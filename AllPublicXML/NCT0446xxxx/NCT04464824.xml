  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The adult emergency service of the Nancy CHRU welcomes an average of 135 visits per day.
      Approximately 18% are patients over 75 years old, among them 45% go home at the end of their
      care. The mobile geriatric liaison team intervenes with these patients at the request of the
      emergency doctors before they return home in order to identify their fragility and implement
      appropriate measures.

      We wish to know the characteristics of these avoidable passages in order to propose
      preventive measures upstream of these passages. To do this, we need to know the
      characteristics of those patients with an avoidable passage.
