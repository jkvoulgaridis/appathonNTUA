    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the bioavailability of teduglutide administered as a
      single subcutaneous (SC) fixed dose (depending upon participant weightband assignment)
      delivered by a syringe injection and the same fixed dose delivered by the pen injector in
      healthy participants.

      The study consists of two cohorts. Cohort 1 consists of participant's with greater than or
      equal to (&gt;=) 40.0 kilogram (kg) to lesser than or equal to (&lt;=) 75.0 kg of weight and Cohort
      2 consists of participant's with greater than (&gt;) 75.0 kg to &lt;= 120.0 kg of weight.
      Participants in each cohort will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment periods (Period I and
      Period II) with sequence AB and BA.
