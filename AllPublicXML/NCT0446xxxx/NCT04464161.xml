  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if taking an oral nutrition supplement (Ensure Nutrition
      Shake) before and after lumbar spine surgery affects blood tests related the nutritional
      status of patients. Patients with poor nutritional statuses who undergo elective lumbar spine
      surgery are at increased risk for complications and longer hospitalizations.

      The study will examine whether a simple and cost-effective perioperative nutritional program
      will affect blood markers of nutritional status (albumin, pre-albumin, transferrin,
      electrolytes). All patients 55 years and older who are undergoing lumbar spine surgery at our
      institution by a single surgeon and meet all inclusion criteria will be added to this study.
      Patients will be randomized into one of two arms; the interventional group will be provide
      with daily Ensure protein drinks for two weeks pre-operatively and four weeks
      post-operatively, while the control group will be instructed to continue their current diet
      plans. Four weeks post-operatively, blood markers (serum albumin, pre-albumin, transferrin,
      electrolyes) will be obtained to assess objective differences in nutritional status.
