  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this observational study researchers want to learn more about the safety of drug Jivi over
      a long period of time. Jivi (generic name: Damoctocog alfa pegol) is an approved blood
      clotting Factor VIII (FVIII) medication for the treatment of hemophilia A (bleeding disorder
      resulting from a lack of FVIII). It is manufactured via recombinant technology and has an
      extended half-live, i.e. it will stay longer in the body than other FVIII products. Therefore
      Jivi acts longer in the body which reduces the frequency of drug injections. This study will
      enroll previously treated patients with hemophilia A who are receiving Jivi regularly at
      their treating doctors to prevent bleeding. Observation for each patient will last for at
      least 4 years, and medical data will be collected during patients' routine visits at their
      treating doctors.
