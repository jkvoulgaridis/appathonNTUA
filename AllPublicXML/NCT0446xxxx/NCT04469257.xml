      Objective: The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of nursing interventions
      and sunlight exposure to reach optimum vitamin D levels by individuals living in nursing
      homes on vitamin D levels.

      Material Method: In the first stage of this two-stage randomized-controlled experimental
      study with pretest-posttest design conducted in June - August 2018 period in the nursing home
      in Central Town of Tokat Province, the questionnaire prepared by the researcher, standardized
      mini mental test, Fitzpatrick skin typing questionnaire and Katz Index of activities of daily
      living were applied. Intervention (n=20) and control (n=20) groups were established with
      individuals using simple random method according to age, gender, skin type and vitamin D
      level. In the second stage, 30-35% of the body surface area of individuals in the
      intervention group was exposed to sunlight five days a week in July. For the participants in
      the control group, sunbathing was not offered. 25(OH)D, calcium, parathormone, phosphorus,
      alkaline phosphatase and albumin levels of all individuals were measured in blood samples
      taken at the beginning and end of the study. Two-way mixed ANOVA, Mann-Whitney U test,
      Wilcoxon signed rank test and Chi-square tests were used to evaluate the data.

    <description>During the activities for the intervention group, the individuals were exposed directly to sun in the nursing home garden on open and sunny days without sunscreen for five days a week for a month with an average of 21.0 ± 5.0 min (min 15 min - max 30 min). About 30-35% of their bodies (hand, face, neck, forearm open up to elbows and legs open up to the knee caps) were open. Sunbathing sessions were held between 10:30 and 11:30 to prevent elderly individuals from being affected by extreme temperatures, and UV index values were monitored during the time and duration of the event at WHO website (http://www.who.int/uv/resources/link/indexlinks/en/, Access date: July 1, 2018). During the hours of the day when UV index was &gt; 6-7, elderly individuals were not taken out. After each sunbathing session, elderly individuals in the intervention group were evaluated for sensitivity and erythema that may occur in the exposed body areas</description>
