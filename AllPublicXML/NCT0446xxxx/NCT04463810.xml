  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to evaluate the cardiovascular changes in long-term virologically
      controlled HIV patients. All the participants have been treated and have been undetected for
      at least five years. Vascular ultrasound and echo will be carried out at 0, 24, 48 and 96
      weeks of follow-up.

      Previous studies have indicated that chronic HIV infection has resulted the diastolic cardiac
      dysfunction. In this study, 500 long-term virologically controlled HIV-infected individuals
      will be followed for two years, and evaluated at 0, 24, 48 and 96 weeks of follow-up. At each
      visiting point, ultrasound evaluation of carotid and vertebral arteries and the heart
      function will be carried out and compared.
