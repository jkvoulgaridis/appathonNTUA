  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study, named THRIVE (The Research In Virtual Environments Study), is to
      test hypotheses for how neighborhood environments influence stress and emotion, as a
      mechanism by which they may influence health. Neighborhood environments may have both acute
      influences on stress-related processes, but also may have lifespan effects due to the
      chronic, cumulative effects of repeated exposures and the long-term toll of adapting to
      adverse neighborhood environments. However, assessing neighborhood influences on stress and
      emotion is methodologically challenging. This study develops such a novel, alternative
      approach to address these questions by deploying a virtual reality (VR) based model of
      neighborhood disadvantage and affluence that creates an immersive experience approximating
      the experience of being in different neighborhoods. In this study, this model will be applied
      to understand neighborhood effects in a diverse sample of adolescents (n = 130) from a range
      of disadvantaged and affluent neighborhoods. The proposed study will employ a randomized
      experiment (n = 65 per condition), with online questionnaires and a single study session, to
      determine (a) if virtual exposure to neighborhood disadvantage elicits differences in emotion
      and stress reactivity; (2) if growing up in a disadvantaged neighborhood results in
      habituation or sensitization to different neighborhood characteristics; and (3) if chronic
      stress results in habituation or sensitization to different neighborhood characteristics.
      This research will develop an innovative methodology that will help establish the role that
      neighborhoods may play in eliciting stress as well as the processes of adaptation to chronic
      stress and chronic neighborhood exposures. In addition, it will help establish a method that
      can be utilized more broadly to study contextual and social environmental influences on
      psychological and biological risk in adolescence.
