    <textblock>
      High incidence rate of knee osteoarthritis and gait analysis are important for early
      assessment of biomechanics. ACL injury is an ideal clinical model for studying knee
      osteoarthritis.

      To clarify the mechanism between the biomechanical status of knee joint and the change of
      gait touch information, and to provide scientific basis for quantifying and evaluating the
      biomechanical status of knee joint in dynamic load-bearing state.

      Purpose: To clarify the relationship between the normal and abnormal biomechanical status of
      the knee joint and the gait touch information, and to establish the biomechanical evaluation
      model of the knee joint during walking or jogging, taking into account the comprehensive
      effects of sports parameters, individual attribute parameters and other factors. An automatic
      analysis and expert diagnosis system was established to evaluate the biomechanics of knee
      joint.

      Methods: 50 young male (23-35 years old) healthy volunteers and 100 patients with unilateral
      simple ACL rupture who need surgical treatment were recruited, 150 subjects in total. Three
      tests were performed before surgery, at the end of the 24th and 48th weeks after surgery. All
      were tested with three-dimensional gait analysis, dynamic plantar pressure measurement and
      isokinetic muscle strength during walking, jogging, emergency stop and take-off, side cut.

      Outcome evaluation indicators and statistical methods: Two-way ANOVA method of repeated
      measurement was used, the left and right sides and different rehabilitation time were used as
      the variables of repeated measurement: the biomechanics of the lower limb joint and the
      change of the biological characteristics of the gait touch information were analyzed. Three
      dimensional gait analysis and computer-aided analysis of gait touch information were used to
      study the changes of ACL rupture and reconstruction. Based on the information of gait touch,
      taking into account the comprehensive effects of sports parameters, individual attribute
      parameters and other factors, a biomechanical evaluation model of knee joint during walking
      or jogging is established, which provides the exact basis for quantifying the information of
      gait touch and evaluating the biomechanical state of knee joint after ACL rupture and
      reconstruction under dynamic load-bearing state, and establishes a clinical practical
      automatic analysis and expert diagnosis system of gait touch information to evaluate the
      biomechanics of the knee joint.
