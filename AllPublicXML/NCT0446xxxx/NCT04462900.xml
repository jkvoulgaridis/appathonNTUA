      This is a multi-center, one arm, prospective observational study which enrolls approximately
      3,000 Chinese patients in China.The study will be performed under real world clinical
      practice setting. Patients will be eligible for the study after taking at least one dose of
      linaclotide. Every patient will be followed maximum of 6 months after enrollment. Study
      measures will be collected at baseline and during the follow-up period. Incidence of adverse
      events will be employed to assess the safety and tolerability of linaclotide in Chinese
      patients. The treatment satisfaction will be employed to assess the impact of treatment. The
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Quality of Life Measure (IBS-QoL) will be employed to assess the
      patient's quality of life.
