    <measure>Subluxation degree by physical examination</measure>
    <time_frame>0-3weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A clinician measured the gap between the acromion and the humeral head with the fingerbreadth at the distal interphalangeal joint of the right index and middle fingers</description>

    <measure>Subluxation degree by radiograph</measure>
    <time_frame>0-3weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The anterio-posterior shoulder X-ray was taken in an erect position, and subluxation was evaluated by Van Langenberghe's five point classification.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of the pain of the shoulder</measure>
    <time_frame>0-3weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain with motion was measured by a verbal descriptive pain scale. The VDPS was developed by Melzack and Katz and is composed of words such as &quot;mild&quot; (level 1) to &quot;very severe pain&quot; (level 5)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of Daily life activities</measure>
    <time_frame>0-3weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Daily life activities were evaluated using the Katz index of independence in activities of daily living, which evaluates the patients in bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, continence, and eating. Activities were scored as zero or one with the total score ranging from zero to six. Higher scores are related with higher independency.</description>
