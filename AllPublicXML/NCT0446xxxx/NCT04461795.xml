      This is a single group, multicenter, open-label study with a study population of patients who
      meet International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition (ICHD-III) criteria for
      migraine with or without aura and have 4 to 22 migraine days per month. This is a
      single-group supportive care study with one arm and no masking. A maximum of 40 participants
      will be enrolled to study intervention. All participants in this single-group study will
      complete a 4-week run-in period. After the run-in period, eligible participants will be
      enrolled to study intervention and enter a 12-week treatment period.

          7. onset of migraine before age 50;

          8. able to differentiate migraine from other primary headache types allowed in the study
             (e.g., tension-type headache);

             discreet headache free periods;

         10. not currently taking a migraine preventive OR has been taking a stable dose of a
             preventive for at least 90 days prior to screening and agrees to not start, stop, or
             change medication and/or dosage during the study period;

             * * participants on migraine preventive should have stable headache pattern

             Definitions of WOCBP, sterile and postmenopausal women, male contraception, and highly
