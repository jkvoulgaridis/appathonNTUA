    <textblock>
      A Randomized, Crossover Trial is conducted to Evaluate Consistency Atrial fibrillation
      diagnosis between the Wearable Dynamic ECG Recorder and the Control device.

      In this investigation, the following indicators is also evaluated:

        1. Sensitivity and specificity of the ECG App algorithm in detecting atrial fibrillation
           compared with physician-adjudicated Gold Standard ECG recorder.

        2. Waveform qualitative assessment

        3. Safety incident assessments. 114 subjects (60 healthy subjects in phase I and 54
           subjects with atrial fibrillation diagnosis in phase II) are enrolled in the
           investigation according to the criteria.

    <description>Electrical signals from ECG electrodes are collected with tested device and gold standard device. An automatic diagnosis of atrial fibrillation made with the tested device, and diagnosis of atrial fibrillation is made by the investigators with gold standard device. Diagnosis results include: &quot;with atrial fibrillation (AF)&quot;, &quot;without atrial fibrillation (No AF)&quot;, or &quot;indecipherable&quot;.
After the diagnosis, the number of &quot;with atrial fibrillation (AF)&quot;, &quot;without atrial fibrillation (No AF)&quot;, or &quot;indecipherable&quot; cases measured by the two devices are calculated according to table 1, and then the results are evaluated for 3×3 matching consistency.</description>
