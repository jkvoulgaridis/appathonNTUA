    <textblock>
      This study is a hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation trial of the Family Check-Up 4
      Health (FCU4Health), an adapted version of the Family Check-Up, in pediatric primary care.
      Patients will be recruited based on their age (2-5 years old) and randomized to receive the
      intervention, FCU4Health, or services as usual. All families will be assessed annually over
      three years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The FCU4Health is an assessment-driven, Motivational Interviewing (MI) based, parent training
      program. Parents complete a comprehensive assessment, including questionnaire of the family
      environment, parenting skills, and child adjustment and health behaviors, and additional
      observation data. The FCU4Health coordinator reviews the assessment results with the parents,
      using MI strategies to engage families in making change to support child behavioral health,
      and to create tailored follow-up services which include parent training modules and referrals
      to additional support services in the community.
