  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies an active virtual reality (VR) experience as a means for non-pharmacologic
      postoperative pain management among patients after head and neck surgery. Investigators will
      assess differences in pain scores, analgesic use, and subjective patient experiences between
      patients participating in a VR activity and patients participating in the same activity using
      a smartphone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Management of postoperative pain after head and neck surgery is complex, and has received
      increased attention to improve patient recovery and quality of life. Narcotic analgesics are
      frequently utilized in postoperative pain management, but these have risks including nausea,
      sedation, constipation, and dependence. Multimodal analgesia can reduce narcotic use and
      improve recovery, but medical comorbidities may contraindicate the use of certain
      medications. Non-pharmacologic measures for postoperative pain control may provide novel and
      cost-effective strategies to confront this complex issue.

      Patients undergoing head and neck surgery will be randomly allocated to participate in an
      immersive experience in VR, or to participate in a similar experience on a two-dimensional
      screen using a smartphone.

    <description>Pain scores will be obtained using an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) prior to each intervention, immediately after the intervention, and then hourly up to 4 hours after the intervention to assess changes in pain scores after each intervention. A score of 0 signifies no pain, and a score of 10 signifies the highest severity of pain.</description>
