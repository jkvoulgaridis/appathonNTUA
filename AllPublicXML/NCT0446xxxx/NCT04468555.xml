  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hallux Abducto Valgus is a frequent pathology with a prevalence of 30% in women and 13% in
      men. The tendency is to increase with age.

      Usually, the elected treatment is surgery, as the conservative orthopedic methods are used at
      the early stages of the pathology. Global Postural Re-Education is a manual therapy treatment
      method through which we can treat lots of pathologies. Some investigations demonstrate
      Postural Re-Education is effective for the treatment of temporomandibular disorders, urinary
      incontinence, and spine disorders, but there is no scientific evidence that defends the
      improvement of the symptoms and correction of the angle of the Hallux Abducto Valgus using
      Postural Re-Education.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Postural control</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 3 weeks and 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Postural control was evaluated by means of a stabilometric platform of resistive pressure sensors (Sensor Medica, Rome, Italy). There will be performed two tests: open eyes Romberg and closed eyes Romberg.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dynamic balance</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 3 weeks and 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Dynamic balance has been measured by a simplified version of the Star Excursion Balance Test where the anterior, posteromedial and posterolateral reach directions were collected for statistical analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ankle range of motion</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 3 weeks and 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Ankle dorsiflexion range of motion was assessed by the weight-bearing lunge test. The patient is positioned in a standing position facing a wall with the involved foot parallel with a tape measure which has been attached to the floor and the opposite leg placed behind in a tandem stance. A forward lunge is performed until the anterior knee tries to make contact with the wall with the heel firmly planted on the ground.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported instability</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 3 weeks and 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the severity of ankle instability the Cumberland ankle instability tool was used. The total score of the nine items ranges from 0 (severe instability) to 30 (normal stability).</description>

    <measure>Assessment of the grade of hallux valgus</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 3 weeks and 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>With the Manchester Scale the examiners grade the feet of the participants in: A: no hallux valgus; B: mild hallux valgus; C: moderate hallux valgus; D: severe hallux valgus.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Foot posture</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 3 weeks and 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>it will be performed the Foot Posture Index 6-items for evaluating the general foot position. It is graded as pronated, neutral or supinated depending on the punctuation</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Passive and active dorsiflexion range of motion of the 1st metatarsophalangeal joint</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 3 weeks and 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>it will be assessed by the Jack test, in which the phalangeal bone is passively dorsiflexed and the plantar arch is observed. The aim is classified the Windlass Mechanism in: intact; limited; absent. The active range of motion will be assessed by kinovea software.</description>

    <measure>Gait parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 3 weeks and 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Gait parameters after treatment with optogait system including gait cycle, contact time, flight time, and pre-swing phase during walking and running.</description>

    <measure>Functional status</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 3 weeks and 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Function in daily living and sport activities were assessed by the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure. This questionnaire Is divided by two subscales of 21 items (daily living subscale) and 8 items (sports subscale). The obtained score is expressed as a percentage calculated by dividing the patient's score by max score and the lower percentage is related to the lower level of function.</description>

    <description>It consisted of Global Postural Re-Education sessions divided into 3 sessions and performed with a frequency of 1 per week for 3 weeks. The sessions were performed individually, with an approximate duration of 40 minutes and all of them were assessed by the same physiotherapist.</description>
