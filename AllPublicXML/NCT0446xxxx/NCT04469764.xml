  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well abemaciclib works in treating patients with ovarian or
      endometrial cancer that has an activation of the CDK4/6 pathway and that has come back
      (recurrent). Abemaciclib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Giving abemaciclib may work better for the treatment of recurrent
      ovarian and endometrial cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To obtain an estimate of the proportion of patients' progression-free at 16 weeks (16 week
      progression free survival [PFS] rate) in patients with recurrent ovarian (including fallopian
      tube and primary peritoneal) or recurrent endometrial cancer following treatment with
      abemaciclib as a molecularly matched targeted therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess objective response rate (ORR) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST), progression free survival (PFS) and safety following treatment with
      abemaciclib as a molecularly matched targeted therapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the relationship between response to abemaciclib and somatic gene alterations
      that lead to CDK4/6 activation in ovarian cancer.

      II. To explore the relationship between response to abemaciclib and hormone receptor
      expression levels as well as somatic gene alterations that lead to CDK4/6 activation in
      endometrial cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive abemaciclib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Patients with tumors
      that are hormone receptor positive also receive anastrozole or letrozole per standard of
      care. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, and then every 12
      weeks up to 1 year.
