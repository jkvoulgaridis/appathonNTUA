  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help people with diabetes who develop neuropathic diabetic
      foot ulcers (DFUs). These ulcers, or sores, if left untreated can increase the chance of
      amputation. Part of the treatment is to have the person wear a diabetic shoe or boot to help
      their foot heal. Sometimes people don't wear the boot like they are told. The investigators
      want to compare three different kinds of diabetic boots to see if they can help make it
      easier for people to wear their boots as instructed.

      The investigators will look at three groups of participants: the first group will wear a boot
      that can't be taken off. The second group will wear a boot that can be taken off, and they
      will get counseling about how important it is to follow instructions as to how often and when
      to wear the boot. The third group will wear a &quot;smart&quot; boot, which will interact with the
      person through a smart watch and smart phone, and give them direct feedback about how they
      are doing with following their boot wearing prescription.

      The investigators will also be looking at how much physical activity, like walking, the
      participants do. And they will compare how well participants sleep and rate their quality of
      life in the three different boots. The investigators think that giving participants
      information about how much they are wearing their boot using readily available technology
      will help them to follow the doctor's directions better, and help their wounds heal faster.
