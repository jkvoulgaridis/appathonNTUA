      According to the results of preclinical pharmacological research and clinical application of
      bevacizumab in ophthalmology Case, 601 will be developed as a drug candidate for the
      treatment of ocular diseases such as wAMD .Observe the safety and tolerability of the single
      and multiple doses of 601 in wAMD patients; study the pharmacokinetic characteristics of
      single and multiple doses of 601, Observe the Preliminary efficacy of 601 multiple injections
      with different doses in the treatment of patients with wAMD.
