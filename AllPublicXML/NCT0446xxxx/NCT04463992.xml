  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Undertreated patient symptoms and resulting acute care use require approaches that improve
      symptom-burden. Previously a lay health worker (LHW)-led symptom screening intervention was
      developed for patients with cancer. In pilot work, the intervention was associated with
      improvements in patient symptom burden and reductions in healthcare use and costs of care at
      the end of life. This intervention will be expanded across several clinics to evaluate the
      impact of the LHW intervention on with cancer and the LHW will be trained to refer patients
      to palliative care. This randomized intervention will evaluate the effect on healthcare use,
      total costs, palliative care and hospice referral.

      All patients with newly diagnosed cancer, over the age of 75 with a medical record number
      ending in an odd number up to 200 patients will be included in the CareMore Pilot 2 Program.
      Any patients who decline to participate will be excluded from the 200 patients in the
      CareMore Pilot 2 Program. The first 200 patients who do not qualify will be the control
      group.
