  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigator propose to determine the efficiency of a new and more
      sophisticated imaging prototype, the Spectral Photon Counting Computed Tomography (SPCCT), at
      characterizing vulnerable plaques and luminal stenosis in Carotid Atherosclerosis patients
      compared to DECT (Dual Energy CT) and MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) which are used in
      current practice

    <description>The acquisition for the assessment of the brain parenchyma and for the evaluation of the cervical and intracranial arteries will be performed without and with iodine based contrast media, respectively. The same parameters will be used for both conditions but for a large volume, from the aortic arch to the top of the head. The iodinate contrast agent's injection (Iomeron 400, Bracco Imaging France) will be performed at 5mL/s into an 18G catheter, followed by a 20 mL saline flush that will be injected at the same rate. The bolus volume will be determined according to the patient's body weight : 70 mL for patients &lt; 80 kg and 1 mL/kg for patients &gt; 80 kg, with a maximum of 90 mL.
The SPCCT scanner is a prototype spectral photon-counting computed tomography system derived from a modified clinical CT system with a field of View (FOV) of 168 mm in-plane, and a z-coverage of 2 mm.</description>
