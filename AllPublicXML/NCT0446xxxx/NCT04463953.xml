  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of BTK inhibitor Zanubrutinib combined with Ixazomib
      and Dexamethasone (ZID) for the newly diagnosed Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia. This ZID
      regimen will be given up to 24 months and stopped for observation. We propose this
      combination will improve the deep remission (≥VGPR) compared to single Zanubrutinib or IRD
      regimen and can be a time-limited regimen which will reduce the life-time therapy and benefit
      the patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia cells always have two or three components tumor cells,
      including lymphocyte, Lymphoplasmacytic cells and plasma cells. We designed a oral regimen to
      target both lymphoma cells (Zanubrutinib) and plasma cells (Ixazomib plus Dexamethasone) to
      eliminate the tumor cells of WM. We propose this combination will improve the deep remission
      of WM (≥VGPR) . Zanubrutinib will be given 160mg Bid per day, up to 24 months, Ixazomib 4mg
      per week and Dexamethasone 20mg per week for three weeks, every 4 weeks one course. ID will
      be given 6 course as introduction and then one course every 12 weeks for up to 24 months. At
      the last ID course, Zanubrutinib will be stopped. The last ID course is to prevent the bounce
      of IgM because of Zanubrutinib discontinue.
