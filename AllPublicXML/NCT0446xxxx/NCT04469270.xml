    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intramuscular (IM)
      administration of Engensis on pain in participants with painful diabetic peripheral
      neuropathy (DPN) in the feet and lower legs, as compared to Placebo, as a second Phase 3,
      well controlled study, sufficient in supporting the efficacy and safety of Engensis.
