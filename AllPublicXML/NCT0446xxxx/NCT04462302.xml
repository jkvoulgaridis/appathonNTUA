  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether an Internet-based pain coping skills program plus enhanced usual care,
      compared to enhanced usual care alone, yields significant improvements in the co-primary
      outcomes of pain severity (as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)) and pain
      interference (also measured by the BPI) from baseline to the post-intervention assessment for
      cancer survivors with persistent pain.

      This is a parallel group randomized controlled, prospective study that examines the effect of
      an Internet-based pain coping skills program on pain severity and pain interference among
      adult cancer survivors experiencing persistent cancer-related pain. The study also explores
      the effects of an Internet-based pain coping skills program on opioid/analgesic medication
      use, health-related quality of life, pain management self-efficacy and various other factors
      relevant among populations with persistent pain (i.e., fatigue, sleep, emotional distress,
      positive affect, pain impact, perceived cognitive problems, and cognitive performance), as
      well as qualitative assessments of participants experiences with pain and the intervention. A
      total of 456 participants will be enrolled (228 per arm) and randomized into the internet
      program arm (plus enhanced usual care) or Enhanced Usual Care alone.

      Each participant will be enrolled in the study for 9 months (from randomization at week 0 to
      the final follow-up assessment at week 34).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have a history of a cancer diagnosis and treatment. Must have a documented
             diagnosis of invasive cancer requiring therapy with any combination of surgery,
             radiation, and chemotherapy/drug therapy including single modality therapy only.
             Patients with a cancer history of only superficial skin cancers or in situ malignancy
             are not eligible.

          -  Must have been ≥3 months, but not more than 24 months since the completion of
             definitive cancer therapy (i.e., time since the last day of chemotherapy
             administration) with either no evidence of residual disease or with stable disease, as
             established by imaging, clinical exam, or laboratory testing at the time of screening.

          -  Must have completed all planned anticancer therapy with the exception of maintenance
             therapy when appropriate. Maintenance therapy includes planned chronic immunotherapy,
             hormonal therapy, targeted therapy or chemotherapy given to prevent recurrence of
             disease rather than to treat active disease (e.g. long-term PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors
             in NSCLC patients following initial chemotherapy). Time frame applies to the most
             recent completion of treatment if participant has experienced cancer recurrence(s).

          -  Must have pain indicated by a score of ≥ 4 on PROMIS Pain Intensity (1a) scale, using
             the Pain Eligibility Interview.

          -  Must have a score of &quot;Most Days&quot; or higher on the Graded Chronic Pain Scale Revised
             (Abbreviated) using the Pain Eligibility Interview.

          -  Must be on a stable analgesic regimen (i.e., no changes to the prescribed analgesic
             regimen) over a period of at least 14 days prior to enrollment. Eligible patients
             should not have planned upward dose titration of their analgesics during the study
             period up to the 10 Week Follow-up Visit. Patients may elect to decrease their
             analgesic use during the study as per discussions with their provider. Unexpected dose
             adjustments including dose escalations as a result of unforeseen clinical need is
             allowed in all patients at all times during the study.

          -  Must have pain of new onset or significantly exacerbated since the time of cancer
             diagnosis or initiation of cancer treatment

          -  Must be expected to be able to complete all study activities including the 22- and
             34-week follow-up assessments according to the treating/referring clinician (e.g.,
             treating clinician feels the patient is unlikely to develop progressive disease
             requiring additional active cancer therapy through the 6-month follow-up period).

          -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2.

          -  Age ≥18 years at the time of study entry

          -  Must be able to speak, read and understand English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a disability that precludes completion of study activities (e.g., severe vision or
             hearing impairment, diagnosis of dementia or clinical evidence of severe cognitive
             impairment, diagnosis or clinical evidence of severe psychiatric disorder, or
             diagnosed drug or alcohol abuse disorder), as per patient report or documented in the
             medical record.

          -  Reports only preexisting pain conditions unrelated to cancer or cancer treatment
             (e.g., migraine or tension headache, arthritis, back disorders, bursitis/tendonitis,
             injuries, fibromyalgia).

          -  Has a known or suspected diagnosable substance use disorder or opioid overuse disorder
             (according to DSM-5 criteria), or is actively receiving treatment for a substance use
             disorder, as per patient report or documented in the medical record.

          -  Currently being prescribed buprenorphine or suboxone.

          -  Suspected or proven progressive cancer by clinical history, exam or imaging
             evaluation. [Must have stable disease or considered to have no evidence of disease
             (NED)].

          -  Patients enrolled on hospice care or end-of-life palliative care are not eligible for
             enrollment. Patients whose local care network provides an opportunity for palliative
             (symptom management) or supportive care concurrent with active treatment following
             diagnosis (i.e. not solely as a palliative or end-of-life measure) are considered
             eligible for this study.

          -  Does not have reliable access to Internet or sufficient personal data plan, and is not
             willing to participate in the Tablet Lending Program provided for this study.

          -  Does not have a working email address.

    <ipd_description>Wake Forest NCORP Research Base is committed to following the NIH Statement on Sharing Research Data (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-03-032.html). As of July 2018, the WF NCORP RB signed an agreement with NCI to contribute de-identified data and data dictionaries from clinical trials conducted through our RB to the NCI NCTN/NCORP data archive within 6 months of primary and non-primary publications of phase II/III and phase III trials to https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/. This will become the primary means for sharing raw data, and we will adhere to the guidelines spelled out in the NCTN/NCORP Data Archive Usage Guide. De-identified data from studies not covered by the agreement (e.g., phase II and observational studies) will be made available upon request. All data files will be de-identified. De-identification procedures will meet the HIPAA criteria as detailed in the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 45, Section 164.514.</ipd_description>
