  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By leveraging a community-based, cancer-specific electronic healthcare record for this study,
      we aim to understand treatment patterns and clinical outcomes among patients with HR+/HER2-
      mBC who received care within the context of a large community oncology network in the United
      States.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a documented diagnosis of hormone receptor-positive (estrogen
             receptor-positive or progesterone receptor-positive), human epidermal growth factor
             receptor 2-negative mBC.

          2. Aged 18 years at initial recorded diagnosis of mBC.

          3. Initiated one of the following qualifying regimens within the USON during the study
             identification period:

               1. Palbociclib combination therapy with an aromatase inhibitor (letrozole,
                  exemestane, or anastrozole) among patients as first-line therapy in the advanced
                  or metastatic setting;

               2. Palbociclib combination therapy with fulvestrant following as first-line or
                  beyond therapy in the advanced or metastatic setting;

               3. Aromatase inhibitor (letrozole, exemestane or anastrozole) monotherapy as
                  first-line treatment in the advanced or metastatic setting;

               4. Fulvestrant monotherapy as first-line or beyond therapy in the advanced or
                  metastatic setting.

          4. Received care at a USON site(s) utilizing the full EHR capacities of iKM at the time
             of treatment.

          5. EHR data available from the USON site(s) where the patient received treatment are
             accessible for research purposes.

          6. During the study observation period, patients observed with at least 2 visits after
             the index date.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Enrollment in an interventional clinical trial during the study observation period
             since clinical trial participants may have clinical scenarios that deviate from the
             population of interest.

          2. Among the Pb-AI and AI mono cohorts, evidence of prior treatment with other CDK 4/6
             inhibitors (ribociclib or abemaciclib), aromatase inhibitors (letrozole, exemestane,
             or anastrozole), tamoxifen, raloxifene, toremifene, or fulvestrant in the advanced or
             metastatic setting.

          3. Among the Pb-FUL and FUL mono cohorts, evidence of prior treatment with CDK 4/6
             inhibitors (ribociclib or abemaciclib) in the advanced or metastatic setting.

          4. Receipt of treatment indicated for another primary cancer during the study observation
             period or history of another primary cancer within the USON iKM EHR database.
