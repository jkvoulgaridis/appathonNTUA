  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Valgus high tibial osteotomy (HTO) and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) are
      established treatment options for patients with medial compartmental osteoarthritis (OA) of
      the knee.However, the clinical outcomes of these treatment modalities for unicompartmental OA
      have become subjects of debate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although HTO for the correction of malalignment in the medial osteoarthritic knee has been
      shown to provide successful outcomes in some studies, it is technically difficult to achieve
      the ideal valgus position postoperatively, and the likelihood of postoperative complications
      after HTO is greater than that after UKA . As compared with HTO, UKA has been reported to
      provide better long-term results, to have a shorter time to full weight bearing, to allow
      easier rehabilitation, and to have fewer perioperative complications. Furthermore,
      indications for UKA are broadening, including younger and more active patients, since
      encouraging midterm and long-term results were published.

    <description>this will be measured by using the Oxford Knee Score, a patient reported outcome questionnairewhich is A patient reported outcome measure highest score that could a patient get is 48 and means that good outcome and the lowest score to be obtained is 0 whick means poor outcome ( the higher the score,the better the outcome)</description>
