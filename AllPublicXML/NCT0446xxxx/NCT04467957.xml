  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) results in the thickening of mucus in the lungs and other organs due to
      dysfunction of a transmembrane conductance protein. This allows buildup of bacteria that
      results in inflammation, leading to tissue breakdown and loss of function. In the lungs, this
      process causes loss of air exchange structures progressing to diminished lung function. The
      exchange of oxygen in the lungs depends on both the integrity of air conduits and
      vasculature. Most clinical assessments, however, focus on ventilatory function, with the
      assumption that any vascular compromise is secondary. Nevertheless, there is evidence, some
      from the investigator's lab, to suggest that perfusion anomalies in the lung occur before
      signs of ventilatory dysfunction. Thus, the inflammatory processes of CF may impact pulmonary
      microvasculature specifically and concurrently or prior to damage to ventilatory structures.
      This study aims to apply a new MRI method to serially measure regional lung perfusion,
      without the use of contrast agent, in children with CF and to associate it with regional
      assessments of ventilation and to serum cytokines or proteomic markers of angiogenesis and
      inflammatory processes.

      The investigator's lab has recently developed a noninvasive, non-contrast, method of labeling
      blood flowing into the lungs and generating a map of perfusion. The investigator aims to
      couple this technique to existing methods using hyperpolarized Xenon to map ventilation. The
      investigator will apply these methods over time in CF patients, monitoring the relationship
      between regional perfusion and ventilation defects.

      This pilot work will provide the foundation for larger studies to establish the essential
      etiological role of perfusion deficits in CF.

      The Lung Perfusion in CF trial is a case-control observational study conducted at Cincinnati
      Children's Hospital.

      Patients will be assessed before and approximately 6 months after the clinical initiation of
      triple-combination modulator therapy with the following imaging to demonstrate aim 1, that
      pulmonary perfusion is regionally altered in CF patients in association with the status and
      progression of lung ventilatory function: Ultra-short echo time (UTE) protocol to obtain
      structural lung imaging primarily for anatomic reference, Hyperpolarized Xenon gas inhalation
      protocol to measure regional lung ventilation and arterial spin labeling protocol to measure
      regional lung perfusion.

      To demonstrate aim 2, that different profiles of serum proteomic markers related to
      angiogenesis and vascular remodeling, characterize states of pulmonary hyperfusion and
      hypoperfusion, blood sample data analysis from a separate study conducted at Cincinnati
      Children's Hospital Medical Center will also be obtained before and 6 months after initiation
      of triple-combination modulator therapy.

      Safety will be assessed by recording adverse events. Vital signs (heart rate, SPO2) will be
      recorded before, immediately following inhalation, and 2 minutes after each Xenon gas
      inhalation; O2 saturation will be monitored continuously throughout the Xenon portion of the
      MRI, and the time and duration of nadir will be recorded.

      The overarching goal of this study is to demonstrate that arterial spin labeling MRI lung
      perfusion can be used to measure regional manifestations of pulmonary vascular disease in CF
      that precedes and contributes to global and local decline in ventilatory lung function.

    <description>Lung defect calculations (total and lobar defect percentages) will be performed by evaluating the percentage of voxels with signals below a threshold value of 60% of the total lung mean signal. This threshold (60%) represents our estimate of the visually accurate defect selection threshold for CF patients. To assign the pixels in the hyperpolarized Xenon gas (129Xe) MRI slices to a lobe, corresponding CT and/or UTE MRI images will be segmented and analyzed with custom MATLAB software.
VDP for CF and Control groups will be compared by 2-sample T-test at baseline. VDP at baseline and 6 months for the CF group will be compared by paired T-test to determine if the change is significantly different from zero change.</description>
