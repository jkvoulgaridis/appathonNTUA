  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical investigation is a prospective, multicentre, non-comparative case series to
      assess safety and efficacy of CorVision® bioengineered corneal inlay for improving
      uncorrected near vision in presbyopic subjects.

      In this study a sterile medical grade collagen-based bioengineered corneal inlay
      (CorVision®), which closely mimics the human corneal tissue, will be tested as a natural
      microlens for correction of near vision in presbyopic patients. The primary endpoint for this
      study is to further determine the safety of the inlay and the secondary endpoint is to
      determine the efficacy of the inlay to improve uncorrected near vision.

      CorVision® implantation will be done via a minimally invasive laser-assisted intra-stromal
      surgery. Besides important information concerning details of the surgical method and
      postoperative care, tolerance of the device and possible adverse events will be reported
      along with several clinical parameters to be measured preoperatively and postoperatively. The
      study will consist of 110 subjects receiving the inlay to be included within a recruitment
      period of 18 months at multiple clinical sites. All subjects will be followed for minimum
      12-months postoperatively. Postoperative evaluations are scheduled at 1 week, 1, 3, 6, and 12
      months.

      Upon signing of informed consent and study inclusion, both eyes will be screened to determine
      which eye is dominant and to ensure that the non-dominant eye meets the visual acuity,
      refraction, and other inclusion criteria. In this investigation, the monovision concept will
      be utilized, e.g. CorVision® will be implanted in the non-dominant eye to improve near vision
      and the dominant eye is left intact or corrected by a standard refractive surgery to
      emmetropia. In brief, subjects will undergo laser corneal surgery on their non-dominant eye
      to create an anterior stromal pocket into which the investigational device will be implanted.
      Combined antibiotic - steroid eye drops will be instilled for 4 weeks post-implantation.

      The investigational treatment does not introduce foreign cells into the patient, requires
      only a short course of local immunosuppression (4 weeks compared to 12 months or longer for
      some other treatment options), and is reversible as the investigational device can be removed
      later if required. Moreover, should serious intra-operative or post-operative complications
      arise during or following implantation of the investigational device that cannot be treated
      with medications (for example thinning or clouding of the cornea), the CorVision® device can
      be removed and the patient can undergo standard-of-care for complications after laser
      surgery.

      Following implantation of the CorVision®, postoperative eye examinations will be conducted at
      1 week, 1 month, then at month 3, 6, and 12 and outside of these standard examination times
      on an as-needed basis at any time. Examinations will include corneal tomography, central
      corneal thickness, slit lamp corneal transparency, keratometry, anterior segment optical
      coherence tomography, and general ophthalmic examination including tear break up time,
      refraction, uncorrected and corrected distance, intermediate and near visual acuity, and in
      some eyes aberrometer measurements, defocus curve or contrast sensitivity.

      The proof-of-concept and feasibility to implant CorVision® by standard surgical methods such
      as a femto-second assisted pocket surgery and postoperative treatment and assessment protocol
      for this new medical device have already been developed via prior pre-clinical evaluations
      and some pilot clinical studies.

The implant rejection is defined as a clinical situation when the implanted eye has decreased central corneal clarity and decreased implant clarity, corneal vascularization inside of laser created pocket and inflammation.</description>

    <description>Presbyopia is an age-related progressive loss of crystalline lens accommodation power resulting in the decreased ability to see near objects. CorVision® is a tissue-mimetic device primarily intended to be used as a corneal inlay in the management of presbyopia and low hypermetropia. The inlay is inserted into the patient's cornea via a minimally invasive laser pocket procedure to modify corneal surface topography and corneal optical performance.</description>
