  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multifocal IOLs that maintain distance focus and improve near vision have been developed to
      reduce spectacle dependence.Multifocal IOLs improve patient performance of near-vision tasks,
      such as reading crafts, hobbies, and social activities to a greater extent than do monofocal
      IOLs. However, halos and reduced contrast sensitivity have been associated with multifocal
      IOLs and are common reasons for patient's dissatisfaction.Trifocal technology has been
      developed to create intermediate focus to overcome these difficulties. Continuous reports of
      the visual outcomes of the FineVision trifocal IOLs are encouraging.

      Monofocal IOLs, which provide effective distance vision, currently account for the majority
      of IOLs implantations. Patients who have undergone cataract surgery with implantation of
      monofocal IOL may require spectacles to perform near-distance (e.g., reading) or
      intermediate-distance (e.g., using a computer) tasks depending on their visual
      demandsMultifocal IOLs that maintain distance focus and improve near vision have been
      developed to reduce spectacle dependence.Multifocal IOLs improve patient performance of
      near-vision tasks, such as reading crafts, hobbies, and social activities to a greater extent
      than do monofocal IOLs. However, halos and reduced contrast sensitivity have been associated
      with multifocal IOLs and are common reasons for patient's dissatisfaction.Trifocal technology
      has been developed to create intermediate focus to overcome these difficulties. Continuous
      reports of the visual outcomes of the FineVision trifocal IOLs are encouraging.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patient eyes had cataract with no other pathology, patients desire for spectacle
             independence after surgery and with realistic expectation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any ocular comorbidity that affect the end results of the surgery, history of ocular
             trauma, irregular corneal astigmatism, pupil abnormalities and capsular or zonular
             abnormalities that may affect postoperative centration as tilt of the lens (e.g.
             pseudo exfoliation syndrome and Marfan's syndrome).
