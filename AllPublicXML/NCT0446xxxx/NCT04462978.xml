  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-IgE mediated gastrointestinal food allergy (non-IgE-GIFA) is an evolving web of clinical
      conditions characterized by subacute and/or chronic symptoms and include food protein-induced
      enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES), food protein-induced enteropathy (FPE), food protein-induced
      allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP), and food protein-induced allergic dysmotility disorders
      (gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), colic and constipation) (FPIMD).

      Despite the epidemiological relevance, pathogenesis, best diagnostic and therapeutic
      approach, and natural history of these disorders are poorly characterized. These limitations
      are responsible for delay and mistake in the clinical management. We aims to evaluate
      clinical history and pathophysiological mechanisms of non-IgE-GIFA in pediatric age.
