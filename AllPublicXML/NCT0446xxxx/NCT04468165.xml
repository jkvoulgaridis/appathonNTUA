  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and health
      related quality of life of Generic DMF (Sclera® or Marovarex ®, Hikma) in patients undergoing
      routine clinical care for RRMS in MENA Region
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, multi-center, prospective, cohort study, where no visits or
      intervention(s) additional to the daily practice will be performed. In the study sites,
      patients undergoing routine clinical care for RRMS and initiated treatment with Generic DMF
      (Sclera® or Marovarex ®, Hikma) in accordance with the approved SPC will be followed up and
      assessed for a total of 12 months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary endpoint of the study is ARR (Annualized Relapse Rate) at 12 month.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Relapses will be identified and recorded by Site investigators. A relapse is defined as any new or historical neurological symptom, not associated with fever or infection, lasting for at least 24 h and accompanied by new neurological signs. New or recurrent neurologic symptoms that occurred &lt;30 days after the onset of a relapse as defined earlier were considered part of the same relapse.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of patients with AEs and SAEs (including laboratory abnormalities) leading to treatment discontinuation will be assessed</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of patients with disability progression as measured by the EDSS over time</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months from Initiation of Hikma DMF</time_frame>
    <description>Disability worsening is defined as 1.5-point increase (if baseline EDSS score was 0), 1.0-point increase (if baseline EDSS score was &lt; 5.5) or 0.5- point increase (if baseline EDSS score was ≥ 5.5) confirmed at least 6 months apart</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 Items (MSIS-29) scores over time</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months from Initiation of Hikma DMF</time_frame>
    <description>The 29-item Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29) is a patient-reported outcome measure to assess the impact of MS on day-to-day life during the past 2 weeks from a patient's perspective; it measures 20 physical items and 9 psychological items.</description>
