  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are investigating the use of a virtual reality programme to reduce pain and anxiety
      experienced during manual vacuum aspiration.

      Virtual reality (VR) is the computer-generated simulation of a three-dimensional environment
      that can be interacted with in a seemingly real way by a person using special electronic
      equipment. In this study a VR headset is worn by the patient allowing them to experience a
      relaxing environment whilst the procedure manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) is performed.

      VR is mostly used in computer gaming but has uses in medical field and has been used in the
      treatment of long standing pain, treatment of burns, dentistry and treatment of cancer pain.
      However, its role in the management of pain and anxiety during gynaecological procedures like
      manual vacuum aspiration has not been researched. This study explores whether it has a place
      in the treatment of gynaecological pain and reduction of anxiety.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients: Clinical indications for undergoing an MVA will be confirmed. Inclusion criteria
        will include all women of 18 - 50 years of age, planned for a MVA who are able and willing
        to give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hearing impairments and blindness

          -  History of epilepsy or any previous seizures

          -  Any known anatomical characteristics that may make performing the office procedure
             more difficult (e.g., cervical conisation)

          -  Any known characteristics that make the patient unsuitable for undergoing MVA (e.g.
             known bleeding disorder, gestation &gt;12 weeks)

          -  The denial or withdrawal of informed consent
