    <textblock>
      The COPACABANA study is designed as a single-centre, open, prospective trial aimed to assess
      the influence of coronary chronic total occlusion (CTO) on downstream myocardial ischemia via
      the novel computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging technique. To this end, consecutive
      patients with CTO of a major coronary artery scheduled to undergo percutaneous recanalization
      of occluded coronary artery based on clinical grounds, will undergo stress CTP using
      state-of-the-art dual-energy CT scanner at 2 time points (before and 3 months after
      successful restoration of flow in the CTO vessel).

    <description>The new-generation dual-source computed tomography scanner Somatom® Force will be used for all CTP studies. Myocardial perfusion will be evaluated in a stress dynamic CT protocol. The scan range will be determined based on a low-dose non-contrast scan. Subsequently, regadenoson will be administered intravenously at a single dose of 0.4 mg, and followed after 50 seconds delay by 35 mL of the iodinated contrast agent (iohexol, concentration 350 mg I/mL) injected at the flow rate of 5 mL/s. Finally, low-dose non-contrast dual-energy CT scan will be performed 5-6 min after the dynamic scan to assess late enhancement of the myocardium.</description>
