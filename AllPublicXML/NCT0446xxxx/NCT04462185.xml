  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The broad goals of this study is to identify changes in genomic landscape during transition
      from stage 0 to stage 1 lung cancer.

      This study intends to determine whether diagnostic biomarkers measured in minimally invasive
      biospecimens are able to correlate molecular, clinical and imaging features to distinguish
      malignant from benign pulmonary nodules. The diagnostic markers once validated can be used as
      broad screening tools for lung cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The four-year study aims to recruit 3000 patients (1500 GGO and 1500 solid / semi solid
      nodules) in the study based on qualifying for a lung cancer screening CT or by routine CT
      chest with the observation of a lung nodule between 5-30mm diameter. These patients will be
      followed for 2~3 years and be managed according to institutional standard of care. This may
      involve the Chinese Thoracic Society guideline or Fleischner criteria (either 2013 or 2017
      guidelines). The clinical data, CT imaging and biospecimens will be collected during each
      visit. Once a patient undergoes surgery, tissue samples (FFPE) from surgery will also be
      collected.

      The gold standard for lung cancer diagnosis will be the results of bronchoscopic biopsy of
      lung or lymph nodes, percutaneous biopsy of lung or other organ sites, surgical biopsy or
      resection, or a minimum follow-up of 2 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 Years and older, both male and female

          -  Willing and able to provide a written informed consent

          -  Radiologic diagnosis of solid indeterminate pulmonary nodule (5-30 mm) OR semi-solid
             (mixed density) nodule with solid component of at least 5mm OR non-solid nodule
             (including pGGO); must be of appropriate size at enrollment, but nodule(s) may have
             been first identified within 12 months prior. Furthermore, nodule(s) &lt; 5 mm in size
             may have been first identified greater than 12 months prior to enrollment though it
             must grow into the appropriate size range (5-30 mm) within 12 months prior to
             enrollment. If multiple nodules were diagnosed, choose the most representative one
             with the longest diameter as the target lesion; if two or more nodules are of the same
             largest size, choose the one with the perpendicular longest diameter

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or previous diagnosis of primary lung cancer, metastatic lung cancer, or any
             other non-lung cancer within 5 years (exceptions are adequately treated squamous and
             basal cell carcinomas of the skin, carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast)
