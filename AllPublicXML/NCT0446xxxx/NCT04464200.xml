  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of 19(T2)28z1xx CAR T cells in people with
      relapsed/refractory B-cell cancers. The researchers will try to find the highest dose of
      19(T2)28z1xx CAR T cells that causes few or mild side effects in participants. Once they find
      this dose, they can test it in future participants to see if it is effective in treating
      their relapsed/refractory B-cell cell cancers. This study will also look at whether
      19(T2)28z1xx CAR T cells work against participants' cancer.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a standard phase I open-label dose-escalation trial. Cohorts of 3-6 patients will be infused with escalating doses of 19(T2)28z1XX CAR T cells to establish the MTD. There are 5 planned dose levels with one additional de-escalation dose level. A 3+3 design will be used to establish the RP2D. Once the RP2D is determined, the study will open to Dose Expansion phase with two cohorts. Cohort 1 will comprise of up to 12 patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (same eligibility criteria as the dose-escalation phase). Cohort 2 will include up to 12 patients with other CD19+ B cell hematologic malignancies including CLL, indolent B-cell lymphoma, primary CNS lymphoma, and Richter's transformation.</intervention_model_description>
