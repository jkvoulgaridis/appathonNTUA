  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 41 million children, or 55 percent of all children in the United States, live more
      than 30 minutes away from a pediatric trauma center. The management of pediatric trauma
      requires medical expertise that is only available at Level I pediatric trauma centers, which
      are specialized pediatric referral hospitals located in large urban cities. Smaller hospitals
      lack pediatric trauma expertise and resources to properly care for these children. When a
      small hospital receives a child with trauma, the standard of care is to conduct a telephone
      consultation to a pediatric trauma specialist, err on the side of safety, and transfer the
      child to the regional Level I pediatric trauma center.

      A newer model of care, the Virtual Pediatric Trauma Center (VPTC), uses live video, or
      telemedicine, to bring the expertise of a Level I pediatric trauma center virtually to
      patients at any hospital emergency department. While the VPTC model is being used more
      frequently, the advantages and disadvantages of these two systems of care remain unknown,
      particularly with regard to parent/family-centered outcomes.

      The goal of this study is to optimize the patient and family experience and to minimize
      distress, healthcare utilization, and out-of-pocket costs following the injury of a child.
      The results of this project will help to optimize communication, confidence, and shared
      decision making between parents/families and clinical staff from both the transferring and
      receiving hospitals.

    <description>19 questions from the Communication with Parent Subscale of the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Child Hospital Survey; specifically, we will report the following measures: Communication between you and your child's nurses (composite measure); Communication between you and your child's doctors (composite measure); Communication about your child's medicines (composite measure); Keeping you informed about your child's care (composite measure) Privacy when talking with doctors, nurses, and other providers (single-item measure); Preparing you and your child to leave the hospital (composite measure); Keeping you informed about your child's care in the Emergency Room (single-item measure). Higher scores are better; 0 (minimum) - 100 (maximum)</description>

    <measure>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days after emergency department visit</time_frame>
    <description>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory measures state anxiety levels and is an easy-to-implement inventory that the individual can answer on his/her own. Responses for the State Anxiety scale assess intensity of current feelings &quot;at this moment&quot;: 1) not at all, 2) somewhat, 3) moderately so, and 4) very much so. Range of scores for each subtest is 20-80, the higher score indicating greater anxiety. A cut point of 39-40 has been suggested to detect clinically significant symptoms.</description>
