  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal anesthesia is widely used in cesarean section, but it is associated with high
      incidence of side effects. To reduce the occurrence of side effects, intrathecal adjuvant was
      recommended to use in spinal anesthesia, with the aim in reducing the dose of intrathecal
      local anesthetic, which can subsequently decrease the incidence of spinal-induced side
      effects and prolong postoperative analgesia.

      Spinal anesthesia is widely used in cesarean section, but it is associated with high
      incidence of side effects. To reduce the occurrence of side effects, intrathecal adjuvant was
      recommended to use in spinal anesthesia, with the aim in reducing the dose of intrathecal
      local anesthetic, which can subsequently decrease the incidence of spinal-induced side
      effects and prolong postoperative analgesia.Many augmentation strategies for intrathecal
      analgesia have been proposed. A meta-analysis by Popping et al. concluded that the
      concomitant use of an opioid such as fentanyl intrathecally allows the reduction in the dose
      of local anesthetic, while augmenting its analgesic potency thereby decreasing its adverse
      effects.

      Dexamethasone relieves pain through reducing inflammation and blocking of nociceptive C‑
      fibers transmission and by suppressing neural ectopic discharge. Post‑operative analgesic
      effectiveness and duration was prolonged when dexamethasone was used as an adjunct for
      peripheral nerve blocks. Recent studies reported no complications associated with intrathecal
      dexamethasone.

      Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a potent, selective α2 adrenergic agonist and when given
      intrathecally, it exerts its analgesic effect via stimulating spinal α2 receptors. Wu et al.,
      in their meta-analysis showed that addition of intrathecal DEX significantly increased the
      duration of postoperative analgesia and reduced analgesic consumption. The increase in
      duration of postoperative analgesia is dose dependent but with increase in the incidence of
      bradycardia.
