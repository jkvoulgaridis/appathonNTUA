  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study's aim is to determine whether brief interventions (micro-interventions) aiming to
      optimize expectations or enhancing feelings of self-compassion are able to improve
      well-being/reduce perceived stress in comparison to an active control group in an
      online-study

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study we use a pre-post-test design to compare the effects of the (classic) best
      possible self intervention vs. the best possible self intervention (including ways on how to
      reach the imagined best possible future) vs. a self-compassion intervention vs. an active
      control group. We are interested in the differential effects and examine several moderators.

    <time_frame>Change from pre (baseline) to post scores (approx. 30 minutes later)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are asked to rate how stressed they feel at the moment at two time points (baseline and the intervention) on a questionnaire (VAS: item ranges from 0 (not stressed at all) - 100 (very stressed). Change scores are calculated (post- minus pre-scores; pre-scores will be used as a covariate).
