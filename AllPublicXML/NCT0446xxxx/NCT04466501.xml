  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ACR LAB is a prescription-only, nurse- or clinician-conducted in vitro diagnostic (IVD)
      device. The test is for the qualitative and semi- quantitative detection of Albumin,
      Creatinine, and the Albumin-to- Creatinine Ratio. The device is composed of a kit and a
      smartphone application using an image recognition algorithm.

      The degree of agreement of the ACR | LAB as compared to the comparator device will be tested.
      Urine samples will be tested by a separate professional user on each device.
