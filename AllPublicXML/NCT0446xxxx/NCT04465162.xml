  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies the side effects of radiation therapy used alone, and if it can achieve a
      high cure rate in the treatment of patients with MALT lymphoma. Radiation therapy uses high
      energy sources to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. This treatment may improve the
      patient's lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the efficacy and toxicity of radiation therapy alone in treating stage 1 and
      2 MALT lymphoma for newly diagnosed patients and for the patients who failed other treatment
      modalities.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo radiation therapy once daily (QD) 5 times weekly over 3.5-5 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6-8 weeks, and then every
      3-4 months for year 1, every 4-6 months for year 2, every 6 months for years 3 and 4, and
      once yearly thereafter.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with newly diagnosed stage 1 and 2 MALT lymphoma are eligible for this study

          -  Patients with Helicobacter (H.) pylori positive gastric MALT lymphoma are recommended
             to have treatments with antibiotics prior to enrollment to this protocol

          -  Patients who failed other treatment modalities (e.g. chemotherapy, antibiotics therapy
             etc) are also eligible as far as they never had stage 3 or 4 disease during the course
             of the disease or disease progression to the opposite side of the diaphragm (as the
             time course of the response to antibiotic therapy can be very variable among patients,
             sometimes requiring more than one year for complete response, failure to antibiotic
             therapy can be very variable among patients, sometimes requiring more than one year
             for complete response, failure to antibiotic treatment will be defined as no response
             or progression of the disease documented by endoscopy and biopsy)

          -  Patients who have had stage 4 diseases due to bilateral parotid gland or ocular/ocular
             adnexal involvement or due to multiple sites within Waldeyer's ring will still be
             eligible

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who had previous radiation dose to the site of the current primary disease
             which would lead to violation of known radiation tolerance limit of that particular
             site if treated again

          -  Patients with MALT lymphoma of the skin whose lesions are separated by more than 5 cm
             will be ineligible

          -  Previous or concurrent malignancy in any form would not be an exclusion criterion.
             However, patients who receive chemotherapy for concurrent malignancy will be excluded
             from statistical analysis

          -  Low blood cell counts would not be exclusion criteria as far as the patient is willing
             to accept supportive measures such as transfusions, filgrastim and epoetin
