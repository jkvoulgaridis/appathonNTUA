  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, phase III clinical study to compare
      the efficacy and safety of HLX10 + HLX04 vs Sorafenibas as the First-line Treatment in
      Patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic HCC

      Eligible subjects in this study will be randomized to Arm A or Arm B at 2:1 ratio as follows:

      Arm A (treatment group): HLX10 + HLX04 Arm B (control group): sorafenib Randomization is
      stratified by: region (Asia (excluding Japan) vs. others), HBV infection vs. HCV infection
      vs. no HBV or HCV infection, portal vein invasion or/and extrahepatic spread (with
      vs.without), and ECOG (0 vs. 1).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Volunteer to participate in the clinical study;

          2. Aged ≥ 18 years and ≤ 75 years;

          3. Patients with histopathologically or cytologically diagnosed locally advanced or
             metastatic and/or unresectable HCC , or patients with clinically diagnosed HCC
             according to the diagnostic criteria of the American Association for the Study of
             Liver Diseases (AASLD);

          4. Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) Stage C; or BCLC Stage B patients who are not
             candidates for radical surgery and/or locoregional therapy.

          5. Received no prior systemic HCC treatment (including chemotherapy, treatment with
             sorafenib, regorafenib, lenvatinib, or other small-molecule antiangiogenic agents);

          6. At least one measurable lesion by the IRRC (central radiography) as per RECIST v1.1

          7. Normal major organ functions as defined

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with known hepatobiliary cell carcinoma, mixed cell carcinoma, or
             fibrolamellar cell carcinoma;

          2. History of hepatic encephalopathy;

          3. Patients with portal hypertension complicated with upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage,
             or esophageal/gastric fundal varices with the red color sign, or high hemorrhage risk
             investigated by the investigator within 6 months before the randomization. Subjects
             must receive endoscopic examinations to rule out high hemorrhage risk (e.g. red color
             sign and severe varices) before enrollment.

          4. Patients with portal vein invasion at the main portal branch (Vp4), inferior vena cava
             involvement, or right cardiac involvement of HCC based on imaging examination.
             Patients with portal vein invasion at the main portal branch but with unobstructed
             blood flow in the bilateral or unilateral branch can be enrolled;

          5. Central nervous system (CNS) or leptomeningeal metastases;

          6. Positive for both HBV-DNA and HCV-RNA;
