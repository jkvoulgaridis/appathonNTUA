      the current study tends to compare the effect of two different treatment techniques used in
      the rehabilitation of shoulder impingement syndrome. rigid tapping and scapular stabilizing
      exercises will be applied and the level of function and pain intensity will be measured
      before and after the intervention and at 3 months follow up. while both methods of treatment
      used previously, the comparison between their effects is not yet investigated and no data is
      available regarding the superiority of one over the other.

      Patients will be recruited through a verbal and written announcement from the customers of a
      local out-patient clinic. 45 Patients diagnosed with SIS met the inclusion criteria and were
      asked to sign a consent form.

      patients will be assigned randomly into three equal groups using permuted blocks. The first
      group (RTG) received rigid taping plus a standard physical therapy protocol. The second group
      (SSEG) received scapular stabilizing exercises plus the same standard protocol, and the third
      group (control group) received the standard protocol only The inclusion criteria were:
      positive 4 out of the clinical signs: empty can test, Hawkins sign, Neer' sign, tenderness
      upon palpation of the greater tuberosity of the humerus, and painful movement between 60°_
      and 120°(painful arc) Subjects were excluded if they have a previous history of shoulder
      surgery, cervical spine involvement, upper-limb fracture, adhesive capsulitis, joint
      instability, intraarticular corticosteroids injections within the last 2 months During the
      first interview, all subjects were checked for inclusion criteria. Eligible subjects
      underwent baseline assessment for pain level using a validated (36, 37) version of the Visual
      Analog Scale (VAS). Moreover, the functional level of the shoulder was assessed using
      shoulder pain and disability index (SPADI). It is a valid and reliable scale with a score
      ranging from 0 (normal) to 100 (complete disability) (38). Pain and functional level were
      assessed again after the end of the treatment period.and after 3months (following up) 12
      weeks-rehabilitation program was implemented to all participants with a frequency of 3
      sessions/week. The RTG received a bilateral rigid taping technique using zinc oxide tape and
      along with protective tape (reference). With the participant assuming a relaxed standing
      position, the tape was applied bilaterally starting from the first to the last thoracic
      vertebra. A second tape was then applied to form a position of scapular depression and
      retraction. This tape was applied bilaterally and extended from the midpoint of the spine of
      the scapula to the last thoracic vertebra. This taping was applied for 12 weeks and changes
      every 2 days (3times per week) In addition to the rigid tape, a standard physical therapy
      protocol will be introduced. This protocol consisted of (1) progressive strengthening
      exercises for rotator cuff muscles. The resistance was applied first by a red-colored elastic
      Thera-band. Then progressed, using the green-colored band. Each exercise was performed 10
      times /session,(2) Self-stretching exercises for levator scapula, posterior deltoid,
      pectoralis minor, and latissimus dorsi muscles. Five repetitions of stretching were performed
      for each muscle per session In addition to the standard protocol, the SSEG received scapular
      stabilizing exercises in the form of (1)wall slides with squat, (2) Wall push-ups with
      ipsilateral leg extension, (3) lawnmower with diagonal squat, (4) resisted retraction to
      scapula with opposite leg squat (5) robbery with squat. ten repetitions / exercises/ session
      were performed .

      The CG received the standard protocol only Statistical analysis: SPSS (Version 16) for
      Windows was used to analyze the obtained data. Mean± SD and percentage of differences were
      calculated.

    <description>The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) is a self-administered questionnaire that consists of two dimensions, one for pain and the other for functional activities. The pain dimension consists of five questions regarding the severity of an individual's pain. Functional activities are assessed with eight questions designed to measure the degree of difficulty an individual has with various activities of daily living that require upper-extremity use. The SPADI takes 5 to 10 minutes for a patient to complete and is the only reliable and valid region-specific measure for the shoulder.</description>

    <description>Taping techniques We will use rigid tape and apply it bilaterally. In the rigid tape application, a combination pack of zinc oxide tape and the protective tape will be used. The protective tape will be applied first with no tension. To apply the rigid tape, subjects will be instructed to place their thoracic spine in a neutral position, the rigid tape will be applied bilaterally from the first to the twelfth thoracic vertebra. Subjects will be asked to retract and depress the scapula. The rigid tape will be applied diagonally from the middle of the scapular spine to the twelfth thoracic vertebra; this technique will be applied bilaterally. The rigid tape will be applied 3 times per week and will be applied for 6 weeks.</description>
