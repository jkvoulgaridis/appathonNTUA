  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare eating behaviors and measures of hunger and fullness between day and
      night workers in order to better understand why night workers are at increased risk for
      obesity and related diseases.

    <time_frame>2-hours measurement period</time_frame>
    <description>Appetite-regulating hormones, including Glucagon-like-peptide 1 (GLP-1) and ghrelin will be analyzed from plasma from whole blood samples collected while fasted and at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min postprandial. Area under the curve of plasma concentrations will be calculated for each individual appetite-regulating hormone</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hunger and fullness</measure>
    <time_frame>24-hours measurement period</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective measures related to hunger, fullness, and prospective consumption will be measured before and after meals via visual analog scales. The range of scores are 0 mm to 100 mm, with higher scores indicating greater feelings of the corresponding measure (e.g. greater hunger). Post-meal measures, adjusted for the corresponding pre-meal measure, will be analyzed as individual outcomes. Area under the curve will also be calculated for each measure.</description>
