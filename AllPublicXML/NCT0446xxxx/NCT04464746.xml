  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In hypertension, highly prevalent, up to 10-15% of hypertensive patients have uncontrolled
      blood pressure despite being treated with ≥3 drugs, which is known as resistant hypertension.
      Resistant arterial hypertension, together with difficult-to-control hypertension, has a worse
      cardiovascular prognosis than controlled hypertension. In addition, data on therapeutic
      adherence in arterial hypertension show that 1 in 2 hypertensive patients do not fully or
      partially comply with the indicated therapeutic prescription. The determination of
      antihypertensive drugs or their metabolites in urine seems to be a good indicator of
      therapeutic adherence. On the other hand, the implementation of a specific program to improve
      knowledge of the disease and its risks and promote therapeutic adherence could improve the
      control of hypertension and reduce the associated morbidity and mortality.

      Objective: To assess whether the implementation of a specific action plan to improve
      adherence for 3 months results in reduced peripheral 24h-systolic blood pressure (SBP) in
      patients with resistant hypertension (RH) or uncontrolled hypertension with 2
      antihypertensive drugs.

      Method: interventional, prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel groups, open study of a
      cohort of 150 consecutively recruited patients with RH (office SBP ≥140mmHg and/or diastolic
      blood pressure ≥90mmHg despite treatment with ≥3 drugs at appropriate doses, one diuretic) or
      patients with uncontrolled hypertension with 2 antihypertensive drugs, with ambulatory 24h-BP
      ≥130 and / or 80mmHg. The partially or completely non-adherent patients (confirmed by
      determination of antihypertensive drugs in urine) will be randomized (1: 1) to receive a
      specific program to improve adherence (intervention group) or routine follow-up (control
      group), with office BP measurement and determination of antihypertensive drugs in urine at
      pre-randomization, 3, 6 and 12 months; peripheral and central 24h-ambulatory BP monitoring
      will be performed at pre-randomization, at 3 and 12 months.
