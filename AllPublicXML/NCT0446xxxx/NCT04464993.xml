  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to develop an optimized intervention for reducing leisure sedentary
      screen time (SST) in middle-aged adults with overweight or obesity. Investigators will use
      the multiphase optimization (MOST) framework to conduct a highly efficient full-factorial
      experimental study to simultaneously test the main effects for each of three intervention
      components (LOCKOUT, TEXT, EARN) and their interactions (e.g., TEXT+EARN; LOCKOUT+EARN+TEXT)
      over 16 weeks.

      Primary Aim: To identify which component(s) from three components under consideration for
      inclusion in StandUPTV reduce SST by &gt;60 min per day per day at 16 weeks. The three
      components tested will be: (a) LOCKOUT (no vs. yes); (b) TEXT (no vs. yes); and (c) EARN (no
      vs. yes). The investigators will use a highly efficient experimental strategy to detect
      effects of individual components as well as all two- and three-way interactions.

      The secondary aim of this study is to examine how reductions in SST displace time into other
      active behaviors, i.e., light-intensity physical activity (LPA), moderate-to vigorous
      physical activity (MVPA) and activity type (e.g., housework, walking, exercise behaviors).
      The investigators will use both device-based (activPAL3c) and self-report (ACT24) measures to
      understand whether SST displacement can increase active behaviors, particularly MVPA.

    <description>Participants will receive a &quot;core&quot; intervention which will include a basic version of the StandUPTV app and a Fitbit watch to use throughout the 16-week intervention.The Fitbit will provide device-based behavioral feedback through the StandUPTV self-monitoring component. SST feedback will be Self-monitoring will provide passive and objective feedback regarding SST behaviors and MVPA drawn from Fitbit and SCREENTIME sources. StandUPTV will also contain basic education including information on the risks of SST and tips for reducing SST. As part of this education, all participants will be provided a behavioral target of reducing their SST by 50% from their baseline. This target will be customized for the participant within StandUPTV based on a baseline week of observation.</description>

    <description>Earn sedentary screen time through moderate-vigorous physical activity: EARN Participants assigned to the EARN component will earn SST by engaging in a 10 min continuous bout of exercise. They will earn SST on a 1:1 ratio up until they reach their baseline level of MVPA. If they exceed their baseline MVPA the ratio will be 1:2 (10 minutes of exercise earns 20 minutes of SST). After each successful 'replacement' of SST, participants will be prompted with an encouraging notification within the app to build self-efficacy (e.g., &quot;Great job exercising! You've earned 20 more minutes of additional screen time!&quot;).</description>
