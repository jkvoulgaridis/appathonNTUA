  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neutropenia is one of the most frequent adverse effects of chemotherapy, and the main factor
      to limit the dosage and the continuation of chemotherapy.A newly pegylated rhG-CSF was
      independently developed by JIANGSU HENGRUI Medicine Co., Ltd, China. Phase 1a, 1b and phase 2
      trials have shown that pegylated rhG-CSF has decreased renal clearance, increased plasma
      half-life, and prolonged efficacy in compare with ﬁlgrastim.

      This study is to evaluate efficacy and safety in chemotherapy-induced neutropenia of
      once-per-cycle Mecapegfilgrastim Injection(PEG-G-CSF) and daily G-CSF in Patients with
      lymphoma patients.

      This is a randomized, controlled study. A total of 170 lymphoma patients who are eligible are
      planned to randomized assigned into two groups to receive mecapegfilgrastim fixed dose of 6
      mg or filgrastim 5 µg/kg/day during chemotherapy.

      The primary endpoint is the duration of grade ≥3 neutropenia in cycle 1. The secondary
      endpoints include incidence of grade ≥3 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia (FN) in cycle
      1-4, The pharmacoeconomics and safety profile are also evaluated.
