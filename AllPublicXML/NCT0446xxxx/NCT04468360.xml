  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 6.4% of the U.S. population suffers from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
      Responses to evidence-based trauma-focused therapies for PTSD vary. This study tests whether
      allopregnanolone (Allo) treatment in Allo-deficient individuals facilitates learning and
      memory processes underlying the efficacy of trauma-focused therapies for PTSD.

      Trauma-focused psychotherapies show general efficacy in PTSD. However, symptom improvement in
      response to such treatments can vary substantially among individuals with PTSD. Several
      factors may contribute to treatment response including neurobiological factors that impact
      brain capacities needed to reprocess trauma memories and consolidate reconfigured brain
      circuits during recovery. During trauma-focused therapies, activation of a threat-related
      memory renders the memory &quot;labile&quot; and engages two competing processes: extinction and
      reconsolidation. Extinction involves: a) activation of prefrontal cortical (PFC) inhibition
      of amygdala-mediated physiological and behavioral defense responses, and b) acquisition and
      consolidation of new learning (e.g., the conditioned threat stimulus or CS+ no longer signals
      threat in the new time-space context). At the molecular level, extinction involves both
      synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). Extinction thus
      improves function, but is not permanent, as amygdala-mediated defense responses may reemerge
      in a new context, upon re-exposure to the original threat, or with the passage of time.

      PTSD has been associated with deficits in both extinction learning and retention.
      Reconsolidation blockade also may contribute to PTSD recovery. Protein synthesis inhibitors
      (not safe/feasible in humans), beta-blockers, and protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitors can block
      reconsolidation (if given within an hour of brief threat memory reactivation),the the latter
      by disrupting phosphorylation of serine 845 residues on Glu-R1 AMPA receptors, thus limiting
      their synaptic incorporation—a prerequisite for memory reconsolidation. Thereafter, the
      former CS+-US association is &quot;remembered&quot;, but amygdala-mediated defense responses are not
      co-activated by the CS+. Some, but not all human studies, have demonstrated
      propranolol-induced blockade of episodic and aversive memory reconsolidation, as well as PTSD
      symptom improvement in paradigms combining reconsolidation blockade and extinction.

      In this randomized clinical trial, the investigators will use a standard 3-day differential
      fear conditioning paradigm to compare the effects of appropriately timed intravenous (IV)
      administration of allopregnanolone (Allo) vs. placebo on extinction retention (Expt. 1) and
      reconsolidation blockade (Expt. 2).

      Allo is a metabolite of progesterone that positively modulates gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
      effects at GABAA receptors; sulfated metabolites of Allo antagonize NMDA receptors. Men and
      women with PTSD are at high risk for Allo deficiency, and low resting Allo has been
      associated with poor extinction retention. In contrast, administration of an Allo analog
      after brief reactivation of conditioned fear in Allo-deficient rodents appears to block
      reconsolidation and prevent the spontaneous recovery of conditioned fear after completion of
      a series of extinction training trials.

      For both Expts. 1 and 2, stratified randomization will be employed to created the following
      subgroups: men (n=44; 22 per treatment group), women in the early follicular phase (eFP)
      (n=42, 21 per treatment group), and women in the mid luteal phase (mLP) (n=42, 21 per
      treatment group).

      In Expts. 1 and 2, all participants will undergo differential fear conditioning (Day 1). On
      Day 2 of Expt. 1, IV Allo vs. placebo will be infused after extinction training to raise
      plasma Allo to resting levels associated with optimum extinction retention; extinction
      retention will be tested on Day 3. On Day 2 of Expt. 2, high dose IV Allo vs. placebo will be
      administered immediately after fear memory reactivation by a single CS+; reconsolidation
      blockade will be tested on Day 3.

      Expt. 1 testing effects of IV Allo on extinction retention will take place first over two
      years beginning after the 6-month study start-up activities. Expt. 2 testing the capacity of
      IV Allo to induce reconsolidation blockade will be conducted over the following two years.

      If this study is successful, Allo could potentially be administered to augment trauma-focused
      therapy in treatment refractory PTSD patients.

    <measure>Extinction retention in Expt. 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>To assess extinction retention the difference between the average skin conductance response (SCR) to the first 5 conditioned stimulus (CS+) trials and the average SCR to the first 5 CS- trials on Day 3 will be calculated. Extinction retention for SCR will be defined as this differential SCR minus the differential SCR for Day 2 (calculated as the difference between the average SCR to the last 5 CS+ trials and the average SCR for last 5 CS- trials—the index of Day 2 extinction). For fear-potentiated startle (FPS), the degree of FPS to the CS+ during the first 5 CS+ trials on Day 3 will be examined and compared to the FPS for the last 5 CS+ trials during extinction. Lower scores indicate better extinction retention.</description>

    <description>Fear acquisition will be defined as the difference between the average SCR to the last two CS+ and the average SCR to the last two CS- trials during the acquisition phase (i.e., the differential SCR). For FPS, the last two trials of acquisition for each CS will be examined. (Because FPS is calculated as the difference between startle to the CSs compared to the noise alone (NA) trials, the standard is to use FPS to CS+ trials as the dependent variable (DV) rather than the difference between FPS to CS+ vs. CS- as is typically done for SCR). Higher scores indicate greater conditioned fear acquisition.</description>
