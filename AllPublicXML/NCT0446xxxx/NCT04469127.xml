  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The HEROINE-Breast01 study is a Phase I/II clinical study of a new investigational agent,
      AIP-303 to help patients with metastatic or unresectable HER2-positive breast cancer and for
      women with previously treated HER2 positive breast cancer who have gone through at least two
      prior lines of treatment and received other HER-2-targeted drugs, Trastuzumab or
      Ado-Trastuzumab and chemotherapy as part of earlier treatments and who have progressed on one
      or more available therapies. AIP-303 may help slow down tumor growth and this might improve
      outcomes and quality-of-life for these patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, Phase I/II, multi-center, open-label study in a total of 150 subjects
      with HER2 Positive Breast cancer tumors. Eligible participants will undergo baseline
      assessments at enrollment. Study participants be administered therapeutic doses of AIP-303 up
      to four treatments spaced 8 weeks apart and a CT scan immediately after. An AIP 301 Ga-68
      PET/CT scan will be performed four weeks before and four weeks after the initial dose of the
      AIP-303. An IEC will review the protocol and any amendments and advertisements used for
      recruitment. The IEC will review the patient information sheet and the informed consent form,
      their updates (if any), and any written materials given to the patients. A list of all IECs
      to which the protocol has been submitted and the name of the committee chairmen will be
      included in the clinical trial report.
