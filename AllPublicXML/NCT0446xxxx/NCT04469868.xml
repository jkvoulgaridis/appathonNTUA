  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioid analgesics are routinely prescribed for these patients for post-operative pain
      control. Even a short exposure to opioids in opioid-na√Øve patients following minor or major
      surgery has been associated with de novo habitual or persistent use of opioids in 5-30% of
      patients. The goal of the study to eliminate the use of outpatient opioids prescriptions
      after major urologic surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 200 million opioid prescriptions are dispensed per year in the United States. Opioid
      prescriptions given by medical providers are a major contributor to the opioid abuse
      epidemic. Nearly 40% of opioid overdose-related deaths occur due to prescribed opioids. Among
      patients diagnosed with opiate dependence, 80% had received an opioid prescription prior to
      their abuse diagnosis and 51% had a family member who had an opioid prescription, Thus,
      opioids prescriptions, which are often in excess of the need by the patient, are a major
      contributor to this public health crisis.

      The investigators devised a prospective intervention study to eliminate or significantly
      reduced the use of opioids prescribed after major urologic surgery for use at home.

    <description>Patients who are being scheduled for any major urologic cancer surgery (open or laparoscopic) will be counselled regarding post-operative pain and measures taken during surgery and during hospital stay.
They will be provided written information on these pain mitigation efforts and the adverse effects associated with opioids use and outpatient prescriptions.
Patients will be discharged from the hospital without any opioids prescriptions and instructions to use non-opioids analgesics.
Patients will complete a visual analog pain scale daily for 7 days after discharge from the hospital.
Patients will be able to call the clinic at anytime for any post-operative pain issues.</description>
