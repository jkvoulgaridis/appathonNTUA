  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Annotated pain maps will be created showing region and size of areas sensitive to mechanical
      stimulus in both women affected by vulvar pain and unaffected control patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will develop annotated pain maps showing region and size of areas sensitive to mechanical
      stimulus. The pain maps will be created by combining IR images, photographs, and clinical
      input, and will be correlated with patient co-morbidities. The IR images will assess for
      areas of inflammation and increased skin temperature. Pain maps will be created with patient
      response to mechanical stimulation with a cotton swab and will be overlaid on the
      thermographic images. Through this combination of measurements, we plan to expand the
      diagnostic tools used in patient care as well as on the classification of this heterogeneous
      disorder.
