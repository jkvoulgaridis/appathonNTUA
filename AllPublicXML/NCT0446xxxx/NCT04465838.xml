      This research is a multicenter,observational study under real world settings in patients
      diagnosed as psoriasis by dermatologist in the clinic. As patient's choice of medication
      should be fully respected, all the patients can choose the treatments they prefer, like
      phototherapy, traditional systemic therapy or biologics. And the study was conducted to
      compare the effectiveness among different choices of medication in Chinese psoriasis
      patients.

      Psoriasis is a chronic, recurrent inflammatory disease which is caused by heredity,
      environment and other factors. The typical clinical manifestation are erythematosquamous
      lesions, and the disease can progress to involve several organs. In view of its complex
      pathogenesis, there exists various of treatment of psoriasis like traditional systemic drugs
      and biologics.

      This study is an observational, multi-centre study based on real-world evidence. Inclusion
      criteria is the patients who visit the clinic diagnosed psoriasis by the dermatologist. There
      existed no exclusion criteria. Information were most collected by a phone application called
      &quot;Psoriasis New World&quot;.

      Primary outcome measure is the percentage of patients who achieved a PASI reduction of 100%
      (PASI 100). And Psoriasis Area and Severity Index includes scores of erythema, infiltration
      and desquamation, weighted by area of involvement in each regions (head and neck, upper
      extremities, trunk, lower extremities), with higher PASI scores indicating worse condition.
      Also, static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA), static Investigator Global Assessment
      (sIGA), Body surface area (BSA) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) are measured to
      assess the severity of psoriasis and the change of the disease condition. It is important to
      monitor all the Adverse Events (AEs) over the whole study. In addition, the laboratory
      examinations of patients such as liver function are also collected.
