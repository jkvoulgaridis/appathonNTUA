  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy treatments are intended to boost a person's immune system to fight their
      cancer. Treatment with immunotherapy has been shown to be effective in a wide range of
      cancers, including melanoma skin cancer, lung cancer and kidney cancer, among others.

      Steroids are anti-inflammatory medications which may suppress the immune system. For this
      reason, persons requiring treatment with steroids have not previously been allowed to
      participate in immunotherapy clinical trials. Therefore, we do not know whether or not
      immunotherapy treatments are effective in patients who are also receiving treatment with
      steroids.

      When cancer has spread to the brain swelling may occur around the tumors, and headache,
      nausea, seizures or stroke-like symptoms may occur. In this instance, steroids are important
      to reduce swelling within the brain, thus alleviating these symptoms.

      Because patients requiring treatment with steroids have not previously been allowed to
      participate in immunotherapy clinical trials, we do not know whether treatment with
      immunotherapy is effective when steroid treatments are also used. This study will investigate
      this question, and also attempt to determine whether treatment with one steroid versus
      another results in a better response to immunotherapy.

    <description>Secondary study outcomes include progression-free and overall survival (PFS, OS). PFS is defined as the time between the date of treatment initiation and the date of disease progression (determined utilizing RECIST 1.1 criteria) or death (whatever the cause), whichever occurs first. For participants who remain alive and whose disease has not progressed, PFS will be censored on the date of last visit/contact with disease assessments. PFS will be based on the disease assessment or date of death provided by the investigator. OS is defined as the time between the date of treatment initiation and the date of death (whatever the cause). For participants who remain alive OS will be censored on the date of last visit/contact with disease assessments. OS will be based on the date of death provided by the investigator.</description>

    <measure>Patient-reported quality of life analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Upon completion of 12 month follow-up period for the final participant enrolled to the study.</time_frame>
    <description>An analysis of patient-reported quality of life will be conducted utilizing the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the EORTC Brain Cancer Module (EORTC QLQ-BN20) questionnaires). Quality of life questionnaires will be administered to participants following enrolment to study but prior to initiation of immunotherapy. Follow-up questionnaires will be administered as part of the standard of care immunotherapy pre-treatment starting 6 weeks from Cycle 1 and every 6 weeks thereafter until end of treatment. Quality of life questionnaires should be administered prior to investigator assessment at each indicated time-point.</description>

             presence of extracranial measurable disease is not a requirement for enrolment.

          5. Patients must be 18 years of age or older.

          6. Patients must be capable of providing consent to enrolment and willing to comply with

             Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.
