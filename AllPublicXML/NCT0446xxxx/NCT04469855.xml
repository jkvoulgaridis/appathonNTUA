  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of long-term treatment with Ozempic® in
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. People will get Ozempic® as prescribed by their
      doctor. People will be in this study about 3 years. People above the age of 18 will be asked
      to fill in the quality of life (QOL) questionnaire (the QOL questionnaire is for the
      assessment of the influence of diabetes treatment on people's life). There is a possibility
      that people's blood sample would be provided to Novo Nordisk from their doctors in case of
      severe allergic reaction that might be caused by Ozempic®.
