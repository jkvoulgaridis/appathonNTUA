  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to test the accuracy of a new device (the Apollo EE Device) that measures
      resting energy expenditure (REE) using only oxygen consumed (VO2). Findings from this study
      will help determine how this new device compares to the gold standard, indirect calorimetry,
      which measures REE using VO2 and carbon dioxide production (VCO2). Findings may help develop
      less expensive and more accessible means of measuring energy expenditure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The gold standard for measuring resting metabolic rate (RMR) is metabolic carts that measure
      oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2). The energy equivalent of VO2
      ranges from ~4.7-5.0 kcals/L, depending on the ratio of carbohydrate, fat, and protein
      oxidized. However, RMR can be measured based solely on VO2, because VCO2 has a relatively
      small effect on energy expenditure estimation. A device that measures RMR based on VO2 and
      eliminates the need for measuring VCO2 could provide a simple and less expensive alternative
      to metabolic carts and may have important clinical applications. The overarching goal of this
      proposal is to validate such a metabolic system by comparing its ability to accurately
      measure RMR against a metabolic cart.

    <description>Healthy adults already enrolled in separate studies using indirect calorimetry to measure RMR within our lab will be recruited for this study. Fifty participants (25 male, 25 female) will be heterogeneous in age, body composition, and physical activity based on the inclusion and exclusion of their respective studies. To test reliability, 25 of the 50 participants will repeat RMR measurements within 1 week of initial measurements.</description>
