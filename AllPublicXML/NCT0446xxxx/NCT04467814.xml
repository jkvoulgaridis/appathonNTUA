  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalization creates opportunities for older adults to accumulate prolonged periods of
      sitting and lying (defined as sedentary behavior) which can result in mobility loss. We
      propose a Type 1 Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation Trial with 1:1 randomization to test the
      effect of a caregiver intervention on older patients' physical activity at 3 months (home).
      We will recruit 61 patients and family caregivers from hospital units and follow them for 3
      months; the primary outcome is patients' daily step count at 3 months.

    <description>Patient and caregiver dyads from both groups will receive usual care during hospitalization and following discharge. This will include a handout on strategies for safely remaining active.
Caregiver participants in the intervention group will receive up to six telephone or video calls with the research assistant or Clinical Resource Therapist. Sessions will review the knowledge translation (KT) product with family members (~15 minutes), art goals, brainstorm strategies, and discuss setbacks. The calls with the caregiver may occur 1 to 2 times in the hospital, within one week of going home, and then in Months 2 and 3.</description>
