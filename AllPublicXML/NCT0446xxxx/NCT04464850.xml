    <textblock>
      This study is aim to compare the efficacy of intravenous versus oral iron therapy regarding
      the hemoglobin levels, iron status and erythropoietin dosage in maintenance hemodialysis
      patients

      Run-in phase: All eligible patients will enter run-in phase for 2 weeks. In this phase, all
      oral therapy that patients received before enrolment into the study will be discontinued.

      Masking: Opened label

      Allocation: Block of four randomization into 2 treatment arms: intravenous iron and oral iron

      Safety criteria: Study participants who meet the following criteria will be discontinued from
      the study. All patients data will be analyzed according to intention-to-treat principles.

        -  Hemoglobin levels &lt; 6.0 g/dl

        -  Packed red cells transfusion is required

        -  Serum ferritin &gt;1,000 md/dl
