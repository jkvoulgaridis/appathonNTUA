    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted a prospective study which included all patients diagnosed with
      biopsy-proven BP in the Dermatology Department of Attikon hospital between April 1, 2009 and
      December 31, 2019. 113 consecutive patients with BP were identified. The investigators
      included the patients with type 2 diabetes and investigated the percentage of patients who
      were under treatment with DPP4-is. The specific DPP4-i prescribed was also documented.Medical
      information including patients' age, sex, other comorbidities and concomitant medications
      were also recorded. Furthermore, the investigators evaluated the effect of different types of
      treatment (topical steroids, systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents) on bullous
      pemphigoid.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most common chronic autoimmune skin disease which is
      characterized by the presentation of subepidermical blisters and mostly affects elderly
      patients . Recent studies have suggested that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4is), an
      incretin-based drug for type 2 diabetes, as possible predisposing agents of BP . The
      objective of the study was to estimate the association between the use of DPP-4is and the
      development of BP in the setting of a tertiary university hospital and to raise awareness for
      everyday clinical practice, both among dermatologists as well as all physicians following
      patients with diabetes The study was designed as an observational prospective study.In the
      study included all patients who received a new diagnosis of BP and hospitalized in the
      Dermatology Department of our hospital between April 1, 2009 and December 31, 2019 Inclusion
      Criteria included a) biopsy proven bullous pemphigoid b) severe bullous pemphigoid c) recent
      manifestation of bullous pemphigoid (last four months).Exclusion Criteria included a) non
      bullous pemphigoid b) presentation of bullous pemphigoid more than four months c) treatment
      with DPP4is more than two years.

      Overall, 113 consecutive patients with the diagnosis of BP were enrolled in the study.The
      investigators reviewed the percentage of patients with type 2 diabetes among all patients
      with BP.The number of patients who were under treatment with DPP4-is and the specific type of
      DPP4-is prescribed were also examined.
