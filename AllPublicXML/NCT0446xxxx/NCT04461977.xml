  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of
      chemotherapy drug paclitaxel induced peripheral neuropathy in patients with early stage
      breast cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with early stage breast cancer (stages I,II,III) who received paclitaxel in
      neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy protocol and developed peripheral neuropathy will be
      randomized to receive true acupuncture (intervention group) vs sham acupuncture (control),
      once a week, for 8 weeks. The primary outcome is improvement of the symptoms by Neuropathic
      Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI) scale (Bouhassira,2004). The secondary outcomes are
      improvements on Visual analog scale (VAS) and Quality of life by FACT-taxane (Cella, 2003)
      questionnaire. These scales will be assessed in the Screening visit (baseline), week 4, week
      6, week 8 and week 12. The study has duration of 12 weeks.

    <description>Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI) scale. This tool included 12 items in total: 10 are differential symptoms descriptors and 2 items evaluate spontaneous and paroxysmal spontaneous pain. The verbal numeric scale from zero (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain). Total pain intensity score may be calculated by the sum of 10 descriptors.</description>

    <measure>Baseline pain intensity change</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening visit (baseline), week 4, week 6, week 8, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analog scale (VAS). The pain VAS is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity. It is a continuous scale comprised of a horizontal (HVAS) or vertical (VVAS) line, usually 10 centimeters (100 mm) in length. For pain intensity, the scale is most commonly anchored by &quot;no pain&quot; (score of 0) and &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot; or &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot; (score of 100 [100‚Äêmm scale]).</description>

    <description>FACT-taxane questionnaire. It is a self-report instrument that was developed to measure the health-related Quality of life of patients receiving taxane-containing chemotherapy. This scale has 16 items, including an 11-item neurotoxicity subscale and five additional taxane-specific questions related to the effects of arthralgia, myalgia, and skin changes. The total score is calculated as the sum of the un-weighted subscale score.</description>
