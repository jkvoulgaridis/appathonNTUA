  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been a rapid increase in researching the use of tart cherry supplements in the past
      5 years, particularly for inflammatory conditions. Many formulations of cherry supplements
      exist, however there has been no comparison between these different types. This is
      particularly important in the realm of inflammation research because sugar is known to
      increase the inflammatory response. The pill form of cherry supplementation has no added
      sugar and is naturally low in sugar (&lt; 1g) while the juice form is higher from added sugar.
      Recent work indicates tart cherry consumption can change gut microbiota, which may modify
      inflammation. The purpose of this study is to look at the effects of taking a cherry
      supplement, either in capsule or juice form, on the gut microbiome, inflammation, and
      health-related variables such as blood pressure, glucose regulation and sleep quality.

      Participants will consume a tart cherry or placebo product for 30 days and attend 5 visits in
      the Exercise Physiology Lab at Ohio University over the 30 day period. They will self-collect
      a stool sample at baseline, 14 days and 30 days after supplementation. Blood samples will be
      taken at baseline, 7 days, 14 days, and 30 days after supplementation. Throughout the study
      participates will rate symptoms (stomach, head, etc.), pain and sleep quality using an online
      survey for which the link will be emailed. Participants will maintain normal diet and
      exercise routine and to track these for the duration of the study.
