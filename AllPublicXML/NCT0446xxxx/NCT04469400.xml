  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impaired glucose regulation (IGR) is closely related to overweight/obesity. By studying
      different dietary patterns (energy-limited diet vs. low-carbohydrate diet) and intensive
      lifestyle interventions combined with blood glucose monitoring, glucose regulation of
      overweight/obesity is affected. To improve the blood glucose and related metabolic indexes of
      patients with impaired (IGR), establish 1-2 clinical intervention programs for impaired
      glucose regulation.
