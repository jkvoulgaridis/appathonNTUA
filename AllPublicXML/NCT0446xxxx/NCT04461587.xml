    <description>Pirfenidone recommended daily dose for patients is 801 mg three times a day with food, for a total of 2403 mg/day. Upon initiating treatment, the dose should be titrated to the recommended daily dose of 2403 mg/day over a 14day period as follows:
Days 1 to 7: a dose of 267 mg administered three times a day (801 mg/day)
Days 8 to 14: a dose of 534 mg administered three times a day (1602 mg/day)
Day 15 onward: a dose of 801 mg administered three times a day (2403 mg/day) It will be provided in 267mg capsules. Treatment will be for a minimum of 12 months. Treatment duration will continue until last patient enrolled received 12 months of treatment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Able and willing to provide informed consent and to comply with study protocol

             years in a coal mining environment

          -  3. Chest CT Scan or Chest Xray (within 6 months) confirming diagnosis of CWP,
             complicated black lung disease/progressive massive fibrosis will be recorded. If CT
             not available must be obtained at Visit 1.

          -  4. Evidence of Loss of lung function defined by decline in FEV1 or FVC or DLCO of 5%
             within the past 36 months prior to enrollment.

          -  5. FEV1 ≤ 75% or FVC ≤ 80% or DLCO ≤ 70% or abnormal 6MWT with oxygen desaturation of

             CWP/PMF is present and meet PFT guidelines. Current smokers will be given smoking

               -  Daily prednisone up to 10 mg daily (prescribed for lung disease or rheumatoid
                  arthritis) will be permitted. Chronic use for 3 months prior to enrollment will
                  be documented.

               -  Methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis will be permitted as long as chronic use

          -  4. Elevation of liver function test at screening documenting AST, ALT or total
             bilirubin &gt; 3 x ULN or ALP &gt; 2.5 x ULN.

          -  5. Patients who have other pulmonary pathology such as lung cancer, active
             tuberculosis or atypical mycobacterial infection requiring treatment.

          -  6. Patients with recurrent malignancy requiring chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
             Individuals with a prior diagnosis of localized skin cancer, prostate cancer,
             localized bladder cancer will not be excluded unless undergoing active treatment.
             Patients with a prior diagnosis of malignancy treated greater than 5 years ago will be
             considered for enrollment.

          -  7. History of alcohol or drug abuse that would impair or risk the patient's full
             participation in the drug study in the opinion of the investigator

          -  8. Use of any investigational therapy within 4 weeks of enrollment.

          -  9. Individuals with clinically significant unstable cardiac disease (ejection fraction
             ≤35%) or complex arrhythmias per PI discretion. Chronic atrial fibrillation will be
             permitted if heart rate is controlled. Historical values of ejection fraction will be
             accepted.

          -  10. Individuals with poorly controlled diabetes per PI discretion (Hemoglobin A1c &gt;9).
             Historical values will be accepted.
