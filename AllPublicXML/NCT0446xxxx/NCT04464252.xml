      Cephalometric analysis is a standardized diagnostic method used daily by orthodontists and
      maxillofacial surgeons. It is based on linear and angular measurements performed on
      radiographic images. This examination is traditionally done manually on two-dimensional
      radiographs, which does not allow to analyze finely the bilateral structures which are found
      superimposed. Cephalometric analysis of three-dimensional imaging (cone beam computed
      tomography (CBCT) or computed tomography scan (CT-Scan)) may provide additional diagnostic
      information, particularly for patients with maxillofacial abnormalities or marked
      asymmetries.

      One of the obstacle to the clinical use of three-dimensional cephalometric analysis is the
      time and expertise needed to manually place the landmarks. Automatic methods described in
      literature are preliminary and lack validation in a clinical context.

      Our retrospective observational study is aimed to develop and validate a new automated
      three-dimensional cephalometry method. This method will be based on a deep learning algorithm
      trained from a database of pre-surgery CT-Scans of patients with have undergone an
      orthognathic surgery. These CT-Scans will be manually annotated to provide a reference
      standard for the training of the algorithm and its evaluation. The validation of our results
      will focus on demonstrating the diagnostic effectiveness and robustness of three-dimensional
      cephalometric measurements obtained in this clinical context.
