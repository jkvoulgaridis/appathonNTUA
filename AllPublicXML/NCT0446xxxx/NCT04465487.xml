  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For dose escalation cohorts, the primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability
      of REGN6569 as monotherapy lead-in and in combination with cemiplimab.

      For dose expansion cohorts, the co-primary objectives are:

        -  To assess the preliminary efficacy of REGN6569 in combination with cemiplimab, as
           measured by objective response rate (ORR)

        -  To assess the preliminary pharmacodynamic activity of REGN6569 as lead-in monotherapy,
           as measured by intratumoral Glucocorticoid-Induced Tumor necrosis factor
           receptor-Related (GITR)+ Treg depletion

      Secondary Objectives are:

      For dose escalation cohorts:

        -  To assess preliminary efficacy of REGN6569 in combination with cemiplimab, as measured
           by ORR, disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free
           survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS)

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of REGN6569 alone and in combination with
           cemiplimab

        -  To assess the immunogenicity of REGN6569 and cemiplimab

      For expansion cohorts:

        -  To characterize the safety profile in each expansion cohort

        -  To assess preliminary efficacy of REGN6569 in combination with cemiplimab, as measured
           by DCR, DOR, PFS, and OS

        -  To characterize the PK of REGN6569 alone and in combination with cemiplimab

        -  To assess the immunogenicity of REGN6569 and cemiplimab
