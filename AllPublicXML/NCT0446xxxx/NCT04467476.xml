  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anaerobic power and capacity are essential in many human activities, especially during sports
      practice that demand a high strength and power of the limbs. Transcranial direct current
      stimulation is a noninvasive technique that can modulate motor brain areas involved in motor
      functions and has the potential to optimize muscle capacity. However, their effects on
      mechanical power are lacking.

      This study aims to investigate the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
      on mechanical power in healthy subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a randomized, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled experimental design
      will be used. The 50 participants will be randomized into two groups: (1) Anodal tDCS(real)
      and (2) Sham tDCS. A single session of anodal and sham tDCS will be performed on each task
      (pre and post-jump test).

      All evaluations will be performed by a single researcher who, like the participants, will not
      know which stimulation group will be participating. Subjects who agree to the conditions and
      sign the consent form may participate in the study. Participants who meet the eligibility
      criteria will be included in the study.

    <measure>Fatigue index</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre and Post-test (immediately after tDCS)</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue index will be evaluated by assessing the ground reaction forces (GRF) and the number of jumps in each test by means of the kinetic analysis of the 60-second vertical jump test (Bosco's Test).
The fatigue index corresponds to the power reduction rate expressed as a percentage and reveals the degree of reduction in the ability to produce strength and maintain exercise.</description>

    <description>The subjective feeling of effort will be assessed by the Borg scale for perceived effort. This is a 15-point numerical scale that ranges from 6 to 20, where 6 means &quot;no exertion at all&quot; and 20 means &quot;maximal exertion.&quot;</description>
