      This is an open-label, single dose, adaptive study of orally adminstered HTL0014242 in up to
      10 healthy male subjects. The primary objective is to investigate the
      pharmacokinetic-receptor occupancy relationship of single oral doses of HTL0014242 in healthy
      subjects. The secondary objectives are to assess the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and
      tolerability of single oral doses of HTL0014242 in healthy subjects.

    <description>The study consists of up to 5 dosing groups, with 2 to 3 subjects per dosing group. Each subject will receive a single oral dose of HTL0014242 in the form of solid suspension capsules (1, 5, 10, and 30mg) as required. HTL0014242 will be administered in up to 5 single dose groups, with 120mg administered in the first dosing group.</description>
