  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Many digital devices, such as smartphones and activity monitors, have sensors to collect and
      track health data. Researchers believe these devices may be able to transform the quality of
      clinical research and healthcare. They believe they may be able to help assess the symptoms,
      response to therapy, and quality of life of people with cancer.

      Objective:

      To collect data from people with cancer using an Apple iPhone alone or together with an Apple
      Watch in order to assess their symptoms and activity levels.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 years and over who have cancer and receiving treatment for their cancer in
      another NIH protocol

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with their medical records.

      Participants will have a baseline visit. They will have visits every 2 4 weeks based on the
      treatment protocol in which they are co-enrolled. Then they will have a follow-up visit 4
      months after the baseline visit. Visits include:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Karnofsky Performance Scale/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status to see how
      their disease affects daily activities

      The study team will use an iPhone to collect data. This includes a 6-minute walk test and
      tests of hearing, reaction time, and cognitive status.

      Questionnaires

      If participants have an iPhone, an Apple Watch will be provided to them after training at the
      baseline visit. Continuous measurement of their activity will be recorded by the watch
      between 2 visits. They will wear the watch while they are on study. They will wear the watch
      while it is not being charged. They should charge the watch at night time. They will have the
      watch for 4 months.

      Background:

        -  A growing number of mobile health solutions are enabling the tracking, diagnosis, and
           management of various physiological processes and disease conditions, and many common
           devices such as smartphones (e.g., iPhone) have integrated robust sensors to collect and
           track this data.

        -  The two most commonly used tools in oncology include the Eastern Cooperative Oncology
           Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) scales that
           were invented more than 50 years ago.

        -  Although standard PS measurements are simple to implement in the clinic, they are
           retrospective, subject to bias and limitations including intra- or inter-observer
           variability, they are intermittent, providing a snapshot of the patients status at the
           time of assessment, they are largely subjective, relying on physician judgement and
           patients ability to recall events and describe their symptoms. Also the inability to
           retrospectively verify or confirm the accuracy of PS assessment is another limitation.

        -  The benefits to patient care of knowing the accurate PS are extensive, including making
           the right treatment decision based on the side effect profile, and survival benefit and
           eligibility on clinical trials.

        -  Biometric data can also play a role in empowering patients to become active participants
           in their own care, by providing them with quantitative feedback on activities of daily
           living and other functions.

        -  There are some studies exploring the accuracy of available electronic activity
           monitoring systems (EAM), but the available data on use of EAM systems in oncology
           patients is limited.

        -  Continuous biometric data can provide actionable insights into fluctuations in not only
           the activity level of cancer patients, but also their cognitive function and mood
           throughout treatment episodes.

        -  Given the current limitations in the overall clinical evaluation of cancer patients, the
           use of remote sensor technologies can provide an objective, frequent, and near-real time
           stream of data in a machine-readable format that is free of human bias and can greatly
           enhance the ability of both clinicians and patients to manage the complexities of cancer
           care.

      Objective:

      -Determine the feasibility of using an Apple iPhone alone or in conjunction with an Apple
      Watch to collect data from patients with cancer to assess their fatigue, acoustic
      neurotoxicity, and cognitive status.

      Eligibility:

        -  Inclusion criteria: Male or female subjects aged greater than or equal to 18 years with
           histologically or cytologically proven malignant tumors who are under active treatment

        -  Exclusion Criteria: Active central nervous system (CNS) metastases, known current
           alcohol or drug abuse, any psychiatric condition that would prohibit the understanding
           or rendering of informed consent

      Design:

      This pilot study will be done in two arms (enrolled concurrently) on a total of 60 evaluable
      patients.

      Patients assigned to Arm 1 will have all assessments done in the clinic. A specially
      programmed iPhone, Apple Watch, an NIH iPad, and investigator conducted assessments will be
      used to collect data assessing patient fatigue, reaction time, and cognitive functioning.
      These data will be compared with data collected from questionnaires including: patient
      reported outcome (PRO)- CTCAE fatigue and mood grading, ECOG/KPS, Neuro-QOL Ability to
      Participate in Social Roles and Activities short form, the Delis-Kaplan Executive Functioning
      System, and The NIH Toolbox.

      Arm 2 of this study will be a subset of enrolled patients who have a personally-owned iPhone.
      Patients in Arm 2 will complete the same battery of assessments in the clinic as those in Arm
      1, with additional continuous measurement of their activity recorded by an Apple Watch at
      home, between clinic visits. The Apple Watch will be given to these patients (or they may use
      a personally owned Apple Watch) who will be trained by study staff on using the device for
      continuous monitoring.
