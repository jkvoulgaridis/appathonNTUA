  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a parallel-group, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind
      ascending dose Phase I study of dietary supplementation in healthy individuals to evaluate
      safety and to determine the pharmacologically effective dose (ED).

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quantification of enzymatic modifications measured in grams by spectrometry</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will measure enzymatic changes on glycoproteins in the immune system by spectrometry, i.e., these changes will be measured in grams. Spectometry will allow the investigators to quantify these changes in small detail, and therefore give a better idea of how supplementation can change enzymatic process that then affect the structure, and mass, of glycoproteins.</description>

    <measure>Flow cytometry to determine the effect of dietary supplementation on the immune system</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Perform flow cytometry on subject blood samples to determine the effect of dietary supplement on immune system. For example, the investigators will note changes to immune cell pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine clusters as translated proteins (measured as height and area of cytokine intensity).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Transcriptome analysis to determine the effect of dietary supplementation on the immune system</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Perform transcriptome analysis on subject blood samples to determine the effect of dietary supplement on immune system. For example, the investigators will note changes to immune cell pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine clusters as RNA (measure on a logarithmic scale per number of reads) to determine the effects of supplementation on both gene transcription and translation.</description>
