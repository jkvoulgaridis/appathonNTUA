      complications after laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) regarding the
      choledochotomy technique have not been adequately studied in the literature. Therefore, this

      Background: complications after laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) regarding
      the choledochotomy technique have not been adequately studied in the literature. Therefore,
      this study aimed to retrospectively analyze and compare the impact of choledochotomy
      techniques during LCBDE among patients with choledocholithiasis during the early and late
      postoperative periods.

      Methods: from March 2014 to February 2018, 85 patients with choledocholithiasis (52 females
      and 33 males) were enrolled in this study. These patients were treated by LCBDE using various
      choledochotomy techniques, including scalpel or scissor (28 patients, 33%) in group I, using
      diathermy hook (35 patients, 41%) in group II, or using an ultrasonic device (22 patients, 26
      %) in group III. Postoperative follow-up was done for assessment of all possible
      complications either early (within 3-6 months postoperatively), or late (2-6 years
      postoperatively) with meticulous observation and study of any relevant postoperative event.

    <description>According to the international study group of liver surgery, bile leakage is defined as fluid with an elevated bilirubin level (3 times higher than the serum bilirubin measured at the same time) in the abdominal drain or the intra-abdominal fluid on or after POD 3, or as the need for radiologic intervention because of biliary collections or re-laparotomy resulting from biliary peritonitis</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>biliary stricture</measure>
    <time_frame>2-6 years</time_frame>
    <description>The biliary stricture is known as abnormal narrowing of the bile duct associated with the rising of cholestasis indexes. Additionally, it has required an invasive treatment such as ERCP, percutaneous transhepatic drainage, or re-surgery [16]. Biliary complications were diagnosed by trans-tubal cholangiography or through MRCP and could be managed conservatively, ERCP, if there is an accessible route, PTD or surgical intervention.</description>

        During the study period, 85 patients (52 females and 33 males) were enrolled in this study
        which they were complaining of manifestations of CBD stones and treated using laparoscopic
        approaches, using various choledochotomy techniques.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All adult patients with choledocholithiasis who underwent LCBDE combined with LC were
             enrolled in this study. No limitations as regards the stone sizes or numbers were
             considered. The CBD diameter should be at least Â± 1 cm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria were normal caliber or stenosed CBD, or the presence of overt

             extraction were excluded from this study.
