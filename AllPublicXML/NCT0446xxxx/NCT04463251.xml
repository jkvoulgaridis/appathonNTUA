    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to evaluate the effect of single administration of RPH-104 at 80 mg
      and 160 mg on parameters of systemic inflammation and outcomes of the disease in subjects
      with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)

    <textblock>
      146 male and female subjects aged from 18 years old (inclusive) hospitalized with STEMI will
      be enrolled in the study. 102 subjects will be randomized, 34 subjects per group.

      After signing informed consent, the investigator will assess the subject's eligibility for
      the study. The screening will be made on Day 1 of the study.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups (in a 1:1:1 ratio) for single
      subcutaneous administration of RPH-104 80 mg, RPH-104 160 mg or placebo.

      Screening, randomization and administration of the study products will be made on the same
      (first) study day.

      Follow-up period after administration of the study products will last for 4 weeks and will
      include follow-up after administration of the study product (Day 1), Visit 2 (Day 3), Visit 3
      (Day 14) and Visit 4 (Day 28±1). The following will be performed during this period: the
      subject's condition monitoring, laboratory and instrumental examination.

      Additional clinical follow-up will last for 12 months after the study product administration
      and will include Visit 5 (Month 6 ±2 weeks) and Visit 6 (Month 12 ±2 weeks). During this
      period, the subject's condition will be monitored and laboratory and instrumental examination
      will be performed.

      The end of clinical part of the study will be the date of the last visit of the last subject
      within additional 12-month clinical follow-up.

      The study is planned to be conducted in Russian Federation and USA.
