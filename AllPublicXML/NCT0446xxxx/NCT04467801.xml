  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For metastatic/advanced NSCLC patients who do not have targetable mutations, either
      immunotherapy targeting the programmed death-1 and its ligand (PD-1/L1) pathway alone or in
      combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy is now a standard of care. However, still
      about half of the patients do not benefit due to treatment resistance. It is therefore
      critically important to find novel therapies and combinations to benefit patients who have
      failed or are intolerant to 1st line immunotherapy.

      This study hypothesizes that ipatasertib in combination with taxane (e.g. docetaxel) can be
      an effective strategy. Ipatasertib is a novel Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive
      inhibitor that has demonstrated robust and selective targeting of Protein kinase B (AKT) in
      cancer patients. Importantly, evidence from preclinical studies has demonstrated that AKT
      inhibitors (e.g. ipatasertib) can enhance the therapeutic effect of chemotherapy as well as
      immunotherapy via modulating Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3'K)-AKT activity
