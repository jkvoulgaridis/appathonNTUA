  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gambling disorder (GD) is recognized as an addictive disorder in the DSM-5. Craving is a core
      phenomenon in addiction that can lead to relapse in problem gambling for pathological
      gamblers. Exposure Therapy (ET) focuses on craving in addiction treatment. ET in
      Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is based on classical conditioning that addresses the
      association between contextual cues and the craving response. ET helps the patient to reduce
      craving when faced with cues triggering craving. ET includes in vivo exposure and imaginal
      exposure. The literature recommends being as close as possible to the context of addiction to
      facilitate the extinction of craving but in vivo ET is complicated to perform. For GD, in
      outpatient consultation, bringing a patient to a casino presents obstacles (e.g., time, human
      and financial cost, agreement with casino for therapy).

      The study will be to assess the effectiveness of Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) in a
      virtual gambling environment. Various trials show that VRET is no more or less effective than
      classical ET in CBT but has other advantages for motivation to treatment. This research aims
      to compare efficacy between CBT with VRET and CBT with imaginal exposure for treatment of GD
      in a multicenter, randomized, controlled, non-inferiority clinical trial.

      Main aim:

      Show, within patients seeking care for GD, that VRET integrated with CBT is non‐inferior to
      imaginal ET integrated with CBT on GD symptom reduction at the end of 12 treatment sessions.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. Show that VRET integrated with CBT is non‐inferior to imaginal ET integrated with CBT on
           GD symptom reduction during the first 12 months post-treatment.

        2. Compare the effect of the two therapeutic strategies on GD symptoms (measured by
           complementary assessments to that used in the main aim), at the end of treatment and
           during the first 12 months post-treatment.

        3. Show the efficacy of VRET integrated with CBT compared to imaginal ET integrated with
           CBT on gambling behavior, craving, and gambling-related cognitions at the end of
           treatment and during the first 12 months post-treatment.

        4. Show the efficacy of VRET integrated with CBT compared to imaginal ET integrated with
           CBT on the evolution of anxiety and depressive symptoms at the end of treatment and
           during the first 12 months post-treatment.

        5. Compare the quality of the two therapeutic strategies at the end of treatment.
