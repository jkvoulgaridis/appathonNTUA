  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lactose, naturally present in milk, can cause digestive discomfort. Delactosed milk is
      currently the only one alternative to cow's milk for intolerant people. As some of them do
      not digest milk, it was completely remove from their diet. However, are they really
      intolerant to lactose or intolerant to milk (or to another of its compounds)? Do β-caseins
      play a role in this intolerance? β-caseins are proteins naturally present in milk. Two types
      of β-caseins were identified: A1 and A2. These types differ according to the genetic profile
      of the cow and depend on the breed. The rare clinical studies interested in this topic
      suggest that:

        1. consumption of milk A1 versus consumption of milk A2 can lead to: softer stools, delayed
           transit, as well as pro-inflammatory effects in some individuals,

        2. consumption of A2 milk significantly reduces gastrointestinal symptoms and improves
           digestive comfort in lactose intolerant people.

      Thus, it would be interesting to be able to assess the effect of a consumption of A2A2 milk
      type compared to A1A2 milk type, both on the parameters of digestive comfort and on
      inflammatory parameters.

      The study will be carried out on healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65 and self-declared
      sensitive, even intolerant to the consumption of milk.

      The main objective of the study is to assess the impact of milk β-caseins (A2A2 vs A1A2) on
      the digestive comfort felt during the consumption of milk in subjects declaring that they do
      not tolerate milk.

    <measure>Analog visual scales</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Digestive comfort will be assessed daily by the average of the following analog visual scales (score : 0 to 10), completed within 30 min to 3 hours after consumption of the daily dose of milk, depending on the usual occurrence of symptoms in individuals:
I have bloating
I have abdominal pain
I have flatulence (gas)
I have borborygmas (gurgling)
I have reflux (return, rise)
Overall, I estimate my digestive comfort.
The average of these 6 analog visual scales, called Global Digestive Discomfort (IDG), will therefore be available every day for 14 days; the final variable analyzed will be the average of these 14 IDG values, and will be called Global Average Digestive Discomfort (IDGM).</description>
