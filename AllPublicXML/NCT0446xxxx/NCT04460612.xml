  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to prove that socks manufactured with infrared textile is capable of
      augmenting peripheral circulation in the lower legs and feet of participants with Diabetes
      Mellitus. Infrared is currently used in saunas and various textiles as general wellness
      products that purport to improve various health conditions and augment microcirculation. This
      study is intended to investigate specifically whether socks capable of harnessing infrared
      energy can improve oxygenation in the feet and lower legs of diabetics using noninvasive
      transcutaneous oximetry to do so.

      Infrared energy is a type of electromagnetic energy that is invisible, and is further
      subdivided into three subsets based on wavelength. Far infrared (FIR or IR-C) is a subset of
      energy in the infrared spectrum that is thought to transfer energy in the form of heat,
      perceived by thermoreceptors in the skin as radiant heat. FIR is thought to be both absorbed
      by the human body but is also emitted in the 3-50 micron range, with a peak output at 9.4
      micron. The range of far infrared varies depending on which source is referenced but is
      generally felt to start at 3 to 5 microns. The use of FIR has been studied in various
      circumstances and thought to improve various biological functions via FIR heat lamps, saunas,
      ray devices and FIR emitting ceramics and fabrics. There are no short-term or long-term
      safety issues that have arisen in any studies thus far. As noted in the 2006 statement of the
      ICNIRP (International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection), &quot;…the contribution
      made by the IR-C spectral region (3-1,000 micron) is normally of no practical concern from a
      health hazard standpoint.&quot; FIR has been shown to increase blood flow in forearms, and access
      flow and survival of arteriovenous fistula in hemodialysis patients. An unpublished study, by
      McClue, reported an apparent increase in pedal circulation of approximately 10% using
      transcutaneous oxygen monitoring in healthy subjects wearing socks infiltrated with FIR
      emitting textiles. The mechanism of improving circulation is not entirely elucidated, however
      recent work suggests a role of increasing endothelial nitric oxide synthase, nitric oxide
      production and modulating profiles of circulating miRNAs (mircoRNA, small noncoding RNAs of
      ∼22nt in length which are involved in the regulation of gene expression at the
      posttranscriptional level).

      Type 2 Diabetes prevalence has increased significantly over the past decade, with estimates
      from 2015 of 26 million Americans diagnosed and predicted to increase to 32 million by 2020.
      Both Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes is well known to increase the risk of nontraumatic lower
      extremity amputation by, amongst other factors, impairing circulation to the feet through
      both peripheral arterial disease and microvascular dysfunction.

      Noninvasive transcutaneous oximetry measurements of the leg have been validated as a valuable
      tool in assessing lower extremity circulation in both normal subjects and diabetic
      individuals.

      This trial seeks to prove that exposure to IR, through the use of newly developed socks that
      contain thermoreactive particles woven into textile, which both emit IR and reflect the IR
      back from the body, can augment circulation in the feet and lower legs of diabetic subjects.
      Noninvasive transcutaneous oximetry will be used as the assessment modality. If this study
      confirms this hypothesis, future studies may be planned to determine if the use of a
      IR-containing textile can prevent new ulcers from forming in high risk patients and perhaps
      even speed the healing of prevalent foot ulcers.

      Subjects will be recruited from both primary care and specialty medical offices who carry a
      diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus, will be between the ages of 18 to 80 and will act as their
      own controls. The goal will be to enroll a minimum of one hundred (100) patients who will be
      evaluated noninvasively with transcutaneous oxygen measurements using Radiometer TCM
      (PeriFlux 6000) supplied by Radiometer America, Inc. Upon arrival study subjects will have
      both feet evaluated by a registered nurse (RN), to ensure there are no signs of infection,
      active foot ulcers, or other open wounds. If there is any such evidence, the patients will be
      excluded from the trial and sent for further evaluation and treatment according to standard
      of care by their primary care clinicians or podiatrists. Patients will then have ankle
      brachial index (ABI) measurements performed on both legs to exclude those who have severe
      peripheral arterial disease (ABI index or 0.4 or lower).

      Subjects will be placed on an exam table reclined at a 120-degree angle with legs extended
      and supported by leg rest. The TCPO2 machine will have been turned on prior to patient
      arrival for calibration. If necessary, any hair on the subject's foot or leg will be removed
      in the area of fixation ring application by a disposable razor. The subject will then have up
      to 3 fixation rings attached, used for measuring TCPO2, placed on the lower leg and foot. The
      fixation rings will be further secured around the circumference with medical tape,
      approximately 1 inch by 0.5 inch per piece to further enhance the seal. The placebo sock will
      be placed over the foot and lower leg covering the fixation rings. The sock will then be
      marked at the sight of each of the fixation rings by placing a dot, with a black marker, on
      the sock in the center of each ring. The sock will then be taken off the subject and placed
      on a foot form, covering the study (IR) sock which has already been placed. Using the black
      mark as a guide, a vertical cut will be made through both socks, no larger than one
      centimeter, so that when the socks are applied, connection of the TCPO2 leads can occur while
      avoiding restriction or compression (known to effect O2 readings) of the electrodes. Three
      drops of contact solution will be placed inside each fixation ring, followed by attachment of
      the electrodes. There will then be a 15 minutes rest/stabilization period allowing for the
      TCPO2 to stabilize (stabilization phase) followed by an additional 15 minutes of readings
      considered the baseline levels (barefoot).

      The placebo socks will then be gently applied to the feet and leg, while being careful not to
      disturb the fixation rings. The placebo socks are identical in all ways to the study sock,
      with the exception that the placebo socks do not contain the proprietary thermoreactive
      minerals woven into the fabric. Subjects will then wear these socks over the pre-affixed
      fixation rings on the study foot as well as the contralateral foot. The active phase will
      then commence and continue for 60 minutes, with TCPO2 measurements taking place continuously
      and recorded at least every 10 minutes. At the end of the 60-minute study period, the leads
      will be removed, followed by the socks. The fixation rings are not removed, however. The
      TCPO2 machine should be recalibrated after the leads are returned to the holding chamber,
      prior to the second half of the trial using the IR socks. During this 15-minute recalibration
      period, subjects will be allowed to use the restroom and may place loose foot coverings over
      their feet for ambulation. Following the subjects return to the exam table, the same above
      protocol will be followed, with 15 minutes of rest/stabilization after the leads are placed
      back on, followed by another 15 minutes for the baseline readings prior to study sock
      placement. The study socks will be placed in a similar manner so that the pre-cut holes line
      up over the fixation rings. Repeat TCPO2 measurements will be obtained according to the same
      schedule as indicated above. Activity will be restricted during the active and stabilization
      phase of the protocol. Patients will be encouraged to void prior to initiation of each half
      of the protocol. However, should subjects have to use the bathroom during one of the active
      phases, the rest and stabilization phase will restart at time zero following the bathroom
      break and reattachment of the TCPO2 sensors. At the completion of the study, the leads and
      fixation rings will be removed and subjects will return placebo and study socks to the
      appropriate personnel.
