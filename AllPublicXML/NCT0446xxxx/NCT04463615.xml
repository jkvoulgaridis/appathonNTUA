    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well leflunomide works for the treatment of patients with CD30+
      lymphoproliferative disorders that have come back (relapsed) or do not respond to treatment
      (refractory). Leflunomide may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate overall response rate of leflunomide treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess complete response rate and duration of response of leflunomide treatment.

      II. To assess toxicities of leflunomide treatment. III. To assess disease status by the CAILS
      (composite assessment of index lesion severity).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To generate a preliminary ribonucleic acid (RNA) signature associated with response of
      CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders (LYPDs) cells to leflunomide.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive leflunomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 13 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 12 months.

    <measure>Duration of response</measure>

    <time_frame>From the date of first documented response (CR or PR) to the first documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. Observed toxicities will be summarized, in terms of type, grade, time of onset, duration, and attribution to the study treatment.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Micro (mi)R ribonucleic acid (RNA)/messenger (m)RNA expression profile</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Data will be summarized by descriptive statistics. The data will also be used to explore the miRNA/mRNA that show significant differences between responders and non-responders after leflunomide treatment. For miRNA/RNA profiling, fold changes &gt; 3 with an false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05 will be considered significant.</description>

          -  Meets other institutional and federal requirements for infectious disease titer
             requirements. Note infectious disease testing to be performed within 28 days prior to
             day 1 of protocol therapy

          -  Negative for tuberculosis antigen (e.g. T-Spot test)

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP): negative urine or serum pregnancy test
             (within 21 days prior to day 1 of protocol therapy). If the urine test is positive or
             cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required

          -  Agreement by females and males of childbearing potential* to use an effective method
             of birth control (hormonal or barrier method of birth control or abstinence) or
             abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through at least three
             months after the last dose of protocol therapy. The effects of study treatment on a
             developing fetus have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect that she is pregnant while participating on the
             trial, she should inform her treating physician immediately

               -  Childbearing potential defined as not being surgically sterilized (men and women)
                  or have not been free from menses for &gt; 2 years (women only)

        Exclusion Criteria:

             chemotherapy, or radiation therapy during the study treatment period

          -  Current or planned growth factor or transfusion support. If growth factor or
             transfusion support is provided between screening and start of treatment, the
             participant will no longer be eligible

          -  Known history of hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection

          -  Known HIV infection

             exceptions:

               -  Adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer

               -  Carcinoma in situ of the cervix

             informed consent

          -  Pregnant women and women who are lactating. Leflunomide has potential for teratogenic
             or abortifacient effects. Because there is a potential risk for adverse events in
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with these agents, breastfeeding
             should be discontinued if the mother is enrolled on this study

          -  Any other condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, contraindicate the
             patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance
             with clinical study procedures, e.g., infection/inflammation, intestinal obstruction,
             unable to swallow medication, social/ psychological issues, etc

          -  Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to
             comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to
             feasibility/logistics)
