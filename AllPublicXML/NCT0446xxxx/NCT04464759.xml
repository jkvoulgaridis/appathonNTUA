    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy (objective response rate) of
      using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab or with nivolumab
      alone in subjects with advanced/metastatic melanoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are three parts to this Phase 1/2 study in subjects with advanced melanoma:

      Phase 1a will identify the MTD and preliminary safety of combination hydroxychloroquine and
      nivolumab therapy.

      Phase 1b will identify the MTD and preliminary safety of hydroxychloroquine administered in
      conjunction with nivolumab and ipilimumab therapy

      Phase 2 will assess the clinical efficacy of combination hydroxychloroquine and nivolumab
      therapy.
