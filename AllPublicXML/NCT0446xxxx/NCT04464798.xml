  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate CC-220 alone, as well as in
      combination with an anti-CD20 mAb (rituximab or obinutuzumab) in subjects with relapsed or
      refractory (R/R) lymphoma. Subjects must have received at least 2 prior lines of therapy, and
      have at least one measurable lesion according to Lugano 2014 classification.

      Study will consist of two parts: Part 1 (Dose Escalation) which will be followed by Part 2
      (Dose Expansion).
