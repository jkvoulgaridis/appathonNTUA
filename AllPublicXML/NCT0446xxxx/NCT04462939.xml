  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to learn about the effect of multi-micronutrient, lutein and DHA
      supplementation (Elevit Breastfeeding &amp; Postnatal Care) on the breast milk nutrient
      composition and babies physical growth parameters.

      Mothers participating in this study received either Elevit or placebo orally once a day for
      12 weeks starting from 4 to 6 weeks after delivery. Blood, urine and milk samples were
      collected from the mothers and physical parameters like size and weight were collected from
      the babies to assess the effect of the supplementation.
