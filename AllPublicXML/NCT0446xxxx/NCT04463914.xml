      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate a mobile application (app) for depression
      treatment. Participants will be randomly assigned to either receive the mobile app,
      &quot;Moodivate&quot;, or not. If provided with Moodivate, participants will be asked to use the app
      regularly, at least once per day, throughout the study duration. Participants will be asked
      to complete electronic questionnaire measures throughout the study period. Participation in
      this study will take about 12 weeks.

    <description>Patients will self report depressive symptoms weekly for 8 weeks with final follow-up at 12-weeks via the Beck Depression Inventory-II. The range of scores possible are 0 - 63, where lower scores are indicative of lower symptoms of depression.</description>

    <description>Participants in the treatment as usual group will be provided educational material about mood management available via the EHR with the suggestion to discuss questions with their PCP.

    <arm_group_label>Group B- Moodivate</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants randomized to the Moodivate condition will be instructed to utilize Moodivate regularly, at least once per day, for the treatment of depressed mood. Participants in the Moodivate group will receive a download code to download the Moodivate mobile application. Moodivate is a mobile app for individuals with elevated symptoms of depression. Within the app, users identify values, create activities, schedule activities, and rate mood daily. Participants will be asked to complete questionnaire measures weekly for 8 weeks, with a final follow-up questionnaire at 12 weeks following study enrollment.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the Moodivate + EHR condition will receive similar instructions as those randomized to Moodivate, but will also be instructed that their PCP will have access to metrics related to their app utilization and may choose to follow-up with them regarding treatment utilization and response. The PCP for each participant randomized to this condition will be provided EHR access to Moodivate metrics which will include metrics related to change in mood, frequency of app utilization, and frequency of activity completion. Participants will be asked to complete questionnaire measures weekly for 8 weeks, with a final follow-up questionnaire at 12 weeks following study enrollment.</description>
