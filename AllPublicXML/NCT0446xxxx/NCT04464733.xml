  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and food effect of HRS9950. The study
      will be conducted in three parts sequentially:

      Part 1, evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics of single
      and multiple doses of HRS9950 tablet in healthy subjects. Part 1 will consist of 64 healthy
      subjects, 6 groups.

      Part 2, evaluate food effect of HRS9950 in healthy subjects. Part 2 will consist of 14
      healthy subjects, 1 group (one of groups in Part 1).

      Part 3, evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics of multiple
      doses of HRS9950 tablet in naïve and treatment-experienced chronic hepatitis B (CHB)
      patients. Part 3 will consist of 40 CHB patients, 1 group for naïve patients and 3 groups for
      treatment-experienced patients.
