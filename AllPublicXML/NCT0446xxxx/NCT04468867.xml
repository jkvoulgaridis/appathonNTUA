  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some women who have been diagnosed with a breast cancer will require chemotherapy as part of
      their treatment. The chemotherapy can be given before breast surgery - neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy or after breast surgery - adjuvant chemotherapy. Whether chemotherapy is given
      before or after does not affect the clinical outcomes for the woman - ie there is no
      disadvantage to the woman. Due to the fact that giving chemotherapy before has no
      disadvantages, many of the oncologists like to give the chemotherapy before because they can
      see if the breast cancer is responding. They are able to do this by using imaging. The best
      imaging test is breast MRI. Ultrasound can be used but studies have shown that it is not as
      good. However, whole breast ultrasound (ABUS) provides 3 dimensional information similar to
      breast MRI and the purpose of our study is to see if ABUS performs similar to breast MRI in
      being able to see if a tumour is responding to the chemotherapy. The breast MRI requires
      women to lie facing down and takes about 20mins. It involves an injection of contrast called
      gadolinium via a cannula. ABUS involves scanning the whole breast with the patient lying on
      their back and takes 10mins. There is no injection of contrast. MRI is an expensive test and
      often there is limited access to the scanner and so patients may have to wait for an
      appointment. ABUS because it is an automated process for obtaining the images can be
      performed in the breast unit in a timely manner without the issue of competing demands. All
      women who agree to take part in the study will have both the breast MRI - standard or care
      and the ABUS.
