  <brief_summary>

      This study is to investigate breath analysis (breath metabolomics) combined with established
      bioinformatic tools as a platform for companion diagnostics.

    <textblock>
      Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is defined as measuring concentrations of a drug at one or
      more time points in a biological matrix after a dose. The purpose of TDM is to individualize
      the drug dose to achieve maximum efficacy and at the same time minimize toxicity. The concept
      of TDM could potentially be even more valuable if in addition to drug concentrations, other
      drug-regulated and drug-related metabolites could be included in the models to define optimal
      dosage. There exists a clinical need to stratify patients with better precision to improve
      current clinical and therapeutic management. Breath analysis offers an opportunity to
      non-invasively retrieve relevant information on the ongoing internal biochemical processes,
      as well as to monitor the respiratory system itself. For breath analysis, a Secondary
      Electrospray ionization - mass spectrometry (SESI-MS) breath analysis platform will be used
      to capture disease-related, drug-regulated and drug-related metabolites (breath metabolomics)
      in exhaled breath. This information, retrieved in parallel to standard of care clinical
      co-variates, could have the potential to provide a more personalized therapeutic management
      of patients.

    <description>Participants will be asked to refrain from eating, drinking, chewing gum use or brushing their teeth at least 1 hour before the measurements will be performed. Room temperature and lighting will be set at the same level for all measurements. Participants will exhale through a disposable mouthpiece into a commercially available SESI source (FIT S.L., Spain). While performing full exhalations, the subjects will keep the pressure through the sampling line at a fixed value monitored by a digital manometer. Breath prints will be collected in real-time recording multiple replicates (typically six in positive and negative ion mode). The whole procedure is absolutely non-invasive and is usually accomplished without any effort in around 15 min per subject.</description>

    <description>In young children below the age of 4 not capable of completing the on-line exhalation maneuvers, or in cases when the patient needs cannot approach the mass spectrometer, the sample will be collected off-line. They will be asked to exhale into a bag that will be transported to the lab and deflated into the mass spectrometer for analysis. Exhaled breath of patients under anesthesia will also collected using available ventilation system in the operation theatre.</description>

      Blood samples will be divided into two sets and stored at -80°C in a dedicated, lock-secured
      laboratory freezer for later molecular analysis. One set will be used for blood plasma
      metabolomics. A second set will be analyzed depending on the exploratory findings regarding
      breath compounds. These samples shall enable retrospective correlation between the
      concentrations of molecules-of-interest in breath and blood.
