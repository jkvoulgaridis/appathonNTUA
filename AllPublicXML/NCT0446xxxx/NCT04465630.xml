      and trabeculotomy performed with the OMNI Surgical System in pseudophakic eyes on intraocular
      pressure (IOP) and the use of IOP-lowering medications in patients with open angle glaucoma

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects, 22 years or older at the time of surgery

          -  History of uncomplicated cataract surgery and posterior chamber IOL implantation
             without compromise to the lens capsule, zonular dehiscence/rupture or vitreous
             prolapse, 6 months or more prior to Baseline Visit.

          -  Diagnosed with mild to moderate open angle glaucoma (e.g. primary open angle glaucoma,
             pigmentary glaucoma, pseudoexfoliative glaucoma) as documented in subjects' medical
             record substantiated using funduscopic exam or OCT and at least one visual field test
             with the Humphrey automated perimeter using the SITA Standard 24-2 testing algorithm.

               -  Mean deviation score must be better than or equal to -12.0 dB

               -  The visual field test may be historical (within 6 months prior to Screening
                  Visit). If needed, visual field testing may be repeated between the Screening
                  Visit and the Surgery Visit.

          -  At the Screening visit, IOP of ≤ 36 mmHg while on 1-5 ocular hypotensive medications1
             with a stable medication regimen for at least 2 months.

          -  At Baseline visit, unmedicated diurnal i) IOP ≥ 22.5 and ≤ 39mmHg and ii) IOP at least
             3 mmHg higher than screening IOP and iii) IOP at 7:30AM ≥ 24

          -  Scheduled for ab-interno transluminal viscoelastic delivery and trabeculotomy using
             the OMNI Surgical System.

          -  Shaffer grade of ≥ III in all four quadrants

          -  Able and willing to comply with the protocol, including all follow-up visits.

          -  Understands and signs the informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any of the following prior treatments for glaucoma:

               -  Laser trabeculoplasty ≤3 months prior to Baseline visit

               -  iStent or iStent Inject implanted ≤6 months prior to Baseline visit

               -  Endocyclophotocoagulation (ECP) or Micropulse laser ≤ 6 months prior to Baseline
                  visit

               -  Trabeculectomy or other bleb forming procedure including Xen, Express, glaucoma
                  draining device/valve

               -  Prior canaloplasty, goniotomy, or trabeculotomy

               -  Hydrus microstent

               -  Suprachoroidal stent (e.g. Cypass, iStent Supra)

          -  Acute angle closure, traumatic, congenital, malignant, uveitic or neovascular glaucoma

          -  Concurrent IOP-lowering procedure other than use of the OMNI Surgical System at the
             time of surgery (e.g. ECP, CPC, etc.)

          -  In the Investigator's judgement, predisposed to significant risk because of washout of
             ocular hypotensive medications

          -  Concurrent ocular pathology or systemic medical condition which, in the Investigator's
             judgment, would either place the subject at increased risk of complications,
             contraindicate surgery, place the subject at risk of significant vision loss during
             the study period (e.g., wet AMD, corneal edema, Fuch's dystrophy, active intraocular
             infection or inflammation within 30 days prior to Screening Visit, etc.), or interfere
             with compliance to elements of the study protocol (e.g., returning to Investigator's
             office for follow-up visits).

          -  History of penetrating keratoplasty or another corneal transplant

          -  BCVA of logMAR 1.0 (20/200) or worse in the fellow eye not due to cataract

          -  Study of OMNI System in POAG

          -  BCVA of logMAR 0.4 (20/50) or worse in the study eye not due to posterior capsular
             opacification (uneventful Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy 6 months prior to baseline is
             permitted only if there is no vitreous present in or in front of the iris plane at the
             time of baseline).

          -  Participation (≤ 30 days prior to baseline) in an interventional trial which could
             have a potential effect on the study outcome, as determined by the study investigator

          -  Women of childbearing potential if they are currently pregnant or intend to become
             pregnant during the study period; are breast-feeding; or are not in agreement to use
             adequate birth control methods to prevent pregnancy throughout the study
