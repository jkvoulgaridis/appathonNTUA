  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As part of root canal treatment, canals should be sealed to prevent further contaminations.
      There are multiple accepted techniques to fill-obturate canals. In the past, different
      obturation techniques have been compared. The most current technique used, a single cone with
      bioceramic sealer, has not been compared. This clinical investigation will compare the
      postoperative pain of this technique to another common technique used in our clinic.
      Postoperative pain after one-visit root-canal treatment on teeth with vital pulps: Comparison
      of three different obturation techniques.

    <intervention_model_description>Non-surgical root canal treatment:
All teeth were isolated with a rubber dam during root canal treatment. The procedures were performed under a microscope (OPMI Pico; Carl Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany). After access, location of canals, and determination of working length (WL) with Root ZX II apex locator (J Morita, Kyoto, Japan), the canals were instrumented using various .04 taper rotary NiTi instruments to a minimum apical size of 35. 4% NaOCl was used as the main irrigant. 17% EDTA was used as the final irrigant. Passive ultrasonic irrigation with size 20 Acteon tip inserted 2mm short of WL was performed with both 4% NaOCl and 17% EDTA for 10 seconds in each canal. After final irrigation, the canals were dried with paper points. The master gutta-percha cone fit was verified with periapical radiographs before filling the tooth.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Patients were asked to rate the intensity of preoperative pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain ever) before receiving root canal treatment. At the end of the visit, the patients were given a survey and asked to rate the intensity of postoperative pain (VAS 0-10) at 4 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after the procedure.</description>

Size 30 Lentulo spiral coated with additional sealer was introduced 3 mm short of WL depth at 300rpm. Bioceramic coated gutta-percha was dipped in BC sealer and introduced into the canal to WL. A heated plugger was used to sear the gutta-percha point at each orifice.</description>

          <description>Patients were asked to rate the intensity of preoperative pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain ever) before receiving root canal treatment. At the end of the visit, the patients were given a survey and asked to rate the intensity of postoperative pain (VAS 0-10) at 4 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after the procedure.</description>

          <title>Obturation Technique: WVT</title>
          <description>Warm vertical compaction technique (WVT): Teeth filled with AH Plus Jet Root Canal Sealer were filled with .04 taper gutta-percha points by WVT. The sealer was introduced with the master cone. The depth of heated plugger was within 3-5 mm of WL in the WVT group, and the remaining canal space was backfilled with additional sealer and thermoplasticized gutta-percha.</description>
