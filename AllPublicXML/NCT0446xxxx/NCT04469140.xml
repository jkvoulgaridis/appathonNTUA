  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators wish to better understand the role of the choriocapillaris (CC) in the
      formation and progression of non-exudative in age related macular degeneration (armd) by
      imaging the retinal pigment epithelium (rpe) and the choroidal microvasculature and by
      studying their inter-dependence to determine if the loss of the CC could prove useful as an
      anatomic clinical trial endpoint in future drug trials.
