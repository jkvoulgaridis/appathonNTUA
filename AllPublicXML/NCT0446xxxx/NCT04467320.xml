  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most children who have been removed from their family home and placed under the care of a
      Local Authority have been exposed to many frightening experiences, including witnessing
      violence, not being fed or cared for, or being abused. These experiences can lead to
      significant emotional difficulties. One such difficulty is posttraumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD), which can involve symptoms like having constant &quot;flashbacks&quot; of scary experiences,
      and a constant feeling of being in danger. This can have a big effect on children's lives.
      Yet, it is still not clear how to help young people in care who are experiencing high PTSD
      symptoms.

      One idea the researchers have is to use a group-based programme which has successfully helped
      other young people who have been exposed to different kinds of stressful experiences (for
      example, war). To test whether this programme could help children in care too, the
      researchers first need to see whether social workers have the time to check in with a child
      about PTSD symptoms; whether young people and their carers are willing to be involved in a
      research project which will test out the treatment programme; and whether mental health
      workers might face any problems when delivering the programme. This project aims to answer
      these questions.

      The researchers will train social workers to complete an 8-question interview with 10-17 year
      olds in care, which will measure symptoms of PTSD. If the young person is experiencing high
      symptoms, they will be invited to take part in a research project. If they would like to join
      the project, children will be randomly selected to take part in the group programme, or be
      given care-as-usual. The group programme involves the young person taking part in five weekly
      meetings, where they will learn skills to reduce their distress, and be supported to work
      through their difficult memories. Their carers will also take part in two meetings which will
      teach them how to support their young person.

    <description>Teaching Recovery Techniques is a 7-session group programme, with 5-sessions for the young person and 2-sessions for the carer. The carer sessions are focused on psychoeducation around trauma and PTSD, as well as skills for supporting a young person through the intervention and with PTSD symptoms more broadly. The young person sessions are primarily focused on skill building and include: psychoeducation and understanding intrusive memories; intrusive images, worries and dreams; arousal, emotions, relaxation and coping; avoidance and triggers; and, memories.</description>
