  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The analysis of human motion using radar has become an increasingly active topic of study due
      to the diverse applications offered by such an analysis (Lai et al., 2008; Fairchild &amp;
      Narayanan, 2016; Narayanan et al., 2014). Information about human motion has important
      applications for urban military operations, search-and-rescue missions, surveillance, and
      hospital patient monitoring. The micro-motions of human movement in the presence of radar
      illumination creates unique modulations in the received signal known as the micro-Doppler
      effect. By analyzing these frequency modulations, one can infer the type of movement being
      performed. This micro-motion associated with human movement produces a nonlinear and
      non-stationary signal that can be characterized using time-frequency domain analysis. Such
      signals will be used to identify high injury risk versus low injury risk athletes, which
      creates an opportunity to direct limited prevention resources to these high-risk athletes;
      identify individuals at risk of falls; and, may even be useful in diagnosing conditions such
      as Parkinson's where asymmetrical movement patterns occur as an early indicator.

      Traditional methods of movement analysis involve the use of expensive video motion capture
      systems that accurately measure the 3-dimensional position of passive reflective markers
      affixed to human body landmarks such as joints and body segments, and while motion capture
      systems are used to effectively estimate movement dynamics, they are generally not portable,
      they are expensive, and they can be cumbersome when the reflective markers are applied to
      older persons or persons with movement deficiencies. Drs. Narayanan and Onks have
      successfully tested a novel use of Doppler radar that is portable, less expensive, and
      eliminates the need for affixing cumbersome reflective markers to participants. In addition,
      preliminary testing has demonstrated the ability to discriminate between certain movement
      conditions at a level of precision we feel are not obtainable with video motion capture.
