      The purpose of this study is to apply the concept of rapid rehabilitation nursing in the
      perioperative period of knee arthroscopy, to make up for the gap in this field, to provide
      reference basis for the general colleagues, promote the development of perioperative rapid
      rehabilitation nursing of knee arthroscopy, accelerate the rehabilitation of patients.

      This study aims to apply rapid rehabilitation nursing concept to the arthroscopic
      perioperative nursing, used to make up for the blank in this field, provides the reference
      for the overwhelming majority of peer, prompt the arthroscopic perioperative rehabilitation
      nursing development, accelerate the patient rehabilitation in January 2020 - December 2020 in
      Beijing a third rate sports medicine hospital be in hospital, to line the arthroscopic
      surgery patients as the research object, adopt the method of prospective, randomized,
      controlled in 220 patients. Inclusion criteria: &lt; 60 age 18 years old, patients with informed
      consent and voluntary participation in arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
      under external anesthesia were excluded from this study: patients with mental system diseases
      or communication disorders; Patients with metabolic diseases such as diabetes; Patients who
      could not quit smoking and drinking alcohol before surgery as required; Patients with
      gastrointestinal tract disease research object were randomly divided into experimental group
      and control group, control group given conventional perioperative nursing, the experimental
      group to implement rapid rehabilitation program, the specific implementation process, see
      table 1 and table 2, compare two groups of preoperative postoperative self-care ability score
      (Barthel index) 、 the degree of postoperative pain numerical rating scale (NRS 0-10 score)
      、the degree of comfort (Likert 1-5 rating score) and rehabilitation completion -Range of
      motion(ROM) score difference; The safety index was the occurrence of postoperative
      complications such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache and urinary retention, and the
      occurrence of postoperative complications such as hypothermia after lower extremity deep
      venous thrombosis (preoperative and postoperative comparison of erythrocyte sedimentation
      rate(ESR)、C-reactive protein（CRP） and procalcitonin indexes in blood routine

    <intervention_model_description>The subjects were randomly divided into the experimental group and the control group. The control group received conventional rehabilitation nursing during the perioperative period, while the experimental group received ERAS intervention. The differences between the two groups in postoperative pain degree (NRS0-10) comfort level (Likert 1-5) and rehabilitation completion Range of motion(ROM) score were compared. The safety index was the occurrence of postoperative complications such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache and urinary retention, and the occurrence of postoperative complications such as hypothermia after lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (preoperative and postoperative comparison of ESR CRP and procalcitonin indexes in blood routine)</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Barthel Index:Barthel index is scored from 0 to 100. A score of 100 indicates that the patient has a good function in basic daily activities. He/she does not need help from others. He/she is able to control urine and urine, eat, dress, transfer to bed and chair, bathe, walk for at least one block, and can go up and down stairs. A score of 0 indicates poor functioning, lack of independence, and need help with all aspects of daily life. According to the score of Barthel index, the ability of daily activities was divided into three levels: good, medium and poor &gt;. 60 was classified as good. 60 to 41 is medium. Have moderate dysfunction and need great help to complete daily activities; ≤40 is classified as poor, with severe dysfunction, most daily activities cannot be completed or need to be attended to by others.</description>
