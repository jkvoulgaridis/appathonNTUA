      1. Determination the prevalence of Entamoeba histolytica infections among patients at
           Assiut University Hospitals presented with diarrhea/dysentery.

        2. Evaluatation the role of different cultures in diagnosing Entamoeba .

        3. Molecularly differentiation between Entamoeba species to monitor the true prevalence of
           E.histolytica .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Entamoeba histolytica is a common pathogenic protozoan widely distributed throughout the
      world (10% of the world's population), with 50,000-100,000 deaths reported annually(1) .It is
      a health problem both in Egypt and worldwide (2) The disease is more prevalent in densely
      populated areas with poor hygiene requirements and lacking sanitary water supply, especially
      in rural areas(3). It causes many digestive complications including diarrhea , and fever(2).
      it transmits through bloodstream forming abscesses in the brain, eye, liver and other vital
      organs and tissues or even lead to death in some cases . Some individuals have no symptom of
      the disease but transmit the infection to others(4) It is well- established that E.
      histolytica leads to invasive disease in humans. Although both E. dispar and E. moshkovskii
      are still considered to be non pathogenic and free-living amoebas, respectively, some reports
      suggest their potential role in provoking disease in humans (5) Cysts of E.dispar ,
      E.moshkovskii and E.hartmanni can be confused with E.histolytica. cysts in the
      parasitological examination(6) The molecular assays, is preferable as it detects E.
      histolytica , differentiates it from other species and monitors its true prevalence for
      better treatment and effective control (2)
