  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A cluster randomized controlled study was carried out in chronic psychiatric wards of a
      general hospital in central Taiwan. Sixty-eight eligible male individuals admitted to 2 wards
      were randomly assigned to an experimental and a control group. Participants in the
      experimental group underwent an oral health promotion program that consisted of biweekly
      group education sessions, and a 12-week individual behavioral modification for oral hygiene
      course. The participants in the control group received usual care only. Dental plaque
      (measured by the Plaque Control Index) was examined by a single dentist before and after the
      experiment.

    <description>Plaque Control Index (PCI) developed by O'Leary et al. to score the primary outcome, plaque accumulation, on the surfaces of the teeth. The score was computed by the existence of plaque divided by all examined surfaces; a higher plaque index indicated poor oral hygiene. We calculated a person-level plaque score by averaging plaque scores for all teeth at each examination.</description>
