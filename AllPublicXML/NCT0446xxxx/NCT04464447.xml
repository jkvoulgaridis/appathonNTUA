  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent and impairing functional somatic syndromes (FSS) are common in adolescents. Despite
      a high need for care, empirically supported treatments are lacking for youth. The aim of the
      uncontrolled was to assess feasibility and treatment potential of group-based Acceptance and
      Commitment Therapy (ACT) in a generic treatment approach for adolescents with multiple FSS
      i.e. &quot;ACT for Health in Adolescents&quot; (AHEAD).

    <description>The treatment &quot;ACT for Health in Adolescents&quot; (AHEAD) is an ACT-based Group intervention consisting of 9 modules (27 hours in total) delivered over a period of 3 months, with a follow-up meeting (3 hours) 3 months after the last module. Six to eight patients participate in each treatment Group. An information meeting (3 hours) for close relatives is held at the beginning of the Group treatment and the adolescents and their parents were invited to a 1Â½-hour individual consultation after the 8th module.</description>
