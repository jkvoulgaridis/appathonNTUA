  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Use HeprAN ™ membrane (coated with heparin) should be allow the success of dialysis sessions,
      with adequate dialysis parameters, in patients treated by long-term anticoagulation with VKA,
      without addition of heparin perdialytic.

      Less use of heparin (UFH or LMWH) during hemodialysis session should be allow a decrease of
      bleedings (moderate or major) and blood transfusions for hemodialysed patients with HeprAN ™
      membrane and treated by long-term anticoagulation with VKA

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim will be to study possibility of hemodialysis sessions success, without perdialytic
      anticoagulation but with adequate dialysis parameters (defined by the patient's Kt / V
      machine), in patients treated by long-term anticoagulation with VKA and dialysed with the
      HeprAN ™ membrane.

    <description>Failure is defined by
early interruption of the dialysis session (&lt;95% of the prescribed time) for :
extracorporeal circuit coagulation
recurrent venous pressure alarm causing blood pump shutdown or
Lower quality of dialysis compared to the quality before stopping perdialytic anticoagulation (defined as Kt/V less than - 2SD for 3 consecutive sessions)</description>
