  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, masked, active-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study that will
      assess the efficacy of ILUVIEN as a baseline therapy in the treatment of Center Involving DME
      (CI-DME). The study will enroll patients who are either treatment naïve or have not received
      any DME treatments for the preceding 12 months as documented in medical records. Patients who
      received DME treatment &gt;12 months before screening, must not have received &gt;4 intravitreal
      injections. The study will compare 2 treatment regimens: ILUVIEN intravitreal implant (0.19
      mg) followed by supplemental aflibercept as needed per protocol criteria (2 mg/0.05 mL),
      compared to intravitreal aflibercept loading dose (2 mg administered by intravitreal
      injection every 4 weeks for 5 consecutive doses) followed by supplemental aflibercept as
      needed per protocol criteria (2 mg/0.05 mL).
