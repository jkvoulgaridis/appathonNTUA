      High incidence rate of knee osteoarthritis and gait analysis are important for early
      assessment of biomechanics. ACL injury is an ideal clinical model for studying knee
      osteoarthritis.

      To clarify the mechanism between the biomechanical status of knee joint and the change of
      gait touch information, and to provide scientific basis for quantifying and evaluating the
      biomechanical status of knee joint in dynamic load-bearing state.

      The purpose of this study is to identify the characteristics of the disease, diagnose the
      disease by computer and evaluate the rehabilitation based on gait touch information after ACL
      rupture and reconstruction, combined with the methods of multi-body dynamics, machine
      learning and biomechanics analysis. Methods: 55 healthy volunteers, 55 patients with ACL
      rupture were recruited. Three dimensional gait analysis and dynamic plantar pressure were
      used to test the kinematic and dynamic data of lower limbs and gait touch information when
      walking, jogging, stopping and jumping, and running side cutting.

      Outcome evaluation indexes and statistical methods:

      the following indexes were measured repeatedly by two factor ANOVA method, and the left and
      right sides and different rehabilitation time were used as the variables of repeated
      measurement: the biomechanics of the lower limb joint and the change of the biological
      characteristics of gait touch information were analyzed. To study the biomechanical status of
      different knee joints and the mechanism of the change of gait touch information. Finally,
      based on the information of gait touch, a biomechanical evaluation model of knee joint during
      walking or jogging is established, which provides the exact basis for quantifying and
      evaluating the biomechanical state of knee joint under the dynamic load-bearing state of gait
      touch information.
