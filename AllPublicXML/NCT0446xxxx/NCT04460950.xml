  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Observational study aimed at evaluating the incidence of familial AML/MDSs in patients with
      de novo MDSs or AML with almost one relative affected by hematologic neoplasms and/or other
      cancers at young age (&lt; 40 years)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, retrospective and prospective, observational study aims to collect
      clinical information on patients with familial AML/MDSs from January 2014 to December 2022.
      No intervention is expected.

      The purpose of this study is to identify and characterize the patients with familial MDSs or
      AML (i.e. with relatives affected by hematologic neoplasms and/or other cancers at young age
      (&lt; 40 years)) or presence of signs, symptoms or laboratory tests compatible with one of the
      known syndromes with germinal susceptibility to AML/MDSs.

      In order to estimate the incidence of familial AML/MDSs, a survey will be sent every year to
      all participating sites to collect only the number of the all diagnosis of AML/MDS. All
      patients will be followed until December 2023 in order to have at least 1 year of
      observation.

        family member of first or second degree affected by myeloid neoplasm or other hematological
        malignancy, or by solid tumors with onset at age &lt; 40 years.
