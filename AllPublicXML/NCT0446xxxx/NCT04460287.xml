  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants and young children have high nutritional demands in order to support adequate growth
      and development, particularly during the transition from complementary feeding at 12 months
      of age to a mixed and varied diet at 36 months of age. Omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated
      fatty acid (n-3 LC-PUFA) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) is the important
      constituents of the maturing brain, especially for visual and cognitive development. However
      only certain foods, such as fatty fish, contain n-3 LC-PUFA at concentrations sufficient for
      their needs. Additionally, these foods that are known to be rich in DHA may not be regularly
      provided to infants and toddlers due to concerns about potential food allergies or
      methylmercury exposure.

      Although the importance of consuming n-3 LC-PUFA and essential fatty acids at the level of
      dietary recommendations in late infancy and early childhood (6-24 months) are highlighted,
      the current median n-3 LC-PUFA and estimated DHA intakes in toddlers in most countries are
      lower than the recommended levels. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommend that
      infants and young children (&lt; 24 months) should consume 100 mg of DHA per day, while for
      older children (2-18 years), they recommend a daily intake of 250 mg. In order to bridge the
      gap between the current intake and recommended levels of n-3 LC-PUFA, general foods,
      especially infant and toddler formulas, should be enriched with n-3 LC-PUFA particularly DHA.
      With a growing body of research, the challenge is to find an ideal formula that is
      nutritionally balanced and human milk-like, especially with respect to the ratio between
      omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids and DHA level.

      In adding DHA into the toddler formula, there are several methods, among others are in the
      form of wet mix and dry blending. The aim of this study is to compare the bioavailability of
      different methods of adding DHA (dry blend versus wet mix) into formulas in healthy
      Indonesian toddlers age 2-3 years old for a period of one month. Furthermore, to evaluate the
      stability of milk-based formulas that are supplemented with DHA under same storage
      conditions, so as to monitor the stability of infant formula.

      This study will use two phase approaches Phase 1, screening habitual n3 intake. Mothers of
      healthy toddlers, non-fish or non-n3 supplement babies (aged 2-3 years old) would be invited
      to complete a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) to determine their habitual dietary intake
      of long chain n3 fatty acids. The 120 babies with the lowest long chain n3 intake would be
      invited to proceed to phase 2 of the trial.

      Phase 2, double blinded, randomized trial. Based on the outcome of the FFQ in phase 1 of the
      proposed trial, the 120 babies with the lowest habitual dietary intake will be allocated to
      diet in a random order for one month. Blood samples will be collected via dry blood spot kits
      at the start, middle and end of the diet along with faecal collection every day.

      Groups are Milk drink unfortified (negative control), Milk drink unfortified plus fish oil
      (positive control), Milk drink fortified with DHA used wet mixing method and Milk drink
      fortified with DHA used dry blending method.

      Population and subjects are Indonesian children aged 2-3 years old living in Jakarta will be
      selected if they meet the study criteria.

      For stage-1: to get 50% of children having habitual low DHA intake, with degree of
      significance 5% and degree of reliability 95%, then 385 children will be needed.

      For stage-2: This study will include 30 subjects per-study group
