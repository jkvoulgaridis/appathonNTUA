  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided prostate biopsy is a gold standard method widely used in
      the diagnosis of prostate cancer. This procedure can be very painful and anxious for men.
      Various pharmacological methods can be used to relieve patients' pain and discomfort during
      TRUS-guided prostate biopsy. Although there is still no consensus on the solution suggestions
      for pain and anxiety due to biopsy, it is known that music, which is a non-pharmacological
      method, is effective in this regard. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of music
      with structured verbal training on patients' pain, anxiety and satisfaction levels during
      transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although there have been several studies examining the effect of music on pain and / or
      anxiety during TRUS prostate biopsy, only one study has been found examining the effect of
      stress management (music and one-to-one simulation training) on patients' pain and anxiety
      levels. In addition, there is only one study on the effectiveness of the training method
      (written and video-based training) on anxiety levels of patients related to prostate biopsy.
      For this reason, it is thought that music will be more effective on pain and anxiety levels
      along with structured verbal training to alleviate the discomfort associated with patients'
      biopsy procedure.

    <description>The average score change on pain intensity as measured by Visual Analog Scale. This scale is an unidimensional measure commonly used to measure pain intensity. The scale is a measuring tool with length of 0-10 cm (0-100 mm). High scores on the scale indicate that pain intensity is high.</description>
