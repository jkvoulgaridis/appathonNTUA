  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the updated Model WA-NG telescope
      prosthesis (hereafter WA-NG telescope), an injectable telescope device, in patients with
      bilateral moderate to profound central vision impairment due to end-stage age-related macular
      degeneration.

      Patients will be screened for eligibility and informed consent will be obtained from those
      who meet screening criteria and are interested in participating in the study. Eligible
      patients will be examined preoperatively to obtain a medical history and to establish a
      baseline for ocular condition.

      Postoperatively, patients will undergo ophthalmic evaluation at regular intervals as
      specified in this protocol.

    <description>The WA-NG telescope prosthesis is the next generation telescopic implantable device which, when combined with the optics of the cornea, constitutes a telephoto system for improvement of visual acuity in patients with severe to profound vision impairment due to bilateral, end-stage age-related macular degeneration. The device is implanted in one of the patient's eyes. In this way, the implanted eye provides central vision and the non-implanted eye can continue to provide peripheral vision.</description>

        **The following Inc. &amp; Exc. are sample and not completed list **

        Main Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with bilateral, stable, moderate to profound central vision impairment due to
             bilateral central scotoma associated with end-stage macular degeneration, defined as
             retinal findings of bilateral, geographic atrophy or disciform scar with foveal
             involvement.

          -  Patients must have distance BCVA between 20/80 and 20/800, and adequate peripheral
             vision in one eye (the non-implanted eye) to allow navigation

          -  Patients must achieve at least a five letter improvement on the ETDRS chart in the eye
             scheduled for surgery, with the external telescope simulator (ETS)

          -  Patients must be available for the study duration of 12 months

          -  Patients must be alert, mentally competent, and able to understand and comply with the
             requirements of the clinical trial, and be personally motivated to abide by the
             requirements and restrictions of the clinical trial.

        Main Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of active CNV on fluorescein angiography or treatment for CNV within the past
             six months.

          -  Patients who may require fellow eye cataract extraction and intraocular lens
             implantation during the 12 months following WA-NG telescope implantation. If fellow
             eye cataract extraction is anticipated, this procedure should be performed at least 30
             days prior to enrollment in the clinical study.

          -  Patients who have had or are expected to have ophthalmic related surgery within the 30
             days preceding implantation of the device.

          -  Patients who have undergone previous intraocular or corneal surgery of any kind in the
             operative eye(s), including any type of surgery for either refractive or therapeutic
             purposes.

          -  Patients participating in any other ophthalmic drug or device clinical trial during
             the time of this clinical investigation
