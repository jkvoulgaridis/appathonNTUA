      Summary:

      Main Objective: to evaluate the efficacy of pelvic gonadal vein embolization with coils in
      treatment of pelvic congestion syndrome Methods: retrospective study included 25 patients in
      the University hospital of Brest.

      The Primary Outcome Measure: To evaluate (to measure) pain relief using visual analogous
      scale (VAS) before and after gonadal vein embolization for pelvic congestion syndrome The
      Secondary Outcome Measures were to assess the impact of the treatment on specific and general
      symptoms through a survey.

      A retrospective, non-invasive monocentric study of our Hospital 10-year registry (including
      data on MRI angiography and Vascular Doppler Ultrasound) of patients who have already
      undergone coil embolization of pelvic gonadal vein in treatment of pelvic congestion
      syndrome. These patients will be contacted by phone to participate in the study. An
      information letter will be handed out and the study protocol will be explained to the
      patients. After obtaining their written consent, they will be asked to fill out the study's
      validated questionnaire at home and return it to us through pre-paid regular mail. A face to
      face interview with the patient will be scheduled to assess the correlation between patient's
      clinical symptoms and survey results. There will be no change in patient's routine follow-up
      care.

      All physician investigators of the study are experts in their field of medicine (e.g.
      interventional MRI angiography, vascular disease).
