  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is designed to test the feasibility of a new intervention, CAPABLE
      Transitions. CAPABLE Transitions is based on the Community Aging in Place, Advancing Better
      Living for Elders (CAPABLE) intervention designed by Dr. Sarah Szanton at Johns Hopkins
      University. Similar to CAPABLE, CAPABLE Transitions consists of an occupational therapy
      (OT)-led intervention in which the study OT, nurse, and handyman deliver an in-home
      intervention over 3-4 months. This intervention is designed to help with the transition of
      care from the skilled nursing facility to home as well as to optimize functioning and home
      safety. This clinical study plans to recruit a total of 48 older adults admitted to a home
      health agency following discharge from a skilled nursing facility. Given that this is a
      feasibility study, it is not designed or powered to test hypotheses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is a randomized, care-as-usual (CAU)-comparator, unblinded clinical trial of
      an occupational therapy (OT)-led in-home intervention designed to help older adults
      successfully return to and remain in their homes following skilled nursing facility (SNF)
      discharge. This intervention is called CAPABLE Transitions. In total, 48 adults (24 in the
      intervention arm, 24 in the CAU arm) aged 65 years and older recently discharged from a
      post-acute SNF stay and admitted to a Medicare-certified home health agency (CHHA) will be
      recruited. Study recruitment will occur over three waves, which will enable enhancement and
      optimization of the study protocol and procedures in-between recruitment waves. This pilot
      study's main outcomes relate to the feasibility of the study. These outcomes include study
      recruitment and retention, fidelity to and perceived benefit of the intervention, and data
      completeness with regard to clinical outcomes (e.g., home time, quality of life, and health
      care utilization).

      The study nurse will regularly screen all of her CHHA intakes to identify study participants.
      This study will recruit English-speaking adults aged 65 years and older who live in the City
      of Rochester and are admitted to a CHHA following a post-acute SNF stay. There are two
      treatment groups. The intervention group will receive CAPABLE Transitions as well as CHHA CAU
      services. The CAU group will receive CHHA CAU services, which can include nursing, health
      aide, medical social work, and occupational, physical, and speech therapy services. CHHA
      clinicians will determine the types and duration of CHHA services that the study participants
      receive; these services will be completely independent from the research study.

      Assessment interviews will be conducted at baseline as well as at three and six month
      follow-up. Interviews will assess sociodemographics, health and functioning, mental health
      and cognitive functioning, home environment, medical services use, and intervention feedback.
      Information also will be extracted on medical conditions, medications, communication with
      providers, and services utilization from participants' medical records.

Rating: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression, each with 1 as lowest score and 5 as highest score: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems, where higher scores indicate worse outcome.
The EQ VAS question records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine' out of 100. Therefore higher scores may indicate better outcomes.</description>
