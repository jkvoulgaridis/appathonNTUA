  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, single-dose phase I study to investigate the absorption,
      metabolism and excretion of [14C] D-0316 in healthy Chinese male subjects. The study will be
      conducted into two steps：Firstly, 2 subjects are enrolled in to participate in the pilot
      study to grope for the completion date of plasma, urine and feces sampling on the 3rd day
      post-dose and onwards. Then, the collection time of blood and excreta samples (urine and
      feces) from the subsequent 2-4 subjects will be adjusted according to the pilot study

      Subjects who had signed informed consent and meet inclusion criteria and no exclusion
      criteria are admitted to Phase I Clinical Unit two days prior to dosing (D-2). On the morning
      of Day 1 before dosing, subjects will be transferred to nuclear medical ward. And after an
      overnight fast of at least 10 h, subjects will receive a single oral dose of 75 mg (50 μCi)
      of [14C]D-0316 as an oral suspension. Then, after two days of the dosing, subjects will be
      transferred back to Phase I Clinical Unit ward and confined to this unit until blood or
      excreta sampling and safety monitoring at the designated time points or intervals are
      complete
