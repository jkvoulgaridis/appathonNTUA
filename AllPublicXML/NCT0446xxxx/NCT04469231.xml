    <textblock>
      A multicenter, prospective, non-randomized, historically controlled study. Demonstrate the
      Synergy Disc is at least as safe and effective as conventional anterior cervical discectomy
      and fusion (ACDF) to treat cervical degenerative disc disease (DDD) in subjects who are
      symptomatic at only one level from C3 to C7 that are unresponsive to conservative management.
      Patients will be evaluated preoperatively, at the time of surgery, and at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12,
      and 24 months after surgery. Follow-up will continue annually until the last patient reaches
      24-month follow-up. The primary analysis will occur at 24 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed investigation is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center, historically
      controlled comparison of the Synergy Disc to the control of conventional anterior cervical
      discectomy and fusion (ACDF) surgery in patients with cervical DDD. A total of 175 patients
      will be enrolled to the investigational group not including approximately 15 training cases.
      The investigational group results will be compared to a historical control data from the ACDF
      control group, which utilized an identical study design. A statistically rigorous
      observational study design using propensity score (PS) subclassification will be used to
      demonstrate covariate balance and enhance the quality of inferences regarding effectiveness
      and safety relative to ACDF control. After investigational device enrollment is complete, but
      before most investigational device subjects have reached their 24-month endpoint, a data set
      containing only baseline covariates of prospectively enrolled investigational device patients
      and historical ACDF control patients will be constructed. The propensity score methods
      detailed below will be implemented by an outcomes-blinded statistician. A Propensity Score
      Memo summarizing the proposed observational design will be developed and submitted for review
      by stakeholders including FDA. The outcomes-blinded statistician will remain blinded until
      after consensus is achieved that the design is acceptable. This will allow for additional
      outcomes-blinded PS modeling if required. The objective of this clinical trial is to
      demonstrate the Synergy Disc is at least as safe and effective as conventional ACDF to treat
      cervical DDD in subjects who are symptomatic at only one level from C3 to C7 that are
      unresponsive to conservative management.

    <description>The Synergy Disc is a cervical disc prosthesis that can be inserted between C3-C7 in skeletally mature patients after anterior discectomy to provide restoration of motion to the functional spinal unit. The Synergy Disc is designed to restoring kinematics to the cervical spine. The Synergy Disc is intended for use in the cervical spine for reconstruction of the disc following a single level discectomy for intractable radiculopathy and/or myelopathy.</description>

             worker's compensation related litigation is not a required exclusion.
