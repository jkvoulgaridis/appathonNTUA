      A single arm clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of the second generation TEVG
      as vascular conduits for extracardiac total cavopulmonary connection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This investigation is a prospective, open-labeled clinical trial determining the safety of
      the use of tissue engineered vascular grafts as conduits for EC TCPC. Patients will be
      monitored for adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE). Special attention will be
      paid to the incidence of stenosis. We will determine graft-related morbidity and mortality
      for the second generation TEVGs which will include any post-operative complication such as
      any aneurismal dilation, stenosis, thromboembolic or infectious event that requires treatment
      and is thought to be caused by the graft as determined by the investigators and confirmed by
      the data safety monitoring board. The graft related complication rates will be compared
      between the first and second generation TEVGs. An interim analysis will be performed to
      assess the incidence of early (&lt;6 month) graft-related complications in the first 6 enrolled
      patients. Safety and tolerability will be assessed through serial imaging, to determine the
      effect of growth and remodeling on graft performance through echocardiography and
      4-dimensional MRI. All appropriate patients requiring EC TCPC who meet study
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be evaluated for enrollment in the clinical trial. All
      enrolled subjects will be required to have follow-up visits at Nationwide Children's Hospital
      for a minimum of 2 years following implant. After obtaining informed consent for the
      patient's parents, patients with single ventricle cardiac anomalies will undergo EC TCPC
      using a tissue engineered conduit. Post-operative care and monitoring will follow an
      established, standardized, clinical algorithm in which the patient's clinical status
      including complications and measurements of graft function will be serially evaluated and
      recorded over a two year period using physical examination, echocardiography, and MRI.

    <ipd_description>Biological Samples: We plan to make available representative samples of the bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells and seeded scaffold to a NIH-designated entity (RM Innovation Catalyst) for in depth and independent characterization. Specifically, for each TEVG manufactured, 1 ml of bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells and a 5mm x 5mm section of the seeded scaffold will be sampled, packed, and transported to the RM Innovation Catalyst per their instructions. In addition, copies of the batch record and completed certificate of analysis will be forwarded to the NIH-designated laboratory.</ipd_description>

Every 6 months throughout the study, data will be shared with RM Innovation Catalyst, with a final locked data set no later than six months prior to the end of the award. Data from our long-term follow up policy will be made available on an annual basis if requested by the RM Innovation Catalyst or the NIH.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>De-identified data will be provided to RM Innovation Catalyst. A Clinical Study Report will be submitted to the US FDA following the International Conference on Harmonization E3 Guideline for Industry: Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports. Summary results of the trial will be submitted to ClinicalTrial.gov within one year of the primary completion date (per regulation and NIH policy). Results of screening tests and subjects participation in the study and ongoing test results will be shared with their primary care physician and/or primary cardiologist if cardiac care is being provided outside of Nationwide Children's Hospital.</ipd_access_criteria>
