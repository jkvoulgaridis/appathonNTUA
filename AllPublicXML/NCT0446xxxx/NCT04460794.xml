      To explore the feasibility of a novel ballet-inspired low-impact at-home workout programme
      for community-dwelling stroke survivors in Hong Kong.

      A mixed methods exploratory study incorporating a randomised controlled trial (RCT) and
      qualitative evaluation will be conducted. A total of 40 stroke participants will be recruited
      from two acute public hospitals. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the
      interention and usual care, or usual care only. Data will be collected in multiple forms:
      recruitment/retention rates, adherence to the intervention, journals, field notes, verbal
      feedback, audio records, semi-structured interviews, and questionnaires on outcomes (balance,
      confidence in balance, gait, walking endurance). This study is the first of its kind in Hong
      Kong. Findings will address the cross-cultural applicability of dance interventions and lay
      the groundwork for examination in a larger-RCT about its effects on survivors' balance, gait
      and memory.

    <description>The 14-item Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Mini-BESTest) will be used. It measures four domains: anticipatory postural adjustments, reactive postural control, sensory orientation, dynamic gait. Items are rated on a 3-level scale (0=&quot;Severe&quot;, 1=&quot;Moderate&quot;, 2=&quot;Normal&quot;). Summed total score=0-28 (higher scores representing better balance ability). Cronbach alpha=0.89-0.94.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline to immediately after completion of the intervention (over 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The 16-item Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale (Chinese version) will be adopted. Participants will rate their confidence in balance associated with performing 16 daily functional activities from 0% (absolutely no confidence) to 100% (fully confident). Summed total score=0-100% (higher scores denotes higher confidence). Cronbach alpha=0.97.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the participants' level of gait</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to immediately after completion of the intervention (over 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The 31-item Gait Assessment and Intervention tool (G.A.I.T.) will be used to measure gait: upper extremity and trunk movement control; trunk and lower extremity (stance phase); trunk and lower extremity (swing phase). Each item is scored from 0 (normal) to 3, with gradients of variation from normal (Total score: 0 (normal gait) to 62 (greatest extent of gait deviations)). It has good intra-rater and interrater reliability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in participants' level of walking endurance</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to immediately after completion of the intervention (over 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The 6-Minute Walk Test (MWT) will be performed in accordance with American Thoracic Society guidelines. The distance walked, the time stopped and reason(s) for stopping prematurely will be recorded. 6MWT, 12MWT, and self-paced gait speed were all significantly highly correlated (r&gt;0.90).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in participants' level of memory</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to immediately after completion of the intervention (over 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The 11-item Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test - Third Version (Chinese version) will be used. For each task, scores range from 0-2 (2-points=normal; 1-point=intermediate; 0-point=error). Total score=0-254. It demonstrated a high inter-rater reliability. Correlation between performance on parallel forms=0.67-0.84.</description>
