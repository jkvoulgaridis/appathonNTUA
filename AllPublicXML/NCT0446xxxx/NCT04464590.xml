  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the study, we aimed to characterize the role of FDG PET/CT surveillance at 12 months of
      malignant lymphoma in asymptomatic patients after a first complete remission and to define a
      rational follow-up strategy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most aggressive lymphomas are sensitive to first-line immunochemotherapy and are in first
      Complete Remission (CR) with initial therapy. CR significantly decreases the risk of
      recurrence and increases survival. However, a cure is not guaranteed and approximately one
      third of lymphoma patients have a relapse disease.

      FDG PET/CT is a valuable noninvasive tool in the evaluation of lymphomas, especially to
      differentiate viable lymphoma and fibrosis or necrosis in residual mass.

      The majority of relapses are diagnosed based on clinical symptoms reported by patients. And
      the role of FDG PET/CT for routine surveillance of patients after treatment is controversial.

      However, many medical centers use routine follow-up FDG PET/CT in addition to physical
      examination and laboratory analysis to detect subclinical relapse.

      Thus, we can imagine a good timing to routine FDG PET/CT when the tumor burden is small in
      the asymptomatic window.

      Survival improvement for relapse detected by routine follow-up imaging is not clearly
      established compared to diagnosis by clinical symptoms.

      Several studies tried to assess the value of follow-up FDG PET/CT but population, type,
      timing and duration of surveillance imaging was very heterogeneous.

        All patients were examined every 3 to 4 months during the first two years, then every 6
        months for three years, including physical examination and blood-test.

        One group (group 1) of patients received a systematic routine surveillance FDG PET/CT at 12
        months (PET/CT1y) according to hematologist team and the other group (group 2) did not
        receive routine follow-up FDG PET/CT at 12 months (non PET/CT1y).

        None patient was symptomatic the first year. A median follow-up of 24 months at the end of
        treatment was required.
