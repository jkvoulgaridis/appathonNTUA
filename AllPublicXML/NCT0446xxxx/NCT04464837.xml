  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) has become the third most common malignant tumor and is the second
      leading cause of cancer related deaths worldwide. Adenomatous polyps of the colon are
      possible precursor lesions for CRC. Screening for CRC has been shown effective in preventing
      CRC and related deaths, especially colonoscopy and resection of adenomatous polyps.
      Currently, for intermediate sized polyps 5 - 20 mm hot snare polypectomy (HSP) with the use
      of electrocautery is conventionally used, causing relevant adverse events including
      haemorrhage and postpolypectomy coagulation syndrome, but is safe regarding complete
      resection of the polyp due to burning effect on residual tissue. On the other hand, cold
      snare polypectomy (CSP) has grown popularity. Absence of electrocautery makes it technically
      easier and most important reduces adverse events. CSP is recommended as the preferred
      technique for polyps &lt;5 mm by the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE)
      guidelines. In literature, there is one multicenter trial from Japan recommending CSP for
      polyps 4-9 mm (average polyp size 5,4 mm) and only a few case studies for polyps 10-15 mm
      with inconsistent results, especially regarding the complete resection and pathological
      evaluation of the specimen.

      In this feasibility trial, the investigators try to find out if CSP with a new designed
      polypectomy snare is efficient and safe in terms of complete resection (R0), pathological
      evaluation and adverse events.
