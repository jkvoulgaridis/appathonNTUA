  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Millions of patients die of cancer every year. There are several methods to treat cancer,
      including surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy. Recently, hyperthermia
      therapy started playing a role in cancer therapy. It has shown effect in animal experiments
      and clinical practice. The sponsor has developed a novel device to use hyperthermia for
      advanced cancer. This study is to prove the safety in human patients of this device &amp; therapy
      and get the first data on efficacy.
