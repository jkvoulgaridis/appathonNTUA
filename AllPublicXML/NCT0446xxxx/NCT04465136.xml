    <textblock>
      The study aimed to investigate whether cranial electrotherapy stimulation(CES) could benefit
      anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, quality of sleep and quality of life in elderly
      patients with anxiety disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) could decrease depression
      and anxiety symptoms in patients with mood disorder. However, none study so far focused on
      the elderly population to investigate the anti-depressant and anxiolytic effect in elderly
      patient with anxiety disorder. Hence, this pilot study aims to assess the safety and efficacy
      of CES on anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, sleep quality and life quality in elderly
      patient with anxiety disorder. The study was an open-label, one arm study. The study aimed to
      investigate whether cranial electrotherapy stimulation(CES) could benefit anxiety symptoms,
      depressive symptoms, quality of sleep and quality of life in elderly patients with anxiety
      disorder.

    <description>evaluate the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) for objective anxiety Each item is scored on a scale of 0 (not present) to 4(severe), with a total score range of 0-56, where &lt;17 indicates mild severity, 18-24 mild to moderate severity and 25-30 moderate to severe.</description>

    <measure>The change of subjective anxiety symptom from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>1.Change from baseline BAI score after the 3rd session, the 6th session, and the 9th session of CES treatment, immediately. 2.Change from baseline BAI score after 3 weeks after the completion of full treatment course</time_frame>
    <description>evaluate the Beck anxiety inventory (BAI) for subjective anxiety The BAI contains 21 questions, each answer being scored on a scale value of 0 (not at all) to 3 (severely). Higher total scores indicate more severe anxiety symptoms. The standardized cutoffs are: 0-7: minimal anxiety; 8-15: mild anxiety; 16-25: moderate anxiety; 26-63: severe anxiety.</description>

    <measure>The change of objective depressive symptom from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>1.Change from baselineHAM-D score after the 3rd session, the 6th session, and the 9th session of CES treatment, immediately. 2.Change from baseline HAM-D score after 3 weeks after the completion of full treatment course</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) for objective anxiety The Ham-D is the most widely used clinician-administered depression assessment scale. The original version contains 17 items pertaining to symptoms of depression experienced over the past week. A score of 0-7 is generally accepted to be within the normal range (or in clinical remission), while a score of 20 or higher (indicating at least moderate severity) is usually required for entry into a clinical trial.</description>

    <measure>The change of subjective depressive symptom from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>1.Change from baseline BDI-II score after the 3rd session, the 6th session, and the 9th session of CES treatment, immediately. 2.Change from baseline BDI-II score after 3 weeks after the completion of full treatment course</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the Beck depression inventory-II (BDI-II) for subjective anxiety the BDI-II contains 21 questions, each answer being scored on a scale value of 0 to 3. Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms. The standardized cutoffs used differ from the original: 0-13: minimal depression 14-19: mild depression 20-28: moderate depression 29-63: severe depression.</description>

    <measure>The change of quality of life from baseline: Brief version of World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF)</measure>
    <time_frame>1.Change from baseline WHOQOL-BREF score after the 3rd session, the 6th session, and the 9th session of CES treatment, immediately. 2.Change from baseline WHOQOL-BREF score after 3 weeks after the completion of full treatment course</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the &quot;Brief version of World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire - Taiwan version&quot; for quality of life. The WHOQOL-BREF produces a quality of life profile. It is possible to derive four domain scores. Each item is weighted on a 0-4 interval scale. The WHOQOL-BREF score is then calculated by totaling the 4 domain scores. The calculation method of the scores in a certain domain is: (summation of the scores in each domain) x 4 / (number of items in a category). The adjusted scores of each domain are as low as 4 points and as high as 20 points. The overall score ranges from 16 to 80, where higher scores denote a higher life quality.</description>

    <measure>The change of quality of sleep from baseline: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1.Change from baseline PSQI score after the 3rd session, the 6th session, and the 9th session of CES treatment, immediately. 2.Change from baseline PSQI score after 3 weeks after the completion of full treatment course</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for quality of sleep Consisting of 19 items, the PSQI measures several different aspects of sleep, offering seven component scores and one composite score. The component scores consist of subjective sleep quality, sleep latency (i.e., how long it takes to fall asleep), sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency (i.e., the percentage of time in bed that one is asleep), sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction.
Each item is weighted on a 0-3 interval scale. The global PSQI score is then calculated by totaling the seven component scores, providing an overall score ranging from 0 to 21, where lower scores denote a healthier sleep quality.</description>

    <description>CES is a brain stimulation device with 2 electrodes on the bilateral earlobe. It uses Alternating current to stimulate the brain including thalamus, vagus nerve system and influence EEG and neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyrate. Stimulation was applied at a current intensity that can be adjusted continuously to provide between 10 and 600 micro-ampere and frequency of 0.5Hertz for 60 minutes, 3 days per week for 3 weeks, total 9 sessions.</description>
