  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Male circumcision is one of the oldest and most common operations performed all
      over the world. It can be performed at different ages, using different surgical techniques,
      for different religious, cultural and medical reasons. It was thought that the newborn baby
      does not experience pain because of incompletely developed nervous system. However, it has
      been shown that neurological system known to be associated with pain transmission and
      modulation, is intact and functional.

      OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to determine if a 30% glucose solution would reduce pain after
      circumcision compared with normal saline.

      STUDY DESIGN: This is a randomized placebo-controlled double-blinded clinical trial.

      POPULATION: We will include full term neonates, who will be recruited from the inpatient
      nursery at Makassed General Hospital over a 1-year period.

      OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome is to assess efficacy of 30% glucose on pain measured
      using the Neonatal Infant Pain Score.

      Secondary outcome is to assess effect of 30% glucose oh physiologic parameters
