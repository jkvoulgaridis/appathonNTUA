      Objective: To determine the effect of respiratory exercise on some physiological parameters,
      sleep quality and fitness in elderly individuals. Method: The pre-post-test was completed
      with randomised controlled, experimental study with 26 elderly individuals in the
      intervention group and 25 in the control group. In the study, stratified randomisation method
      was used considering age and gender. To elderly individuals in the intervention group; for
      three months, three days a week, 30 minutes at the same time of the day respiratory exercise
      was applied (pursed-lip breathing exercise, deep breathing exercise, coughing exercise). No
      attempt was made to the control group. Data were collected with the Pittsburg Sleep Quality
      Index, Subjective Vitality Scale, pulmonary function test, sphygmomanometer and pulse
      oximetry device. In the evaluation of the data, independent sample t- test, paired-sample
      t-test and two way repeated measures ANOVA were used data.

      Study design The study was conducted in a pre-test- post-test, randomised controlled
      (parallel) and experimental design.

      Study population and sample The study population consisted of 294 individuals residing in a
      nursing home. The sample size was calculated using the GPower 3.1.9.4 program considering the
      results of similar studies in literature, and a total of 52 individuals were found to be
      adequate with a 0.05 margin of error and an 80% test power. The study was completed with 26
      individuals in the intervention group and 25 individuals in the control group

      Randomisation Study participants were stratified by age (65-74 years, and ≥75 years) and
      gender (female- male). Then participant assigned to experiment and control groups via simple
      randomisation method using the computer-based SPSS program. Neither study participants nor
      breathing exercise trainers were blinded in the study. However, the respiratory function
      tests were evaluated by an independent physiotherapist, and randomisation, statistical
      analyses and reporting were performed by an independent statistician.

      Implementation steps Pre-test: The pre-test measurements were performed by the researcher and
      a physiotherapy specialist at the physical therapy unit of the nursing home. First Pittsburgh
      Sleep Quality Index and then Subjective Vitality Scale were administered in order to avoid
      the effect of measurements on the data. After participants were given time to rest,
      cardiological parameters and finally, pulmonary functions were assessed. A manual
      sphygmomanometer and a pulse oximeter were used to assess the cardiac functions (blood
      pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation). A spirometer was used to assess pulmonary functions
      (FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio and percentages). The results were delivered to the researcher by
      the authorised representative of the spirometer in pdf format within 15 days. All other data
      were recorded by the researcher after measurement.

      Implementation in the intervention group: This group of elderly were subjected to a
      pursed-lip breathing exercise (using a windmill toy), a diaphragmatic breathing exercise and
      a coughing exercise three times a week (Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays) for 12 weeks in
      groups of 5-6 individuals (2 groups of 6 persons, and 4 groups of 5 persons: 6 groups in
      total) between 10:00 and 15:30, at the same time of the day for each group in 30-minute
      sessions. All breathing exercises were taught to the elderly individuals on the first day of
      implementation and demonstrated again prior to practice by the researcher throughout the
      implementation phase. The elderly were informed about potential conditions such as dizziness
      that might occur during the breathing exercise and were reminded to take a short break in
      such case and wait until the dizziness was over.

      Implementation in the control group: None of the elderly in the control group were subjected
      to breathing exercises. They continued their daily lives as normal.

      Post-test: After one day of completing the breathing exercises; the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
      Index, the Subjective Vitality Scale and physiological parameters were recorded by following
      the same steps as in the pre-test implementation by the same physiotherapist and the
      researcher at the physical therapy unit. All data were recorded by the researcher in the same
      manner.

      Data assessment The study data were evaluated using the SPSS (Statistical Package for Social
      Sciences) 16.0 software. Data assessment was made using number, percentage, mean, standard
      deviation, and t-tests for dependent groups and paired samples t-test, and two-way analysis
      of variance for repeated measures. The level of significance was accepted as p&lt;0.05. The
      effect size was determined by Cohen's d value. A partial eta square (pη2) was used as the
      effect size while assessing the two-way analysis of variance.
