    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized, Phase 2 umbrella study of retifanlimab in
      participants who have advanced or metastatic endometrial cancer that has progressed on or
      after platinum-based chemotherapy. retifanlimab will be administered as monotherapy or in
      combination with other immunotherapy or targeted agents.
