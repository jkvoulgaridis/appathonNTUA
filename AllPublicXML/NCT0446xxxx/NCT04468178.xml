  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the clinical trial is to determine that the GLOBAL ICON implant system
      from DePuy does not exhibit worse shoulder function after 2 years than the SIMPLICITY from
      Wright Medical. The primary endpoint is the Constant-Murley Shoulder Score (CMSS) of the
      implant after 2 years, the non-inferiority of which is to be demonstrated in comparison with
      an already established prosthetic system (SIMPLICITY, Wright Medical).

      The primary goal of the clinical trial is to determine that the GLOBAL ICON implant system
      from DePuy does not exhibit worse shoulder function after 2 years than the SIMPLICITY from
      Wright Medical. The primary endpoint is the Constant-Murley Shoulder Score (CMSS) of the
      implant after 2 years, the non-inferiority of which is to be demonstrated in comparison with
      an already established prosthetic system (SIMPLICITY, Wright Medical).

      As secondary endpoints, the migration behavior of the humeral components over time will be
      determined by radiostereometric analysis (RSA), the further clinical-functional results and
      the satisfaction of the patients treated will be investigated. Clinical outcomes are measured
      using standardized and reproducible clinical scores (Oxford Shoulder Score -OSS and Short
      Form Health 36-SF-36 v1.0 ) at each time of examination.

      Other endpoints include revision rate within the follow-up period, surgical time (incision to
      suture), and delays in surgical procedures due to instrumentation.

      The times of data acquisition are the admission day before the operation to determine the
      preoperative status, the discharge day and the follow-up appointments after 3 months, 6
      months, 12 months and 24 months to determine the postoperative status and course.

    <description>The Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) is a 12-item patient-reported questionnaire specifically designed for assessing outcomes of shoulder surgery e.g. for assessing the impact on patients' quality of life of degenerative conditions such as arthritis and rotator cuff problems. Scores from each question are added so the overall score ranges from 12 to 60 with 12 being the best out-come.</description>

    <description>The Short Form (36) Health Survey is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health consisting of eight scaled scores. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Trial participants need primary total shoulder replacement due to primary
             osteoarthritis or post-traumatic osteoarthritis

          2. Trial participants are willing to take part in the clinical trial and intend to be
             available for the planned follow-up examinations.

          3. Male, female and various subjects with age on the day of surgery from 18 to 80 years
             inclusive.

             that are non-invasive and do not involve drug use are allowed.

          5. Exclusion of intraoperative circumstances that require the implantation of a
             prosthesis type other than that provided for in the clinical trial (depending on the
             surgeon).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous operation on the rotator cuff of the affected shoulder
