      Objective: To study the clinical effect of anatomical reconstruction of the posterolateral
      structure of the knee joint under arthroscopy.

      Methods: The patients who were admitted to hospital for the treatment of posterolateral
      structural injuries of the knee joint, including those with other ligament injuries (combined
      with anterior and posterior cruciate ligament injuries and medial collateral ligament
      injuries) were subjected to arthroscopic reconstruction of the posterolateral structures.
      Carry out preoperative and postoperative evaluations, and conduct preoperative and
      postoperative comparative studies to clarify the clinical effect of the procedure.

      Expected results: The anatomical reconstruction technique of the posterolateral structure of
      the knee joint under arthroscopy may effectively restore the stability and motor function of
      the knee joint.

      Expected conclusion: Arthroscopic anatomical reconstruction of the posterolateral structure
      of the knee is an effective minimally invasive technique.
