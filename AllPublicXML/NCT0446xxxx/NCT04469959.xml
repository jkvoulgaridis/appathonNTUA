      Late-Life Depression (LLD), or depression in older adults, often presents with motivational
      deficits, deficits in performance in cognitive domains including processing speed and
      executive dysfunction, and mobility impairments. This triad of findings implicate
      dopaminergic dysfunction as a core pathophysiologic feature in depression, and may contribute
      to cognitive decline and motor disability. Normal aging results in brain-wide dopamine
      declines, decreased D1/D2 receptor density, and loss of dopamine transporters. Although brain
      changes associated with depression and aging converge on dopamine circuits, the specific
      disturbances in LLD and how responsive the system is to modulation remain unclear. In this
      collaborative study between Columbia University /New York State Psychiatric Institute and
      Vanderbilt University Medical Center, investigators are testing integrative model that aging,
      in concert with pro-inflammatory shifts, decreases dopamine signaling. These signally changes
      affects behaviors supported by these circuits, in the context of age-associated cortical
      atrophy and ischemic microvascular changes, resulting in variable LLD phenotypes.
      Investigators propose a primary pathway where dopaminergic dysfunction in depressed elders
      contributes to slowed processing speed and mobility impairments that increase the effort cost
      associated with voluntary behavior. The central hypothesis of this study is that late-life
      depression is characterized by dysfunction in the dopamine system and, by enhancing dopamine
      functioning in the brain. By improving cognitive and motor slowing, administration of
      carbidopa/levodopa (L-DOPA) will improve depressive symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Late Life Depression (LLD) is a prevalent, disabling, and at times lethal condition for which
      currently available treatments are often ineffective. No prior study has comprehensively
      examined dopamine-dependent behaviors (i.e., reward processing, cognition, motor function) in
      LLD, and none has integrated positron emission tomography (PET), multimodal magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI), neuropsychological evaluation, and mobility assessments. Should
      cognitive and motor slowing result in altered effort-based decision making as researchers
      hypothesize, treatment development may shift from addressing mood and hedonic responses
      toward facilitating cognition and movement, reducing the effort cost of voluntary behavior,
      and promoting behavioral activation.

      This study at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) will enroll 60 evaluable elderly
      depressed outpatients with evidence of dopaminergic dysfunction, characterized as either
      slowed processing speed or slowed gait speed. To disentangle depression effects from
      age-related changes, 30 never-depressed elders also will complete baseline evaluation.
      Assessments include PET imaging of receptor density, neuromelanin-sensitive MRI (NM-MRI)
      measurement of nigrostriatal status, task-based MRI focused on effort-based decision making
      and reward processing, and comprehensive psychiatric, neurocognitive, and physical
      performance evaluation. Depressed participants then will be randomized to levodopa (L-DOPA)
      or placebo for 3 weeks, followed by repeat multimodal MRI and cognitive/behavioral
      assessments. In a cross-over phase, participants will receive the opposite intervention for
      an additional 3 weeks followed by clinical and cognitive assessments only. This mechanistic
      probe allows us to examine the contributions and interrelationships of dopamine-dependent
      processes in LLD and evaluate the responsivity of dopamine systems in LLD to pharmacological
      stimulation.

      To maximize ability to detect drug effects, researchers will combine data gathered at VUMC
      with data gathered in a comparable sample enrolled at Columbia University. The sample
      enrolled at Columbia University will complete overlapping but not identical baseline
      assessments, including different PET imaging. Columbia University will complete a similar
      crossover trial of L-DOPA.

      AIM 1: To characterize dopaminergic dysfunction in LLD at molecular, circuit, and behavioral
      levels.

      Hyp 1: Compared to age- and gender-matched controls on baseline functional MRI (fMRI), LLD
      participants will be less willing to expend effort for rewards and exhibit lower prefrontal
      cortex and striatal activation on the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT). Hyp 2:
      Across all participants, lower midbrain &amp; striatal [18F]-fallypride binding, and lower NM-MRI
      signal in the substantia nigra, pars compacta will predict lower performance across cognitive
      domains: Positive Valence (impaired willingness to expend effort, decreased neural
      activations on the EEfRT), Cognitive (slowed processing speed and executive dysfunction), and
      Sensorimotor (slowed gait speed). Hyp 3: Across all participants, slowed processing and gait
      speed likewise will predict lower willingness to expend effort on the EEfRT.

      AIM 2: To examine responsivity of dopamine circuits in LLD to stimulation with L-DOPA.

      Hyp 1: Compared to placebo, L-DOPA will result in greater normalization of neural activations
      and improved behavioral performance in Positive Valence, Cognitive, and Sensorimotor domains.
      Hyp 2: Baseline PET and NM-MRI measures will moderate L-DOPA effects. The greatest
      improvements will be observed in those with the lowest baseline [18F]-fallypride binding, and
      NM-MRI signal.

      Exploratory Aims: 1) To investigate associations of baseline proinflammatory markers with
      dopaminergic function across molecular, circuit, cognitive and behavioral levels of analysis.
      2) To evaluate the durability of L-DOPA effects on cognitive domains in the crossover phase.

    <description>This functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging task assesses neural response during reward anticipation and receipt. On each trial, participants are presented with a 2000msec cue indicating that trial's reward value ($0, $1, or $5). After the cue, a 2000-2500 msec delay period ensues as the participant waits for the target. Participants press a button as quickly as possible when the target is visible. After another delay lasting from 950 to 2800 msec, a feedback screen lasting 2500msec appears indicating the outcome (&quot;Hit!&quot; or &quot;Miss!&quot;) for each trial, with a brief interval before the next trial. the primary contrast for analyses is the contrast of Cue $5 - Cue $0 to brain activation during reward anticipation. The contrast of Hit vs. Miss on both $5 and $1 trials is the primary index of reward receipt.</description>

    <ipd_description>This study will include clinical, cognitive, and neuroimaging data from older depressed subjects. The final dataset will include clinical information about subject psychiatric diagnoses, psychiatric and medical history, cognitive data, and response to L-dopa . We will share data via the National Database for Clinical Trials related to Mental Illness (NDCT). NDCT provides a secure platform for data-sharing allowing for communication of research data, tools, and supporting documents. As required by NDCT, we will obtain a Global Unique Identifier (GUID) for each participant. We will additionally follow NDCT requirements to certify and review data, as well as timeline requirements for data submission and data sharing. Sharing of neuroimaging data will also be facilitated by an XNAT system (xnat.org). XNAT is an open-source informatics software platform that assists in the management and archiving of imaging data.</ipd_description>
