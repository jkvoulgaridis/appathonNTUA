      Introduction Rare complex syndromes Patients with complex genetic syndromes, by definition,
      have combined medical problems affecting multiple organ systems, and intellectual disability
      is often part of the syndrome. During childhood, patients with rare genetic syndromes receive
      multidisciplinary and specialized medical care; they usually receive medical care from 3-4
      medical specialists.

      Increased life expectancy Although many genetic syndromes used to cause premature death,
      improvement of medical care has improved life expectancy. More and more patients are now
      reaching adult age, and the complexity of the syndrome persists into adulthood. However,
      until recently, multidisciplinary care was not available for adults with rare genetic
      syndromes. Ideally, active and well-coordinated health management is provided to prevent,
      detect, and treat comorbidities that are part of the syndrome. However, after transition from
      pediatric to adult medical care, patients and their parents often report fragmented poor
      quality care instead of adequate and integrated health management. Therefore, pediatricians
      express the urgent need for adequate, multidisciplinary adult follow up of their pediatric
      patients with rare genetic syndromes.

      Medical guidelines for adults not exist and the literature on health problems in these adults
      is scarce. Although there is a clear explanation for the absence of adult guidelines (i.e.
      the fact that in the past patients with rare genetic syndromes often died before reaching
      adult age), there is an urgent need for an overview of medical issues at adult age, for 'best
      practice' and, if possible, for medical guidelines.

      The aim of this study is to get an overview of medical needs of adults with rare genetic
      syndromes, including:

        1. comorbidities

        2. medical and their impact on quality of life

        3. medication use

        4. the need for adaption of medication dose according to each syndrome

      Methods and Results This is a retrospective file study. Analysis will be performed using SPSS
      version 23 and R version 3.6.0.
