      To assess the feasibility in diabetics in a primary care setting of screening for NAFLD and
      advanced fibrosis, by using non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to estimate the
      hepatic proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) to
      estimate hepatic stiffness.

      This is a prospective cohort study consisting of a one-time visit by diabetic patients with
      optional following liver biopsy. The aim of the study is to evaluate whether liver fat
      fraction and liver stiffness, as determined by magnetic resonance imaging, are associated
      with subclinical cardiovascular disease, as evaluated by coronary artery calcium scan in
      diabetics. During the visit, patients will undergo review of medical history, vitals
      (including body mass index, blood pressure), physical exam, blood work, urine collection,
      ECG, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including MR proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF)
      and MR elastography, ultrasound using acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging, and
      computed tomography (CT) scan for coronary artery calcium scoring. Blood work will be sent
      for labs relevant to traits of metabolic syndrome including markers for diabetes (hemoglobin
      A1C, fasting glucose) and hyperlipidemia (lipid panel). Serum, plasma and whole blood will be
      stored for future studies. Results from history, physical exam, and radiographic imaging will
      be analyzed and if they indicate the presence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, patients will
      be offered an optional liver biopsy for further assessment. All patients will be invited to
      continue in the study and have follow-up visits every two years for a total duration of the
      study of 5 years.

      There is a separate optional component of the study where subjects will be asked to donate a
      blood sample for genetic research.Subjects will be offered the opportunity to review, discuss
      and sign the consent at their scheduled visit. All questions will be answered at this time
      and throughout the study. Declining to give a genetic sample does not prohibit the
      participant from participating in the study. The biospecimen collected as part of this study
      will be kept in Dr. Loomba's locked research freezer at the Clinical Teaching Facility
      (CTF-building A).These samples and data may be stored for 50 years to be used at a later date
      for investigation of new novel biomarkers. This will be made clear to the patient during the
      consent process.
