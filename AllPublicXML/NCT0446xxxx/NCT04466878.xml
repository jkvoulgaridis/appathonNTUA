      Inclusion criteria: Only constitutional VWD-patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria of the
      French reference center for VWD will be included. Patients with acquired von Willebrand
      syndrome will not be included.

      Material and Methods: A 15-items survey that will be sent to the 30 centers involved in the
      French network for bleeding disorders (MHEMO) to identify VWD-patients referred for
      endoscopic exploration of at least one GI-bleeding from January 2015 to December 2017. Only
      constitutional VWD-patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria of the French reference center
      for VWD will be included. Constitutional VWD diagnosis will be confirmed confirmed centrally
      in all patients by the French reference center for von Willebrand disease. A GI-bleeding
      episode will be defined as any overt or occult GI-bleeding (unexplained chronic iron
      deficiency anemia causing a drop of hemoglobin level by more than 2 g/dL from baseline). We
      will analyze patient characteristics, GI-bleeding pattern, VWD type/subtype, nature
      (gastroscopy, colonoscopy or VCE) and results of the endoscopic exploration and management
      that was applied: endoscopic therapy by argon plasma coagulation, on-demand/prophylactic-VWF
      replacement therapy, use of antiangiogenic drugs. If angiodysplasia without another bleeding
      source is identified, GI-bleeding will be categorized as angiodysplasia, if another lesion is
      identified GI-bleeding will be categorized as &quot;no-angiodysplasia&quot; and if no bleeding source
      is identified, GI-bleeding will be categorized as obscure GI-bleeding. Recurrence will be
      defined as evidence of overt GI-bleeding or a drop of hemoglobin level by more than 2 g/dL
      from baseline.
