  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether application of Dry Needling (DN) is
      effective for improved Muscle Mechanical Properties and Muscle Contractility in Latent
      Trigger Points point (LTrP) of upper trapezius. Randomized controlled trial, in parallel with
      cross-control design. Two groups with LTrP in upper trapezius, and will be randomly selected
      to DN group or Sham-Dn group.

    <measure>Change in Stiffness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at 30 minutes after treatment, at 24 hours after treatment, at 72 hours after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure is obtained by a device named MyotonPro. Stiffness reflects the resistance of the muscle to the force deforming the muscle.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Maximal Radial Displacement (Dm)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at 30 minutes after treatment, at 24 hours after treatment, at 72 hours after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure is obtained by a device named Tensiomiography. The variable Dm is given by the radial displacement of the muscular belly in a transverse plane, expressed in millimeters (mm) and depends on muscle tone or stiffness. A low Dm is related to a high muscle tone or an excess of stiffness, while a high Dm value indicates a lack of muscle tone or stiffness defect.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, at 30 minutes after treatment, at 24 hours after treatment, at 72 hours after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure is obtained by a device named MyotonPro. The frequency of the damped oscillations characterizes the muscle tone.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Decrement (elasticity)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at 30 minutes after treatment, at 24 hours after treatment, at 72 hours after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure is obtained by a device named MyotonPro.The logarithmic decrement of the damping oscillations characterizes muscle elasticity which is the ability of the muscle to restore its initial shape after contraction</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mechanical Stress Relaxation Time [ms]</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at 30 minutes after treatment, at 24 hours after treatment, at 72 hours after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure is obtained by a device named MyotonPro. Mechanical Stress Relaxation Time [ms] is the time for a muscle to recover tis shape from deformation after a voluntary contraction or a removal of an external force.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Ratio of deformation and Relaxation time, characterising Creep (Deborah number)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at 30 minutes after treatment, at 24 hours after treatment, at 72 hours after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure is obtained by a device named MyotonPro. Ratio of deformation and Relaxation time, characterising Creep (Deborah number) is the gradual elongation of a tissue over time when placed under a constant tensile stress.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Contraction time (Tc)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at 30 minutes after treatment, at 24 hours after treatment, at 72 hours after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure is obtained by a device named Tensiomiography. Contraction time (Tc) as a time between 10% and 90% of the contraction</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Delay time (Td)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at 30 minutes after treatment, at 24 hours after treatment, at 72 hours after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure is obtained by a device named Tensiomiography. Delay time (Td) as a time between the electrical impulse and 10% of the contraction</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sustain time (Ts)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at 30 minutes after treatment, at 24 hours after treatment, at 72 hours after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure is obtained by a device named Tensiomiography. Sustain time (Ts) as a time between 50% of the contraction and 50% of the relaxation</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Relaxation time (Tr)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at 30 minutes after treatment, at 24 hours after treatment, at 72 hours after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure is obtained by a device named Tensiomiography. Relaxation time (Tr) as a time between 90% and 50% of the relaxation</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pressure Pain Perception (PPP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at 30 minutes after treatment, at 24 hours after treatment, at 72 hours after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Pain Pressure Threshold (PPT) as assessed using an manual mechanical algometer. The procedure performed was the same as the prior described, but pressure was kept until 2.5 kg/cm2 and maintained for 5 seconds, whereas the subject had to characterize the level of pain using a 10-mm visual analog scale (VAS)</description>
