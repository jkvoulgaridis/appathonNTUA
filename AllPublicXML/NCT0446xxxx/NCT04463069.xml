      Considering that children with intellectual disability (ID) might be more vulnerable to
      obesity than their counterparts in the general population. This study aimed to develop and
      evaluate the effectiveness of an adapted physical activity (APA) program in reducing weight
      among adolescents with ID. The hypothesis of the study was the APA program would be able to
      decrease obesity among adolescents with ID.

      Background: Children with intellectual disability (ID) might be more vulnerable to obesity
      than their counterparts in the general population. This study aimed to evaluate the
      effectiveness of an adapted physical activity (APA) program in reducing weight among
      adolescents with ID.

      Methods: A 9-month randomized controlled trial was conducted between August 2018 and June
      2019. Adolescents (12-18 years old) with ID and overweight/obesity were recruited from six
      special education schools in Hong Kong. The participants in the intervention group
      participated in the APA intervention, which consisted of simple and fun endurance and
      strength-building exercises at a frequency of two sessions per week. Data on obesity-related
      variables, subjective PA levels, sleep duration and eating habits were collected before the
      intervention, at the midpoint of the intervention and after the intervention. Changes in the
      outcome variables were analyzed using linear mixed-effect models.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change from baseline BMI at 4 months and 10 months</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 4, 10 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome variable was change in BMI (weight (kg) / height2 (m)) that was further calculated from the height and weight measured at school in the morning time. Height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a stadiometer and weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg on a TANITA digital scale (TBF-410) with the subject wearing lightweight clothing and no shoes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>BMIz</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 4, 10 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BMI values were converted into BMIz using the WHO 2007 reference standards.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Body fat</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 4, 10 months</time_frame>
    <description>Percent Body fat was measured with the TANITA digital scale (TBF-410) using foot-to-foot bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). The data were automatically recorded after entering participants' sex, height and age.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Waist-to-height ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 4, 10 months</time_frame>
    <description>The waist-to-height ratio was calculated by dividing the waist circumference by the height. The waist circumference (cm) was measured midway between the lowest rib margin and the top of the iliac crest at the end of gentle expiration</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Waist-to-hip ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 4, 10 months</time_frame>
    <description>The waist-to-hip ratio was defined as the waist circumference divided by the hip circumference. The hip circumference was measured at the maximal protrusion of the buttocks. The measure was performed with a flexible meter ribbon accurate to 0.1 cm.</description>

    <description>This PA program was modified from an adapted physical activity (APA) program that designed for obesity management among adolescents with intellectual disability (ID)22. The aim of the APA program was to promote PA and health for people in special needs. In this study, the APA program was carefully designed based on a comprehensive pre-intervention assessment of each adolescent with ID, so that can be able to address their individual needs in learning and adaption. The APA program comprised three stages of APA training at school and each stage consisted of simple and fun endurance and strength-building exercise, at a frequency of two sessions per week, and lasting for about three months.</description>
