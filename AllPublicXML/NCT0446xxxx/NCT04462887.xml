  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Determine the benefits of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) patients participating
      in a structured, 8-week educational telephone intervention delivered by expert cardiovascular
      nurses post-ICD. To determine if individuals participating in a post-hospital telephone
      nursing intervention would demonstrate (1) increased physical functioning, (2) increased
      psychological adjustment, (3) improved self-efficacy in managing the challenges of ICD
      recovery, and (4) lower levels of health care utilization over usual care at 1, 3, 6 and 12
      months post-ICD implantation.

      The goal of the study was to determine if a short-term social cognitive theory intervention
      would improve physical functioning and enhance psychological adjustment after receiving a
      first time ICD. The central aim of this study was to determine if individuals participating
      in a telephone nursing intervention compared to usual care demonstrated (1) improved physical
      functioning, (2) improved psychological adjustment, 3) improved knowledge related to sudden
      cardiac arrest (SCA) and the ICD, and (4) lower levels of health care use over a 3-month
      period post-ICD.

    <description>The intervention consisted of structured information (SI) provided in a booklet, nursing telephone support (NTS) and access to a nurse pager 24h/day. The SI booklet, Sudden Cardiac Arrest: A Survivor's Experience, contains 2 components: a descriptive component including individual verbatim statements about experiences of others during the first year of recovery and a management component outlining successful strategies used by others in dealing with issues in recovery. The NTS telephone calls included: check-in about current concerns, assessment of the topic for the week, review of common recovery experiences, discussion of behavioral strategies for dealing with the topic for the week, provision of positive feedback for strategies already working well, anxiety reduction statements, practice of new behaviors using role-playing and problem solving techniques, summarization, setting specific goals for the upcoming week, and collaborating on a learning assignment for the subsequent week.</description>
