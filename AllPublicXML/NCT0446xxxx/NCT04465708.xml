  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this current study is to conduct a conceptual replication with an independent
      evaluation team of the randomized controlled trial conducted by Langberg and colleagues,
      which demonstrated the efficacy of the Homework, Organization, and Planning Skills (HOPS)
      intervention. The study will be conducted under routine practice conditions with school staff
      serving as interventionists; the study sample will include the broad range of students with
      organization, time management, and planning problems. The study will examine how
      implementation factors (fidelity, engagement, working alliance) are related to outcomes, and
      it will explore the potential moderating role of school organization factors on outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Organization, time management, and planning (OTMP) skills are associated with academic
      performance. A randomized controlled trial found that the Homework, Organization, and
      Planning Skills (HOPS) intervention was effective in improving student organization skills
      and homework performance, with moderate to large effect sizes. HOPS is a 16-session skills
      training program, provided individually to students in grades 6 through 8 who have OTMP
      skills deficits that contribute to academic difficulties. Two parent consultations and one
      teacher consultation promote generalization and maintenance of effects. The current study is
      a conceptual replication of the previous HOPS study, conducted by an independent evaluation
      team. The intervention will be delivered under routine practice conditions, with school staff
      serving as interventionists. The study will examine how fidelity, engagement, and working
      alliance are related to outcomes, and it will explore the extent to which school organization
      factors moderate outcomes. Across 30 schools in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, Investigators
      will recruit a total of 240 of 6th, 7th, and 8th grade students with OTMP deficits. Parents,
      teachers, and an Individualized Education Plan (IEP)/504 Plan Case Manager provide data about
      the students. School counselors and Principals provide data about the organizational context
      of the schools. A school staff member delivers the HOPS intervention and provides data.

      Using a cluster randomized design, Investigators will randomize schools to HOPS or Treatment
      as Usual - Wait List (TAU-WL), ratio of 2:1. Outcomes will be assessed at Baseline and
      Post-Treatment for all students, 5 months after Baseline assessment for all HOPS students and
      6th and 7th grade TAU-WL students, and 12 months after Baseline for students in grades 6 and
      7 who received HOPS. Participants in TAU-WL will receive HOPS following completion of study
      activities.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 Months after Baseline, 5 Months after Baseline, 12 Months after Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Children's Organizational Skills Scale - Parent version (COSS-P) will be used to assess changes in OTMP functioning at home. COSS-P total scores have good discriminant validity and are sensitive to treatment effects. The COSS-P uses a 4-point rating scale (1=Hardly ever or never to 4=Just about all of the time). The COSS-P yields three subscale scores: Materials Management, Organized Actions, and Task Planning. Minimum scores for each subscale and the Total score are 40 and maximum scores are 90, with higher scores representing more impairment. The COSS-P will be used primarily as an outcome measure. In addition, Investigators will examine whether severity of organization problems, as measured by Baseline COSS-P scores, moderates the effect of treatment on academic outcomes.</description>

    <description>The Children's Organizational Skills Scale - Teacher version (COSS-T) will be used to assess changes in OTMP functioning at school. COSS total scores have good discriminant validity and are sensitive to treatment effects. The COSS-T uses a 4-point rating scale (1=Hardly ever or never to 4=Just about all of the time). The COSS-T yields three subscale scores: Materials Management, Organized Actions, and Task Planning.

    <measure>Change in Student Proficiency in Academic Subject Areas</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 Months after Baseline, 5 Months after Baseline, 12 Months after Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Academic Progress Report (APR) is a teacher-report measure that assesses proficiency in up to six academic subjects relative to standard expectations (1=Well below standard expected at this time of year; 3=At standard; 5=Well above standard). The sum of ratings across six academic subjects is the unit of analysis. The minimum score is 1 and the maximum score is 5, with higher scores indicating higher functioning. Reliability is acceptable (alpha = .84), and this measure is sensitive to treatment effects for an elementary school organizational skills training intervention. For each participating student, Investigators will obtain teacher ratings on the APR from two of the student's academic teachers to attempt to capture the student's academic performance in a standardized fashion.</description>

    <measure>Change in Student Academic Grades</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 Months after Baseline, 5 Months after Baseline, 12 Months after Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will obtain report card grades for the academic year prior to student enrollment, the academic year of student enrollment, and the academic year following student enrollment for all participating students. Investigators will calculate students' grade point average based on report card grades.</description>

    <measure>Change in Student Homework Performance at Home</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 Months after Baseline, 5 Months after Baseline, 12 Months after Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Homework Problem Checklist (HPC) is a 20-item parent-report measure that assesses student homework performance. Factor analyses conducted by Power and Langberg et al., have indicated that the HPC has two distinct factors: Homework Completion and Homework Materials Management. Scores range from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 60, with higher scores representing higher impairment. The HPC has been shown to be sensitive to the effects of interventions to improve student homework and organization skills.</description>

    <measure>Change in Student Homework Competence at School</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 Months after Baseline, 5 Months after Baseline, 12 Months after Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Homework Performance Questionnaire - Teacher Revised Version (HPQ-T) assesses students' homework behavior during the past 4 weeks. Each item is rated on a 7-point scale indicating how often each behavior occurs (never or rarely = 0% to 10% of time; almost always/always = 91% to 100% of time). The 17-item General factor that assesses overall homework competence, which has strong psychometric properties, will be used in the analyses. This score is generated by averaging the scores of items 9-25, with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 6. Higher scores indicate higher functioning.</description>

    <description>The Homework, Organization, and Planning Skills (HOPS) intervention is delivered through a series of 16 frequent but brief sessions between the school professional and student. For the purposes of this study, the school professional will be called a &quot;school partner.&quot; Each session is approximately 20 minutes. The three main skill areas covered as part of the program are: (1) school materials organization, (2) homework management and (3) time management and planning. A reward system is utilized in effort to change behavior patterns by making rewards available when a student engages in productive organizing and planning behaviors. The intervention also includes two parent meetings and one teacher meeting.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female students in grades 6 through 8.

          2. Student is in a general education classroom.

          3. Student is nominated for the study by at least one academic teacher who reports
             regularly assigning homework to this student.

          4. Nominating teacher(s) rates the student's OTMP skills deficits as having a negative
             impact on academic performance (rating &gt; 3 on a 4-point scale on at least one of four
             interference items of COSS-T),

          5. Parental/guardian permission (informed consent) and student assent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Students will be excluded if they are in a pull-out special education classroom for
             more than 50% of the day, because the organizational demands for these students may
             differ from those placed mostly in general education.

          2. Students with a one-to-one aide will be excluded because the presence of an aide
             substantially alters how an organizational intervention is implemented.

          3. Students from families in which both caregivers do not speak English will be excluded
             because the program has not yet been developed for non-English speakers.

          4. Students from a family in which one student has already been enrolled in the study
             will be excluded. Only one student per family will be included in the study.
