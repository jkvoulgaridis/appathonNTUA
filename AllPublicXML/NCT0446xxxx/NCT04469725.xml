  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, multi-center, single arm study in subjects with advanced
      thymic carcinoma after failure of platinum-based combination chemotherapy. Subjects should
      have documented progressive disease while on platinum-based combination chemotherapy. If
      subjects discontinued platinum-based therapy due to reasons other than progressive disease,
      subjects should have completed at least 2 cycles of platinum-based combination chemotherapy
      before the commencement of documented progressive disease. Subjects will be treated with
      KN046 5 milligram per kilogram every 2 weeks.
