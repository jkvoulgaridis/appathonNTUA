  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized multicentre phase II trial with a large translational component. The
      trial will evaluate the two standard chemotherapy regimens: modified folfirinox (mFFX) and
      gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel (GA), in patients with untreated metastatic pancreatic ductal
      adenocarcinoma. Integrated into this phase II trial are a number of laboratory components
      including molecular profiling, patient derived organoid establishment, and drug testing
      sensitivity and other biomarkers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The two chemotherapy regimens GA and mFFX remain standard treatment options without
      biomarkers to predict response. PASS-01 will for the first time explore progression free
      survival differences in the two standard backbone regimens used in the advanced setting.
      Biomarker driven strategies in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are lacking, perhaps
      accounting for a large number of failed phase II studies. This study will evaluate two
      standard of care chemotherapy regimens, but will also explore high content molecular
      profiling, chemotherapy sensitivity signatures, GATA6 and other putative biomarkers as
      predictors of response to chemotherapy. In addition, the use of patient derived organoid
      models for personalized medicine in PDAC will continue to develop within this study.

      Approximately 150 patients diagnosed with untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer will be
      randomized to either arm.

          6. Patients must be suitable for treatment with either mFFX and GA without
             contraindications to either regimen.

          7. Eastern Cooperative Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1. (Karnofsky ≥70%).

          8. Life expectancy of greater than 90 days, as judged by the investigator

          9. Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test and
             must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.

         10. Within 14 days of the proposed randomization date, patients must have normal organ and
             marrow function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have received prior systemic treatment for PDAC, including treatment in
             the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. Prior surgery or palliative radiation is
             permitted.

          2. Patients with histology other than pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Those with
             adenosquamous are allowed. Acinar tumors and colloid are excluded.

             procedures or requirements. *Use of any illicit drugs or other substance abuse
             (including alcohol) are not screened in Canada using Toxicity testing. -
