      This study is designated to:

        1. investigate the tolerance and safety of treatment of Human placental mesenchymal stem
           cells gel on Human diabetic foot ulcer.

        2. learn the primary effectiveness of Human placental mesenchymal stem cells gel on Human
           diabetic food ulcer.

        3. study the pharmacokinetics of Human placental mesenchymal stem cells gel on Human
           diabetic food ulcer.
