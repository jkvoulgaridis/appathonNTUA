      A single-center, randomized, open-labeled, 2×2 crossover phase 1 study to evaluate the
      pharmakinetics effect of high fat food to single dose administration of Anaprazole in healthy
      Chinese male subjects. 14 health male subjects is divided to A group (n=7) and B group (n=7).
      2 periods (7 days) cross-over design, anaprazole 40mg single dose, one is fasting oral
      administration before breakfast, the other is oral administration 30 minutes after breakfast
      with high fat food.
