  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a disabling, incurable condition that affects
      250,000 people in France, and Crohn's disease (CD) is the most common form. CD progresses, in
      one-quarter of the cases, towards the appearance of intestinal stenosis, most often on the
      terminal ileum, sometimes with obstructive symptoms and requiring an optimization of medical
      treatment (biotherapies) and/or surgery The hypothesis of this study is [18F]FDG PET /CT,
      (Positron emission tomography with the tracer fluorine-18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG),
      called [18F]FDG PET coupled to a dedicated CT scanner) could help quantify intestinal
      inflammation in patients with abnormal entero-MRI, and differentiate inflammation and
      fibrosis on a joint PET /CT and MRI , in patients with complicated Crohn Disease intestinal
      stenosis
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intestinal inflammation could be quantified by the PET/CT due to the tropism of a PET tracer,
      [18F]FDG for activated inflammatory cells.

      [18F]FDG PET/CTperformed on latest digital PET/CT cameras and recordings focused on the
      abdomen could help quantify intestinal inflammation in patients with abnormal entero-MRI, and
      differentiate inflammation and fibrosis on a joint PET/CT and MRI , in patients with
      complicated Crohn Disease intestinal stenosis.

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indices are used to assess the upgradability and activity of
      CD and try to predict response to treatment, in particular Nancy's MRI score for digestive
      inflammation.

      An inflammation index (FILM-i) and a fibrosis index (FILM-f), based on this MRI/PET analysis,
      will be developed and validated to develop personalized medicine in patients with stenosing
      CD. Indeed, these indices will guide the therapeutic choice, in particular for the
      biotherapies prescription or the need to operate these patients.

    <time_frame>Day 45</time_frame>
    <description>Index FILM-i will be developed using histological scores determined according to the extent and the diffusion in the thickness of the intestinal wall: cellular infiltration and edema
These histological scores both include 4 grades:
0 = no damage (fibrosis or inflammation),
1 = slight damage,
2 = average achievement,
3 = severe damage. The FILM-i indice is developed in order to predict these same 4 grades.</description>

    <description>Index FILM-f will be developed using histological scores determined according to the extent and the diffusion in the thickness of the intestinal wall : collagen fibrosis
These histological scores both include 4 grades:
0 = no damage (fibrosis or inflammation),
1 = slight damage,
2 = average achievement,
3 = severe damage. The FILM-i indice is developed in order to predict these same 4 grades.</description>
