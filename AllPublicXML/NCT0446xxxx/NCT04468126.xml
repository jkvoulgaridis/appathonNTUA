  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      First-line therapy of patients with acute respiratory failure consists in oxygen delivery
      through standard oxygen, high-flow nasal oxygen therapy through cannula or non-invasive
      ventilation. Non-invasive ventilation in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is not
      recommended. In a large randomized controlled study, high-flow nasal oxygen has been
      described as superior to non-invasive ventilation and standard oxygen in terms of mortality
      but not of intubation. Paradoxically in immunocompromised patients, high-flow nasal oxygen
      has not been shown to be superior to standard oxygen. To improve the level of evidence of
      daily clinical practice, we propose comparing high-flow nasal oxygen versus standard oxygen,
      in terms of mortality in all patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure
