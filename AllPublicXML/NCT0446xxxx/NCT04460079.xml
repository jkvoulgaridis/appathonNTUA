  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study was an observational, multicenter, non-interventional, single arm, open
      label, PMS study conducted in Iran.

      The primary objective of this study was safety assessment, including the rate of AEs. The
      secondary objective was the effectiveness evaluation in the prevention of
      chemotherapy-induced FN.

      The present study was an observational, multicenter, non-interventional, single arm, open
      label, PMS study conducted in Iran.

      Data was gathered in two booklets, each containing information on four cycles of
      chemotherapy, which was filled by the designated physician. The duration of PegaGen®
      treatment was at the physicians' discretion based on the patient's condition.

      The primary objective of this study was safety assessment, including the rate of AEs. The
      secondary objective was the effectiveness evaluation in the prevention of
      chemotherapy-induced FN.

      This study was single arm and 654 subjects participated across various tumor types and
      regimens.

    <description>Safety evaluation was reported using summary statistics. For each AE, data was summarized using incidence according to system organ class and preferred term of AEs and SAEs. Moreover, causality assessment was done and its results was reported by frequency and percentage.</description>
