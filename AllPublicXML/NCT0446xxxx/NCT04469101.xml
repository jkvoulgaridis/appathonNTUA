  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to better understand how patient positioning can affect pain relief
      after an epidural. In addition to pain, the investigators will assess how position affects
      epidural spread, and its effects on maternal blood pressure and fetal heart rate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidurals will be placed with parturients in the standard sitting position. An epidural
      catheter will be placed to a depth of 5 cm into the epidural space. After placement,
      parturients will be randomized to one of the four position groups (left uterine displacement,
      left lateral, right lateral, or seated upright). After successful positioning, a series of 5
      cc bolus doses of 0.08% ropivacaine with 2 mcg per cc of fentanyl will be injected through
      the epidural catheter in 5 minute intervals for a total volume of 20 cc. After the initial
      loading dose of epidural solution has been injected in the first 20 minutes post-insertion,
      the patient will be able to return to whatever position they are most comfortable with. The
      parturient will be asked to rate their pain on a verbal pain scale of between 0 and 10 at the
      peak of their contraction at three time intervals. The spread of the blockade will be
      assessed with ice applied along both the left and right mid-clavicular lines. Maternal blood
      pressure will be measured on the upper arm in all patients as per nursing protocol. Fetal
      heart rate will be monitored intermittently with Doppler ultrasound as per nursing protocol.
