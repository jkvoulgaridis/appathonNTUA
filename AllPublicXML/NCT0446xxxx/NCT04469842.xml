      Lung transplantation is a life-saving therapy for patients with advanced lung disease,
      however, necessitates the use of life-long immunosuppressive therapy for the prevention of
      acute and chronic rejection. The backbone of immunosuppression is the calcineurin-inhibitor
      class, with tacrolimus being the preferred drug due to its potency and improved side-effect
      profile. Nevertheless, tacrolimus is associated with several side effects including increased
      risk for infection and malignancy, tremors, headaches, seizures, hypertension, leukopenia and
      renal dysfunction. In fact, by 6 months post-transplant, 50% of patients will have a 50%
      decline in eGFR and by 5 years post-transplant ~10% of patients will have advanced renal
      disease that may require renal replacement therapy and/or kidney transplantation. Tacrolimus
      induces a nephropathy in two ways- acute calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity (CIN) is
      mediated by afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction, whereas chronic CIN is due to interstitial
      nephritis and fibrosis. Immunosuppressive regimens that spare or dose-reduce calcineurin
      inhibitors have been shown to have a modest impact on preserving renal function, but are
      limited by timing. Although most studies support implementing renal preserving protocols
      early on, this is balanced by the potential for acute cellular rejection, antibody mediated
      rejection and anastomotic dehiscence.

      Long-acting Tacrolimus (LCP-tacrolimus) may have the potential to bridge the balance of
      providing potent immunosuppression, while sparing renal function, due to the better systemic
      dose levels and improved concentration/dose ration achieved with it compared to
      IR-tacrolimus, evidenced in the renal transplant population. There is limited experience with
      LCP-tacrolimus in lung transplantation. Several case reports chronicling the late conversion
      from IR-tacrolimus to LCP-tacrolimus due to absorption issues or side-effect intolerance,
      have demonstrated safety and tolerability. The investigators seek to determine whether early
      use of LCP-tacrolimus in lung transplant recipients following the index hospitalization is
      acceptable, and propose a single-center prospective, randomized, controlled pilot study of
      early-use LCP-tacrolimus in lung transplant recipients to assess safety, tolerability and
      side-effects of LCP-tacrolimus.

      Lung transplantation is a life-saving therapy for patients with end-stage lung disease
      refractory to medical treatment, providing an improvement in both survival and quality of
      life.[1,2] Despite the benefits, patients are at risk for myriad side effects including
      infection, malignancy, neurologic complications (headache, tremor, seizures),
      gastrointestinal distress and renal failure, to name a few.[3] Many of these are related to
      the requisite need for life-long immunosuppression. Current standard immunosuppressive
      regimens for lung transplant recipients include calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus preferred
      over cyclosporine), antiproliferative agents (mycophenolate mofetil vs. azathioprine) and
      corticosteroids; calcineurin inhibitors serve as the backbone of immunosuppression.[4] Renal
      dysfunction is perhaps the most prevalent complication after lung transplantation, affecting
      up to 90% of post-transplant recipients.[5] By 5-year post-transplant, ~8% of patients may
      require renal replacement therapy and/or renal transplantation.[6] Renal dysfunction tends to
      occur early on in the post-transplant period. Monnier and colleagues showed in a
      single-center analysis that the incidence of acute kidney injury within the index
      hospitalization was ~75%; the median loss of glomerular function within the first year was
      ~45%.[7] Moreover, Canales and colleagues showed that &gt;55% of patients in a cohort of 219
      lung transplant recipients had a doubling of their pre-transplant serum creatinine, the
      majority occurring within the first year post-transplant.[8] Early renal dysfunction in lung
      transplant recipients is associated with a poor overall prognosis. Broelkroleof and
      colleagues demonstrated that loss of renal function within he first month post-transplant is
      predictive of chronic kidney disease.[9] Moreover, chronic kidney disease is associated with
      a five times increased risk of mortality.[5] Perhaps the greatest contributor to the
      development of CKD in solid-organ transplant recipients are the calcineurin inhibitors
      (CNIs).[10] CNIs cause renal compromise (calcineurin inhibitor nephropathy, CIN) via acute
      and chronic mechanisms. Acute CIN is due to potent vasoconstriction of afferent arterioles in
      the kidney, resulting in ischemia.[11,12] Chronic CIN is thought to be largely mediated by
      interstitial fibrosis as the end-result of arteriolar sclerosis, oxygen free-radical injury,
      and upregulation of pro-fibrotic pathways including PDGF, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
      signaling, TGFB and matrix metalloproteinase-9.[11,13] Attempts at utilizing CNI-free or
      CNI-reduced regimens in the lung transplantation population has been understudied and/or
      unsuccessful to date. Belatacept, a CTLA4-fusion molecule that prevents CD28-mediated
      co-stimulation to activate T-lymphocytes, has been well-studied in renal transplantation as
      an alternative to CNIs. The BENEFIT Trial, a phase III clinical study of Belatacept vs.
      Cyclosporine in renal transplant recipients, demonstrated improvement in patient and
      allograft survival, and mean eGFR (~70 cc/min vs ~45cc/min) at seven years. However, rates of
      biopsy proven acute cellular rejection were twice as much with Belatacept.[14] Case reports
      of Belatacept as rescue therapy in lung transplant recipients intolerant of CNIs are mixed;
      there are reports of increased ACR and fulminant acute respiratory distress syndrome.[15,16]
      The mTOR inhibitor class of immunosuppression has also been incorporated into regimens in an
      effort to ameliorate CNI-toxicity. Villanueva and colleagues assessed outcomes of conversion
      to Sirolimus and reduced Tacrolimus in 49 patients with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome
      (chronic rejection) or CNI-intolerance; there was no difference in renal function one year
      following sirolimus initiation.[17] Conversely, Shitrit and colleagues demonstrated that
      sirolimus plus low-dose tacrolimus led to an improvement in GFR of 10 mL/min, compared to
      control maintenance immunosuppression in a pilot study of sixteen lung allograft
      recipients.[18] More recently, Gottlieb and colleagues demonstrated that conversion to
      quadruple immunosuppression therapy with low-dose CNI (target tacrolimus trough 3-5) led to
      improvements in eGFR of 10cc/mL compared to standard immunosuppression (tacrolimus trough
      &gt;5). There was no considerable difference in biopsy-proven acute rejection, chronic rejection
      and death.[20] The conversion for those in the 4-drug experimental group occurred on average
      11 months following transplant, which may account for the muted benefit; perhaps an earlier
      change in immunosuppression management would have led to more clinically significant results.
      Notably, discontinuation rates of sirolimus in case reports are variable, with most studies
      reporting a 20-80% discontinuation rate due to gastrointestinal distress, pneumonitis,
      thrombocytopenia, etc., making the mTOR inhibitor class less appealing.[19] It is apparent
      that changes to immunosuppression management earlier in the post-transplant period are ideal
      to see a maximum benefit in preserved renal function.9 However, this is complicated by the
      concerns for acute cellular rejection, which has a peak incidence at 6 months post-lung
      transplantation.[21,22] Acute cellular rejection is a leading risk factor for the development
      of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD, chronic rejection).[23] Hence any dose reduction
      in CNI or the use of an agent associated with ACR (Belatacept) is less desirable within the
      first few months post-transplant.

      Given the preference to utilize a CNI-based regimen early-post transplant but still minimize
      nephrotoxic effects, the investigators seek to determine whether the early use of long acting
      tacrolimus, LCP-Tacrolimus (LCP-tacro, Envarsus XR, Veloxis Pharmaceuticals), results in
      improved renal function compared to intermediate release tacrolimus (IR-tacrolimus,
      IR-tacro). Anecdotally, LCP-tacro has been used in lung transplant recipients as an
      alternative agent for those with debilitating headache or tremor. Early use of LCP-tacro has
      not been widely adopted due to perceptions associated with ability to closely titrate trough
      levels and cost. However, early use of LCP-tacro may provide several benefits. As a
      long-acting formulation, LCP-tacro allows for daily dosing. Moreover, LCP-tacro has greater
      absorption and bioavailability, leading to decreased swings in peak and trough
      concentrations; frequent fluctuations in serum tacrolimus levels potentiates afferent
      arteriolar vasoconstriction.[24] A steady state of systemic tacrolimus trough levels is
      desirable, since tacrolimus metabolism is directly related to nephrotoxicity.[25] The use of
      LCP-Tacro has been studied in renal transplant recipients. Langone and colleagues identified
      that LCP-tacrolimus compared to IR-tacrolimus was associated with improved tremor incidence
      and quality of life.[1] Rostaing and colleagues demonstrated that the use of LCP-tacro
      compared to intermediate tacrolimus was non-inferior in terms of combined death, allograft
      failure, biopsy-proven acute rejection and loss to follow-up. However, the use of LCP-tacro
      was associated with a significant reduction in total daily dose, and a 30% reduction in peak
      dose, without an increase in biopsy proven acute rejection episodes. Although not a
      prospective end-point, there was no significant impact on renal function.[26] In other
      studies, though, higher concentration/ drug (C/D) ratios for tacrolimus are associated with
      an improved renal safety profile.[27] It is conceivable that a clinical benefit of LCP-tacro
      over IR-tacro may be better manifested in clinical arenas that require higher target
      tacrolimus trough levels, such as lung allograft recipients, where initial post-transplant
      targets can be as high as 12-15 ng/mL, compared to renal transplantation where target trough
      levels are a relatively conservative 4-8 ng/mL.[2, 3] The experience of LCP-tacrolimus in the
      realm of lung transplantation is limited. Murakoezy and colleagues studied 53 patients that
      were converted from short-acting Tacrolimus to long-acting Envarsus. Conversion was performed
      at an average 3.6 years post-transplant. Ten patients were switched back due to side-effects
      (unknown), though the remainder tolerated conversion without complication. Ahmed and
      colleagues demonstrated feasibility in using long-acting Tacrolimus in 8 patients that were
      unable to achieve sufficient therapeutic levels with a short-acting formulation due to
      suspected polymorphisms of CYP3A4/3A5.[28] McCurry and colleagues assessed safety and
      feasibility of LCP-tacrolimus in a retrospective analysis of 18 lung transplant recipients.
      They found that patients on LCP-tacro had a 27% reduction in total dose. No patients
      experienced any adverse effects. Moreover, 2/18 patients had an improvement in tremors and
      headache.[29] Given the limited experience with of LCP-tacrolimus in lung transplant
      populations, the investigators propose a prospective, randomized, controlled pilot study to
      assess the safety, tolerability, and side-effect profile of early use LCP-tacro within the
      first 9 months post-transplantation. It is hypothesized that the early use of LCP-tacro in
      lung transplant recipients is safe and tolerable, and associated with an improved side-effect
      profile compared to patients treated with standard IR-tacro.
