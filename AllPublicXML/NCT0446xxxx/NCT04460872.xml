  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will determine the feasibility of implementing a combinatory rehabilitation
      strategy involving testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) with locomotor training (LT;
      walking on a treadmill with assistance and overground walking) in men with testosterone
      deficiency and walking dysfunction after incomplete spinal cord injury. The investigators
      hypothesize that LT+TRT treatment will improve muscle size, muscle function, bone mineral
      density, and walking speed.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) produces bone, muscle, and neural impairments that increase fracture
      risk and impede recovery of physical function. Locomotor training (LT) increases muscle size
      and promotes recovery of muscle function and walking in some persons with incomplete SCI. It
      is unknown if testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) improves these factors in men who have
      walking dysfunction and low testosterone after incomplete SCI. In addition, the combined
      effects of LT plus TRT remain unknown in men with incomplete SCI.

      For this pilot study, men with incomplete SCI who have low testosterone and walking
      dysfunction will receive 6-months of TRT alone or TRT with LT. TRT injections will be given
      weekly. LT will involve 35 sessions of treadmill walking with assistance and overground
      walking (4 sessions per week) during the initial 2-3 months of TRT. Participants will be
      assessed at study entry and at 1-6 month intervals thereafter. Testing will include
      measurements such as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, dual energy x-ray
      absorptiometry (DEXA) scan, and muscle performance and walking tests. Participants will also
      undergo safety tests, including physical exams, electrocardiogram (ECG), prostate digital
      rectal exam, and blood tests to assess hematocrit, liver enzymes (AST and ALT), prostate
      specific antigen (PSA), and other health markers. The treatment groups will be compared with
      a non-treatment control group comprised of men with incomplete SCI who receive no treatment.
      Participants enrolled in the non-treatment control group will undergo the same tests
      described above.
