  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BTK inhibition and checkpoint blockade are promising classes of therapy for central nervous
      system (CNS) lymphoma and have demonstrated efficacy with acceptable toxicity. A multidrug
      approach may carry a higher chance of durable efficacy in this aggressive disease that
      carries significant morbidity and mortality. Given the poor outcomes and limited options for
      patients who are not candidates for high-dose methotrexate, the investigators seek to
      evaluate the combination in this patient population.
