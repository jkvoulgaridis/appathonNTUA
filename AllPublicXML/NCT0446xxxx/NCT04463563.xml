  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral oximetry using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been shown to reduce the
      incidence of neurological dysfunction and hospital length-of-stay in adult cardiac surgery
      though not all studies agree. A previous audit using cerebral saturations at or above
      baseline showed improved neurological and length-of-stay outcomes.

      This prospective, single centre, double-blinded controlled study randomized 182 consecutive
      patients, scheduled for cardiac surgical procedures using cardiopulmonary bypass.
      Participants were randomized by concealed envelope prior to anaesthesia. NIRS study group
      were managed perioperatively using our NIRS protocol. The control group had standard
      management without NIRS. Primary outcomes were post-operative neurological impairment and
      hospital length-of-stay. Secondary outcomes included ventilation times, intensive care unit
      length-of-stay, major organ dysfunction and mortality

    <description>Fluency and cognitive functions: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). This test is conducted as a questionnaire of 11 questions. Questions include 'what is the date?', 'name the town you are in?', spelling-forwards and backwards, counting backwards, copying a picture, follow an instruction, naming objects etc. The test is scored out of 30 and recorded in a table. The test is repeated on the third post op day and the 2 scores compared to give a number which relates to performance.</description>

HADS D- hospital anxiety and depression score relating to Depression. Patients are asked a question and their response is scored from 0-3. There are 14 questions the score is recorded and compared with the score after the same questions on the 3rd post-op day. The result gives an indication of the patient's mental state and how it may have changed dur to the sugery.</description>

    <description>A monitor by means of non-invasive stickers will display cerebral oximetry (brain oxygen saturations) throughout the heart surgery.This gives a direct reading of brain frontal lobe oxygen levels. The baseline is recorded before the patient goes to sleep (anaesthetised) and throughout the surgery and time on cardiopulmonary bypass if the brain oxygen levels fall below baseline then various physiological changes are made to restore oxygen to baseline.</description>
