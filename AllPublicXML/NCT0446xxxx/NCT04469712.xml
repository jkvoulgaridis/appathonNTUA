      The Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) is the procedure of choice in morbid obesity with
      metabolic disorders in most of the reference centers. Resent data describes the SASI
      Bipartition as being as efficient on weight loss and co-morbidities as the RYGB, with the
      advantage of being less technically difficult and less morbidity. In order to draw definite
      conclusions regarding the procedure, larger series with longer follow-up are necessary.

      Patients with BMI over 40, or with BMI over 35 with comorbidities are offered SASI
      Bipartition with 300 cm common limb or standard RYGB. Follow up is performed through visits
      at 3, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months after surgery.

      Results on weight loss, comorbidities resolution, complications, and need of supplements are
      registered.
