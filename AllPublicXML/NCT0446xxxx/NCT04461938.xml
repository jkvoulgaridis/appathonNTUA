  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nutritional interventions such as ketogenic diet (KD) or fasting are currently under
      evaluation as anti-cancer treatment. In glioma patient cohorts, the feasibility and safety of
      fasting in addition to antitumor treatment has been shown. However, it is still unclear
      whether fasting exerts effects on the glioma tumor tissue at all, and whether fasting causes
      metabolic or immunological changes in the glioma microenvironment that could be exploited
      therapeutically. Therefore, the central contribution of this study is to characterize
      metabolic and immunological changes in the glioma tumor tissue induced by a fasting cycle of
      72 hours prior to biopsy or resection.

    <measure>General metabolic changes</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days</time_frame>
    <description>Main target parameters of MR spectroscopic imaging are detection of intracerebral ketone bodies (acetone, acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate), changes in lactate and adenosine triphosphate / adenosine diphosphate (ATP/ADP) concentrations and changes in intracellular pH (pHi) as determined from the chemical shift difference between inorganic phosphate (Pi) and phosphocreatine (PCr). Tumor tissue and healthy appearing normal white matter of the contralateral hemisphere will be examined.
Tumor tissue will be analysed by metabolome and proteome analysis and RNA sequencing.</description>

    <description>A short questionnaire of 8 aspects concerning the tolerability of the diet will be handed out. The patients will be asked to grade their consensus to each statement by 1 to 5 where &quot;1&quot; is defined as &quot;not at all&quot; and 5 as &quot;very relevant&quot; for daily life.</description>

    <description>The study intervention consists of one fasting cycle of 72 hours prior to biopsy/resection. Depending on clinical condition, patients can be hospitalized during the course of the study (e.g. need for medical assistance due to immobilization). Patients in good clinical condition will be admitted on day 3.</description>
