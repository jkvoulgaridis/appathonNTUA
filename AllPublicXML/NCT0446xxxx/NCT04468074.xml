  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants with chronic back pain will complete an online eligibility questionnaire. After
      signing a consent form, eligible participants enter a two-week baseline period (&quot;Baseline
      Period&quot;) during which they complete a daily pain survey. Following the Baseline Period all
      participants complete an MRI scan. After the MRI, scan participants are randomized into a
      treatment group (&quot;Therapy Group&quot;) or a no-intervention group (&quot;Standard of Care Group&quot; or
      &quot;SOC Group&quot;) with a ratio of 1:1 (treatment:SOC). Therapy Group participants receive
      education about chronic pain. They also participate in sessions to personalize their Virtual
      Reality (VR) experience, and to complete training on the use of the VR hardware and software.
      Therapy Group participants complete the treatment for 8 weeks (&quot;Therapy Period&quot;), after which
      they return the VR equipment. All participants take a second MRI scan approximately 8-weeks
      after the first MRI; for the Therapy Group this is at the end of the Therapy Period. After
      the Therapy Period, Therapy Group participants continue to complete daily pain surveys during
      a two-week follow-up period (&quot;Follow-Up Period&quot;). All participants complete self-reported
      clinical outcomes and behavioral measures surveys before and after the Baseline Period, 4
      weeks after the first MRI (for Therapy Group this is mid-way through the Therapy Period), and
      before and after the Follow-Up Period. For Therapy Group participants the study ends with the
      final surveys and an exit interview at the end of the Follow-up Period. Study Extension
      (Add-on): SOC Group participants may receive the treatment after the Follow-Up period. Those
      who elect to do so will complete the same set of surveys as the Therapy Group did during the
      treatment phase; however, since there is no comparison group, data from this study extension
      is not used in the main outcomes analyses.

    <description>Therapy Group participants start the treatment period with three 1 Â½ hour introductory sessions:
An education session on the science behind chronic pain and a basic overview of the VR therapy.
A session to customize the VR experience to match the participant's own pain experience.
A training session on the use of the VR hardware and software.
Upon completion, participants begin using the VR therapy app at home once a day, 5 times a week (minimum), for a total of 8 weeks. The VR app contains different training exercises. A workbook provides a schedule and background on each of the training sessions.
Therapy Group participants may continue their other pain treatment regimes, and are asked to notify the research team of any changes.</description>

          -  Any clinically significant unstable medical abnormality or acute or chronic disease of
             cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary
             disease), hepatic, or renal systems; including: history of cardiovascular disease or
             issues (e.g., recent heart attack), stroke; brain surgery, or brain tumor; Diabetes;
             cancer (last 12 months); diagnosis of a specific inflammatory disorder: rheumatoid
             arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, scleroderma, Lupus; polymyositis; or Cauda Equina
             syndrome.

          -  History of head injury within 6 months,

          -  Unexplained, unintended weight loss of 'Ã¢â€¢ 20 lbs in past year.

          -  Self-reported history of (digital) eye strain or computer vision syndrome.

          -  Unable or unwilling to meet study attendance requirements.

          -  MRI contraindications as determined by MRI safety screen (e.g., pregnancy, metal in
             body, claustrophobia, using the standard screen conducted by the MRI imaging
             facility).
