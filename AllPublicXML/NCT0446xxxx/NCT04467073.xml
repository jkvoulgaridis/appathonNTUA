  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proof-of-concept study addresses the gap in the access to care literature by examining a
      stepped-care version of a telehealth naturalistic developmental behavioral intervention
      (NDBI), Online RIT. Online RIT is an interactive website introducing Reciprocal Imitation
      Training (RIT), an NDBI focused on enhancing social imitation. RIT uses a naturalistic
      behavioral approach to teach object and gesture imitation to young children with ASD within a
      play-based context. The efficacy of RIT has been demonstrated through a small randomized
      control trial, several single-subject design studies, as well as in independent replications.
      Prior research also suggests that parents can be taught to effectively use RIT with their
      children in person, and two single-subject design studies detail the development and
      feasibility testing of Online RIT plus therapist assistance. These preliminary data suggest
      Online RIT may serve as an ideal platform for examining the potential of individualized
      telehealth delivery formats, such as stepped-care. Therefore, the goal of this study was to
      compare a stepped-care format of Online RIT to a waitlist control condition to determine
      initial feasibility and effectiveness of this innovative intervention and service delivery
      model.

    <description>Participants completed four telehealth modules over a period of 5 weeks (~1 per week, 1 week to practice). Two variables were selected as tailoring variables for this stepped-care model. Fidelity (RIT-PFF) and self-efficacy (EIPSES) at 5 weeks were used to determine which participants were in need of a &quot;step up&quot; in care, in the form of remote parent coaching.
Parents who demonstrated â‰¥80% on the RIT-PFF, and who reported gains on the EIPSES continued to have access to Online RIT and practiced on their own for the next 5 weeks, but did not receive any remote coaching. Parents who demonstrated &lt;80% fidelity on the RIT-PFF and/or who didn't report increases in the EIPSES were directed into coaching. Coaching involved videoconferences once per week (wks. 6-10) with a parent coach (PI), and followed the occupational performance coaching model. Sessions included review of successes and challenges, parent practice with feedback, problem solving, and planning.</description>

    <description>Online RIT presents RIT techniques in four sequential learning modules: (1) Setting Up For Success (2) Imitating your Child (3) Describing Play (4) Teaching Object Imitation. Each learning module includes an instructional video, quiz, interactive exercises, and at-home planning and reflection. The website also includes a video library, Frequently Asked Questions, downloadable visual aids, links to relevant external resources, and a customizable &quot;dashboard&quot; that allows users to track their individualized goals and the amount of time they have spent working on their goals (e.g., practice log).</description>
