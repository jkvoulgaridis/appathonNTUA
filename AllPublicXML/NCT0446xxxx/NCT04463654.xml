  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), the deliberate, self-inflicted destruction of body tissue
      without suicidal intent and for purposes not socially sanctioned, is an increasing health
      care problem in Denmark. Approximately 20 % of Danish adolescents report a history of NSSI at
      some point in their lives. Individuals with NSSI have an increased risk of suicidality.
      Therefore, it is of great importance to develop and investigate the effectiveness of a
      low-cost app in reducing NSSI.

      The purpose is to investigate whether treatment as usual (TAU) and the Zero Self-Harm app is
      superior to TAU in reducing 1) frequency of NSSI-episodes and 2) suicide ideation,
      hopelessness, and depressive symptoms in individuals with NSSI. As people with NSSI, without
      a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis, are not eligible to receive psychiatric treatment in
      Denmark, TAU includes many different treatments and counseling services, i.e. counseling at
      non-profit organizations, service centers in the municipalities, outpatient treatment
      services for psychiatric disorders, and care, information and attention at emergency
      departments. Common to them all is that they do not offer specialized treatment focused on
      NSSI.

      The trial is designed as a 2-arm, parallel group, 6 months, randomized clinical superiority
      trial. A total of 366 participants, 183 in each arm, will be included. One group will receive
      TAU, the other will receive TAU and the Zero Self-Harm App. Participants will be recruited
      through non-profit organizations, service centers in the municipalities, outpatient treatment
      services, and psychiatric and somatic emergency departments in Denmark.

      Inclusion criteria are engagement in two or more episodes of NSSI in the past month, no
      further planned treatment, have a smartphone, fluent in Danish, provide an informed written
      consent, age above 15 years.

      Primary outcome is the mean monthly difference in frequency of NSSI-episodes at 6-month.
