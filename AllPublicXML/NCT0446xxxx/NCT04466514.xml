  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open-label, single dose, randomized, three-period, crossover design study to evaluate the
      effect of food on the bioavailability of a single oral dose of ASTX029 in healthy adult male
      and female participants.

      Following a screening period of up to 28 days, eligible participants will be enrolled and
      randomized to receive a single treatment (A, B, C) in a random order, with each treatment
      separated by an approximate 5-day washout period. The duration of the study is expected to be
      approximately 42 days.
