  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gougerot-Sjögren syndrome or Sjögren syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disease belonging to
      connectivitis, the classic triad of symptoms being the association of a sicca syndrome
      (generally predominant in the mouth and / or ocular, but also present at the cutaneous,
      vaginal or tracheal level), diffuse arthromyalgia and marked fatigue. The study investigators
      hypothesize that changes in the gut microbiota, by modulating gut permeability and thereby
      promoting microbial translocation, would have immunomodulatory effects that could be
      correlated to changes in the activity of Gougerot-Sjögren disease.
