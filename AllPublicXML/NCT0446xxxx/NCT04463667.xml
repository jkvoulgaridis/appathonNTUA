  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Taiwan, with the westernization of eating habit and lifestyle, metabolic syndrome and
      non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD) have become very important health issues. This project will
      therefore study the histological and clinical data of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver
      disease and explore the impact of exercise intervention on the hepatic fatty infiltration of
      the patients. The research strategy will include (1) combining modern artificial big data
      collection technology to fully monitor the daily life, sleep and exercise patterns of the
      participants; (2) improving fatty liver and metabolic syndrome through trial-based exercise
      intervention; and (3) exploring the changes of sleep patterns and intestinal microflora in
      patients with metabolic liver disease after exercise intervention.

      Background &amp; aims: In Taiwan, with the investigators sternization of eating habit and
      lifestyle, metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD) have become very
      important health issues. This project will therefore study the histological and clinical data
      of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and explore the impact of exercise
      intervention on the hepatic fatty infiltration of the patients. The research strategy will
      include (1) combining modern artificial big data collection technology to fully monitor the
      daily life, sleep and exercise patterns of the participants; (2) improving fatty liver and
      metabolic syndrome through trial-based exercise intervention; and (3) exploring the changes
      of sleep patterns and intestinal microflora in patients with metabolic liver disease after
      exercise intervention.

      Materials &amp; methods: The investigators will first retrospective collect clinical and
      histologic data of patients with biopsy proven NAFLD. Second, the investigators will
      establish a non-invasive fatty liver detection and staging platform at National Taiwan
      University Hospital. The investigators then plan to enroll 100 patients with non-alcoholic
      fatty liver from NTUH employees. The investigators will collect all basic information
      including intrahepatic fat and fibrosis severity, and assign them to the exercise
      intervention group (n = 80) and the observation group (n = 20) after conditional screening.
      After one year of exercise intervention, the investigators will analyze the effect of
      exercise on intrahepatic fat (main parameter: 20% reduction in intrahepatic fat; 30% achieved
      in the exercise intervention group; 5% achieved in the control group) and related metabolic
      syndrome indicators, and analyze different types of exercise Whether the intervention has
      different effects, and analyze the improvement of sleep pattern and intestinal microflora
      after exercise intervention.
