  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic surgery decreased the morbidity of colorectal surgery. The two most common
      surgeries for colorectal cancer are right and left colectomy.

      Objective: To compare perioperative morbidity of the right versus left colectomy for cancer,
      as well as the quality of laparoscopic oncologic resection of both procedures. Methods:
      Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from patients operated at the
      University of São Paulo School of Medicine, between 2006 and 2016. Postoperative
      complications were classified with scale within 30 days after surgery. Grade III or greater
      was considered serious complication. Quality of oncologic resection was assessed by the
      average number of lymph nodes harvested and surgical margins.
