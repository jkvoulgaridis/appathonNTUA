  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It may be hard to acquire stable sensorimotor rhythm from the affected motor cortex for
      patient without a response of paretic hand. A few studies suggest two ways to approaching
      closed-loop therapy: peripherally extracting the residual signals, for example electromyogram
      (EMG) at proximal muscles (deltoids) and centrally extracting the activity patterns from
      unaffected hemisphere during attempting to move paretic hand. Therefore, understanding neural
      signatures of residual upper extremity movement among stroke patients might help in
      discovering potential therapeutic target and developing tailored brain-computer interface
      (BCI) therapy. Additionally, 59.4% of stroke patients in acute stage impair at least one
      somatosensory modality. It remains unclear whether the patient with somatosensory impairment
      hinder BCI effect.

  <detailed_description>

      Investigators will consecutively enroll subacute (1-4 weeks after stroke onset) patients with
      first-time, unilateral, subcortical stroke and age-matched healthy controls. All participants
      will carry on 2 sequential experiments. In the first experiment, participants will perform 2
      motor tasks using either paretic/nondominant upper extremity or non-paretic/dominant upper
      extremity, called motor attempt (M) condition or calibration condition. The second experiment
      contains 3 conditions: cyclic functional electrical stimulation (cFES), cFES during motor
      attempt (M-cFES), and functional electrical stimulation during brain-computer interface
      (BCI-FES) in random order. The sensorimotor oscillations from the electroencephalography
      (EEG), upper extremity sensorimotor function score (Fugl-Meyer test, Action Research Arm
      test, and Revised Nottingham Sensation Assessment), corticospinal excitability from the
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and resting-state functional and structural
      neuroimage from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be assessed before and after the final
      experiment, as well as 3 months after stroke.
