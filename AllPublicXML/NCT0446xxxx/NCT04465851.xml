    <textblock>
      INTRODUCTION: Iron is a vital nutrient for many physiological processes including DNA
      production, oxygen transport and neuronal processes. However, several factors limit iron
      absorption including: limited bioavailability of iron (dietary or supplementation sources),
      can be subject to dietary iron inhibitors (e.g. calcium). Excess iron can cause cellular
      oxidative stress in the body.

      Curcumin is an active component found in turmeric, known for its anti-oxidant and
      anti-inflammatory properties. Co-administration of iron and curcumin may influence iron,
      inflammatory status and/or neurotrophic markers in the body.

      Intervention study with five parallel treatment groups in a randomised, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled design.

      Study population: Healthy Participants (Male or Female) will receive daily supplements
      (active or equivalent placebos) for 6 weeks (42 days)

      Biological samples (blood and urine samples) are collected at baseline visit (day 1),
      mid-point (day 21) and end-point (day 42). In addition, pertinent questionnaires (Visual
      Analogue Scale-Fatigue [VAS-F] and oral iron supplement questionnaire will be collected at
      the aforementioned time points.
