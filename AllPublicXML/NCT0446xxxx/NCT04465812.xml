  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This smartphone-based personalized multiple intervention study aims to prevent cognitive
      impairment and reduce dementia and cerebrovascular events in 45-74 year old persons with high
      risk of stroke in China. The investigators plan to monitor and manage participants'
      behavioral and health (vascular risk factors control, sleep quality, mental health and
      cognitive training) based on self-monitoring and personalized feedback via smartphone app.
      The short-term primary outcome is 1-year change in global cognitive score measured by a
      modified National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and Canadian Stroke
      Network-Canadian Stroke Network protocol. The investigators hypothesize that the intervention
      based on self-monitoring and personalized feedback will prevent cognitive decline by the
      initial 1-year intervention. The long-term primary outcome is the development of dementia and
      cerebrovascular events during a total of 5 years' follow-up. The investigators hypothesize
      that the smartphone-based personalized multiple intervention may reduce the 5-year risk of
      dementia and cerebrovascular events, mainly through the improvement in vascular risk factors
      control, sleep quality, mental health and cognitive training activities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with ≥ 3 stroke risk factors (including hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, atrial
      fibrillation or valvular heart disease, smoking history, obvious overweight or obesity, lack
      of exercise, family history of stroke), or with transient ischemic attack, are regarded as
      patients with high risk of stroke. Studies have indicated that these stroke risk factors
      might be associated with an increased risk of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) progress,
      glymphatic dysfunction, cognitive decline, dementia, and cerebrovascular events. However,
      prevention in these patients is largely unknown and the management of these patients is a
      very troublesome issue. Previous study has demonstrated that interventions in the feedback
      and monitoring method could improve exercise adherence in older people compared with other
      methods including comparison of behavior, social support, natural consequences, identity and
      goals and planning. Therefore, the investigators plan to monitor and manage vascular risk
      factors control, sleep quality, mental health and cognitive training based on self-monitoring
      and personalized feedback on a smartphone app in patients with high risk of stroke. The
      investigators hypothesize that the intervention based on self-monitoring and personalized
      feedback will reduce cognitive impairment, glymphatic dysfunction, CSVD progress, depressive
      symptoms, anxious symptoms, improve sleep quality, and reduce dementia and cerebrovascular
      events incidence in the study group compared to the control group.
