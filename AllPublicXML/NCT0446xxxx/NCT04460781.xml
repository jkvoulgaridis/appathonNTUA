      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the safety of Flublok Quadrivalent influenza vaccine in pregnant women included
      in the VAP00003 Study (NCT03694392) and their offspring exposed during pregnancy or up to 28
      days preceding the estimated date of conception with regards to pregnancy, birth, and
      neonatal/infant outcomes

      Secondary Objective:
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data will be recorded prospectively during the safety follow-up for pregnant women until
      delivery (or pregnancy outcome, whichever is later), and for infants of pregnant women for 1
      year after birth.

        Women were not randomized. A modified-cluster randomization scheme was used. Facilities
        were assigned to blocks and were randomized within blocks, ensuring that roughly half the
        facilities within each block initially administer one vaccine of the 2 vaccines planned in
        the study, and the other half administer the alternate vaccine. Iteratively, over time, the
        vaccine administered within each facility will then alternate.
