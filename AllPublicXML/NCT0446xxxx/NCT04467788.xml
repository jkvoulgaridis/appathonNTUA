  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A healthy dentist is one of the most important components of a successful dental practice. It
      is estimated that more than half of practitioners have some kind of painful work-related
      musculoskeletal disorders.

      It was reported that 80% of dental students were not aware of ergonomic posture during dental
      procedures. It is believed that dental students with knowledge of ergonomic principals would
      be able to maintain their health. Some studies demonstrated that the frequency and severity
      of WMSDs might decrease by training the dentists on ergonomic principles.

      This study will be carried out on dental interns in Department of Pediatric Dentistry and
      Dental Public Health, in Faculty of Dentistry-Cairo University. The procedures will be
      carried out by postgraduate student Nourhan Saad Mohamed who has M.D.S. (2018) - Cairo
      University- Egypt, and works as Assistant Lecturer in Future University in Egypt. The
      procedures will be done without assistant at a lecture room and outpatient clinic of
      Pediatric Dentistry in Cairo University.

      At baseline, evaluation of knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) on ergonomics in dentistry
      will be do e through a self-structured questionnaire.

      Afterwards, the participants will be split into two groups. One group will recieve training
      on ergonomic principles through clinical simulation session, while the other group will
      recieve training through Computer-aided sessions.

      KAP will be re-evaluated after the training sessions to evaluate the change in KAP about
      ergonomics.
