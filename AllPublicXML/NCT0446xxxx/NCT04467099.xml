  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study's aim is to determine the incidence of flexor hallucis tendon tears associated with
      os trigonum excision. The study will then compare the length until functional return to play
      of the patients who had flexor hallucis tendon tears with concomitant os trigonum excision
      versus those without flexor hallucis tendon tears who underwent os trigonum excision. Lastly,
      the study will be evaluating the patient complaints and physical exam findings before and
      after surgery and compare those without flexor hallucis tendon tears to those with flexor
      hallucis tendon repair.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posterior ankle pain syndrome has many etiologies. Two main causes of this are flexor
      hallucis tendon tear and os trigonum impingement. The current teaching is that patients with
      flexor hallucis longus tear complain of posterior medial ankle pain and those with posterior
      lateral ankle pain have an os trigonum impingement. It is also classically understood that
      patients with flexor hallucis tendon tears take longer to return to their pre-injury level of
      function. Our clinical experience refutes these reports and our study looks to further
      evaluate it.

      This study brings back patients who were treated by the study doctor. The patient's
      preoperative evaluation will be reviewed including clinic notes and imaging. The operative
      reports for these patients will be reviewed to verify the surgery procedure performed. These
      patients will be included in the study and we will utilize the American Academy of Orthopedic
      Surgeons Foot, Ankle, and Lower Limb module that they have completed postoperatively. This
      measure of patient's functional and subjective satisfaction has already been completed by
      patients at their regularly scheduled follow up appointments and is available for review.

      Prospectively, patients will be asked to return to the clinic for a follow-up evaluation,
      which includes a standard x-ray. All patients will be consented prior to data collection,
      minors included in this study will be asked to sign an assent as well. Many factors will be
      assessed such as; a range of motion test of the ankle utilizing goniometric technique, nerve
      path and function, stability ankle grading, radiologic findings, and patient-reported
      outcomes filled out pre and postoperatively.
