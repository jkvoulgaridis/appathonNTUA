  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to examine the effects of a sleep extension intervention on the metabolic and
      cardio-vascular profile of obese people who present traditional diabetes risk factors, and
      who are habitually sleep deprived. Participants randomized to the intervention arm will
      complete a 6-week sleep extension intervention, whilst the control group will maintain their
      habitual sleep schedule. It is hypothesized that the sleep extension intervention will
      significantly increase total sleep time, and will be accompanied by significant
      metabolic-related changes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent epidemiological (survey) research, conducted in both in healthy populations and among
      those with existing chronic disease, shows that insufficient sleep can significantly
      contribute to ill health (including diabetes, heart disease and obesity). These findings have
      also been accompanied by credible explanatory mechanisms emphasising the role of sleep in
      regulating appetite, satiety, glucose and daytime stamina. Sleep extension, therefore, is a
      largely unexplored pathway for improving individual health, and reducing an existing risk of
      diabetes. If successful, increased sleep duration and quality could be adopted as an
      achievable public health intervention.

      The study aims to recruit a total of 20 men, overweight, presenting traditional risks of
      developing diabetes, who are habitually short sleepers. Participants are then randomized,
      stratified by weight status, to a sleep extension group, or a control sleep monitoring group.
      Baseline measures include sleep actigraphy, continuous glucose monitoring, blood pressure,
      and a mixed-meal tolerance test; after the 6-week intervention, the same measures are
      repeated.

    <description>Intervention group participants met with an experienced sleep scientist to discuss and agree changes to their sleep and personal schedules. Discussions lasted 60-90 minutes, were informed by actigraphic sleep assessments from the baseline period, and aimed to increase TST by ≥1 hour/night. The structure and content of the &quot;About Sleep&quot;, &quot;Sleep Hygiene&quot; and &quot;Thoughts and Sleep&quot; components of the online Sleepful application, a self-help sleep management programme. Advice was supported by the provision of self-help booklets addressing sleep hygiene and the management of pre-sleep cognitions which had been successfully trailed in an intervention for insomnia symptoms. Finally, to capitalize on the participant's motivation at recruitment, and optimize adherence, the newly agreed sleep schedule was written into an agreement which the participant was asked to sign, simulating a 'therapeutic contract'. Schedules were reviewed by telephone at the end of the first week and revised if required.</description>

    <description>The sleep extension programme was designed around four alternative assumptions: 1) that among this group of habitual short sleepers, extending time in bed (TIB) would represent a significant behavioral change to established night-time and daytime routines; 2) that for practical purposes (accommodating personal, family and work schedules) extended time in bed is best anchored against typical rise-times; 3) that sleep onset may represent a particular challenge for those advancing habitual bed-times by over 1 hour each night; and 4) that in consenting to the trial, participants were motivated to make and sustain behavioral change.</description>
