    <textblock>
      This prospective, single-center, open-label, investigator-sponsored clinical study seeks to
      investigate the outcomes of patients undergoing vitro-retinal surgery with the treatment of a
      dexamethasone intracanalicular insert. All patients in the treatment groups will receive a
      dexamethasone intracanalicular insert. There will be three experimental groups of patients,
      varying that time of insertion. Ten patients will receive the dexamethasone intracanalicular
      insert pre-operatively (1 week to 1 days prior to vitreo-retinal surgery). Ten patients will
      receive dexamethasone intracanalicular insert on the day of surgery. Ten patients will
      receive DEXTENZA insert Day 1 post-operatively. Ten patients will be prescribed standard of
      care ophthalmic drops, Prednisolone Acetate, and no dexamethasone insert (control group). All
      patients no matter what cohort will receive Gentamicin, antibiotic ophthalmic drops.

    <description>The insert, containing 0.4 mg of active pharmaceutical product, is placed within the canaliculus to provide a sustained and tapered delivery of drug to the ocular surface over 30 days after a one-time insertion.

          -  Corticosteroid depot/implant in the study eye - 2 months

             used to transiently highlight the vitreous and removed during vitrectomy) is
             permissible in study eye.

          -  Intraoperatively or perioperatively used systemic steroid for the purpose of general
             anesthesia (as administered by the treating anesthesiologist) is permissible.

          -  Patients with systemic illness involving abnormalities of the
             hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; patients with primary adrenocortical
