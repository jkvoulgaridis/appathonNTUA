      This is a post-market, open-label, prospective, multi-center, observational study evaluating
      upper limb pain relief with the DTM™ SCS programming approach.

      Data at follow-up visits will be compared to baseline assessments collected at the beginning
      of the study.

      The expected total duration of this study is approximately 12 months. Enrollment of
      participants is expected to last 6 months. Participants that have received the permanent
      implant will be followed up for 3 months after their device has been activated. A participant
      will likely be committed to the study for about 5 months. This consists of Baseline
      assessments, up to 10 days of trial stimulation, and 3 months of treatment following
      implantation and activation of the device.
