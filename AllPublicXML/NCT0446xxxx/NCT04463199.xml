    <textblock>
      Using computer for long hours is related to higher risk of computer related muscular
      disorders like forward head posture and neck pain. Deep cervical flexor muscles are important
      head-on-neck posture stabilizers thus their training may lead to improvement in forward head
      posture (FHP) and neck pain (NP).

      In contemporary societies, computer use by children is a necessity and thus highly prevalent.
      Using computer for long hours is related to higher risk of computer-related muscular
      disorders like forward head posture and neck pain. Deep cervical flexor muscles are important
      head-on-neck posture stabilizers thus their training may lead to improvement in forward head
      posture (FHP) and neck pain (NP). Aim of study was to determine if 4 weeks of deep cervical
      flexors training is effective in alleviating neck pain and improving forward head posture in
      adolescent children using computer regularly. A pretest-posttest experimental group design
      was used. Subjects were randomly assigned into control group (receiving postural advice only)
      and experimental group (receiving deep cervical flexor training and postural advice).
      Dependent variables were measured on day 0 (at baseline) and after 4weeks of training. The
      photographic analysis was used for measuring forward head posture, visual analog scale (VAS)
      for neck pain intensity and Neck Disability Index (NDI) for functional disability.
      Experimental group received craniocervical flexion training for 4 weeks and postural advice.
      Control group received only postural advice.

    <description>Change in Neck pain intensity assessed from baseline at 4 weeks interval. It is a scale on a piece of paper equal to the length of 10 cm. Each centimeter has 1 point, with 0 means &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 means &quot;worst pain felt ever&quot;. Lower the score, better the outcome measure.</description>

    <description>PBU airbag was clipped together and folded in, fastened, and placed suboccipital. Uninflated pressure sensor was kept below the neck, so that it touched the occiput then inflated to a stable baseline pressure of 20 mmHg to just fill the space below the neck but not to push it into lordosis. Subjects were demonstrated the correct action of the deep cervical flexors that is gentle nodding of head as if saying &quot;yes&quot;.</description>
