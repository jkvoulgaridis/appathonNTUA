      The purpose of this study is to characterize the Freestyle Libre 3 Glucose Monitoring System
      in pediatric and adult subjects with respect to YSI reference venous plasma sample
      measurements.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 100 subjects will be enrolled at up to six (6) clinical research sites in the United
      States. Subjects will wear two Sensors. Each Sensor will have a paired Reader that will be
      given to the subject. Subjects will be asked to perform at least 4 capillary Blood Glucose
      (BG) tests per day using the primary Reader.

      Interstitial glucose readings from each Sensor will be obtained with the corresponding
      Readers immediately following each BG test. Subjects will be instructed to report any
      problems with the device. Subjects will make up to six (6) scheduled visits to the clinical
      study site, including the Enrollment/Screening Visit (Visit 1). Based on the subjects' age
      and

      /or weight, subjects will have up to three (3) in- clinic visits during which intravenous
      blood draws and YSI reference testing will occur.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject must be at least 4 years of age.

          2. Subject must have type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

          3. Subject must require insulin therapy through an insulin pump and/or multiple daily
             insulin injections (at least 3 injections daily).

          4. Willing to perform a minimum of 4 finger sticks per day while wearing the sensor in
             the study.

          5. Subject must be able to read and understand English.

          6. For subjects age 6 and older: willing to allow medical personnel to insert an IV
             catheter in the arm to allow for venous blood samples to be obtained per the study
             protocol.

          7. In the investigator's opinion, the subject must be able to follow the instructions
             provided to him/her by the study site and perform all study tasks as specified by the
             protocol.

          8. At the time of enrollment, subject must be available to participate in all study
             visits.

          9. Subjects aged 18 years and older must be willing and able to provide written signed
             and dated informed consent.

         10. Subjects aged 17 years and younger must have a parent, guardian or legally authorized

             and dated informed assent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has known allergy to medical grade adhesive or isopropyl alcohol used to
             disinfect skin.

          2. Subjects age 18 and older: Subject is known to be pregnant, attempting to conceive or
             is not willing and able to practice birth control during the study duration

             during the study (only applicable to female subjects age 17 years and younger)

          4. Subject has extensive skin changes/diseases at the proposed application sites that
             could interfere with device placement or the accuracy of interstitial glucose
             measurements. Such conditions include, but are not limited to extensive psoriasis,
             recent burns or severe sunburn, extensive eczema, extensive scarring, dermatitis
             herpetiformis, skin lesions, redness, infection or edema.
