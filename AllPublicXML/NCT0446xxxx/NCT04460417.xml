    <textblock>
      The study examined smokers from the initial COMPASS survey who live in one of three local
      Census tracks with large concentrations of minority populations and smoking rates, including
      Washington Park (98.8% African American, 60.5% smoker), Gage Park (76.7% Hispanic, 26.7%
      smoker), and Bridgeport (34.5% Asian, 27.0% Hispanic, 29.3% smoker), randomizing them to
      receipt of treatment as usual care advice (via a pamphlet form the National Cancer Institute)
      versus theoretically-driven and empirically-supported smoking cessation advice session
      delivered in-person at the UCM.

    <description>Participants will take part in an approximate one-hour health and smoking feedback session at the University of Chicago in Dr. King's Clinical Addictions Research Laboratory (CARL). The session will follow the Courage to Quitâ„¢ (CTQ) Roadmap program (developed by Dr. King with the Respiratory Health Association). This roadmap shorter version of the larger CTQ program has been specifically designed as an inpatient bedside or outpatient brief intervention guide to assess smoking cessation motivation, consequences of smoking, facts and myths about smoking, barriers to making a change, approved medications, de-bunking myths about medications or treatments without scientific evidence (e-cigarette, laser treatments, herbals, etc.), and gaining social support.</description>

    <description>The session began with the therapist reviewing the participants' personal feedback sheet within the context of clear messaging that there is no safe level of smoking and of how smoking affects the participant individually and the Black community collectively. The participant was encouraged to quit smoking, else to reduce smoking if abstinence was not desired, and to use NRT within the next week to help foster behavior change and alleviate withdrawal symptoms. This portion of the counseling was presented within a culturally-targeted framework such that myths regarding NRT common among persons with low health literacy were discussed and debunked and historical mistrust of the medical community and concerns about exploitation were also addressed. Each participant in EC was offered a starter kit of NRT with a one week supply of patches or lozenges.</description>

    <description>Participants met with a research assistant for 3-5 minutes and received the National Cancer Institute (NCI) pamphlet &quot;Clearing the Air&quot; and access to related online resources, which includes brief advice to quit smoking and medication information. They did not receive counseling or specialized care and were advised to refer to the resources should they be interested in quitting smoking.</description>
