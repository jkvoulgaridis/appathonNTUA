      This study is aim to study the changes of serum creatinine levels at 72 hours after admission
      in patients with acute heart failure who has diuretic resistance compared to those who do not
      have diuretic resistance from furosemide stress test

      This study is an observational prospective study to demonstrate a prognosis of acute heart
      failure patients who have diuretic resistance compared to those who do not have diuretic
      resistance from furosemide stress test. The primary outcome is changes of serum creatinine
      levels at 72 hours compared to baseline values at the time of admission.

    <description>This group includes acute heart failure patients who has diuretic resistance from furosemide stress test. Furosemide stress test will be performed by administration of intravenous furosemide 1 mg/kg in patients who do not receive oral furosemide before and 1.5 mg/kg patients who have received oral furosemide before. Diuretic resistance was defined as urine output &lt;250 hr at 2 hours after furosemide administration.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Heart failure without diuretic resistance</arm_group_label>
    <description>This group includes acute heart failure patients who do not have diuretic resistance from furosemide stress test. Furosemide stress test will be performed by administration of intravenous furosemide 1 mg/kg in patients who do not receive oral furosemide before and 1.5 mg/kg patients who have never received oral furosemide before. Patients will be defined not to have diuretic resistance if their urine output ≥250 hr at 2 hours after furosemide administration.</description>
