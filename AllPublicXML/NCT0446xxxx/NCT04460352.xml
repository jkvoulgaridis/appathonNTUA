      NEEDS is a pragmatic open-label, randomised, controlled, phase III, multicenter trial with
      non-inferiority design with regard to the primary endpoint overall survival and superiority
      for the experimental intervention definitive chemoradiotherapy with regard to the main
      secondary endpoint global health related quality of life (HRQOL) one year after
      randomisation.

      The aim is to compare outcomes after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with subsequent
      esophagectomy to definitive chemoradiotherapy with surveillance and salvage esophagectomy as
      needed in patients with resectable locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the
      esophagus, with the aim to provide generalisable guidance for future clinical practice.
