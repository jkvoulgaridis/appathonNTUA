    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics
      of single oral fadanafil tablet 100mg in healthy subjects.

      Fadanafil is a selective phosphodiesterase (PDE5) inhibitor. The proposed Phase 1b trial is a
      single center, randomized, open-label, two-period crossover study in approximately 14 Chinese
      healthy adult male subjects.
