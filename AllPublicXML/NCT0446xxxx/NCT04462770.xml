    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof of concept trial
      to evaluate the efficacy of EPX-100 (clemizole hydrochloride) in children with Dravet
      Syndrome. The 20-week study begins with a 4-week Observational Phase which will establish
      seizure frequency and eligibility for treatment, followed by a 4-week Titration Phase to
      identify the maximum tolerated dose in each patient. Thereafter, the patient will enter into
      a 12-week Maintenance Phase. A battery of chemistries, hematology, urinalysis,
      pharmacokinetics, and ECG's will be monitored throughout the 20-week study. The patient will
      have the opportunity to enter a 52-week Open-Label Extension phase at the end of the
      Maintenance Phase. The primary endpoint is the percent change in the 28-day seizure frequency
      in the final 4-weeks of the 12-week Maintenance Phase relative to the 4-week Observational
      Phase in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population between active and placebo (3:1)
      therapy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical diagnosis of Dravet Syndrome. Participants must have seizures which are not
             completely controlled by anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) with the following criteria:

               -  Onset of frequent seizures prior to 18 months of age,

               -  Normal development at onset,

               -  History of seizures that are generalized, unilateral clonic, and/or hemi-clonic,
                  namely:

                    -  Hemi-clonic (Note: Lateralization - right body, left body, or independent R
                       and L)

                    -  Focal with clear, observable motor signs (i.e., automatisms, dystonic
                       posturing, focal tonic stiffening)

                    -  Secondarily generalized tonic clonic (evolving to bilateral convulsive
                       seizure from focal seizure)

                    -  Generalized tonic clonic convulsion

                    -  Tonic

                    -  Clonic (note bilateral: symmetric R and L)

                    -  Tonic/Atonic - aka 'drop attacks'

               -  Brain MRI without cortical malformation, and

               -  Genetic mutation of the sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 1 (SCN1A) gene
                  must be documented.

          2. The participant must be approved to participate by the PI after a review of the
             medical history, baseline seizure calendars and inclusion/exclusion criteria. The
             Independent Reviewer will confirm Dravet Syndrome diagnosis for each participant
             enrolled in the study.

          3. Seizure criteria of ≥4 countable convulsive seizures (tonic-clonic, tonic, clonic,
             atonic, focal with observable motor signs) per 4-week baseline period (Observational
             Phase).

          4. Participants should be on a stable regimen of AEDs≥30days prior to Visit 1 and
             generally in good health.

          5. Parent or Legal Authorised Representative (LAR) is willing and able to maintain an
             accurate and complete daily seizure calendar.

          6. Sexually active women of child-bearing potential (WCBP) must be using a medically
             acceptable method of birth control and have a negative urine pregnancy test at the
             screening visit. A WCBP is defined as a female who is biologically capable of becoming
             pregnant. A medically acceptable method of birth control includes intrauterine devices
             in place for at least 3 months, surgical sterilization, or adequate barrier methods
             (e.g., diaphragm and foam). Use of oral contraceptives in combination with another
             method (e.g., a spermicidal cream) is acceptable. In participants who are not sexually
             active, abstinence is an acceptable form of birth control and urine will be tested per
             protocol. Women who are of non-child-bearing potential, i.e., post-menopause, must
             have this condition captured in their medical history. Pregnant women are excluded
             from this study.

          7. Have parent or LAR available and willing to give written informed consent, after being
             properly informed of the nature and risks of the study and prior to engaging in any
             study-related procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following excludes a participant from study enrollment:

          1. Known sensitivity, allergy, or previous exposure to EPX-100 (clemizole HCl).

          2. Exposure to any investigational drug or device &lt;90 days prior to screening or plans to
             participate in another drug or device trial at any time during the study.

          3. Seizures secondary to illicit drug or alcohol use, infection, neoplasm, demyelinating
             disease, degenerative neurological disease, or central nervous system (CNS) disease
             deemed progressive, metabolic illness, or progressive degenerative disease.

          4. Concurrent use of drugs known to interfere with EPX-100, including moderate or severe
             inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4/5/7. Specifically, concurrent use of carbamazepine,
             oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, and/or phenobarbital, or fenfluramine as an investigational
             drug, are excluded, as well as refraining from grapefruits and grapefruit juice during
             the study period.

          5. Has any medical condition that, in the PI's judgement, is considered to be clinically
             significant and could potentially affect participant safety or study outcome,
             including but not limited to: clinically significant cardiac disease (including
             angina, congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, and history of
             arrhythmias), renal, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hematologic or hepatic conditions;
             or a condition that affects the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of
             drugs.

          6. Has an active suicidal plan/intent or have had active suicidal thoughts in the past 6
             months or a suicide attempt in the past 3 years.
