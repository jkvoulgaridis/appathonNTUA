  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
      to assess the PK, safety, tolerability and PD of CB-0406 in healthy participants. The study
      will be conducted as a 2-part study.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a 2-part study:

      Part 1 is designed as single ascending dose (SAD) escalation study investigating 5 dose
      levels. Each cohort will consist of participants (N=8) to be randomly assigned to receive a
      blinded oral dose of CB-0406 (n=6) or placebo (n=2). Dose levels of CB-0406 in the sequential
      cohorts will be 100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg, 800 mg or 1000 mg to be administered once on each
      cohorts study Day 1.

      Part 2 is designed as multiple ascending dose (MAD) escalation study investigating up to 5
      dose levels as determined by the SAD cohort. Doses will be determined following completion
      and review of the safety and PK findings for Cohorts 1 to Cohort 5 in Part 1.

                  confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or
                  hormonal replacement therapy; however, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea,
                  a single FSH measurement is insufficient);

             system; or a disease requiring medical treatment;

          2. Previous history of any surgical or medical condition that might significantly alter
             the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of CB-0406, such as stomach or
