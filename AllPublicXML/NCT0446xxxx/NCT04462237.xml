  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present randomized clinical trial is aimed at evaluating the efficacy of recombinant
      human platelet-derived growth factor in combination with collagen matrix for the treatment of
      multiple adjacent gingival recessions
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the fact that gingival recession is most often a generalized condition rather than
      being localized to a single tooth, most of the data currently found in the literature
      pertains to the treatment of localized gingival recessions.

      The gold standard treatment for this condition involves the use of an autogenous connective
      tissue graft, that is associated with increased patient morbidity.

      Biomaterials have progressively gained popularity due to their advantages when compared to
      autogenous grafts, such as unrestricted availability, avoidance of a secondary surgical site,
      reduction of the surgical time, and the patient's preference.

      Collagen matrix is one of the most used soft tissue substitute for the treatment of gingival
      recessions. Combining this scaffold material with a growth factor could enhance its outcomes.
      In particular, root coverage using platelet-derived growth factor can also promote
      regeneration of new cementum, periodontal ligament and bone.

      Therefore, the aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of platelet-derived
      growth factor in combination with collagen matrix outcomes for the treatment of multiple
      adjacent gingival recessions.
