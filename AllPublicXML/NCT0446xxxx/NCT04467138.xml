      Retrospective analysis of 51 patients (27 female, 24 male, mean age 51.5±12.6 years) who
      received all-in-one PN including amino acids, glucose and lipids supplemented with pure fish
      oil LE was performed.

      All patients depended on parenteral nutrition (PN) are prone to inflammation. This condition
      may aggravate already existing proinflammatory status and can become a critical factor for
      developing liver dysfunction (LD). Intravenous fish oil may attenuate the inflammatory
      status, , however, data on its use in adults is scarce. The aim of the study was to
      investigate the impact of the addition of pure fish oil intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) as
      part of short- and long term PN in patients either at risk or with already existing
      inflammation.

      Retrospective analysis of 51 patients (27 female, 24 male, mean age 51.5±12.6 years) who
      received all-in-one PN including amino acids, glucose and lipids supplemented with pure fish
      oil LE was performed. Pure fish oil emulsion (Omegaven®, Fresenius Kabi) was used as the
      additional product along with the standard lipid emulsion to reach a fish oil dose of approx.
      0.5 g fish oil/kg/d. Diagnoses were chronic intestinal failure (CIF, n=20), Crohn's disease
      (CD, n=22), and Ulcerative colitis (UC, n=19). The observation period was 12 months for CIF
      and 21days for UC and CD.
