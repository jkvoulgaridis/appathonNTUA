             lesion.

             I. Thoracoscopic surgery or thoracotomy with excision of the affected lung or
             esophagus or mediastinum (however, a history of thoracoscopic surgery without wedge

             systemic treatment (Pemphigus, psoriasis vulgaris, pemphigus vulgaris, vitiligo), and
             celiac disease controlled only by dietary control are regarded as eligible if they
             have been inactive in the past 5 years, even with a history of autoimmune
             complications or history.

             echocardiography, exercise electrocardiography, etc. should be performed, and if it is
             judged that new treatment for ischemic heart disease is not necessary, it is
             qualified.

         17. The latest inspection value within 14 days before registration (possible on the same
             day two weeks before the registration date) satisfies all of the following.
