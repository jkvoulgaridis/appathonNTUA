  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most common respiratory diseases,
      with 90% of cases directly attributable to smoking. Unfortunately, many patients continue to
      smoke and have an urgent need to quit. Proactive tobacco treatment programs identify patients
      outside of a routine clinical appointment and engage them in making a supported quit attempt.

      Most previous research of proactive tobacco treatment has used telephone outreach, which can
      be resource intensive. Electronic methods (texting, secure messaging) may be effective while
      requiring fewer resources.

      In this study, a previously tested telephone outreach intervention will be adapted for
      electronic delivery, with content tailored to smokers with COPD. First, information will be
      gathered from smokers with COPD and the medical staff who care for them to adapt the program
      for electronic delivery. Then, the program will be pilot-tested. Smokers with COPD will be
      randomly assigned to either usual medical care or the outreach intervention, with goals to
      increase participation in smoking cessation programs, quit attempts, and successful
      cessation.

    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most common respiratory conditions
      and the 4th leading cause of death in the US. 90% of cases are directly attributable to
      smoking. Quitting smoking is the most important intervention for these patients, who continue
      to smoke at rates double the national average. Smokers with COPD remain undertreated for
      tobacco use. Proactive tobacco treatment programs identify patients outside of a routine
      clinic visit, engage them in making a quit attempt and connect them with treatment. These
      programs may be particularly beneficial for smokers with COPD. Previous phone-based programs
      are resource intensive to deliver. Electronic methods for delivering proactive outreach for
      tobacco cessation may be effective and cost-effective, and can be tailored to the target
      population.

      Hypothesis: A proactive tobacco treatment program adapted to electronic delivery and tailored
      to smokers with COPD will be effective and cost effective for increasing quit engagement
      among smokers with COPD.

      Study design: Multi-aim implementation study with randomized pilot. Aim 1: Mixed methods
      (survey and interview) assessment of current use of health information technology among
      smokers with COPD with a focus on the impact of the chronic disease state on tobacco
      cessation.

      Aim 2: Qualitative assessment of barriers and facilitators to implementation of proactive
      tobacco treatment programs for patients with COPD among staff and leadership.

      Aim 3: Randomized pilot of a proactive tobacco treatment program for smokers with COPD
      delivered through secure messaging, compared to usual care. Sub-aim will assess marginal cost
      associated with the program.
