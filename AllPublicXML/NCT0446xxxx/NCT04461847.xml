  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The consideration of quality of life issues has led to the development of alternative
      surgeries for breast cancer patients, particularly in the case of localized disease.
      Nipple-sparing subcutaneous mastectomy (SM), for example, was designed to preserve the
      nipple-areola complex which facilitates breast reconstruction. However, SM still leaves
      behind a conspicuous scar.There have already been some observation study show that endoscopic
      subcutaneous mastectomy(ESM) can improve the cosmesis outcomes and at the same time as safe
      as the traditional SM.However there is no RCT in this field.That is why the investigators
      design this study.
