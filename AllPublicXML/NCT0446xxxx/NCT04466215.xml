  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypotheses under test are that alcohol dependent subjects treated with CORT118335
      will report decreased craving for alcohol following alcohol exposure in the laboratory and
      report significantly less drinking under naturalistic conditions, than those treated with
      placebo.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female volunteers, 18-65 years of age.

          -  Meets DSM-5 criteria for current alcohol use disorder of moderate or greater severity
             (AUD-MS).

          -  In the month prior to screening, reports drinking &gt; 21 standard drinks per week if
             male, &gt; 14 if female, with at least one heavy drinking day (≥ 5 males, ≥ 4 females)
             per week

          -  Subjects will not be seeking treatment because the medication studies are not
             treatment trials, and to avoid exposing treatment-seekers to alcohol cues.

          -  Subjects must be abstinent a minimum of 3 days (but not more than 7 days) prior to the
             human lab session.

          -  Negative BAC and a CIWA score of &lt; 9 at screening and time of lab session to eliminate
             acute alcohol or withdrawal effects on dependent measures.

          -  In acceptable health in the judgment of the study physician, based on interview,
             medical history, physical exam, ECG, routine urine and blood chemistry.

          -  Subjects with a history of depression, who have been on a stable dose of
             anti-depressant medication for at least 3 months, and do not meet current DSM-5
             criteria for depression or anxiety.

          -  Females with childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test on the
             screening visit with a negative urine pregnancy test at randomization and agree to use
             an effective double barrier birth control for the study duration and one month
             thereafter.

          -  Males must agree to use double barrier birth control for the study duration and one
             month thereafter.

          -  Able to provide informed consent and understand questionnaires and study procedures in
             English.

          -  Willingness to comply with the provisions of the protocol and take daily oral
             medication

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a medical condition that contraindicates the administration of
             CORT118335, such as:

               -  history of adrenal failure; Addison's disease or adrenal insufficiency

               -  concurrent corticosteroid therapy;

               -  hemorrhagic disorders;

               -  concurrent anticoagulant therapy;

               -  cardiovascular, hypertensive, hepatic, respiratory or renal disease;

               -  insulin dependent diabetes mellitus;

               -  severe anemia (&lt; 12 hemoglobin)

               -  inherited porphyria

          -  Significant medical disorders or clinically significant findings on ECG (e.g.,
             prolongation of the QTc interval), urine or blood tests that increase potential risk
             or interfere with study participation as determined by the study physician. Note:
             serum potassium below the normal range must be replaced to normal prior to
             randomization; individuals with serum potassium outside the range of normal will not
             be randomized.

          -  Meets DSM-5 criteria for a major Axis I disorder including mood or anxiety disorders
             or substance dependence disorders other than alcohol or nicotine, or, mild cannabis
             use disorder.

          -  Has a urine drug screen (UDS) positive at screening for substances of abuse other than
             alcohol or marijuana.

          -  Liver function tests more than 3 times the upper limit of normal or elevated
             bilirubin.

          -  Sexually active female subjects with childbearing potential who are pregnant, nursing,
             or refuse to use double barrier (non-hormonal) methods of birth control for the
             duration of the study and one month thereafter.

          -  Treatment within the month prior to screening with 1.) an investigational drug or
             vaccine; 2.) drugs that may influence study outcomes, e.g., disulfiram (Antabuse),
             naltrexone (ReVia), acamprosate (Campral), anticonvulsants, antidepressants.

          -  Chronic use or need for psychotropic drugs. Note: some drugs with psychotropic
             properties (e.g., antihypertensive drugs) are allowed if their use is judged by both
             the investigator and the study physician not to pose a safety risk or impact the
             results of the study.

          -  Current use of drugs that are CYP3A substrates and inhibitors (such as calcium channel
             blockers, azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics, erythromycin, protease inhibitors)
             due to risk of interactions with CORT118335; CYP3A inducers (such as rifampin,
             rifabutin, rifapentin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's wort),
             which may decrease CORT11835 exposure and possibly compromise efficacy.or chronic use
             of drugs that are CYP2C8/2C9 substrates (such as NSAIDs, warfarin, and repaglinide),
             or regular consumption of grapefruit juice.

          -  Mifepristone is an inhibitor of CYP2B6 and may cause significant increases in exposure
             of drugs that are metabolized by CYP2B6 such as bupropion and efavirenz. The
             concomitant use of CYP2B6 substrates such as bupropion and efavirenz is prohibited.

          -  Ongoing treatment with medications that may increase risk, including prescribed,
             over-the-counter, and herbal preparations or as determined by the study physician.

          -  No fixed domicile and/or no availability by home or mobile telephone

          -  History of hypersensitivity to the study drug or the ingredients

          -  Failure to take double-blind medication as prescribed
