  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrauterine balloon tamponade (IUBT) is recommended worldwide as the second-line therapy to
      treat postpartum hemorrhage. While much literature demonstrates the effectiveness of this
      therapy, little is known about how long the IUBT should be used once placed. Though it is
      common to use IUBT for 12-24 hours, the balloon may be equally effective when used for
      shorter durations of time, which could have beneficial effects for patients and hospitals.
      The proposed study is a pragmatic randomized controlled trial of non-inferiority comparing
      two durations of time for intrauterine balloon tamponade placement, 6 and 18 hours, in
      controlling postpartum hemorrhage.

      The specific aims of the proposed study are to determine: 1) whether quantitative blood loss
      significantly differs when the balloon is removed in 6 hours compared to 18 hours, 2) whether
      hemorrhage-related morbidity differs when the IUBT is kept in place for 6 or 18 hours, and 3)
      whether shorter duration of IUBT placement has beneficial effects including shortened
      postpartum hospital stays, improved maternal-infant bonding, and reduced postpartum pain
      prior to maternal discharge from hospital.

      We hypothesize that, once hemorrhage control has been achieved with IUBT placement, there is
      no clinically significant difference in postpartum blood loss when the balloon is removed 6
      hours after placement compared to 18 hours after placement.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women at Denver Health and Hospital Authority (DHHA) who have an IUBT placed for
             postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony will be approached for enrollment in the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women will be excluded from the study if they: are less than 18 years of age; had a
             cesarean delivery; are unable to consent for themselves; have a preexisting or
             acquired clotting factor disorder such as von Willebrand or hemophilia, disseminated
             intravascular coagulation, or therapeutic anticoagulation at time of delivery; would
             refuse blood product transfusion; have a fetal demise or birth of a previable fetus;
             or are incarcerated at the time of delivery. Women who do not speak English or Spanish
             will be offered enrollment if a phone interpreter is available to review the consent,
             but will be excluded from the survey portion of the study.
