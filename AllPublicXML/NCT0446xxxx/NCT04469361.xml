  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Classic ballet dance is a demonstration of complex motor skills to be revealed in aesthetic
      combinations and repetitively, and it demands intensive use of the lower extremities within
      extreme of range of motion (ROM). Because ballet practice depends on advanced technical
      skills, it involves intensive physical training and causes an overload on the musculoskeletal
      system and foot deformities such as pes planus.

      Plantar venous pump (PVP) is a network of multiple venous vessels located between the muscles
      of the foot arch. PVP is considered the first step of venous return and discharges into the
      posterior tibial vein (PTV). PVP is reported to be active during gait while it is inactive in
      resting position. There are different views on the mechanisms enabling its activation 1-3.
      The general view is that during the stance phase of the gait, the flattening of the plantar
      arch with weight transfer causes the veins in this region to narrow and creates a force that
      pumps the blood up.

      The aim of this study is the investigation what kind of hemodynamic changes ballet training
      causes in the lower extremity
