  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperglycemia affects 30-40% of hospitalized patients. Despite the fact that basal/bolus
      insulin therapy has been demonstrated to improve glycemic control and clinical outcomes in
      patients, achieving good glucose control remains a challenge.

      This study examines the effects of Fiasp (a faster acting insulin) on blood sugars after
      meals compared to another type of insulin known as Novolog. The study will be performed in
      patients with type 2 diabetes admitted to the hospital, who are not in the intensive care
      unit, and who are being seen by the inpatient diabetes consult team. Eligible participants
      will be treated with Fiasp or Novolog injected multiple times a day before meals and at
      bedtime, in addition to a once daily injection of insulin glargine as basal insulin. Which
      type of meal time insulin (Fiasp vs Novolog) the subject gets is decided by chance, like the
      flip of a coin. Insulin doses will be started and titrated based on a protocol. All the
      subjects will wear a blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)) sensor placed in their arm
      which they will wear for 72 hours during the study. The glucose values from the CGM,
      collected during the time it is worn, will be downloaded and compared to assess the response
      to the two different types of insulins - Fiasp and Novolog. The goal is to determine if Fiasp
      works as well as or better than Novolog in controlling blood sugars, particularly after
      meals, in the subjects of the study.

    <description>Group 1 will receive daily basal insulin glargine with a scheduled bolus of meal insulin Novolog. Meal Novolog will be dosed at the time the subject starts to eat. If the premeal BG is ≥ 150 mg/dL, additional Novolog will be administered based off the correctional scale at the same time as the prandial insulin. The dose of Novolog will be administered by the floor nurse as per usual standard of care.</description>
