      The teaching platform of the TCM daycare clinics for depression patients will provide a good
      clinical training environment for the trainees. They can learn how to take care of depression
      patients by the lectures and the clinical practice experiences in the daycare clinics. They
      can also learn a holistic approach, a patient-centered healthcare service. This teaching
      model will strengthen the clinical training of TCM and enhance the international
      competitiveness of TCM doctors.

    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a serious psychiatric illness with a high lifetime
      prevalence rate and causes major clinical, social and economic burden to patients and their
      family. Despite that more than 40 antidepressants with various mechanisms are available on
      the market, half of patients fail to achieve remission with optimized medication treatment
      because of unsatisfactory efficacy, frequent intolerability and poor compliance of
      pharmacotherapies. However, Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a safe and effective
      therapy which has many previous evidences to improve the treatment of depression. The aim of
      this project is to build up a TCM clinical daycare model for depression patients, and to
      establish a teaching platform for TCM trainees.

      The TCM daycare model will be provided by a team organized by doctors, nurses, pharmacists,
      psychologist, nutritionist and case managers. This model will provide a comprehensive TCM
      care system to improve the clinical symptoms and quality of life of depression patients.
