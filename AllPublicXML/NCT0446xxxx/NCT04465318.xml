  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study team proposes a two-arm pilot study randomizing participants with COPD who smoke
      combustible cigarettes (CC) to counseling + NRT (standard of care) or counseling +
      e-cigarettes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Globally, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is projected to be the third largest
      cause of death by 2030 and in the US over 16 million people have COPD. Smokers are four and a
      half times more likely to develop COPD than non-smokers, with the likelihood of COPD
      increasing progressively with the duration and intensity of smoking. Among those with COPD,
      smoking cessation is the most effective means of slowing the decline of lung function and
      overall disease progression. Patients at all stages of COPD benefit from quitting smoking.
      Over 90% of COPD deaths occur in current smokers, however 47.1% of people with COPD continue
      to smoke. Electronic cigarettes (E-cigarettes) could help people reduce the harm of
      combustible cigarettes (CC) through reductions in number of Cigarettes per Day (CPD) or
      quitting CC completely by addressing both nicotine and behavioral dependence. Although there
      are associated health risks, all available evidence indicates that E-cigarettes are safer
      than CC. Unlike CC, e-cigarettes are not associated with coronary heart disease or myocardial
      infarction. The purpose of this mixed methods study is to identify barriers and facilitators,
      as well as to assess preliminary effectiveness of e-cigarettes as a harm reduction strategy
      among people with COPD.

             (CAT) score on the screening â‰¥10.

          2. ages 21-75 (the legal age for purchasing e-cigarettes is 21)

          3. current CC smokers (more than 5 packs in a lifetime; smokes 4 or more days/week)

          4. smokes at least 10 cigarettes per day on days they smoke CC

             with, a working telephone number and/or a system with teleconferencing capabilities
             (e.g. smartphone or computer), a phone with text messaging capabilities, and be
             willing to use an e-cigarette or NRT for 12 weeks. To reduce attrition, participants
             will be asked to provide one additional contact as a backup for follow up on
             appointments.

          2. are pregnant (as determined by urine pregnancy test for women under age 52) or
             breastfeeding (self-reported). Women of childbearing age must also be willing to use
             an approved form of birth control during the course of the study if not practicing
             abstinence. Approved birth control methods include: hormonal birth control (e.g. &quot;the
             pill&quot;), barrier methods (e.g. condoms, diaphragm), and intrauterine devices (IUDs).

          3. diagnosis of any medical condition (unstable angina/heart disease) or psychiatric
             condition precluding use of nicotine patch or gum as determined by the MD of this

             doctor.

          4. reporting using NRTs or e-cigarettes within the last 30 days
