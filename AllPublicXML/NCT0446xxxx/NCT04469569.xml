  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The focus of this research is on increasing the uptake of the human papillomavirus (HPV)
      vaccine in young cancer survivors, a vulnerable population at high risk for developing new
      cancers (such as cervical and anal cancer) caused by persistent HPV infection. An effective
      vaccine exists that can prevent these cancers, but HPV vaccine uptake is low among young
      cancer survivors. This research will evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of an
      evidence-based intervention, adapted for use by healthcare providers in pediatric oncology
      clinics, to increase the uptake of HPV vaccine among young cancer survivors 9-17 years of
      age. Results of this research will provide important information that can be used to
      implement new strategies to increase the uptake of the HPV vaccine among young cancer
      survivors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Childhood cancer survivors are at high risk for developing new cancers (such as cervical and
      anal cancer) caused by persistent infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV). Compared
      with the age- and sex-matched general population, female and male cancer survivors have a
      1.4- to 2.5-fold excess risk, respectively, of developing HPV-related malignancies.
      Fortunately, HPV-related malignancies are largely preventable due to availability of the
      nonavalent HPV vaccine, which offers protection against ~90% of oncogenic HPV subtypes. We
      have previously shown that uptake of the HPV vaccine is significantly lower in cancer
      survivors compared with general population peers (22.0% vs 42.5% in those age 13-17yrs), and
      that lack of healthcare provider recommendation is the strongest predictor of HPV vaccine
      non-initiation in cancer survivors. Strategies that are most successful in increasing HPV
      vaccine uptake in the general population focus on improving healthcare provider knowledge
      about the HPV vaccine, enhancing the skills that healthcare providers need to effectively
      recommend the vaccine to young people and their parents, and reducing barriers to receiving
      the vaccine.

      This study will evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of an evidence-based
      intervention (HPVIQ-PedOnc), adapted for use by healthcare providers in pediatric oncology
      clinics, to increase the uptake of HPV vaccine among young cancer survivors (9 to 17 years of
      age and at least one year following completion of cancer therapy). The HPVIQ-PedOnc
      intervention has three components: i) Provider Communication Training; ii) Assessment and
      Peer Feedback/Coaching; and iii) Provider Toolkit, and is designed to increase provider
      knowledge regarding use of the HPV vaccine in the cancer survivor population, enhance
      provider skills in delivering brief, compelling HPV vaccine recommendations to parents of
      young cancer survivors, present ongoing feedback to providers regarding clinic- and
      provider-level survivor HPV vaccination rates, and decrease barriers to receipt of vaccine by
      survivors through the provision of Vaccine Action Plans. If the intervention is effective in
      improving and sustaining increased uptake of the HPV vaccine in young cancer survivors, this
      study will contribute important information needed to move forward with testing the
      widespread use of the intervention in pediatric oncology practices.
