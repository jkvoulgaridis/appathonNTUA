  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well xisomab 3G3 works in preventing catheter-associated
      blood clots (thrombosis) in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy. Many patients with
      cancer develop blood clots from their peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line and
      can have pain, swelling, and other symptoms. They also often require blood thinners, which
      can increase the risk of bleeding. Xisomab 3G3 is type of drug called a monoclonal antibody
      that may prevent blood clots caused by a PICC line in patients receiving chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE I. To determine the efficacy of xisomab as measured by the incidence of
      symptomatic or asymptomatic catheter-associated thrombosis (CAT) in individuals with a PICC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of xisomab 3G3 in cancer patients with a PICC.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Assessment of drug exposure.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive xisomab 3G3 intravenously (IV) at the time of PICC line placement. Patients
      then receive standard of care chemotherapy 2 days later. After approximately 2 weeks,
      patients undergo standard of care ultrasound for possible CAT.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 60 days.

    <measure>Incidence of major and clinically-relevant bleeding</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to end of follow-up (60 days from time of administration)</time_frame>
    <description>Bleeding will be defined using the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis definition of major bleeding for clinical investigations of anti-hemostatic medicinal products in nonsurgical patients (i.e., fatal bleeding, critical organ bleeding such as central nervous system bleeding, or bleeding causing a fall in hemoglobin of 20 g/L or more) and clinically relevant non-major bleeding (i.e., bleeding that does not fit the former definition of major bleeding but prompts medical attention). The incidence of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding, along with 95% confidence interval, will be assessed using the safety analysis set (all patients who are exposed to the single dose of study drug).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of xisomab 3G3-associated adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to end of follow-up (60 days from time of administration)</time_frame>
    <description>Descriptive statistics of safety will be presented using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v) 5.0 using the safety analysis set (all patients who are exposed to the single dose of study drug). All on-study AEs, treatment-related AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), and treatment-related SAEs will be tabulated using worst grade per National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE v5.0 criteria by system organ class and preferred term. On-study lab parameters including hematology, chemistry, liver function, and renal function will be summarized using worst grade NCI CTCAE v5.0 criteria.</description>
