      This is a multicenter, open-label, non-comparative, three-arm, phase IIa trial of Ipatasertib
      (GDC-0068) in combination with non-taxane chemotherapy agents for taxane-pretreated
      unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer patients
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women age ≥ 18 years with triple-negative unresectable locally advanced or MBC that is not
      amenable to resection with curative intent.

      Patients must have received at least one, but not more than two, prior chemotherapeutic
      regimens for treatment of unresectable locally advanced and/or metastatic disease (at least
      one regimen must have contained a taxane).

      The number of patients to be included is 54 patients. The primary objective is to evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of ipatasertib (GDC-0068) in combination with capecitabine,
      eribulin, or carboplatin plus gemcitabine in patients with unresectable locally advanced or
      metastatic triple-negative breast cancer

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed Informed Consent Form (ICF) prior to participation in any study-related
             activities.

          2. Female patients ≥ 18 years at the time of signing ICF.

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1.

          4. Life expectancy of ≥ 12 weeks.

          5. Histologically confirmed Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) per American Society of
             Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) criteria based on
             local testing on the most recent analyzed biopsy. Triple-negative is defined as &lt;1%
             expression for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) and negative for
             Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) (0-1+ by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or
             2+ and negative by in situ hybridization [ISH) test].

          6. Unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease documented by computerized
             tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that is not amenable to
             resection with curative intent.

          7. Measurable or evaluable disease as per RECIST v.1.1. Patients with only bone lesions
             are also eligible.

          8. Refractory to or relapsed after one or two prior standard of care chemotherapy
             regimens for unresectable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Earlier
             adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy for more limited disease will be considered as one of
             the required prior regimens if the development of unresectable locally advanced or
             metastatic disease occurred within a 12-month period of time after completion of
             chemotherapy.

             Note: Exclusive tumor marker elevation will not be considered sufficient for diagnosis
             of disease progression.

          9. Prior therapy must have included a taxane in any combination or order and either in
             the early, locally advanced, or metastatic setting. Note: Exclusive prior taxane-based
             therapy as adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment is also allowed if the patient had a
             disease-free interval of less than 12 months after completing this treatment.

         10. Eligible for one of the chemotherapy options (eribulin, capecitabine, carboplatin plus
             gemcitabine) as per local investigator assessment and slots availability. Patients
             treated with (neo)adjuvant platinum salts or capecitabine and who have relapsed more
             than one year after the last dose of either treatment may be allowed to be included in
             the treatment arm based on ipatasertib (GDC-0068) in combination with carboplatin plus
             gemcitabine and capecitabine, respectively.

         11. Previous treatment with androgen receptor antagonists, poly ADP-ribose Polymerase
             (PARP) inhibitors, and immunotherapy is allowed. Those patients who have previously
             received a PARP inhibitor will not be included in the carboplatin and gemcitabine arm
             unless PARP inhibitors were used in the early breast cancer setting and the period
             between the end of PARP inhibitor-based regimen and onset of metastatic disease is at
             least of 12 months.

         12. Resolution of all acute toxic effects of prior anti-cancer therapy to grade inferior
             or equal to 1 as determined by the NCI-CTCAE v.5.0 (except for alopecia or other
             toxicities not considered a safety risk for the patient at investigator's discretion).

         13. Willingness and ability to provide a tumor biopsy from a metastatic site or the
             primary breast tumor at the time of the inclusion in order to perform exploratory
             studies. If not feasible, patient eligibility should be evaluated by a Sponsor's
             qualified designee. Note: Subjects for whom tumor biopsies cannot be obtained (e.g.,
             inaccessible tumor or subject safety concern) may submit an archived metastatic tumor
             specimen only upon agreement from the Sponsor.

         14. Patients agree to give blood samples (liquid biopsy) at the time of inclusion, after
             two cycles of study treatment, and upon progression or study termination.

         15. Adequate hematologic and organ function within 14 days before the first study
             treatment on Day 1 of Cycle 1, defined by the following:

               1. Hematological: White blood cell (WBC) count &gt; 3.0 x 109/L, absolute neutrophil
                  count (ANC) &gt; 1.5 x 109/L, platelet count &gt; 100.0 x109/L, and hemoglobin &gt; 9.0
                  g/dL.

               2. Hepatic: Serum albumin ≥ 3 g/dL; Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal
                  (× ULN) (≤ 3 x ULN in the case of Gilbert's disease); aspartate transaminase
                  (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 × ULN (in the case of liver metastases
                  ≤ 5 × ULN); alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≤ 2 × ULN (≤ 5 × ULN in the case of liver
                  and/or bone metastases ≤ 5 × ULN).

               3. Renal: Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 × ULN or creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min based on
                  Cockcroft−Gault glomerular filtration rate estimation.

               4. Coagulation: Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) (or activated Partial
                  Thromboplastin Time [aPTT]) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5 × ULN
                  (except for patients receiving anticoagulation therapy).

             Note: Patients receiving heparin treatment should have a PTT (or aPTT) ≤ 2.5 × ULN (or
             patient value before starting heparin treatment). Patients receiving coumarin
             derivatives should have an INR between 2.0 and 3.0 assessed in two consecutive
             measurements one to four days apart. Patients should be on a stable anticoagulant
             regimen.

         16. For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from
             heterosexual intercourse), or to use a highly effective non-hormonal form of
             contraception, or two effective forms of contraception, as defined in the protocol
             during the treatment period and for at least 28 days after the last dose of
             ipatasertib (GDC-0068), three months after the last dose of eribulin, and six months
             after the last dose of carboplatin and gemcitabine or capecitabine, whichever occurs
             later, and agreement to refrain from donating eggs during this same period. Women of
             childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test before study

             colitis) or active bowel inflammation (e.g., diverticulitis).

         12. Known hypersensitivity reaction to any investigational or therapeutic compound or

             enrollment with the exception of carcinoma in situ of the cervix, non-melanoma skin
             carcinoma, or stage I uterine cancer. For other cancers considered to have a low risk
             of recurrence, discussion with the Medical Monitor is required.
