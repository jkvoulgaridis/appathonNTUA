      Background: The acne scar is a common disorder characterized by skin eruption or
      abnormalities on face, chest, and/or back in the adolescence which affect the cosmetic
      appearance.

      Purpose: The main aim of this study was to investigate whether monopolar radiofrequency (MRF)
      or pulsed dye laser (PDL) is more effective in the cases suffering from acne scars in the
      form of reducing acne scars and improving the cosmetic appearance.

      Thirty patients suffering from moderate or severe acne scars were randomly assigned into two
      equal groups. Group A (MRF group): received 2 sessions per week with MRF for 8 weeks. Group B
      (PDL group): received 1 session per week with PDL for 8 weeks. The severity of acne scars was
      assessed before and after treatment by using the clinical evaluation scale for acne scarring
      (ECCA) scale and the self-assessment of clinical acne-related scars (SCARS) scale. Quality of
      life and the emotional impact of acne scars were evaluated by the facial acne scar quality of
      life (FASQoL) scale.

    <description>Clinical evaluation scale for acne scarring. Using this scale, the type of scar was defined by the qualitative descriptions of scars, which is then accompanied by a numerical score (0-4) and then multiplied by (15-50) which is a weighting factor of clinical severity, the total possible score is from 0 to 540. Higher score means worse outcome while lower score means better out come.</description>

    <description>Self-assessment of clinical acne-related scars questionnaire. It consists of 5-items with 1 hypothesized domain which asks patients to assess acne scars severity as seen in the mirror. The total possible score is from 0- 20. Higher score means worse outcome while lower score means better out come.</description>

    <description>Facial acne scar quality of life scale. It is a tool formed of 10-items with 3 domains to assess the emotional, social functioning and work/school effect of scars on a 5-point rating scale The total possible score is from 0- 40. Higher score means worse outcome while lower score means better out come.</description>
