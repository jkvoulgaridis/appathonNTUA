  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will compare whether advertisements on Google or Facebook are more
      effective to reach women in the Pacific Northwest about treatment options for urinary
      incontinence through the American Urogynecologic Society's patient education website,
      VoicesForPFD.org. The investigators hypothesize there is no difference in the overall
      population engagement between these two platforms due to anticipated higher reach through
      Facebook based on user characteristics but higher engagement through Google due to higher
      user interest on this platform.

      The investigators will conduct a comparative ecological study to compare effectiveness of two
      different targeted digital outreach platforms to engage women at risk for urinary
      incontinence in the Pacific Northwest. Counties in Oregon, Washington, Idaho will be
      randomized to receive advertisements for the American Urogynecologic Society's patient
      education website (domain VoicesForPFD.org) via either Google or Facebook. The investigators
      will use advertising campaigns developed specifically for this purpose. Through website
      analytics measuring advertisement clicks and census population data, the investigators will
      estimate utilization rates of the website for each county among the target population of
      middle-aged women to determine if one platform is more effective than the other for this
      topic and population.
