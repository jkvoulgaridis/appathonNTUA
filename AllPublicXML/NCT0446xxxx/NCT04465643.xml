  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate safety and feasibility of neoadjuvant nivolumab plus
      ipilimumab prior to standard therapy (surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy) in patients
      with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) and newly diagnosed pre-malignant and malignant
      peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) for whom surgery for resection of tumor is indicated.
