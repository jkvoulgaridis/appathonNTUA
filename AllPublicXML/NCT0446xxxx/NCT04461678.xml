      The objective of this study is to verify the clinical effectiveness of HPV Genotyping Nucleic
      Acid Assay Kit. This is a multi-center clinical study involving at least three study centers,
      each with screening sites. The protocol describes two study phases: Phase I is a baseline
      study of the screened population and ASCUS referral population (if necessary), the data of
      which will be submitted after the baseline study is completed; Phase II is a three-year
      follow-up study of the screened population, the data of which will be submitted again after
      the follow-up is completed.

    <description>The total sample size of screening population is approximately 12,000 cases (all females ≥ 21 years of age). Two cervical cytology samples will be collected from each subject with a tube of SurePath sample followed by a tube of PreservCyt sample. The 1st tube of SurePath liquid-based cytology sample is used for cytology test and BD Onclarity Assay HPV detection. Subjects with cytology test results ≥ ASCUS or positive HPV test results will be suggested to return for baseline colposcopy within approximately 12 weeks.</description>
