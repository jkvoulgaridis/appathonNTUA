  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The origin of knee osteoarthritis is multifactorial but the disease is strongly related to
      age. The pain and functional disability are the main reasons for consultation.
      Non-pharmaceutical treatment is always indicated.

      The rehabilitation will reduce the pain, maintain or partially recover the amplitude of the
      movements as well as fight against vicious analgesic attitudes and strengthen the muscles to
      stabilize the joints. A program of self-rehabilitation exercises performed at home may be
      prescribed to people with knee osteoarthritis. It must include exercises adapted to the
      patient's functional abilities and painful level and requires education to improve the
      patient's motivation to practice a regular exercise program. However, adherence to such
      exercises is low, and until 2016 there was no objective way to find out the reasons for
      patients' lack of adherence to self-workout programs. The EARS (&quot;Exercise Adherence Rating
      Scale&quot; or Adhesion to Physical Exercise Programs) is validated in 2016 and reliable to
      evaluate the physical activity of patients with low back pain.

      As far as we know, this questionnaire is the only one validated in the international
      literature, a validation for French patients is currently underway. We believe this tool can
      be used for patients with knee osteoarthritis after minor changes.

      EARS (&quot;Exercise Adherence Rating Scale&quot; or Adhesion to Physical Exercise Programs) assesses
      in the first part what type of physical exercise was recommended for patients with common
      chronic pain, as well as their frequencies and the date until which they were prescribed. The
      patient can also inform how often he can do his exercises, or otherwise, if he has completely
      stopped them, to mention since when and why.

      A second part of the questionnaire explores the behavior of patients towards adherence to
      exercise programs and a final part examines the reasons for or not performing these
      exercises.

      Inclusion and the first questionnaires period at the beginning of the knee rehabilitation
      program (program for 6 weeks). Clinical and demographic data questionnaire that will be
      completed by the investigating physician. The second questionnaire will be done at 48 hours
      from the inclusion (only the EARS questionnaire will be filled at 2 days). The third time the
      patients will complete the questionnaires at the end of the rehabilitation program and the
      last time at 4 months end half.

    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a valid and reliable self-rating scale that measures anxiety and depression in both hospital and community settings. HADS gives clinically meaningful results as a psychological screening tool and can assess the symptom severity and caseness of anxiety disorders and depression in patients with illness and the general population.
One questionnaire, comprising fourteen questions. Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression.
Scoring : 0-7- normal, 8-10-borderling abnormal, 11-21-abnormal</description>
