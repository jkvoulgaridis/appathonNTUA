  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot study is to conduct an unblinded pilot randomized clinical study on the
      effectiveness and tolerability of auricular semi-permanent (ASP) vs intradermal (long), and
      pyonex needles in Battlefield Acupuncture (BFA) for the treatment of acute musculoskeletal
      (MSK) pain.

      1. Begin to identify which of 3 needles is most efficacious for BFA treatment of acute MSK
           pain;

        2. Identify patient experiences and tolerance of three commonly used acupuncture needles at
           Mike O'Callaghan Military Medical Center at Nellis Air Force Base. This study will
           compare 30 patients (10 per needling group) and will serve as a pilot study for a
           potential larger randomized control trial (RCT) across multiple MTFs in the Defense
           Health Agency (DHA) to establish better BFA care practices. We will be recruiting a
           total of 39 subjects, which is inclusive of a 30% drop out rate to accommodate those
           that may be lost to the study or have missing data to achieve a final total of 30
           subjects.

    <time_frame>Four repeated measurements of change in the DVRPS: preacupuncture (Day 0), post-acupuncture (10-15 minutes post needle insertion), 24 hours and one week post-therapy.</time_frame>
    <description>Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS).DVPRS is an 11-point numerical rating scale with 0 indicating no pain and 10 indicating severe pain. It has been confirmed for reliability and validity in measuring both acute and chronic pain, and is currently the standard for pain measurement throughout DoD and VA health systems. The DVPRS demonstrates linear scale qualities allowing parametric methods to be used.</description>

    <measure>Needle Tolerance: questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Three repeated measurements of change in needle tolerance: post-acupuncture (10-15 minutes post needle insertion), 24 hours and 1 week posttherapy.</time_frame>
    <description>Will be measured using an in-house developed questionnaire. It employs 5-point ordinal scales to evaluate 12 post-therapy experiences or perception encompassing adverse outcomes, inconveniences, and satisfaction</description>
