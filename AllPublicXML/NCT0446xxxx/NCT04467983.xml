  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized open label clinical trial will evaluate the effect of continued denosumab
      alone over 18 months versus denosumab with added abaloparatide for 18 months. 70
      postmenopausal women will be enrolled over a period of 18 months. The co-primary outcomes
      will be group differences in BMD of the total hip and lumbar spine at 18 months. Secondary
      outcomes will include group differences in BMD at the femoral neck, trochanter and wrist
      sites at 6, 12 and 18 months, spine and total hip BMD at 6 and 12 months and TBS at 18
      months. Secondary outcomes will also include within group changes from baseline for each of
      these variables. Bone turnover markers will also be measured to demonstrate that PINP levels
      will increase with administration of abaloparatide even in the setting of ongoing denosumab,
      while CTX levels will remain low.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some women on denosumab treatment for osteoporosis remain at high risk for fracture. These
      include women who sustain incident fractures on denosumab and those who have declining BMD or
      persistently low BMD, despite treatment. There are few options available for these patients.
      Denosumab withdrawal is associated with dramatic increased bone remodeling, rapid prominent
      bone loss, and multiple vertebral fractures (Cummings JBMR 2017). Switching from denosumab to
      teriparatide is associated with substantial BMD loss in the hip and femoral neck. After 2
      years of denosumab treatment, when women are switched to teriparatide, total hip BMD remains
      below the baseline (at end of denosumab treatment) over the entire 2 years of teriparatide
      treatment (Leder Lancet 2015).

      Abaloparatide might be a better option than teriparatide in patients switching from
      denosumab, because it is less pro-resorptive than teriparatide, however, hip BMD will still
      likely decline. Alternatively, adding abaloparatide to ongoing denosumab might be an
      excellent treatment option for these women. One of the investigators has previously shown
      that adding teriparatide to ongoing alendronate results in improved BMD and bone strength,
      compared to switching to teriparatide (Cosman JCEM 2009 and Cosman JBMR 2013). Others have
      shown that co-administration of teriparatide and denosumab to treatment na√Øve women increases
      BMD more than either agent alone (Tsai Lancet 2013, Leder et al JCEM 2014). Based on both of
      these observations, the investigators believe that adding abaloparatide to continued
      denosumab treatment will allow bone formation to increase, without increasing bone resorption
      (modeling-based bone formation) and will produce substantial BMD increments in both spine and
      hip.

      Hypothesis: In women who still appear to be at high risk for fracture while receiving ongoing
      denosumab therapy, adding abaloparatide will increase BMD of the lumbar spine and total hip
      significantly more than continuing denosumab alone.
