  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the performance of an ultrasonic system for automatic
      classification of cataract type and severity, as well as the estimation of the optimal
      phacoemulsification energy. Ultrasonic signals from the lens will be acquired with the
      Experimental Medical Device (ESUS) in participants with cataract, and in healthy subjects
      (control).

      The proposed technique may represent an important advance in cataract treatment. The
      quantitative and automatic classification of cataract type and severity, and the estimation
      of the optimal phacoemulsification energy is may represent a valuable tool for surgical
      planning, reducing complications associated to excessive levels of phacoemulsification
      energy, as well as the times spent on surgeries. This device may be relevant not only for
      patients, but also for public health systems, reducing waiting lists and associated costs.

  <detailed_description>

      This is a prospective, pivotal, non-blinded study. Fifty (50) participants will be recruited
      at the Coimbra Surgical Center of Portugal. The study will be conducted on subjects with
      age-related cataract, and on healthy subjects as control group. Since this is a pilot study,
      no sample size estimation has been implemented. The statistical power will be determined at
      the end of the study. Only per-protocol participants will be considered on statistical
      analysis.

      Procedures involved. The ultrasonic system (Experimental Medical Device - ESUS) works in
      A-scan mode, with an acoustic working frequency of 20 MHz. From the ultrasonic signals
      backscattered from the lenses, acoustic parameters will be extracted, and used for automatic
      algorithms implementation. This study will be implemented once.

      Slit lamp with LOCS III classification will be used as comparator. Contrast sensitivity test
      results will be used for incipient cataract detection, where slit lamp may present some
      limitations. Optical coherence tomography and specular microscopy will help on detecting
      postoperative complications; other complications identified by the physician will be also
      considered. Surgical parameters as phacoemulsification energy and surgical time will help on
      phacoemulsification energy evaluation.

      Safety assessment. The system uses an ophthalmic probe. There are not anticipated adverse
      events related to the procedures involved in the use of the ultrasonic system, or any other
      procedure in the protocol. The safety conditions will be monitored through the occurrence of
      unanticipated adverse events or serious adverse events. If these situations occur, the event
      will be reported to the competent authorities (in agreement with the current regulation) and
      the corrective actions will be implemented.

    <description>• For the ultrasonic signals acquisitions, an ophthalmic probe working in A-mode scan, must be coupled to the cornea. To reduce the discomfort generated by coupling the probe, topical anaesthesia (oxybuprocaine hydrochloride) will be applied before starting acquisitions. However, if the participant has some known contraindication to this anaesthetic, in replacement, a disposable neutral contact lens will be used as coupling medium between the probe and the cornea.
The acquisitions are initiated through a starting button in the system's user interface, and the probe must be kept by few seconds for automatic signals records. During this period, signals are visualized in the user interface. Finally the probe is uncoupled, and the acquired signals are saved.</description>
