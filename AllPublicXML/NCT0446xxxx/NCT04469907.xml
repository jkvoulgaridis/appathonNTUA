  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single dose, non-randomized, open-label, parallel group study. The study will be
      conducted in participants with severe renal impairment and compared with matched participants
      with normal renal function. The duration of the study for an individual participant from
      Screening to Follow-up will be approximately 5 weeks.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will have 4 cohorts, consisting of participants with severe renal impairment
      (Cohort 1), moderate renal impairment (Cohort 2), mild renal impairment (Cohort 3) and
      participants with normal renal function (Cohort 4). Following completion of Cohort 1 and
      Cohort 4, pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety data will be reviewed and a decision will be made
      whether to study unmatched participants with moderate and mild renal impairment (Cohorts 2
      and 3, respectively)..

      Participants will be screened up to 21 days before administration of study drug. Eligible
      participants will be admitted to the clinical unit on the evening of Day -2. Each participant
      will receive a single oral dose of the study drug under fasted conditions on Day 1.
      Participants will remain resident in the clinical unit until the morning of Day 3.
      Participants will then return to the unit, as scheduled, for collection of PK samples and
      safety assessments, with a final Follow-up visit on Day 14.
