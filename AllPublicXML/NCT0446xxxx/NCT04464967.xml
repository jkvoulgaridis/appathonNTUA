  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Phase 1/2a study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SNK01 in
      combination with trastuzumab or cetuximab in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD)/recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and the preliminary efficacy for each combination
      regimen.

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire consists of 30 questions, 24 of which are grouped into nine multi-item scales (five functioning scales [physical, role, cognitive, emotional and social], three symptom scales [fatigue, pain and nausea/vomiting] and one global health status scale). The remaining six questions are single-item scales (dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation, diarrhea and the financial impact) and are intended to assess symptoms.
All of the scales and single-item measures are scored on a scale from 0 to 100. A better state of the patient is denoted by a higher score for the functioning scales and global health status, while a worsening state of the patient is denoted by higher scores on the symptom and single-item scales.</description>
