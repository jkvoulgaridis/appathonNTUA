  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of the neuroprotectant,
      nerinetide in reducing global disability in participants with acute ischemic stroke
      undergoing endovascular thrombectomy excluding thrombolysis.

    <description>The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a valid and reliable clinician-reported measure of global disability that has been widely applied for evaluating recovery from stroke. It is a scale used to measure functional recovery (the degree of disability or dependence in daily activities) of people who have suffered a stroke. mRS scores range from 0 (best outcome) to 6 (worst outcome), with 0 indicating no residual symptoms; 5 indicating bedbound, requiring constant care; and 6 indicating death.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) selected for emergency endovascular treatment.

          2. Age 18 years or greater.

          3. Onset (last-known-well) time to randomization time within 12 hours.

          4. Disabling stroke defined as a baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Score
             (NIHSS):

               1. NIHSS &gt; 5 for internal carotid artery (ICA) and M1-middle cerebral artery (MCA)
                  occlusion; or

               2. NIHSS &gt; 10 for M2-MCA occlusion.

          5. Confirmed symptomatic intracranial occlusion at one or more of the following
             locations: Intracranial carotid I/T/L, M1 or M2 segment MCA. Tandem extracranial
             carotid and intracranial occlusions are permitted.

          6. Pre-stroke (24 hours prior to stroke onset) independent functional status in
             activities of daily living with modified Barthel Index (BI) ≥ 95. Patient must be
             living without requiring nursing care.

          7. Qualifying imaging performed less than 2 hours prior to randomization.

          8. Consent process completed as per national laws and regulation and the applicable
             ethics committee requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of a large core of established infarction defined as ASPECTS 0-4.

          2. Evidence of absence of collateral circulation on qualifying imaging (collateral score
             of 0 or 1).

          3. Any evidence of intracranial hemorrhage on the qualifying imaging.

          4. Treatment with an intravenous or intra-arterial plasminogen activator (e.g., alteplase
             or tenecteplase) within 24 hours before randomization.

          5. Planned treatment with a plasminogen activator (intravenous or intra-arterial).

          6. Planned use of an endovascular device not having approval or clearance by the relevant
             regulatory authority.

          7. Endovascular thrombectomy procedure is completed as defined by the presence of TICI
             2c/3 reperfusion or completion of groin / arterial closure.

          8. Clinical history, past imaging or clinical judgment suggesting that the intracranial
             occlusion is chronic or there is suspected intracranial dissection such that there is
             a predicted lack of success with endovascular intervention.

          9. Estimated or known weight &gt; 120 kg (264 lbs).

         10. Pregnancy/Lactation; female, with positive urine or serum beta human chorionic
             gonadotropin (β-hCG) test, or breastfeeding.

         11. Known prior receipt of nerinetide for any reason, including prior enrolment in this
             ESCAPE-NEXT trial.

         12. Severe known renal impairment defined as requiring renal replacement therapy (hemo- or
             peritoneal dialysis).

         13. Severe or fatal comorbid illness that will prevent improvement or follow up.

         14. Inability to complete follow-up treatment to Day 90.

         15. Participation in another clinical trial investigating a drug, medical device, or a
             medical procedure in the 30 days preceding trial inclusion.
