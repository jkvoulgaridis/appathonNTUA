  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Dip Home-Based Dipstick Analyzer (henceforth HBDA) is composed of a kit and a smartphone
      application. The device will be provided to the subject in a simulated home-use environment.
      All subjects will be asked to complete the urine test by following the application guidance,
      including providing a urine sample and scanning the urine strip after placing it on the
      Color-Board. The user will also complete a questionnaire to collect information regarding the
      use of the HBDA device. Following the usability test performed by the lay user, the subject's
      urine sample will be tested by the professional user using the comparator device. The use of
      the HBDA device will be evaluated for accuracy and identified risks. Additionally, measurable
      usability criteria for specific, critical steps will be evaluated.

    <description>The Dip Home-Based Dipstick Analyzer is a prescription, in-vitro diagnostic, home use device, which qualitatively and semi-quantitatively measures 10 urine analytes. The device combines a urine stick kit with an easy to use smartphone application using an image recognition algorithm. Results of the experimental HBDA device will be compared to the results of the predicate device tested by a professional user</description>
