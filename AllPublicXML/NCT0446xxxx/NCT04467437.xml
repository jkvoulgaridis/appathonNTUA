  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether non-invasive stimulation over the spinal cord
      at the neck and/or lower back can improve walking function for people with neurologic
      conditions. Spinal stimulation has been used extensively for individuals with spinal cord
      injury, and has demonstrated improvements in function. This study will extend this work to
      other neurologic conditions, such as cerebral palsy and stroke, that also demonstrate similar
      impairments as spinal cord injury.

      The primary aims of this study are to:

      Aim 1: Evaluate impact of spinal stimulation on spasticity and locomotor function.

      Aim 2: Investigate participant perceptions of spinal stimulation.

      The investigators will be using a cross-over design study to compare intensive training only
      to intensive training combined with spinal stimulation. After an initial baseline period of
      up to 4 weeks (Phase I). Participants will have their first intervention phase of the study
      (Phase II). This will involve either intensive training only (Condition A) or intensive
      training combined with spinal stimulation (Condition B). This will be followed by a washout
      period with no intervention (Phase III) and then the second intervention phase (Phase IV).
      The second intervention phase will involve either Condition A or Condition B, whichever the
      participants did not received during Phase II. Phases II-IV will each last up to 8 weeks.
      After the intervention period is complete, the participant will be asked to come for
      follow-up visits up to 3 months after the intervention phases are completed (Phase V).
