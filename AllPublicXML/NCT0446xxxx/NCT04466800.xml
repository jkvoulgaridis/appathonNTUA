  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following the acute phase of COVID, some patients may have sequelae, such as breathing
      difficulties or malnutrition. We hypothesize that a functional and respiratory rehabilitation
      program associated with personalized nutritional care will improve quality of life, physical
      performance and respiratory capacities and will decrease the prevalence of malnutrition among
      those patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In France, more than 150 000 patients have been infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID
      has been responsible for more than 100 000 hospitalizations. Following the acute phase of
      this disease, some patients may have sequelae, such as breathing difficulties or
      malnutrition. However, the prevalence and intensity of those sequelae still remain unknown.
      Thus, a functional and respiratory rehabilitation program associated with personalized
      nutritional care may be necessary to improve those patients' prognosis.

      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a 4-week rehabilitation program following
      the acute phase of COVID. This program includes regular physical activity supervised by a
      physical acticity educator, a systematic malnutrition screening and a nutritional follow-up
      performed by a dietitian. Patients will be randomized in two groups: rehabilitation program
      (intervention group) or usual care (control group). Quality of life, physical performance,
      respiratory capacities and nutritional status will be assessed in both groups at inclusion
      and one month later (corresponding to the end of the rehabilitation program for the
      intervention group).

    <description>Regular physical activity, supervised by a physical education educator, a systematic malnutrition screening and a nutritional follow-up performed by a dietetician.
Patients will follow a 4-week rehabilitation program, comprising 3 physical activity sessions per week for 4 weeks. First sessions will be supervised by a physical activity educator and patients will perform the following sessions at home, using physical training software. The physical activity educator will call patients once a week to ensure the sessions are correctly performed and adapt the program if necessary. Patients will also undergo a nutritional assessment carried out by a dietitian at the beginning of the program. A dietitian will call patients once a week to ensure their nutritional status is appropriate.</description>
