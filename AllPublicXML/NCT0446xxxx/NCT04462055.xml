    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of Dupilumab in food allergic patients with moderate
      to severe Atopic Dermatitis (AD). Included patients participated in the BioDay Registry.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The positive results of the dupilumab studies in AD, asthma and nasal polyposis with chronic
      sinusitis validate the fundamental role for IL-4 and IL-13 in the pathogenesis of these
      diseases, and add to the possibility that these cytokines are also critically involved in
      other related allergic/atopic (type 2 immune) diseases that are often co-morbidly associated
      with AD, such as food allergy.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the effect of Dupilumab on change in clinical eliciting dose (i.e. lowest dose causing an allergic reaction) in subjects with peanut, hazelnut, walnut, cow's milk, hen's egg and/or soybean allergy</measure>
    <time_frame>Each subject will undergo two oral food challenges: one at screening and one during dupilumab treatment with a treatment duration of at least 28 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>AD patients with moderate to severe AD who are indicated for treatment with dupilumab and have symptomatic food allergy to peanut, hazelnut, walnut, cow's milk, hen's egg and/or soybean allergy will be included.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the effect of Dupilumab on food allergy related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Before the first food challenge and 3 months after the second food challenge during their visit conform Bioday protocol.</time_frame>
    <description>The food allergy related quality of life will be measured with the Food allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire adult form (FAQLQ-AF)
The FAQLQ-AF assesses health-related quality of life (HRQL) and contains a total of 29 items. The total FAQLQ‐AF score is the mean score of all items with a range of 1 'no impairment' to 7 'maximal impairment'.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the effect of Dupilumab on the level of specific IgE (sIgE) antibodies</measure>
    <time_frame>sIgE in blood will be measured every three months during dupilumab treatment</time_frame>
    <description>sIgE in blood will be measured using the ImmunoCAP system (Thermofisher, Uppsala, Sweden). Levels of ≥ 0.35 kU/L will be considered positive. Depending on the food the following will be tested: peanut: extract, Ara h 2, 6; hazelnut: extract, cor a 1, 9, 14; walnut: extract; cow's milk: extract; hen's egg: extract; soybean: extract</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the effect of Dupilumab on the biological activity of IgE for peanut and hazelnut and measurement of biomarkers profile</measure>
    <time_frame>The basophil activation test and the measurement of biomarkers on Luminex at baseline and after at least 28 weeks of dupilumab treatment (e.g. at time of second challenge)</time_frame>
    <description>For patients treated with Dupilumab left over serum is stored except as the patient objects.
Patients treated with Dupilumab asked to participate to the biobank eczema and/or biobank acute inflammation.</description>
