  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Clinical crossover trial study. In this study, 100 patients with type II diabetes
      will be selected based on entry and exit criteria, then randomly divided into two equal
      groups (group &quot;A&quot; and group &quot;B&quot;).In the first three days of the first week of
      hospitalization, in group &quot;A&quot; insulin injection with a 90-degree angle and using Nidel
      32-Gauge with a length of 5 mm, and in the other group insulin injection with a 90-degree
      angle and using Nidel 32-Gauge with a length of 8 mm will be done. After a one-day break, in
      another three days, the types of needles used in the two groups are moved together. After a
      one-day break, in another three days, the types of needles used in the two groups are
      replaced together. Then the VAS scale will be used to assess post-injection pain; the amount
      of leakage after the injection will be measured in two ways Yes/No, according to the
      researcher's observation. And to check the effect of Needles on controlling patients' blood
      sugar, their blood sugar levels will be measured based on the routine of hospital units.

      After entering the data in SPSS20 software, the collected data will be analyzed using
      descriptive statistics (frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation) and statistical
      tests (t-test, chi-square).
