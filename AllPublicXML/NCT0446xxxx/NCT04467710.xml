      The aim of this study was to observe the different therapeutic strategies concerning the
      management of common bile duct stones in our center between 2007 and 2019, and their
      respective morbimortality.

      Lithiasis disease represents a real public health problem. Indeed, 10% of the general
      population is asymptomatic carrier of gallbladder stones and among them, 35% will present a
      symptomatic form which will cause the indication of cholecystectomy. As a result, around
      120,000 cholecystectomies are performed per year in France, and around 750,000 in the United
      States for this indication. Cholecystectomy is therefore the most widely performed procedure
      in the world. However, in 3 to 20% of cases, common bile duct stones will be associated and
      to be treated. Different strategies are proposed: a treatment called &quot;all surgical&quot; or an
      endoscopic treatment (usually a sphincterotomy) before or after a cholecystectomy. The
      investigators defined three different treatment strategies, representing our three groups of
      patients: one group with fully laparoscopic surgical treatment (cholecystectomy and
      laparoscopic exploration of the common bile duct at the same time), one group with
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy and management of the common bile duct stone(s) by an ERCP
      performed intraoperatively, and a third group with laparoscopic cholecystectomy and an ERCP
      performed postoperatively during the same hospital stay. The primary outcome was the
      morbimortality rate in each group. The secondary outcome was to identify risk factors of
      failure in the fullfil surgical treatment process.
