    <textblock>
      This study compares insulin icodec (a new insulin taken once a week) to insulin glargine (an
      insulin taken once daily which is already available on the market) in people with type 2
      diabetes.

      The study will look at how well insulin icodec taken weekly controls blood sugar compared to
      insulin glargine taken daily. Participants will either get insulin icodec that participants
      will have to inject once a week on the same day of the week or insulin glargine that
      participants will have to inject once a day at the same time every day. Which treatment
      participants get is decided by chance.

      The insulin is injected with a needle in a skin fold in the thigh, upper arm or stomach. The
      study will last for about 1 ½ years. Participants will have 37 clinic visits and 26 phone
      calls with the study doctor. At 11 clinic visits participant will have blood samples taken.
      At 8 clinic visits participants cannot eat or drink (except for water) for 8 hours before the
      visit.

      Participants will be asked to wear a sensor that measures the blood sugar all the time in 5
      periods of about one month during the study (about 5 months in total). Women cannot take part
      if pregnant, breast-feeding or plan to become pregnant during the study period.
