    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well intensive blood pressure management works in decreasing
      systolic blood pressure in patients with kidney or thyroid cancer that has spread to other
      places in the body (metastatic) who are starting anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor
      cancer therapy. This study is being done to find out if a systolic blood pressure to a target
      of less than 120 mmHg (intensive systolic blood pressure management) can be achieved, well
      tolerated, and beneficial as compared to the usual approach to a target of less than 140 mmHg
      while taking an anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This study may help doctors
      understand the best way to control blood pressure in kidney or thyroid cancer patients taking
      anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the feasibility of an intensive (systolic blood pressure [SBP] &lt; 120 mmHg)
      &quot;Intervention&quot; versus standard care (SBP &lt; 140 mmHg) &quot;Non-Intervention&quot; approach to blood
      pressure (BP) control in metastatic renal cell and thyroid cancer patients initiating
      anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive intensive systolic blood pressure management for 6 months. Patients
      receive increased blood pressure medication every 2 weeks while systolic blood pressure is
      120 mmHg or higher. Patients also monitor blood pressure at home 1 day a week (4 times in 1
      day) every 2 weeks and upload the recorded blood pressure readings to the provider and to a
      central blood pressure monitoring team. Patients with changes in blood pressure medications
      monitor blood pressure readings on 3 days in 1 week (4 times in 1 day).

      ARM B: Patients receive standard blood pressure management for 6 months. Patients receive
      blood pressure medications per doctor's instruction. Patients also monitor blood pressure at
      home 1 day (4 times in 1 day) every 2 weeks and upload the recorded blood pressures to a
      central monitoring team.
