  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was conducted as a randomized controlled experimental study in order to determine
      the effect of hybrid simulation training on gaining the intramuscular injection skills of
      nursing students. The sample of the study consisted of 126 students (63 study groups, 63
      control groups) enrolled in Nursing Principles Course at Pamukkale University Faculty of
      Health Sciences in 2018-2019 academic year. In the study, the study group performed hybrid
      simulation (standard patient+Digital half hip model simulator) and the control group
      performed simulation with low reality simulation method (hip/intramuscular model). Study data
      were collected using Student Identification Form, Intramuscular Injection Achievement Test,
      Intramuscular Injection Application Skill Assessment Form, Two Column Writing Reflective
      Thinking Strategies and Scale of Student Satisfaction and Self-confidence in Learning.

      Nursing students need to be proficient in nursing knowledge and skills before entering a
      health care environment in order to provide safe care to patients. One of the important and
      difficult to accomplish skills that nursing students must learn is the ability to administer
      intramuscular injections. In order to avoid complications due to IM injection application, it
      is necessary to comply with surgical asepsia, to know the method of application correctly and
      to have psychomotor skills. Therefore, nursing students are expected to graduate with
      knowledge and skills related to IM injection application during their education. Basic
      plastic mannequins without advanced technology, mannequins or models with low technological
      features that present the selected anatomical parts of the human body can also be used in
      standard patient and hybrid simulation. Hybrid simulation applications contribute to learners
      ' ability to develop psychomotor skills in a safe and realistic environment, as well as
      problem solving, critical thinking and decision making. Furthermore, hybrid simulations have
      become an ethical requirement to improve students ' skills without causing any potential harm
      to actual patients. In this study, the effectiveness of HS method will be evaluated to gain
      IM injection skills in nursing students. It will be ensured that the students ' knowledge and
      skills will be sufficient by increasing their desire to learn about IM injection, where they
      experience intense fear and anxiety before going to the clinic.

    <description>After each student received theoretical training, they performed an intravenous injection on the model. In the study group performed hybrid simulation. After finishing the simulation application. the students went to the analysis room and watched their own application videos. The analysis session was held immediately after all the students in the group completed their applications.The IM injection success Test and Student Satisfaction and self-confidence scale were applied to the study and control groups after the laboratory application was completed.</description>
