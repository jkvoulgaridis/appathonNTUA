  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe asthma is a condition characterized by a lower sensitivity to high doses of inhaled
      corticosteroids combined with a second controller, most often a long-acting bronchodilator.
      It concerns approximately 5% of asthmatics. Treatment failure and co-morbidities induced by
      systemic corticosteroid therapy can cause debilitating dyspnea, limited physical activity,
      and impaired quality of life. Severe asthma could therefore be associated with major
      presenteeism, defined as the presence of an employee at work despite his health issues and
      which implies a limitation of the employee's productive capacity. Uncontrolled asthma and
      co-morbidities of asthma have been shown to be associated with a decrease in work
      productivity that includes absenteeism and presenteeism. Although there is little data, a
      recent study found a decline in work productivity in severe asthma. Various factors
      associated with presenteeism could be involved, such as asthma control, frequency and
      severity of exacerbations, comorbidities, or treatments.

      Biotherapies targeting the signaling pathways involved in airway inflammation improve asthma
      control, decrease the frequency of asthma exacerbations which are major determinants of
      quality of life, improve lung function, and allow oral steroid sparing. Biotherapies could
      therefore be associated with a decrease in presenteeism.

      The objective of the study is to describe the evolution of presenteeism at work, evaluated by
      the WPAI: Asthma, after 6 months of treatment by biotherapy and to identify factors
      associated with this evolution
