  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to better understand the systems-level neuronal mechanisms by which general
      anesthetics produce loss of consciousness.The researchers believe that anesthetics suppress
      consciousness by disrupting the functioning of large-scale brain networks that support
      information integration in the brain.

    <description>Measurement of force of participants' hand squeezing on a rubber ball in response to instructions. This will be measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) of air pressure during squeezing the rubber ball, using BIOPAC (https://www.biopac.com) MP160 system with AcqKnowledge software (V5.0).</description>

    <description>While music is played Noninvasive functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) imaging will be performed at the University of Michigan Health System, University Hospital, Department of Radiology.
The fMRI is done under anesthesia using propofol. The researchers will manually control the infusion of propofol to achieve target effect-site concentrations of 1.2, 1.6, 2.0, and 2.4 Î¼g/ml in a stepwise fashion.</description>

    <description>Propofol will be administered by intravenous infusion. All anesthesia equipment, supplies, and drugs will be provided by anesthesiologists from the University of Michigan Health System. The researchers will manually control the infusion of propofol to achieve target effect-site concentrations which will be maintained for 4 minutes each.
Four types of music, including Jazz, Rock, Pop and Country, will be presented in a pseudo-randomized order. During the behavioral test period, participants will be asked to squeeze an Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) compatible grip dynamometer (a rubber ball) for every 10-second periods (96 cycles in total). The beginning of each cycle will be cued with the spoken word &quot;squeeze&quot;.</description>
