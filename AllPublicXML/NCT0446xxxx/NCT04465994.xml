      This retrospective study includes 74 patients with acute Achilles tendon rupture from March
      2012 to September 2018, aiming to compare the mid-term curative effect of primary repair and
      gastrocnemius turn-down flaps and guide clinical decision.

      Objective: To explore the surgical methods and observe the med-term curative effect of
      primary repair and gastrocnemius turn-down flaps for acute Achilles tendon rupture, so as to
      guide clinical decision. Methods: This retrospective study includes 74 patients with acute
      Achilles tendon rupture from March 2012 to September 2018, whose surgeries was completed by
      the sponsor with either primary repair or gastrocnemius turn-down flaps. The recovery and
      motor function of the patients were followed up by outpatient clinic and telephone at 3
      months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months after operation, respectively, so as to
      statistically analyze the med-term curative effects of two surgeries. Specific indicators
      include: Visual Analogue Scale, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Ankle-Hindfoot
      Score, The Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Achilles, The Achilles tendon Total
      Rupture Score, the Tegner Activity Score, Biodex isokinetic dynamometer system, Postoperative
      rehabilitation index and complications.

    <time_frame>from pre-surgery to two years after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is designed to present to the respondent a rating scale with minimum constraints. Respondents mark the location on the 10-centimeter line corresponding to the amount of pain they experienced. This gives them the greatest freedom to choose their pain's exact intensity. It also gives the maximum opportunity for each respondent to express a personal response style. The minimum and maximum values of VAS are 10 and 0, respectively. And higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>change of American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Ankle-Hindfoot Score</measure>
    <time_frame>from pre-surgery to two years after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle-Hindfoot Score combines subjective scores of pain and function provided by the patient with objective scores based on the surgeon's physical examination of the patient (to assess sagittal motion, hindfoot motion, ankle-hindfoot stability and alignment of the ankle-hindfoot). The scale includes nine items that can be divided into three subscales (pain, function and alignment). The minimum and maximum values of AOFAS are 100 and 0, respectively. And higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>

    <description>The VISA-A questionnaire displayed construct validity when used in two populations of patients with Achilles tendinopathy and control subjects. The questionnaire avoids the redundant components of non-specific scoring systems such as that developed for hind foot problems by the American Orthopaedic Society, and those devised for Achilles tendon rupture. Results range from 0 to 100, where 100 represents the perfect score.</description>

    <time_frame>from pre-surgery to two years after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Tegner activity scale was first described in 1985 and initially designed for physician administration after ACL and meniscal injuries. To date, the Tegner activity score has been a frequently used patient-administered activity rating system for patients with various knee disorders. The Tegner activity scale is a one-item score that graded activity based on work and sports activities on a scale of 0 to 10. Zero represents disability because of knee problems and 10 represents national or international level soccer.</description>
