  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an individually tailored
      self-management intervention, the selfBACK app, in improving health status in patients on a
      waiting list for outpatient rehabilitation due to low back and/or neck pain compared to a
      non-tailored web-based self-management solution (e-Help) and usual care only.

    <textblock>
      Patients on waiting list for treatment at the multidisciplinary outpatient clinic for back,
      neck and shoulder rehabilitation, St. Olavs Hospital, Trondheim University Hospital, Norway,
      due to low back and/or neck pain are the target group for this study. The average waiting
      time for receiving treatment is 8-10 weeks. The use of digital solutions can be a beneficial
      approach to support self-management during the waiting period. Therefore, the effectiveness
      of these tools in this patients group needs to be evaluated.

      A total of 321 participants will be recruited and randomly allocated to one of the three
      groups: 1) the selfBACK app in addition to usual care; 2) the e-Help webpage in addition to
      usual care; and 3) usual care only. Participants who receive either the selfBACK app and the
      e-Help webpage will be allowed to seek care, treatment or help elsewhere as usual.

      Self-reported outcome measures will be collected through web-based questionnaires at three
      follow-up time points: 1) 6 weeks; 2) 3 months (primary endpoint); and 3) 6 months. In
      addition, participants receiving the selfBACK app will be asked a set of weekly tailoring
      questions to individualize self-management plans. Objective registry based data linked to
      social security number in Norway will be used to investigate health care consumption and
      sickness absence at 1 year (and up to 5 years).

    <masking_description>This study is a single-blinded trial. Participants and health personnel at the clinic will not be blinded to group allocation, whereas researchers performing the analysis and the interpretation of the results will be blinded to group allocation. Once the study is completed, the data will be extracted from the database in anonymized form for statistical analyses, i.e. all personal information that may identify specific participants or group allocation will be removed and the intervention and control groups will be randomly labelled as A, B and C.</masking_description>
