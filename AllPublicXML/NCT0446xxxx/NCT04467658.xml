  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigated quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) subtypes as auxiliary
      tools to assess Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Patient assessed using the
      Korean version of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version IV and were assigned
      to one of three groups: ADHD, ADHD-Not Otherwise specified (NOS), and Neurotypical (NT). The
      investigators measure absolute and relative EEG power in 19 channels and conducted an
      auditory continuous performance test. The investigators analyzed QEEG according to the
      frequency range: delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), slow alpha (8-10 Hz), fast alpha (10-13.5
      Hz), and beta (13.5-30 Hz). The subjects were then grouped by Ward's method of cluster
      analysis using the squared Euclidian distance to measure dissimilarities.

      Participants between 7 and 12 years of age diagnosed with ADHD according to the DSM-5
      criteria were included in the study. The ADHD diagnosis was based on a Korean version of the
      Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version IV (DISC-IV), which is a structured
      interview tool, and these diagnoses were confirmed by multiple child and adolescent
      psychiatrists. If participants did not meet the ADHD diagnostic criteria of DSM-IV and
      DISC-IV, they were assigned to the Neurotypical (NT) group. Based on the results of the
      DISC-IV test, participants were assigned to the ADHD or Non-Other Specified (NOS) group.
      Patients who met the diagnostic criteria of ADHD in DSM-IV, but whose score did not exceed
      six, and had a score of more than three in the attention deficit or hyperactivity/impactivity
      scale of DISC-IV were included in the NOS group. Children with a history of brain damage,
      neurological disorders, genetic disorders, substance dependence, epilepsy, or any other
      mental disorder were excluded from participation. Children with an IQ of 70 or lower
      according to the Korean-Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (Fourth Edition) or who were
      receiving drug treatment were also excluded from this study. The EEG recordings were
      performed using a SynAmps2 direct-current (DC) amplifier and a 10-20 layout 64-channel
      Quick-Cap electrode-placement system (Neuroscan Inc., NC, USA). The EEG data were digitally
      recorded from 19 gold cup electrodes placed according to the international 10-20 system. The
      impedances were maintained below 5 kâ„¦, and the sampling rate was 1000 Hz. The investigators
      use the linked mastoid reference and two additional bipolar electrodes to measure horizontal
      and vertical eye movements. During the recording, each participant laid in a dimly lit,
      electrically shielded, sound-attenuated room. Resting EEG recordings were recorded after
      three minutes with the participants' eyes closed.

    <description>We used MATLAB 7.0.1 (Math Works, Natick, MA, USA) and the EEGLAB toolbox to pre-process and analyze the EEG recordings. First, the EEG data were down-sampled to 250 Hz. Next, the EEG data were detrended and mean-subtracted to remove the DC component. A 1-Hz high-pass filter and a 60-Hz notch filter were applied to remove eye and electrical noise. Next, independent component analysis (ICA) was performed to remove the well-defined sources of artifacts. ICA has been shown to reliably isolate artifacts caused by eye and muscle movements and heart noise (23). Finally, clinical psychiatrists and EEG experts visually inspected the corrected EEGs. For the analysis, we selected more than two minutes of artifact-free EEG readings from the three-minute recordings</description>
