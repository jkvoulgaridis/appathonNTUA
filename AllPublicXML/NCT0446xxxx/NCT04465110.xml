  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It was demonstrated that acute dietary supplementation with GSE reduced arterial blood
      pressure via reduction in Q in obese individuals. However, no studies have investigated the
      chronic effects of dietary GSE supplementation on hemodynamic responses during exercise.
      Given the fact that obesity is associated with an impaired function of eNOS, the effect of
      chronic dietary GSE supplementation on abnormal blood pressure response to exercise and
      aortic stiffness (AoS) needs be elucidated. Thus, it is hypothesized that GSE decreases
      systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP),
      Q, and aortic stiffness at rest and during exercise. This study would determine that this
      supplementation may be used as a non-pharmacological intervention to prevent incident
      hypertension and cardiovascular events during exercise via enhanced endothelial function.

      We investigated whether elevated blood pressure and aortic stiffness (AoS) characterized in
      obese and overweight males (N=10) are reduced following chronic GSE supplementation during
      exercise. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial
      pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (Q), total vascular
      conductance (TVC), and AoS to two submaximal cycling exercises (40% and 60% VO2peak) were
      compared 7 days after ingestion of GSE or placebo (PL) within an one week washout period.
      Compared with PL, GSE supplementation significantly decreased MAP at rest, 40%, and 60%
      workloads. AoS was significantly reduced at rest. Q tended to be decreased, but there was no
      significant difference. GSE had no effect on HR, TVC, and SV. Our study indicates that
      chronic supplementation with GSE reduces arterial pressure at rest and during exercise
      primarily via the combined reduction of AoS and Q. Thus, GSE can be a dietary supplement to
      treat augmented blood pressure responses in obese and overweight males at rest and during
      exercise.
