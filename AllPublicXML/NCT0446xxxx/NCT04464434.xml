      HSCT has been implemented in (inter)national treatment guidelines for diffuse cutaneous
      systemic sclerosis (dcSSc) and is offered in clinical care and reimbursed by national health
      insurance in several European countries. However, data and specific guidelines on the best
      timing of HSCT in the course of dcSSc are lacking. In particular, it is unclear whether HSCT
      should be positioned as upfront therapy or as rescue treatment for patients not responding to
      conventional immunosuppressive therapy.

      This multicentre, randomized, open label trial aims to compare two treatment strategies used
      in usual care: upfront autologous HSCT versus usual care with (intravenous (i.v.)
      cyclophosphamide (CYC) pulse therapy followed by mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and HSCT as
      rescue option).

      Rationale: This multicentre, randomized, open label trial aims to compare two treatment
      strategies used in usual care: upfront autologous HSCT versus usual care with (intravenous
      (i.v.) cyclophosphamide (CYC) pulse thera-py followed by mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and HSCT
      as rescue option). HSCT has been implemented in (inter)national treatment guidelines for
      diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcSSc) and is offered in clinical care and reimbursed
      by national health insurance in several European countries. However, data and specific
      guidelines on the best timing of HSCT in the course of dcSSc are lacking.

      In particular, it is unclear whether HSCT should be positioned as upfront therapy or as
      rescue treatment for patients not responding to conventional im-munosuppressive therapy.
      Given the risks and costs associated with HSCT, it may be preferable to evaluate the
      patient's response to immunosuppressive therapy before proceeding to HSCT. Considering HSCT
      as a rescue treatment could significantly delay the need for a potentially harmful treatment
      and may be an efficient approach from a health economic perspective as HSCT is a highly
      specialized, resource intensive and expensive medical procedure. On the other hand, in the
      time frame needed to evaluate the effect of immunosuppressive therapy, pulmonary and cardiac
      involvement may develop, negatively influencing a patient's prognosis and possibly leading to
      a contra-indication for HSCT. We hypothesize that upfront HSCT results in less toxicity and
      medical costs in the long run. Therefore, we propose a multicentre randomized open label
      trial in chemotherapy naive patients with early dcSSc.

      Objective: To determine the optimal treatment strategy in early dcSSc: the effect of HSCT as
      upfront therapy compared with that of immunosuppressive medication in early dcSSc, with
      respect to survival and prevention of major organ failure (referred to as 'event-free
      survival' which is considered as primary endpoint), safety and the impact on skin thickening,
      visceral involvement, functional status, and quality of life Secondary goals are to evaluate
      (in both treatment arms) whether disease activity correlates with immunological parameters,
      including immunopathology of skin, immune reconstitution, and autoantibodies. We will also
      de-termine the cost-effectiveness of HSCT as first line treatment versus usual care and try
      to identify factors associ-ated with response to treatment.

      Study design: This investigation is an international multicentre, prospective, randomized,
      open label trial com-paring two treatment strategies used in regular care: upfront autologous
      HSCT versus immunosuppressive thera-py with i.v. CYC pulse therapy followed by MMF and HSCT
      as rescue option.

      Study population: Patients aged between 18 - 65 years with an established diagnosis of dcSSc
      according to the ACR/EULAR criteria. Patients disease duration (non-Raynaud's symptoms)
      should be ≤ 2 years and mRSS ≥ 15 (diffuse skin pattern) and /or clinically significant organ
      involvement (heart and lung involvement).

      Intervention: One group (A) receives upfront autologous HSCT and the other group (B) receives
      12 monthly i.v. pulses CYC (750 mg/m2), followed by at least 12 months of oral MMF (max 3
      grams daily) at one year after start of treatment. From 6 months onwards, rescue HSCT is
      allowed in group B in case of severe progres-sion despite treatment, and immunosuppressive
      therapy can be initiated in case of disease progression or relapse in group A.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameter is event-free survival after
      randomisa-tion/treatment start.

      Secondary efficacy endpoints: Overall Survival (OS), progression-free survival, number of
      participants that need rescue therapy (i.e. the alternative treatment) due to treatment
      failure. Treatment related mortality, treatment toxicity, and changes in mRSS, FVC, TLC and
      DLCO, nailfold microscopy, immunological markers in skin and blood, cardiac MR and 18FDG-PET.
      The CRISS at 12 months. Safety and tolerability outcomes according to CTC-criteria (CTCAE
      v5.0). Patient reported outcomes at 12 and 24 months include: Quality of life (EQ-5D), SHAQ,
      Gastrointestinal complaints (UCL SCTC GIT 2.0), sexual functioning.

    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The American College of Rheumatology Composite Response Index in Diffuse Cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis (ACR CRISS) was developed using expert consensus and data driven approaches for use in clinical trials (Khanna et al, 2016).
The exponential algorithm determines the predicted probability of improvement from baseline, incorporating change in the mRSS, FVC percent predicted, physician and patient global assessments, and HAQ-DI. The outcome is a continuous variable between 0.0 and 1.0 (0 - 100%). A higher score indicates greater improvement. Subjects are not considered improved (ACR CRISS score = 0) if they develop new: 1) renal crisis; 2) decline in FVC% predicted by 15% (relative) from baseline and confirmed after 1 month; or 3) left ventricular failure (systolic ejection fraction &lt; 45%); or 4) new pulmonary artery hypertension on right heart catheterization requiring treatment.</description>

    <description>Modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS) The MRSS is a validated physical examination method for estimating skin induration. It is correlated with biopsy measures of skin thickness and reflects prognosis and visceral involvement, especially in early disease2, 4. It is scored on a 0 (normal) to 3+ (severe induration) ordinal scales over 17 body areas, with a maximum score of 51 and is used to categorize severity of SSc. Minimally clinically significant difference in MRSS is 3-5 points (Amjadi et al., American College of Rheumatology; Aug 2009; 2493-2494) It has been extensively used as primary/ secondary outcome in RCT with Scleroderma.

The evaluation of the images will be done centrally. The NFS-findings will be described standardly according to the consensus of the EULAR study group on microcirculation in rheumatic diseases. As such, the images will be evaluated in a quantitative (density, di-mension, morphology and presence of haemorrhages) and a qualitative way (normal, aspecific abnormalities, early/active/late scleroderma pattern).

    <description>The UCLA SCTC GIT 2.0 is a standardized set of outcome measures developed through literature review, patient focus groups and cognitive debriefing among patients with a variety of gastrointestinal disorders including irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, other common gastrointestinal disorders, SSc, and a census-based US general population control sample (Khanna et al, 2009). The scale consists of eight domains relating to gastroesophageal reflux (13 items), disrupted swallowing (7 items), diarrhea (5 items), bowel incontinence/soilage (4 items), nausea and vomiting (4 items), constipation (9 items), belly pain (6 items), and gas/bloat/flatulence (12 items). The scales correlated significantly with both generic and disease-targeted legacy instruments, and demonstrate evidence of reliability.</description>

    <description>The gut microbiome will be investigated by a single fecal sample at baseline and 12 months after randomisation. These samples will be collected by patients themselves with the use of a collection tube. Analysis will be per-formed by shotgun metagenomics, to determine the composition of the microbiome and compare the composi-tion before and after treatment and between responders and non-responders. Since the microbiome is influenced by medication and diet, patients will fill in a diary about their diet for one week and a short questionnaire about the use of medication.</description>
