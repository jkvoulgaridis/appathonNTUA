    <textblock>
      This is an open label, randomized, positive control, phase II study to treat subjects with
      KRAS/NRAS/BRAF wild-type, unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer. The patients will be
      randomized into three arms consist of CPGJ602 (2 weeks/cycle) + mFOLFOX6, CPGJ602 (1
      week/cycle) + mFOLFOX6, and cetuximab (1 week/cycle) + mFOLFOX6 at a ratio of 2:2:1. This
      study is conduct to assess the efficacy and safety of three treatments for patients.
