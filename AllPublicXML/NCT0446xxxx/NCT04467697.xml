    <textblock>
      The purpose of this six-month treatment extension study is

        -  to assess feasibility of a lower starting dose of SOV2012-F1 (daily dose of 400 mg [200
           mg with breakfast meal and 200mg with dinner meal]) to titrate individual doses in order
           to further enhance drug administration.

        -  To examine the blood pressure (BP) effects of Marius's oral testosterone undecanoate
           formulation, SOV2012-F1, using 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM).

      This is the six-month treatment extension of Study MRS-TU-2019, which like Study MRS-TU-2019,
      is an open-label study. The MRS-TU-2019 ABPM Extension Study (MRS-TU-2019EXT), will extend
      the participation for up to 170 MRS-TU-2019 subjects who chose to enroll into the
      MRS-TU-2019EXT, for a target of 135 evaluable subjects reaching the 4-month ABPM assessment
