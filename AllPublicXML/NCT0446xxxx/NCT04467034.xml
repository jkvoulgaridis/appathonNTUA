  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Stanford Tobacco Prevention Toolkit is a free online curriculum developed for use by
      educators and health professionals in providing tobacco-specific prevention education to
      middle and high school students. The aims of this study are to determine: (1) whether the
      Curriculum is effective in changing middle and high school students' resistance to using
      tobacco as well as knowledge of, attitudes towards, and intentions to use different tobacco
      products; and (2) whether the Curriculum is effective in changing middle and high school
      students' actual use of tobacco in the short-term.
