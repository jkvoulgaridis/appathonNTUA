  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate the simply use of three-dimensional (3D) printed
      individualized porous implants in the absence of autogenous/allogeneic bone graft or any
      osteoinductive agents to treat the large bone defects caused by varies of pathogenesis and
      systematically study its long-term therapeutic effect and osseointegration characteristics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A selection of fifty-eight patients with large bone defects caused by tumor, infection or
      trauma received the individualized porous implants treatment, and two typical cases were
      chosen for detailed study. Further, the large segmental femur defect model of sheep was
      utilized to study the osseointegration characteristics of the individualized porous implants
      in 1, 3, 6 months after implantation.
