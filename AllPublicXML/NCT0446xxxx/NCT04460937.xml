  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial investigates the side effects and best dose of adavosertib and how well it
      works when given in combination with radiation therapy in treating patients with esophageal
      or gastroesophageal junction cancer for which no treatment is currently available
      (incurable). Adavosertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and
      shrink tumors. Giving adavosertib together with radiation therapy kill more tumor cells than
      radiation therapy alone in treating patients with esophageal and gastroesophageal junction
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To identify the maximally tolerated dose of adavosertib (AZD1775) to be used in
      combination with radiation therapy for patients with esophageal/gastroesophageal junction
      (GEJ) cancer that is metastatic or inoperable and not eligible for definitive chemoradiation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To evaluate the efficacy of AZD1775 when
      administered in combination with radiation therapy by assessing changes in Ogilvie dysphagia
      score following treatment, time to second intervention for dysphagia, and overall survival.

      III. To identify biomarkers that are predictive for response to experimental therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of adavosertib.

      Patients undergo radiation therapy once daily (QD) 5 days per week for 3 weeks in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive adavosertib orally
      (PO) QD for 2-5 days (depending on dose level) during weeks 1 and 3 of radiation therapy in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 weeks, every 3 months for
      2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years.

          -  Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated
             and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are
             eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load

          -  Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if follow-up brain imaging after
             central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy shows no evidence of progression

          -  Patients with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) or
             leptomeningeal disease are eligible if the treating physician determines that
             immediate CNS specific treatment is not required and is unlikely to be required during
             the first cycle of therapy

          -  Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does
             not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the
             investigational regimen are eligible for this trial

          -  Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of

                  calculated per institutional standards) obtained from an ECG (Note: if one ECG
                  demonstrates a QTcF &gt; 480 msec, then a mean QTcF of =&lt; 480 msec obtained from 3
                  ECGs 2-5 minutes apart, is required at study entry)

               -  Patients with congenital long QT syndrome are excluded

          -  The effects of AZD1775 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and
             because other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women
             of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) for 2 weeks prior to study drug exposure,
             the duration of study participation, and for 1 month after completing treatment. Women
             of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum
             sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 1 week of registration. Should
             a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men
             treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception for
             the duration of study participation and for 3 months after completion of treatment.
             Male patients should not donate sperm during exposure to study drug and for 3 months
             after study drug discontinuation

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.
             Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a
             legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be
             eligible

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study

          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) with the exception of alopecia

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to AZD1775

          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or
             inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly
             changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference.
             As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled
             on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need
             to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or
             herbal product

          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness

          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because AZD1775 is a WEE1 inhibiting agent
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with AZD1775, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with AZD1775. These potential risks may also apply to other agents
             used in this study

          -  Prior thoracic or abdominal radiation therapy for cancer

          -  Patients with congenital long QT syndrome or with a history of Torsades de pointes
             unless all risk factors contributed to Torsades have been corrected. AZD1775 has not
             been studied in patients with ventricular arrhythmias or recent myocardial infarction

          -  Eligibility of subjects receiving any medications or substances with the potential to
             affect the activity or pharmacokinetics of AZD1775 will be determined following review
             by the principal investigator

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients on antiretroviral therapy are
             ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions. Components
             of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) therapy are inhibitors of CYP3A4 which
             should be avoided
