  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Community Healthcare Workers (CHWs), who live in the communities they serve, have the
      potential to reach patients who poorly engage in their care. Motivational Interviewing (MI)
      is a special type of interactional approach that focuses on improving the person's motivation
      to engage in healthy behaviors, such as keeping their clinic appointments and regularly
      taking medications. In this study, we will develop a mobile health tool that will assist CHWs
      in two tasks while they utilize MI to assist patients' engagement in care: 1) follow prompts
      on the mobile device to deliver MI; and 2) record consented conversations between CHWs and
      patients so that MI specialists can review the audiotape and provide feedback to maintain the
      MI skills.

    <description>We will develop Community-based mHealth Motivational Interviewing Tool (COMMIT) using iterative design and testing with frequent, structured input from the key stakeholders: community health workers (CHWs), their supervisors and youth living with HIV (YLWH).The tool will be used by community CHWs in Achham, Nepal to: 1) obtain decision-support to deliver motivational interviewing (MI) for patients in their communities, and 2) capture consented audio recordings of client interactions for review and feedback by their supervisors, allowing CHWs to maintain MI skills beyond the initial training period.</description>
