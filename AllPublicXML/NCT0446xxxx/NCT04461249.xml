  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elevated IOP is a key risk factor for the progression of glaucoma. IOP is subjected to
      diurnal fluctuation in healthy individuals and higher fluctuation in POAG . So, once-daily
      antiglaucoma drugs must have consistent efficacy throughout the day. Prostaglandin analogues
      (PGAs) have become the first-line drops for medical treatment of glaucoma worldwide. In our
      study, we compare between the efficacy and tolerability of Latanoprost 0.005%, Travoprost
      0.004% and Tafluprost 0.0015% on diurnal IOP fluctuation in patients having POAG, IOP
      fluctuation was assessed before treatment , then 2 weeks and 6 weeks after. A comparable and
      significant reduction in IOP fluctuation occurred in the 3 groups. Side effects were mild and
      tolerable.

    <measure>To Compare Between the Efficacy of Latanoprost 0.005%, Travoprost 0.004% and Tafluprost 0.0015% on Diurnal Intraocular Pressure Fluctuation in Patients Having Primary Open-angle Glaucoma</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months from starting the treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Newly diagnosed primary open-angle glaucoma patients received one of the 3 study medications and intraocular pressure fluctuation measured in mmHg by using Goldmann applanation tonometer was compared to the baseline intraocular pressure and to vompare its efficacy to the other 2 drugs</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To Compare Between the 3 drugs regarding their tolerability and assess their side effects.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Months from starting the treatment</time_frame>
    <description>All patients were subjected to full Ophthalmological examination before starting the treatment and were assessed in the follow up visits to detect the tolerability of the drugs and detect the occurrence of side effects as dry eyes using shirmer's test, also red eyes, eye lashes Lengthening, periocular pigmentation were evaluated by photography comparing to the baseline</description>
