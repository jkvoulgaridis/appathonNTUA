  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Collegiality is a one of the great virtues of physician-hood. Mutual support from colleagues
      to help deal with the challenges of being a physician has long helped physicians manage the
      stress related to practicing medicine and helped physicians derive meaning from their work.
      Unfortunately, increased productivity expectations and other changes to the practice of
      medicine over the last several decades have decreased the time physicians have to interact
      with colleagues and eroded the fabric of collegiality. Recent studies suggest burnout affects
      nearly half of U.S. physicians at any given point in time and has substantial personal and
      professional consequences. The steps organizations can take to promote collegiality are
      unknown. The goal of the present study is to evaluate the ability of an organizational
      intervention to encourage collegiality, shared experience, connectedness, and mutual support.
      This study builds on two prior intervention studies directed by the Mayo Clinic Department of
      Medicine Program on Physician Well-Being, the first focusing on a small group facilitated
      well-being curriculum and the second focusing on individual electronic tasks to prompt
      positive reflection and gratitude.

    <description>Those randomized to the immediate intervention arm will be asked to meet approximately every other week for 6 months, covering 12 sessions. We will ask each group to meet in a relatively private setting (e.g., a restaurant near campus or a reserved meeting room), rather than more public spaces (e.g. river room, cafeteria) where interruptions are more likely.</description>

    <description>The first 15 minutes of each session will be semi-structured discussion involving i) check in and ii) dialogue about the assigned question. Group leaders will be provided 3-4 discussion questions for each session. The group (or the leader) can choose the one they are most interested in and will then spend 10-15 minutes discussing the question together. Questions will touch on key themes for discussion (see the attached topics list) and are derived from our previous intervention studies. The remainder of the time can be used for socializing and building relationships with colleagues.</description>
