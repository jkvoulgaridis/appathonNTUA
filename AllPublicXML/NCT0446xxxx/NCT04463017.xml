  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is two-part ascending dose trial in healthy volunteers. The study will be conducted in
      two phases: a single dose, dose escalation phase in up to 7 cohorts (Part A) and a multiple
      dose, dose escalation phase in up to 3 cohorts (Part B).

      Up to 64 subjects will be enrolled in Part A, and up to 39 subjects in Part B, for a total of
      not more than 103 to allow for replacement subjects, if deemed necessary. Fewer subjects may
      be enrolled if not all cohorts are utilized due to identification of the MTD in an earlier
      cohort.

      be enrolled if not all cohorts are utilized due to identification of the MTD in an earlier
      cohort.

      For Part A, double-blind dosing will occur in cohorts 1 through 7. In these cohorts, 6
      subjects will receive HU6 and 2 will receive matching placebo.

      While the Part A is on-going, the 7-day, Part B, the multiple ascending dose stage will
      enroll 3 cohorts of 10 healthy volunteers each consisting of 8 treated and 2 placebo
      subjects.
