  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall incidence of cardiorespiratory arrest in Europe is estimated at 350,000 to
      700,000 cases per year. Survival rate is estimated at 10.7% for all rhythm disorders
      combined.

      Several examples of AI application in the medical field exist. Ting et al have developed a
      computer tool capable of diagnosing the presence of diabetic retinopathy with excellent
      power. In resuscitation, Celi et al proposed a tool capable of predicting the need for
      crystalloid vascular filling during a systemic inflammatory state. In Nature in 2018,
      Komorowski demonstrated the efficacy of AI in the hemodynamic management of sepsis. In a
      study of the renal response to fluid challenge, Zhang et al. demonstrate the effectiveness of
      the learning machine.

      Objectives: Determination of an algorithm capable of predicting the mortality of patients
      admitted to intensive care units (ICU) for ACR from hospitalization reports (CRH). Also use
      of the algorithm to predict the risk of recurrence of the arrest, the duration of mechanical
      ventilation, the appearance of sepsis, the development of organ failure, prediction of the
      CPC (Cerebral Performance Category), time to obtain catecholamine withdrawal, the appearance
      of acute renal failure with or without the need for extra-renal purification (EER) and
      duration under EER, the average length of stay.

      This project is part of a larger, nationwide project with greater power, and includes all the
      data generated during hospitalization in intensive care.

      Method: an estimated total number of patients included in this study to be between 300 and
      500. The population will come from the intensive care units of Nice, Antibes, Cannes, Grasse.

      Inclusion will be retrospective, on CRH, CR of CT imaging (cerebral and
      thoraco-abdomino-pelvic), MRI, EEG, and daily follow-up words, from 2014 to the end of 2020.

      After anonymisation, application of semantisation using natural language processing (NLP)
      methods. The data to be extracted are entered in a document written by intensive care
      physicians. These data will then be stored in a database. In order to meet the main
      objective, we will develop a computer algorithm capable of predicting mortality in the study
      population. This algorithm, based on a large database, can be designed using machine learning
      or even deep learning techniques depending on the amount of data to be processed.
