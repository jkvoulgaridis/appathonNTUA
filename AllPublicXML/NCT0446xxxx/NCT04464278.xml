  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to correlate weight variation as well as body composition with
      mortality and unscheduled readmission of geriatric population
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Weight loss in obese adults confers health benefits, while weight loss in the elderly is
      associated with an increased risk of mortality.

      There are a large number of studies associating weight loss and mortality but the
      relationships between changes in body composition (ratio between fat mass and lean mass) and
      mortality are often contradictory and poorly understood in elderly subject. The aim at this
      study is to request at this question.
