      STUDY OVERVIEW

      Full title:

      A self -guided, internet -based intervention for patients with chronic breathlessness
      (SELF-BREATHE): an interview study.

      Objective:

      To understand the key factors that would enable / facilitate patients with chronic
      breathlessness to use an online breathlessness support intervention (SELF-BREATHE).

      Study type:

      Qualitative interview study

      Methods:

      Semi-structured qualitative interviews will be conducted to achieve maximum variation in
      approx 20 patients with chronic breathlessness (a purposive sample: age sex, diagnoses, and
      presence of caregiver).

      The interview will explore and identify:

      Patients' views/experiences of internet-based activities, e.g. digital apps, shopping online;
      Patients' understanding, preferences, values and motivations that would influence uptake of
      SELF-BREATHE; Potential barriers to the development and use of SELF-BREATHE; Facilitators to
      usage of SELF-BREATHE, such as the ability to self-monitor progress etc...

      These topics cover areas of uncertainty in order to optimise the SELF - BREATHE intervention.

      Inclusion criteria:

      Adult patients &gt;18 years of age, with the ability to read, converse in English and able to
      provide informed consent

      Chronic breathlessness on exertion and or rest (MRC dysponea score &gt;2)

      Advanced disease such as cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic heart
      failure (CHF) or interstitial lung disease (ILD), where the underlying disease is deemed to
      be optimally medically managed by the referring clinician / allied health professional /
      clinical nurse specialist

      Exclusion criteria:

      Breathlessness of unknown cause

      A primary diagnosis of chronic hyperventilation syndrome
