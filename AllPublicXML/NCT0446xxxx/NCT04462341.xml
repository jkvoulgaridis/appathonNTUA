  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of cleaning around implants that hold a
      full denture in the mouth. Different oral hygiene protocols will be compared. Areas to
      measure are gum tissue color and consistency, bleeding and cleanliness. A questionnaire will
      be provided at the end of the study. This is a proof of concept study.

      The aim of this proof of concept study is to evaluate the effect of an oral hygiene regimen
      of manual brushing and water flossing on implant retained removable complete dentures. This
      is a randomized, two arm clinical trial that will compare the traditional oral hygiene
      regimen to the experimental regimen. Data will be evaluated at baseline, 3 weeks and 6 weeks.
      Photographs of the tissue and denture will be taken.
