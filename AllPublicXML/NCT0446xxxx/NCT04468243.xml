  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a nurse-led intervention for adults with newly diagnosed
      cancer and undiagnosed/newly diagnosed Type-2 diabetes
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim 1: To examine study feasibility of a nurse-led intervention for adults with
      newly diagnosed cancer and T2D. We define feasibility indicators as: (a) efficient study
      recruitment is possible given prevalence of T2D (diagnosed and undiagnosed) in UF patients
      with newly diagnosed cancer; (b) retention rates in both groups ≥80% to indicate that the
      study design and methods are adequately patient-centered; (c) identified barriers to and
      facilitators of a nurse-led intervention are respectively modifiable or optimizable; and (d)
      patient acceptability scores &gt;8 for the study procedures. We hypothesize that we will recruit
      up to 40 patients within 18 months and retain ≥ 80% of patients in all groups; minor but
      important revisions will be required to resolve issues identified with using the nurse-led
      intervention; and 80% of patients from both groups who complete the study will report that
      the burden of the study is acceptable through their retention in the study.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine the variation in HbA1c at baseline and at the end of the
      three-month intervention period in each of the two study groups.

    <description>Nurse-led (group A). Patients randomized to group A will be taken to an available consultation room within the clinic and provided brief diabetes education which includes understanding what it means to have diabetes, healthy eating, and physical activity. Patients will also receive instructions on how to use a glucometer and how to take Metformin.</description>

    <description>Usual Care (Control; group B). Patients randomized to usual care will be informed of their HbA1c value, will continue to receive usual cancer care, and will be encouraged to follow-up with their PCP for T2D management. The RA will ensure that oncology visit clinic notes and the results of the HbA1c testing are relayed to the patient's PCP office. Patients who do not have a PCP identified will be referred to an appropriate provider.</description>
