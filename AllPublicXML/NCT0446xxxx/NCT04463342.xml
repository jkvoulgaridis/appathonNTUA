  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with occlusal caries in posterior teeth, does the use of recently introduced non
      coated glass ionomer provide better clinical performance compared to conventional glass
      ionomer with surface coating?

      -Primary objective: To evaluate clinical performance of different types of restorations
      (Ketac molar with coating and Ketac Universal Aplicap 3M without coating) in occlusal caries
      in posterior teeth.

      The study will be conducted in Conservative Dentistry Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo
      University; The operator in charge will be Mahmoud Magdy Eldamanhory

      Patients will be selected from the outpatient clinic of the department Conservative Dentistry
      Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University

        -  Local anesthesia will be applied to patients complaining about pain or sensitivity to
           prevent discomfort during restorative procedures.

        -  Conservative cavity design will be used according to the principals of minimal invasive
           dentistry.

        -  All the cavities will be performed by the main author using #57 straight plain carbide
           fissure bur held in high speed contra-angled hand piece with water cooling system.

        -  All internal line angles will be slightly rounded.

        -  Each bur will be discarded after 5 preparations

        -  If deep caries will be found, it will be removed with large round bur at low speed and a
           thin layer of calcium hydroxide will be placed on the deep portion of the cavity.

        -  Isolation will be maintained by using Rubber Dam.

        -  The dentin and enamel of cavities will be conditioned with 20% polyacrylic acid for 20
           seconds (Cavity Conditioner, GC), washed, and briefly dried.

        -  The restorations will inject into the cavity.

        -  After the passage of the manufacturer's recommended setting time of 2.5 minutes, the
           restoration will be trimmed and polished wet using high-speed fine diamonds.

      In control group ketac molar with coating:

      -After the restoration will briefly dry, Ketac Coat will be applied and photocured for 20
      seconds using a photo-curing light.

      In study group &quot; Ketac Universal Aplicap 3M without coating&quot;:

      -The newest addition to glass ionomer family, Ketac Universal Aplicap glass ionomer
      restorative is a self-cure, one-step placement material designed to help to finish faster.
      There's no need for conditioning, coating or light-curing steps.

    <description>A faster, easier procedure is great, but you want assurance that reducing chair time doesn't mean compromising on performance. KetacTM Universal AplicapTM Glass Ionomer Restorative saves time by eliminating the need for a coating—yet still delivers the compressive strength and surface hardness that are higher than several competitive glass ionomers which require one.This advancement is the latest in 3M's 30-year history of developing proven and trusted glass ionomers.</description>

    <description>A bulk-fill, packable and fast-setting conventional glass ionomer. Because it's less &quot;technique sensitive&quot; than a composite it's ideal for difficult-to-isolate posterior restoration. High compressive strength and marginal integrity make it a glass ionomer of choice for posterior restorations.Ketac Conditioner Dentin Pretreatment is required; Ketac Glaze Light-Cured Varnish applied on the top of the restoration to avoid moisture contamination.</description>
