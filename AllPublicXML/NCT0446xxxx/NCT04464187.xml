  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Orilissa is a drug approved for the management of moderate to severe pain associated with
      endometriosis. Orilissa should not be taken by women who are pregnant or suspected to be
      pregnant but pregnancies are expected as the medicine does not completely stop ovulation and
      women may inadvertently continue taking Orilissa until their pregnancy is confirmed.

      This study will assess pregnancy outcomes (maternal, fetal, and infant) of participants with
      and without exposure to Orilissa for their endometriosis or other conditions based on
      approved indications and prescribing patterns of Orilissa. Around 584 participants will be
      enrolled (292 participants exposed to Orilissa and 292 without exposure) in the United
      States.

      Participants will not receive Orilissa as part of this study but will be followed for
      maternal and fetal outcomes up to 1 year after delivery.

      There may be a higher burden for participants in this study compared to standard of care.
      Participants will be asked to provide additional information by questionnaire during each
      trimester of pregnancy, and at 0-6 weeks, 26 weeks, and 1 year after delivery.
