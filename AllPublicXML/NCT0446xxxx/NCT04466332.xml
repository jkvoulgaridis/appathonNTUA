  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to compare two ECG techniques for guiding Peripherally Inserted
      Central Venous Cather (PICC) in terms of accuracy of the final position of the catheter tip.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One technique uses ECG signal transmission with saline water and allows external catheter
      length adjustment while the other technique uses a guidewire for signal transmission thus
      requiring prior catheter length adjustment

    <intervention_name>LifeCath-CT PICC easy™ (Vygon)</intervention_name>
    <description>ECG electrodes are placed on patient's chest ensuring that there is a distinguishable P-wave.
Upper arm selection is based on vein diameter and dominance, ultrasound is used to identify a suitable vein.
The patient is prepared using a maximal sterile barrier approach. The catheter is inserted into one of the veins (75-90° arm abduction) using ultrasound and modified Seldinger technique.
The PICC is advanced into the central circulation and used as an intracavitary electrode (connection with Vygocard2™). Saline water instilled through the catheter ensures conductivity.
The ECG is then used until displayed intracavitary P-wave has a maximal height without negative deflexion. Catheter is left at this point (cavo atrial junction).
The PICC hub side is then trimmed and the catheter part connected. The PICC is caped with a neutral bidirectional valve.
The puncture site is dressed and catheter stabilized. Chest Xray is obtained immediately after insertion to assess the position.</description>

    <description>ECG electrodes are placed on patients chest ensuring that there is a distinguishable P-wave.
Upper arm selection is based on vein diameter and dominance, ultrasound is used to identify suitable vein.
The patient is prepared using a maximal sterile barrier approach. The catheter is inserted into one of the veins (75-90° arm abduction) using ultrasound and modified Seldinger technique.
The catheter's free end is cut to the anticipated length using anthropometric measurements (insertion/axillary crease+axillary crease/sternal notch+13cm) and the preloaded magnetic-tipped stylet (serving as intracavitary electrode) is put inside.
The PICC is advanced into central veins until intravascular ECG displays a P-wave with maximal height without negative deflexion. Catheter is left at this point (cavo atrial junction).
The puncture site is dressed and catheter stabilized. Chest Xray is obtained immediately after insertion to assess position.</description>
