  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood products are commonly used before invasive procedures in patients with end-stage liver
      diseases despite cirrhosis being a thrombophylic state. Traditional coagulation tests (namely
      INR and PLTs count) are known to be unreliable in predicting bleeding risk before invasive
      procedures and in representing the real coagulation status of cirrhotic patients.
      Notwithstanding they are still used to guide blood products administration before invasive
      procedures. Rotational Thromboelastometry ( ROTEM) has been shown to be effective in
      detecting signs of hypo-hypercoagulability possibly being an alternative method to guide
      blood products transfusion. The aim of this randomized controlled study is to evaluate the
      efficacy of ROTEM as a guide for blood products transfusion in cirrhotic children undergoing
      invasive procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with cirrhosis listed for invasive procedures and with deranged INR between 1.5-2,5
      and/or deranged platelet count between 20,000/mm3-50,000/mm3 will be included in the study
      and will be block randomized into two groups. To prevent bleeding during the procedure, one
      group will receive prophylactic transfusion of either FFP, Platelet or Cryoprecipitate based
      on the values of INR, platelet and fibrinogen.The second group will undergo ROTEM based
      correction.

      Following correction, the procedure will be done in both the groups. Patients randomized in
      the ROTEM group will undergo repeat ROTEM and INR, Platelet, Fibrinogen testing (depending on
      the component transfused), post the procedure, to look at the correction achieved. Similarly,
      patients randomized in the conventional group will undergo repeat INR, Platelet, fibrinogen
      testing depending on the component transfused.

      Patients will be followed for 24 hours indoors for any evidence of bleeding or transfusion
      reaction.
