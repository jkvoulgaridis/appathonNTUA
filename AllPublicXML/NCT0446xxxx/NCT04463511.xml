      Primary objective: To determine if placing preterm infants in a polyethylene bag (PB)
      immediately after birth, before the umbilical cord is clamped, will increase the number of
      preterm infants with a normal temperature on admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit
      (NICU).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Newly born preterm infants that develop abnormal temperature after birth have higher
      morbidity and mortality. Placing infants &lt; 32 weeks' gestation in a polyethylene bag (PB) in
      the delivery room (DR) reduces the rate of hypothermia on admission to the Neonatal Intensive
      Care Unit (NICU). Since 2012, the rate of admission hypothermia in preterm infants, placed in
      a PB in the DR at the National Maternity Hospital (NMH), has increased significantly. This
      may be as a result of heat loss while the infant remains attached to the cord.

      Our primary objective is to determine if placing preterm infants in a PB immediately after
      birth, before the umbilical cord is clamped will increase the number of preterm infants with
      a normal temperature on admission to the NICU.

    <masking_description>In the delivery room, the infant is randomised to application of a polyethylene bag before or after cord clamping. Neither the delivery room care provider nor the investigator are blinded to the group assignment. When the infant is stable, they are be transferred from the delivery room to the neonatal unit. The outcome assessor is the admitting nurse in the neonatal unit who will be blinded to the group assignment.</masking_description>

    <description>Immediately after delivery, while still attached to placental circulation, infants will be placed in a PB. After the cord has been clamped and cut, the infant will be transferred to the resuscitaire for ongoing care. In the case of caesarean section a sterile bag will be used and prepared observing sterile techniques. A member of the neonatal team donned in sterile gown and gloves will assist the obstetrician in placing the infant in the PB.</description>
