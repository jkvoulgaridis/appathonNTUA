  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of our project is to better understand the characteristics of the young patients
      with coronary artery disease presenting for cardiac catheterization at our institution and to
      put forth a program to optimize their risk factors with a focus on gender differences. We
      will assess traditional and non-traditional risk factors, as well as genetics and
      environment. These characteristics will be compared by gender to determine unique factors
      related to women that could subsequently be targeted. The program will begin with universal
      education about the process of atherosclerosis, risk factors contributing to the disease and
      specific risk factor goals for each patient for the 6 month program. The patients will then
      be part of a bimonthly 6 month cardiovascular risk reduction program that will offer both a
      nutritional program with teaching kitchen component, and exercise instruction lead by an
      exercise physiologist. Psychological support will be provided to address stress that impairs
      quality of life, depression or anxiety to fully optimize the lifestyle component. These
      sessions will be done virtually in order to comply with social distancing until in person
      sessions can resume.

      The investigational endpoints of this program will include a variety of CVD risk factors,
      biomarkers, lifestyle behaviors, quality of life and guideline-based medical regimen. At the
      end of this phase, we aim to both better understand differences in risk factors and the
      interventions with the biggest impact in terms of risk factor optimization in men vs. women.
