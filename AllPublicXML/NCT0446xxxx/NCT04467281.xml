  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if using the radioactive tracer 89Zr-DFO-daratumumab with
      PET/CT scans is a practical and effective way to view and monitor multiple myeloma in
      participants before and during their treatment with daratumumab. We also want to see if
      89Zr-DFO-daratumumab PET/CT scans can predict a participant's response to therapy, and if
      they can better locate any leftover disease following treatment compared to the standard
      imaging methods.
