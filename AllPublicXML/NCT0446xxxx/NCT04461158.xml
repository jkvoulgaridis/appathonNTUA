  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To address the health disparities in SLE outcomes for minorities, targeted intervention will
      be used to address the common barriers to care among patients; a comprehensive patient
      navigator approach will be utilized based on evidence from prior studies is the purpose of
      this research. The navigator services most commonly provided include facilitation and
      coordination of care, practical support, including scheduling transportation and referrals to
      financial assistance programs, appointment scheduling and reminders, education and
      psycho-social support. The most effective patient navigators address both health system and
      patient barriers.

    <measure>Improvement in Medication Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months - from baseline to 12 month visit</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence with prescribed medical therapies will be defined as the ratio between the number of therapy-days supplied to the number of days until the prescription was refilled and compared between LPNP participants and usual care patients. Medication adherence rates will be estimated by charts review and comparing these medications to pharmacy records on dates and quantities filled. Included medication classifications will include antihypertensives, immunosuppressants, Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine), and glucocorticoids. Additionally, overall pill burden will be compared between LPNP participants and usual care patients. LPNP participants' medication diaries will be reviewed to determine self-reported adherence.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in patient-reported lupus-specific disease status</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months - from baseline to 12 month visit</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in patient-reported lupus-specific disease status (measured by the LupusPRO v1.7) over time, from Baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, compared between interventional and usual care groups will be completed at the start and end of participation. The LupusPRO is a validated, comprehensive patient reported quality of life questionnaire specific for patients with lupus. Domain areas include: lupus symptoms, cognition, physical health, pain vitality, procreation, emotional health, body image, desires-goals, social support, coping, and satisfaction with care.</description>

    <measure>Improvement in Adherence with medical providers and services</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months - from baseline to 12 month visit</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence with medical providers and services will be the ratio of number of visits scheduled to the number of visits kept. Rates will be compared between LPNP participants and usual care patients.</description>
