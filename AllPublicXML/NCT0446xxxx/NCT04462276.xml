  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter phase 2 clinical trial to investigate the treatment efficacy and
      feasibility of combining thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) with the IMpower133 regimen in the
      upfront treatment of ED SCLC patients. Patients with a response after induction therapy with
      carboplatin/etoposide and atezolizumab will be included into this study to subsequently
      receive atezolizumab maintenance therapy and will be randomized to receive TRT or not. This
      trial aims to i.) increase the efficacy of combined atezolizumab- and chemotherapy by adding
      radiotherapy and ii.) determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of
      chemotherapeutic, immunological and radiological treatment in the first-line setting of
      advanced SCLC, and iii.) to collect tumor tissue as well as blood and stool samples for
      separate biomarker research project.
