  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, open-label, single-center, randomized, investigator-sponsored clinical
      study seeks to investigate: how will pseudophakic patients respond in terms of objective and
      subjective outcomes, when treated with Dextenza compared to topical prednisolone acetate
      following gas bubble repair and laser for RD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who have given informed consent and determined to be eligible at screening will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to DEXTENZA (placed once in the lower punctum) or the use of
      topical Prednisolone acetate 1% drops (four times daily). They will be observed for a period
      of 3-months for both pain and inflammation of the eye.
