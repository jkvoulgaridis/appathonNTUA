  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers are doing this study to measure and test cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in the blood
      before, during, and after first-line treatment for follicular lymphoma. They will look at
      whether cfDNA levels are related to a person's response to the usual first-line treatment for
      follicular lymphoma. Researchers also want to understand how different genetic changes in
      follicular lymphoma relate to a person's response to the usual first-line treatment.

    <description>Response will be evaluated using the updated response criteria entitled, &quot;The Lugano Classification&quot; system. The investigator will use of the 5-point scale for visually assessing response on the pre- and end-of-treatment FDGPET/CT scans. This scale is commonly referred to as the Deauville criteria; it was developed by international experts in the field at the First International Workshop on interim-PET in Lymphoma in Deauville in 2009 and is routinely applied to patients undergoing lymphoma directed therapy. The 5-point scale is described in the table below.
