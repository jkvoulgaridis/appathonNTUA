      Methodology:

      The study was an open label, randomized, crossover, 2 periods study in 20 healthy male/female
      volunteers. Subjects received 500 mg of the new formulation of soluble tablets vigabatrin or
      Sabril, as single oral administration in 2 different study periods depending on the
      randomization, with a 7-days wash out period between administrations

      Objectives:

      Primary objective:

      Evaluate bioequivalence between a new paediatric formulation of vigabatrin (VGB-ST) and
      Sabril granules for oral administration.

      Secondary objective:

        -  Define pharmacokinetic parameters of the new paediatric formulation soluble tablets of
           vigabatrin (VGB-ST)

        -  Assess the safety of the new formulation of soluble tablets VGB-ST versus Sabril
