    <description>The physician will score the acne vulgaris based on the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) scale. A score of 0 indicates that residual hyperpigmentation and erythema may be present; a score of 1 indicates that there are a few scattered comedones and a few small papules; a score of 3 indicates that more than half of the face is involved, that there are many comedones, papules, and pustules, and that one nodule may be present; a score of 4 indicates that the entire face is involved, covered with comedones, numerous papules and pustules, and a few nodules and cysts. The change in PGA score will be recorded at each of the 4 study visits, for up to</description>
