  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective randomized controlled observer-blinded study we aimed to compare the
      efficacy of a single operator technique so called Jedi Grip and conventional technique
      requiring double operator in ultrasound guided axillary brachial plexus block.

      Patients aged between 18 and 65 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical
      status I to II ) undergoing elective hand, wrist and forearm surgery were prospectively
      enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to Group C (conventional technique) or group J
      (Jedi technique). In both groups, axillary plexus blockage was provided by applying 5cc of a
      mixture of 10 cc 0.5% bupivacaine and 10 cc 2% prilocaine to the ulnar, radial, median and
      musculocutaneous nerves. Parameters such as performance time and the number of needle passes
      were recorded during procedure. Subsequently, a blinded observer evaluated and recorded
      parameters related to the success of blockage. The main outcome variable was performance time
      and success rate (surgical anesthesia).

    <masking_description>After completion of the block, a blinded observer recorded demographic data and questioned the patients for felt pain related to the block procedure using a 10-cm visual analog scale (0 cm = no pain, 10 cm = worst imaginable pain). Patients were also questioned for symptoms related to the local anesthetic toxicity.
Subsequently, measurements of brachial plexus blockade were carried out every 5 mins until 30 mins by the same blinded observer.</masking_description>

    <description>Sensory blockage was evaluated and graded; from lateral to the forearm, the volar face of the thumb, volar face of the 5th finger and lateral side of the hand back; for musculocutaneous, median, ulnar and radial nerves, respectively. Graduation was according to 3-point scale using a cold test: 0 = no block, 1 = analgesia (patient can feel touch, not cold), and 2 = anesthesia (patient cannot feel touch).</description>

    <description>on goup C, operator used the probe and needle with different hands while an assistant controlling the syringe to aspirate or inject local anesthetic. On Group J single operator controlled the probe with one hand while controlling the needle and the syringe on the other hand with the Jedi technique. The needle was held between the index finger and the middle phalanx of the middle finger, and the syringe was held with fingers 4 and 5, with the plunger part to the thumb in the palm.</description>
