  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of danicopan as add-on therapy
      to a complement component 5 (C5) inhibitor (eculizumab or ravulizumab) in participants with
      PNH who have clinically evident EVH.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multiple-region, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multiple-dose, study
      in participants with PNH who have clinically evident EVH on a C5 inhibitor (eculizumab or
      ravulizumab).

      Participants will be randomized to danicopan or placebo, in a 2:1 ratio for 12 weeks
      (Treatment Period 1) in addition to their C5 inhibitor (eculizumab or ravulizumab) therapy.
      At Week 12, participants randomized to receive placebo will be switched to danicopan for an
      additional 12 weeks (Treatment Period 2) while remaining on the ongoing C5 inhibitor therapy,
      and participants randomized to danicopan will continue on danicopan for an additional 12
      weeks while remaining on the ongoing C5 inhibitor therapy.

      At the end of the 2 treatment periods (Week 24), participants may enter a 1-year Long-Term
      Extension (LTE) Period and continue to receive danicopan in addition to their C5 inhibitor
      therapy.
