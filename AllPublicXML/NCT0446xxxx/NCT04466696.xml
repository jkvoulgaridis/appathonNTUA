  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with T4 colorectal cancer represent a specific subgroup of colorectal
      patients, frequently composed of fragile patients whose advanced nature of the disease often
      requires a multi organ resection by an open surgery approach and frequently leads to higher
      intra/postoperative complication.Those characteristics makes them to be considered less
      suitable for ERAS protocol, especially regarding an expected difficult compliance to
      postoperative items.

      The impact of enhanced recovery program on postoperative outcomes in this subset of patients
      has never been addressed in literature, in fact most of studies either excluded T4 patients
      due to higher rates of complication or adopted an homogeneous patient sampling analizing all
      stage colorectal cancer together.

      Our aim is to investigate the feasibility of ERAS protocol in T4 colorectal patient, primary
      outcome was to compare postoperative lenght of stay between T4 colorectal patients treated
      with ERAS protcol and those treated with standard of care.

        Patients with a clinical diagnosis of stage T4 colorectal cancer who underwent surgical
        resection between January 2016 to January 2020 at Minimally Invasive Surgery Unit of Tor
        Vergata University Hospital were prospectively enrolled in the ERAS group and treated with
        fast track protocol. Postoperative short outcomes were compared to a control group treated
        with conventional care that underwent surgical resection for T4 colorectal cancer at the
        same center from January 2010 to December 2015. Data of the control group were collected
        retrospectively from a prospectively mantained database.
