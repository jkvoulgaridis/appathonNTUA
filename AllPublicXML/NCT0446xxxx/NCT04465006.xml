  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to investigate the effects of hippotherapy simulator exercises in
      addition to the conventional rehabilitation program on the balance, postural control,
      mobility, functional capacity, and independence levels of stroke patients.

    <textblock>
      Twenty-six 18- 65 years of patients with stroke were included in the study. Patients were
      divided into two groups as hippotherapy simulator group (HSG) (n = 13) and conventional
      exercise group (CEG) (n = 13). Patients were evaluated with Berg Balance Scale (BBS) for
      balance, Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke (PASS) for postural control, Rivermead Mobility
      Index (RMI), and Time Up- Go Test (TUG) for mobility, 2min. Walking Test (2mWT) for
      functional capacity and Barthel Index (BI) for the level of independence respectively before
      and after treatment.

    <measure>Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 - Day 45</time_frame>
    <description>The Berg balance scale is used to objectively determine a patient's ability (or inability) to safely balance during a series of predetermined tasks. It is a 14 item list with each item consisting of a five-point ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 4, with 0 indicating the lowest level of function and 4 the highest level of function and takes approximately 20 minutes to complete.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 - Day 45</time_frame>
    <description>It measures the ability of an individual with stroke to maintain stable postures and equilibrium during positional changes. It consists of a 4-point scale where the items are scored from 0 to 3, and the total scoring ranges from 0 to 36</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rivermead Mobility Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 - Day 45</time_frame>
