  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study will evaluate the preliminary efficacy of Pride Posts Plus, a social
      media-based smoking cessation treatment. A pilot randomized trial (N=120) will compare Pride
      Posts Plus, which includes a gamification element, to Pride Posts (without gamification) and
      to a usual care treatment. Participants will be adults who smoke, identify as sexual or
      gender minorities, and use Facebook. The primary outcome will be biochemically verified 7-day
      abstinence from smoking at 3 and 6 months. Secondary outcomes will be treatment engagement, a
      quit attempt (y/n), and thoughts about tobacco abstinence at 3 and 6 mos.

      Participants (N=120) will be randomized to one of three conditions: (1) Pride Posts, a
      Facebook-delivered smoking cessation intervention (including daily posts, and weekly live
      group sessions, tailored to sexual and gender minority (SGM) adults; (2) Pride Posts Plus,
      the Facebook-delivered smoking cessation intervention plus a gamification element, or (2) a
      usual care condition which includes referral to smokefree.gov, a federally-developed
      web-based intervention which includes similar digital treatment elements. All participants
      will have access to up to six months of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT).

      Assessments will occur at baseline, 3, and 6 months follow-up. Assessments will include
      measures on smoking, thoughts about abstinence, and SGM identity experiences. All
      participants who report no past 7-day smoking will be asked to provide biochemical
      verification of smoking status using a portable carbon monoxide measurement tool. All
      intervention and assessment procedures will be conducted digitally.
