  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is one of the few cancers whose survival rate has not improved
      significantly due to high local recurrence and systemic metastasis despite advances in
      diagnosis and treatment over the past 40 years. And currently pancreatic cancer is the fifth
      leading cause of cancer-related death in Korea. For this reason, various anti-cancer
      therapies and radiotherapy have been tested to improve survival.

      Due to recent advances in radiotherapy technology, proton beam therapy (PBT) is a promising
      treatment for pancreatic cancer because it can reduce radiation dose from surrounding normal
      tissue while maximizing radiation to tumor tissues due to the distinct physical properties of
      proton beam. Low toxicity have been reported. In addition, retrospective analysis of
      pancreatic cancer patients (n=37) who performed proton therapy (PBT) from June 2013 to July
      2016 showed promising therapeutic performance and less toxicity (survival rate, 19.3 months;
      Grade ≥ 3 Toxicity, 0%). In addition, gene polymorphisms of several genes (CD44, CD166, XAF1,
      MMP9, MUC1/4, SMAD7, SMAD4 (DPC), RRM1, ERCC1, HER2, etc.) in pancreatic cancer have been
      reported to be associated with recurrence and prognosis.

      reported to be associated with recurrence and prognosis. Therefore, in this study, a
      prospective cohort of pancreatic cancer patients treated with proton beam therapy was
      established to analyze local control, survival, recurrence, toxicity, proton treatment plan
      information, gene expression information to analyze local control (LC), overall survival
      (OS), recurrence-free surival (RFS), and factors predicting treatment-related toxicity.

    <description>The primary outcome is to establish a prospective cohort of pancreatic cancer patients treadted with proton beam therapy. It is for exploring factors and models that predict local control, relapse, survival and treatment-related toxicity in patients with pancreatic cancer who have undergone proton therapy.</description>
