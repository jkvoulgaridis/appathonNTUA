  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The evaluation of gliomas in imaging represents a real challenge today, at the initial
      diagnosis, for therapeutic planning or follow-up treatment of these lesions. There is an
      urgent need for non-invasive imaging tools to evaluate a glioma throughout its management. At
      present, the diagnosis of certainty is only obtained through an anatomo-pathological analysis
      with sampling during an invasive procedure (surgery or biopsy). Magnetic resonance imaging,
      through perfusion, diffusion imaging or spectroscopy is developing in gliomas. However, it
      remains time-consuming and is not always available. At the same time, positron emission
      tomography (PET) with amino acids is an interesting alternative for these brain tumours.
      Amino acid PET has the advantage of being more specific than the abnormalities detected in
      MRI and the amino acid radiotracers cross the blood-brain barrier, even if not broken, unlike
      Gadolinium in MRI. Among these radiotracers, 18F-FDOPA can, among other things, assist in the
      non-invasive staging of gliomas at initial diagnosis.
