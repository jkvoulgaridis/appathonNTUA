  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The age of patients' population is increasing every year, as the life expectancy. Thus, the
      incidence and prevalence of hematological cancers is increasing. In particular, acute
      leukemias and myelodisplastic syndromes are the most frequent diseases of the hematopoietic
      system. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is the main therapeutic options for
      these diseases, and the number of allo-SCTs in the elderly is currently in progressive
      growth. This is partially due to the improvement of the allo-SCT procedure over the years,
      with the amelioration of donor selection, HLA typing, graft versus host disease (GVHD) and
      infections prophylaxis and treatment.

      Nevertheless, there is still an unmet clinical need, represented by the lack of extensively
      and detailed outcome analysis of elderly patients addressed to allo-SCT. With this aim, we
      planned this retrospective analysis of allo-SCTs in patients older than 60 years, within the
      GITMO transplant activity of the last 17 years. This study will help us in designing future
      prospective trials, including a comprehensive geriatric assessment of frailty, in order to
      address to allo-SCT those elderly who have the highest probability to achieve the best long
      term outcome with the lowest transplant-related mortality and morbidity.
