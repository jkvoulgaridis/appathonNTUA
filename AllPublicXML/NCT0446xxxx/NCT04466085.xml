      Subjects in the 2 dose group were injected with 2 doses of test vaccine or placebo in the
      upper arm deltoid muscle according to the 0,1 month immunization program, and subjects in the
      3 dose group were injected with 3 doses of test vaccine or placebo in the upper arm deltoid
      muscle according to the 0, 1, 2 month immunization program .
