  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AL101 monotherapy in
      subjects with Notch-activated recurrent or metastatic TNBC; Notch activation will be
      determined by a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) test.

    <measure>Quality of life (QoL)-QLQ-C30</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month</time_frame>
    <description>The QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / Quality of life scale, and six single items. Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / Quality of life represents a high Quality of life, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life (QoL)- QLQ-BR45</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life (QoL) as determined by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, by breast cancer quality of life questionnaire QLQ-BR45. QLQ-BR45 is a supplementary questionnaire module to be employed in conjunction with the QLQ-C30. The QLQ-BR45 incorporates nine multi-item scales to assess body image, sexual functioning, breast satisfaction, systemic therapy side,effects, arm symptoms, breast symptoms, endocrine therapy symptoms, skin mucosis symptoms, endocrine sexual symptoms. In addition, single items assess sexual enjoyment, future perspective and being upset by hair loss.
All of the scales and single item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high score for the functional scales and functional single items represents a high/healthy level of functioning, whereas a high score for the symptom scales and symptom item represents a high level of symptomatology or problems.</description>

          4. Documented tumor progression following no more than 3 lines of systemic chemotherapy,
             PARP inhibitor therapy or immunotherapy for metastatic disease, as appropriate. Of
             note, neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy will not count as prior lines of therapy.

          6. Documented Notch activation from tumor biopsy results from within the last 2 years
             from a commercially available NGS assay, LDT or other validated IUO clinical trial
             assay.

          7. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy
             test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment that is
             considered medically active and may interfere in the ability to detect responses in
             this subject. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin that have undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ
             cervical cancer.
