    <intervention_name>Autologous Human Schwann Cells</intervention_name>
    <description>Schwann cells harvested from the sural nerve and debrided, injured sciatic nerve of the participant will be autologously transplanted along sural nerve autografts wrapped in a collagen matrix</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Persons with severe sciatic nerve injury, brachial plexus injury, and/or major injury
             at the upper or lower extremity with nerve loss within previous year;

          -  Peripheral nerve injury with large gap (5 - 10 cm) between healthy nerve endings;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Persons unable to safely undergo an MRI (may include persons with an implanted device
             or metallic fragments which may interfere with MRI safety);

          -  Persons with pre-existing conditions that would preclude satisfactory sural nerve
             harvest (may include amputation or major injury to lower limb, or disease affecting
             the sural nerve);

          -  Persons with severe peripheral nerve injury gap length &gt; 10 cm in length;

          -  Persons with history of radiation or local cancer in area of nerve injury, including
             primary tumors of the nerve;

          -  Pregnant women or a positive pregnancy test in those women with reproductive potential
             prior to transplantation;

          -  Presence of disease that might interfere with participant
