      This is a single group, multicenter, open-label study with a study population of patients who
      meet International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition (ICHD-III) criteria for
      migraine with or without aura and have 4 to 20 migraine days per month. This is a
      single-group supportive care study with one arm and no masking. A maximum of 54 participants
      will be enrolled to study intervention. All participants in this single-group study will
      complete a 4-week run-in period. After the run-in period, eligible participants will be
      enrolled to study intervention and enter a 12-week treatment period.

             electronic Daily Headache Diary;

          3. in good general health based on investigator's judgment;

          4. must be between 18 to 65 years of age, inclusive, at time of Visit 2;

          5. have migraine with or without aura meeting the diagnostic criteria listed in the
             International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition (ICHD-III; Appendix 5);

          6. verification of headache frequency through prospectively collected baseline
             information during the 28-day screening/baseline phase reporting 4-20 migraine days
             and no more than 20 total headache days;

          7. onset of migraine before age 50;

          8. able to differentiate migraine from other primary headache types allowed in the study
             (e.g., tension-type headache);

          9. stable history of migraine at least 3 months prior to screening with headache free
             periods;

         10. not currently taking a migraine preventive OR has been taking a stable dose of a
             preventive for at least 90 days prior to screening and agrees to not start, stop, or
             change medication and/or dosage during the study period;

             **participants on migraine preventive should have stable headache pattern

         11. must have a score of ≥ 3 on the Migraine Functional Impact Questionnaire (MFIQ)
             overall impact on usual activities item at screening;

             effective birth control methods for the duration of the study (i.e., starting at
             screening). Definitions of WOCBP, sterile and postmenopausal women, male
             contraception, and highly effective and acceptable birth control methods are to be

             butalbital use ≥10 days/month in previous 12 months or during run-in period;
             Medication Overuse Headache (MOH) with other medication types will be allowed but must
             be documented;

         13. unstable medication use for migraine prevention (changes in the last 3 months);
