  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a diagnostic accuracy prospective, single-centre, open-label, single group assignment
      interventional study.

      Its aim is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in detection of
      primary tumour and extra prostatic disease (lymph node, soft tissues spread or bone
      metastases) in men newly diagnosed with Prostate Cancer at Intermediate and High Risk,
      according to 2019 Prostate Cancer EAU Guidelines Risk Group Stratification (see Study
      Population paragraph).

      The investigators are interested in the possible future role of [68Ga]Ga-labelled PSMA PET/CT
      as integration to conventional imaging mpMRI (with or without CT of the lower abdomen and
      Bone scan) in the detection of primary tumor and extra-prostatic disease (lymph node and soft
      tissues spread or bone metastases).

      This is a diagnostic accuracy prospective, single-centre, open-label, single group assignment
      interventional study.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of
      [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in detection of primary tumor and extraprostatic disease (lymph node,
      soft tissues spread or bone metastases) in men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer at
      intermediate or high-risk.

      The secondary objective of this study is to compare the diagnostic accuracy of
      [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT to the diagnostic accuracy of conventional imaging mpMRI (with or
      without CT of the lower abdomen and Bone scan) in the prostatic bed and extra prostatic
      disease in men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer at intermediate or high-risk.

      To evaluate association between [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT uptake value (SUVmax and SUVmean) and
      aggressiveness of prostate tumor (e.g. PSA serum level and Gleason Score).

    <measure>Diagnostic accuracy measures (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values) of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in detection of primary tumor and extraprostatic disease (lymph node, soft tissues spread or bone metastases).</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>For the primary objective, the following index test and reference test will be considered:
Index test: [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT performed before treatment. Reference test: clinical, radiological and histo-pathologic assessment, when available, at 12 months followup and up to 24 months after treatment.
Two nuclear medicine physicians will review the PET images using PET/CT Software Syngo.via.
A PET positive finding for pelvic or retroperitoneal lymph nodes or lymph nodes â‰¥ 8mm is defined with PSMA uptake equal to or above blood pool and lower than liver.
A PET positive finding in lymph nodes of other regions is defined with PSMA uptake equal to or above liver and lower than parotid gland. Any uptake equal to or above parotid gland will be considered positive.
The readers will be blinded to clinical and pathologic data, except for the knowledge of diagnosis of biopsy proven prostate cancer.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparation diagnostic accuracy of the [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT versus the conventional imaging mpMRI (with or without CT of the lower abdomen and Bone scan) in the prostatic bed and extra prostatic disease.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>For the secondary objective, the following index test and reference test will be considered:
Index test: conventional imaging mpMRI performed before treatment. Reference test: clinical, radiological and histo-pathologic assessment at 12 months follow-up and up to 24 months after treatment.
MRI imaging results will be evaluated by two radiologists specializing in body MRI imaging with the PI-RADS version 2 criteria.
In addition, for the secondary objective, after testing the assumption of normality with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the metabolic PET parameters (SUV max and SUV mean) will be correlated with PSA serum level, by using the Pearson correlation, and with Gleason score and tumor volume, by using the Spearman correlation.</description>
