  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is defined as nausea and/or vomiting occurring
      within 24 hours after surgery, it commonly affects 20-30% patients but as high as 70-80%
      patients who are deemed high risk for PONV may be affected. PONV may cause unpleasant
      complications such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, suture dehiscence, aspiration of
      gastric contents, delayed recovery and prolonged hospital stay. Standard guideline
      recommended combination of anti-emetics to prevent PONV in high risk patients. The commonly
      used agents are dexamethasone and ondansetron which are cheaper although they are proven to
      be less effective as single agent when compared with newer agent such as palonosetron. As an
      adjunct or alternative to pharmacological treatment, acupressure P6 point has gained
      increasing attention for its possible value in preventing PONV. It is proven that acupressure
      reduced the incidences of PONV when combined with pharmacological treatment. It is postulated
      that acupressure active Aβ and Aδ fibres and stimulate the release of β-endorphine from
      hypothalamus. In addition, it is believed that acupressure might act on dopaminergic,
      serotonergic and norepinerphrinergic fibres which might has a role in PONV prevention.

    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the efficacy of palonosetron monotherapy versus combination
      of acupressure P6 point with dexamethasone and ondansetron in preventing PONV. It has been
      proven that palonosetron is more superior as single agent when compared with acupressure,
      dexamethasone and ondansetron separately. However, this might not be cost effective as
      palonosetron is more expensive than the other agents. In addition, the combination therapy
      has been reported better in preventing PONV when compared with monotherapy. The investigators
      need to investigate whether the combination of acupressure with dexamethasone and ondansetron
      exert an effect equal or even better than palonosetron monotherapy. The investigators
      hypothesis is the combination of acupressure P6 point with dexamethasone and ondansetron
      provide better prophylaxis againts PONV when compared with palonosetron. The requirement for
      rescue anti-emetics for combination of acupressure P6 point with dexamethasone and
      ondansetron group is lesser than palonosetron.

    <masking_description>Potential patients are identified and consented for study during pre-operative assessment. Both patients and assessors are blinded in this trial.
Participants and assessors are being blinded of the treatment or medications given intra-operatively. The acupressure wristband and anti-emetics will be given after general anaesthesia. The wristband will be removed prior to emergence, participants will not aware of the methods used to prevent nausea and vomiting. Postoperative participants will be assessed by independent nurses who are not involved in the study.</masking_description>
