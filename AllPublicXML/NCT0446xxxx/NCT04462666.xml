  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We designed this study as a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial. The aim of
      the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy, safety and control of recurrence rate of
      acute gouty arthritis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gout is a recurrent chronic inflammatory disease caused by monosodium urate (MSU) crystal .
      Acute gouty arthritis (GA) is the most common first symptom of gout. With the progress of the
      disease, the frequency of acute attack increases, and joint destruction may occur. The
      prevalence of hyperuricemia in China was about 13.3%, and the pooled prevalence of gout was
      1.1%. Repeated attacks of GA seriously affect the quality of life, resulting in huge economic
      costs and mental stress. Due to inadequate prevention and treatment, the target of healing
      gout is often not achieved. In GA, TCM has shown satisfactory therapeutic effect with less
      adverse effects and minimal toxicity. Huzhang granule (HZG), a Chinese herbal prescription,
      is a compound preparation with twelve ingredients which has been used in the clinical
      treatment of gout for over 30 years at the Yueyang Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese
      and Western Medicine affiliated to Shanghai University of TCM.Therefore，this double-blind,
      randomized, controlled clinical trial. will provide high-quality clinical evidences for
      evaluating the clinical efficacy, safety and control of recurrence rate of Huzhang granule ，a
      representative prescription for the treatment of acute gouty arthritis , in the treatment of
      GA.

    <description>Visual Analogue Score is an often-used tool to measure subjective phenomena, which has shown good reliability and validity in terms of assessment of pain. In the clinical study of acute gout attack，it can be used as a tool to measure the degree of pain from 0 to 100 mm (with 0 being no pain and 100 being maximum pain)</description>

    <measure>36-Item Short Form Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>36-Item Short Form Survey is a health status profile originally designed to measure eight health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions.
Scoring the 36-Item Health Survey is a two-step process. First, precoded numeric values are recoded per the scoring key in a given table. Note that all items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state. In addition, each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively. Scores represent the percentage of total possible score achieved. In step 2, items in the same scale are averaged together to create the 8 scale scores. another lists the items averaged together to create each scale. Items that are left blank (missing data) are not taken into account when calculating</description>
