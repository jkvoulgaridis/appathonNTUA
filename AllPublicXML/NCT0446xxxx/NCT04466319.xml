      The Effect of Rocking Chair Movement on the Start of Bowel Functions in Patients With
      Gastrointestinal System Surgery

      The research will be carried out as a randomized controlled experimental study in patients
      with open gastrointestinal tract surgery in order to evaluate the effect of rocking chair
      movement to be given in addition to standard care in the initiation of postoperative bowel
      functions (post-operative first time gas, first time defecation).Ethics committee and
      institution permissions and written consents of individuals were obtained prior to the
      study.The universe of the study was composed of patients with open gastrointestinal surgery
      lying in the general surgery service of a hospital in Eskisehir. With the error margin of
      0.05, 90% test power, 30 people in intervention and control groups, 60 patients in total will
      be included in the research.Appointment of patients to intervention and control groups was
      done by stratification and block randomization method according to gastric and intestinal
      surgery.The draw method was used to assign stratified patients to blind technique
      intervention and control groups in order to avoid side-holding, and an equal number
      (blocking) patients were assigned to each group. The individuals in the intervention group in
      the rocking chair three times a day, 20 minutes, a total of 60 minutes after the first day
      after surgery. The individuals in the control group will sit in a standard chair in the same
      time as the intervention group in the non-rocking chair. The data will be collected using the
      &quot;Descriptive characteristics determination form&quot;, &quot;Intervention Group Intestinal Functions
      Evaluation Form&quot; and &quot;Control Group Intestinal Functions Evaluation Form&quot;.

    <description>Patients in the experimental group were sat rocking chair three times a day in a rocking wooden chair in addition to their postoperative routine care by their nurses. After providing the rocking chair to the patients' room, the researcher gave the data collection form to be filled by the patient himself. It was the researcher's supervision that the patient sat in the rocking chair for the first time. The rocking chair movement continued to intervene until the patient released gas. After emitting gas, he continued to swing in the rocking chair until he made his first stools. The patient was visited every day until he was discharged. No special clothing or materials were required for the patients to sit in the rocking chair.</description>
