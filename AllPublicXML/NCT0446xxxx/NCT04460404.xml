  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional constipation is one of the five most common gastrointestinal diseases in
      outpatient visits. It is known that the global prevalence of chronic constipation is
      estimated to be 14%, and the prevalence of adults in my country is about 4.0% to 10.0%. It is
      generally believed that the diagnosis of functional constipation is based on a thorough
      history and physical examination. However, these standards are mainly used in clinical
      research and are not always strictly applicable to clinical practice. Therefore, in addition
      to the main symptoms, the medical history should include evidence of organic diseases (alarm
      symptoms). Rectal bleeding, anemia, weight loss, fever, family history of colon cancer and
      the age of onset over 50 years are considered as alarm symptoms of severe gastrointestinal
      diseases, but the value of alarm symptoms in distinguishing organic diseases from functional
      diseases is still not Ok, further research is still needed. In 2016, the Rome IV standard was
      updated and released, with some updates in the definition and diagnostic criteria for
      functional constipation. However, there are few studies on the clinical practice based on
      Rome IV. The advantages and disadvantages of adjusting the diagnostic criteria of Rome IV
      compared to Rome III in clinical application are still unclear. In order to evaluate the
      predictive value of the alarm symptoms of functional constipation based on Roman IV, we
      designed this cross-sectional study. It is used to evaluate the predictive value of alarm
      symptoms for functional constipation and organic bowel disease, as well as the predictive
      value of alarm symptoms of benign and malignant intestinal diseases related to functional
      constipation symptoms.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             constipation in Rome III or IV (specific conditions are as follows) (1) Must include
             two or more of the following:

               1. More than 25% of bowel movements feel laborious;

               2. Over 25% of the bowel movements are dry ball dung or hard dung; (Bristol Manure
                  Character Scale Type 1-2)

               3. More than 25% of bowel movements have an inexhaustible feeling;

               4. More than 25% of bowel movements require manual assistance;

               5. More than 25% of bowel movements need to be assisted by manual techniques (such
                  as assisting bowel movements with fingers and basin support);

               6. Less than 3 times per week (spontaneous defecation). (2) Dirty feces rarely occur
