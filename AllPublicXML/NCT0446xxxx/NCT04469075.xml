    <textblock>
      The participants are being treated with Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) for malignant
      glioma, and this type of treatment may cause skin-related side effects. This study will test
      whether using clindamycin and triamcinolone topical lotions can prevent skin-related side
      effects of TTFields.
