  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with end stage liver disease undergoing liver transplantation have varying degrees
      of intraoperative haemodynamic unstability during various phases of transplantation. It is
      difficult to determine the cause for hemodynamic instability in these patients and to predict
      the best treatments. Currently, cardiovascular resuscitation options are triggered by
      arterial pressure and cardiac output (CO) measures, focusing on the oxygen delivery side of
      the circulation. The primary determinants of cardiac output reside on the venous side. Veins
      are 30-50 times more compliant than arteries and contain approximately 75% of the total blood
      volume [1]. Mean systemic filling pressure provides vital information on this venous side of
      the circulation. Mean systemic filling pressure , which is defined as the pressure equal to
      the pressure which would be measured if the heart should suddenly stop pumping and all
      (arterial and venous) the pressures in the entire circulatory system should be brought to
      equilibrium instantaneously, is a good, complete and reliable reflection of the total
      intravascular fluid compartment(2) We would study the Mean systemic filling pressure in liver
      transplant recipients and record hemodynamic, respiratory, cardiac and renal function
      prospectively. Follow up data for 7 days for respiratory, cardiac and renal complications
      will be collected, along with hospital stay, ICU stay and mortality. The association between
      Mean systemic filling pressure and these outcomes will be analyzed.
