      Investigating the biomechanics for the PCL ruptured or reconstructed patients during walking,
      jogging, cutting, jumping. To establish a knee joint biomechanical evaluation model to
      quantify and evaluate the plantar pressure information under dynamic load-bearing state after
      PCL fracture. Provide a precise basis for the biomechanical state of the knee, and establish
      a clinically practical automatic analysis of plantar pressure information and an expert
      diagnostic system.

      Background: The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is an essential structure in knee
      stabilization. Knee cartilage degeneration after a PCL injury has been reported in several
      studies. Understanding the changes in movement patterns of patients with PCL ruptures could
      help clinicians make specific treatment protocols to restore patients' sporting ability and
      prevent joint degeneration. However, the kinematics and kinetics of the lower limb in
      patients with PCL injuries are still not clear.

      Methods: Three-dimensional gait analysis system, force plate, electromyography will be used
      for 55 healthy male participants (control group) and 55 male patients with isolated
      PCL-deficiency (PCL-d group) during walking, jogging, cutting, jumping. Repeated measurement
      two-factor analysis of variance will be performed to determine differences between involved
      and uninvolved legs in the PCL-d group and control group at different rehabilitation times
      (prior reconstruction surgery, 6 months, and 1-year post PCL reconstruction surgery).
      Three-dimensional gait analysis and computer-aided analysis technology of plantar pressure
      information were used to study the changes of PCL after fracture and reconstruction. Based on
      the plantar pressure information, the movement parameters, and individual attribute
      parameters, establish a knee joint biomechanical evaluation model to quantify and evaluate
      the plantar pressure information under dynamic load-bearing state after PCL fracture. Provide
      a precise basis for the biomechanical state of the knee, and establish a clinically practical
      automatic analysis of plantar pressure information and an expert diagnostic system.

        Inclusionï¼šage of 18-45 years old. Healthy volunteers: no history of neuro or
        musculoskeletal system injury that may affect the movements. Isolated PCL rupture patients:
        The inclusion criteria included an isolated PCL rupture of at least 3 months' duration. The
        exclusion criteria were (1) additional knee ligament or meniscal damage; (2) severe damage
        to the ipsilateral hip, ankle joint, or contralateral lower limb (ligament ruptures or bone
        fractures); (3) age &gt;50 years (to avoid age-induced osteoarthritis interference); (4) any
        cartilage injury grade &gt;2 according to the Outerbridge classification; and (5) Tegner
