      Overall study aim of this study is to analyse descriptive statistics of Patient-Reported
      Outcome（PROs） which will be used in the Hyperkalemia（HK） registry study in hyperkalemia
      patients with Chronic Kidney Disease（CKD） or Heart Failure（HF） to describe the practice
      patterns of hyperkalemia treatment in in clinical practice. Based on these assessments, this
      study will provide the information for the applicability of PRO measurements which will be
      used in the Hyperkalemia registry study to the study population, i.e. CKD and/or HF patients
      with hyperkalemia.

        This study will include patients with hyperkalemia treated at outpatient clinics. Eligible
        patients will be screened through the regular visit to study sites in a consecutive manner.
        This study will be conducted in outpatient clinics in general hospitals. 150 hyperkalemia
        patients with CKD or HFrEF will be enrolled and assessed cross-sectionally.

        After the written informed consent, subjects will be asked to complete the
        questionnaire-based survey.

        Health-Related Quality of Life (HR-QoL), compliance to treatment with potassium binders,
        and other factors including age, sex, height, weight, smoking status, alcohol use and
        socio-economic status will be collected through the designated questionnaires. Information
        on disease status and on treatment patterns will be collected from physicians, and the
        latest results of laboratory tests will be collected from medical records (within 6 months
        before enrolment).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Outpatients aged ≥20 years

          -  Hyperkalemia patients defined as meeting either of the following criteria:

               1. Having a history of S-K ≥5.1 mmol/L ≥2 times within 6 months before enrolment

               2. Having a history of S-K ≥5.5 mmol/L once within 6 months before enrolment

               3. Currently treated by potassium binders for the treatment of hyperkalemia at
                  enrolment

          -  Having been diagnosed as CKD (≥stage 3b) or HFrEF by investigators as defined below:

        CKD is diagnosed based on the guidelines of CKD issued by the Japanese Society of
        Nephrology (JSN, 2018) as being either or both of condition 1 and 2 for ≥3 months

          1. Clear sign of kidney impairment based on urinalysis, imaging, blood test, or biopsy.
             Especially, existence of ≥0.15 g/gCr of proteinuria (≥30 mg/gCr of albuminuria) is
             important.

          2. GFR &lt;45 mL/min/1.73m2 Within the routine clinical practice, GFR is estimated by serum
             creatinine, gender, and age using following the formulation.

        eGFR creat (mL/min/1.73m2) = 194 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)-1.094 x age (years)-0.287 (for
        female patients, x 0.739)

        ≥Stage 3b CKD is diagnosed based on the following eGFR categories:

          -  Stage 4: 15 mL/min/1.73m2 ≤ eGFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73m2

          -  Stage 5: eGFR &lt;15 mL/min/1.73m2

          2. NYHA class II-IV

               -  Provision of signed, written, and detailed informed consent

          -  Patients with acute kidney injury at enrolment •Patients who took blood transfusion or
             potassium supplements within 6 months before enrolment

          -  Active malignancy or life expectancy of less than 6 months.

          -  Patients who have GI disturbance/chronic diarrhoea/stoma, and investigators determine
             those affect significantly serum K level

          -  Patients who have autoimmune disorders, and investigators determine those affect
             significantly serum K level

          -  Patients whose lab data have suspicion for pseudohyperkalemia

          -  Patients who are pregnant, lactating, or planning to become pregnant

          -  Current participation in interventional studies and/or clinical trials

          -  Patients who, in the opinion of the investigators, would be unlikely to comply with
