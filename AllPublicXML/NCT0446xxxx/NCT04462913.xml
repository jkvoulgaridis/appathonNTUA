      The current common clinical methods cannot truly reflect the biomechanical status of the knee
      joint. Based on the foot-knee coupling mechanism, the simple and practical dynamic gait touch
      information provided by the 3D force platform are closely related to the knee biomechanics.
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the disease feature recognition, computer-aided
      diagnosis and rehabilitation assessment based on the gait touch information related to lower
      limb injuries.

      Background:

      The current common clinical methods cannot truly reflect the biomechanical status of the knee
      joint. The three-dimensional gait analysis is the gold standard, but it is difficult to apply
      clinically. There is an urgent need for a clinically practical method to quantitatively
      evaluate the biomechanics of the knee joint under dynamic weight bearing.

      Methods:

      50 healthy volunteers, 450 sports injuries patients (including hip, knee, and ankle joint
      diseases) and 50 patients with degenerative osteoarthritis were recruited.

      55 passive reflective markers were placed bilaterally on the body. Lower extremity kinematics
      and dynamic plantar pressure during walking, jogging were collected.

      Outcome evaluation indicators and statistical methods: The following indicators use repeated
      measurement two-factor analysis of variance: the left and right sides, different
      rehabilitation times are used as repeated measurement variables, to analyze the biomechanical
      changes of the lower limb joint biomechanics and gait touch information. A variety of machine
      learning methods (such as PCA, SVM, CNN, etc.) are used to analyze, and select the
      appropriate algorithm and parameters according to the learning effect. Finally, this study
      will establish a machine learning models for computer-aided diagnosis, treatment, and
      rehabilitation assessment.
