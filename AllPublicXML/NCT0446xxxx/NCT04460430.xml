    <textblock>
      HR+/HER2-negative BC represent ∼70% of all newly diagnosed breast tumours and are responsible
      for most recurrences and deaths due to this disease, and despite available standard
      therapies, ∼15-20% of hormone tumours recur at distant sites. As BC is a clinically and
      biologically heterogeneous disease, intrincsic subtype may play an important role in
      classifying patients. In this case, HER2-E subtype is present in approximately 6.6-11.0% of
      HR+/HER2-negative tumors and might express either HER2, estrogen receptor (ER) or
      progesterone receptor (PR), we also know that HER2-E is present twice as much in metastatic
      tumors compared to primary tumors and that HER2-E patients may benefit in terms of PFS form
      an anti-HER2 drug as was showed using retrospective sample in EGF30008 trial. Therefore,
      incorporation of novel drugs in combination with endocrine therapy (ET) can improve patient
      outcomes in HR+/HER2-negative BC advanced disease specially in those with HER2-E subtype.

      Methods NEREA is an open-label, single arm, multicenter phase II study evaluating treatment
      with neratinib in combination with ET in pre and post-menopausal women and men with locally
      advanced or metastatic HER2-enriched (HER2-E), HR+/HER2-negative breast cancer who had
      recurrence or progression while receiving previous ET (either aromatase inhibitors, tamoxifen
      or fulvestrant) in the adjuvant setting or to treat advanced disease or both. The study will
      follow a Simon's 2-stage design with one interim and one final efficacy analysis. The primary
      objective will is assess the efficacy of neratinib in combination with ET is this group of
      patients, efficacy will be measured as Progression-Free Survival at 6 months (PFS6) defined
      as the proportion of patients alive and without progression, locally assessed by the
      investigator through the use of RECIST v.1.1 at 24 weeks after first treatment
      administration, imaging evaluation will be performed every 8 weeks for the first 12 months
      following treatment start, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Secondary endpoints include
      Clinical Benefit Rate at 6 months , Overall Response rate, Duration of response, Time to
      response and Incidence, duration and severity of Adverse Events. The interim analysis will be
      conducted when 33 patients are evaluable for the primary endpoint having the potential for at
      least 3 'on treatment' disease assessment scans. If less than 15 patients achieved a PFS6,
      the trial will be terminated for futility in favor of the null hypothesis. If more than 28
      patients achieved a PFS6, the trial will be stopped in favor of the alternative hypothesis
      demonstrating activity. If none of the two above-mentioned conditions are attain, up to a
      further 23 patients may be evaluated, for at least a total of 56 evaluable patients.
      Therefore, if a total of 28 or more patients achieved a PFS6 at the end of the second stage,
      then the null will be rejected in favor of the alternative.

      Eligible patients will receive neratinib 240 mg every day in combination with ET, with either
      exemestane, fulvestrant or tamoxifen: exemestane 25 mg every day orally, tamoxifen 20mg every
      day orally or fulvestrant 500 mg administered in two intramuscular injections of 250 mg each
      at C1D15 and at D1 of each subsequent 28-day cycle at investigator discretion. LHRH agonist
      will be used in men and premenopausal women if no oophorectomy has been performed previously.
      All patients will take prophylactic loperamide with a stablished doses scheme during the firs
      cycle and on demand in subsequent cycles

             (every effort should be done to obtain the sample after the previous therapeutic
             regimen for advanced disease). The tumor tissue should be of good quality based on
             total and viable tumor content and must be evaluated centrally for PAM50 analysis
             prior to enrollment. Patients whose tumor tissue is not evaluable for central testing
             are not eligible unless a biopsy from metastatic lesion is performed for this purpose.

             a) Acceptable samples include core needle biopsies for deep tumor tissue or

             mucosal lesions or biopsies from bone metastases.

             c) Fine needle aspiration, brushing, cell pellet from pleural effusion and lavage
             samples are not acceptable.

          -  * Measurable disease or non-measurable (but evaluable), as defined by RECIST v1.1.
             (Note: Previously irradiated lesions can be considered as measurable disease only if
             disease progression has been unequivocally documented at that site since radiation).

          -  Adequate hematologic and end-organ function

          -  Baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50% measured by echocardiography
             (ECHO) or Multiple Gate Acquisition (MUGA) scan.

        • A male participant must agree to use contraception as detailed in Appendix 3 of this
        protocol during the treatment period and for at least 120 days form the last doses of
        neratinib and refrain from donating sperm during this period.

        Female participants:

          -  A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (see Appendix
             3), not breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies:

          -  Prior treatment with any ERBB2-directed TKI (eg, lapatinib, afatinib, dacomitinib,
             neratinib, tucatinib)

          -  Received prior therapy resulting in a cumulative epirubicin dose &gt;900 mg/m2 or
             cumulative doxorubicin dose &gt;450 mg/m2. If another anthracycline or more than one
             anthracycline has been used, the cumulative dose must not exceed the equivalent of 450
