  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maximal oxygen consumption, VO2max, is the gold standard to evaluate human aerobic fitness,
      which stands for the maximal capacity of cardiorespiratory system and musculoskeletal system
      to transport and utilize oxygen. Previous study showed that there is significant correlation
      between maximal oxygen consumption from cardiopulmonary exercise test and strength and
      endurance of lower extremities. In people with sedentary lifestyle, they often limited by the
      lower limb muscle performance during cardiopulmonary exercise test. Their breathing patterns
      are more irregular than athletes during cardiopulmonary exercise test. However, there is no
      study comparing the activation pattern of respiratory muscles between these two groups.
      Whether the breathing pattern in people with lower exercise capacity is less efficient under
      exertional activities still unknown. The purpose of this study is to investigate the
      relationship between maximal oxygen consumption and inspiratory muscle activation pattern in
      healthy adults.

    <description>This is an observational study. Loaded inspiratory muscle test is setting at 30% of maximal inspiratory pressure. Subjects will perform only 15 breaths under this intensity to exam the performance of their inspiratory muscles. Loaded inspiratory muscle test is not for training. Cardiopulmonary exercise test is performed by using bicycle ergometer. These two tests will be performed at least 1 week separately.</description>
