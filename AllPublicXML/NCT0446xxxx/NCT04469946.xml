  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of OpenSound Navigator (OSN), a hearing
      aid speech-enhancement algorithm developed by Oticon, as treatment for pediatric hearing aid
      users. The study used a within-subjects design with pre- and post-comparisons involving
      fifteen pediatric (ages 6-12) patients with symmetrical sensorineural hearing losses ranging
      from the mild to moderately-severe degree. All participants were fit with bilateral Oticon
      OPN™ behind-the-ear hearing aids set with the OSN algorithm enabled. The investigators
      evaluated hearing aid benefit through word recognition in noise (behavioral testing) and
      everyday hearing/listening abilities (parental/legal guardian reported) within one week of
      the hearing aid fitting (pre-intervention) and two months post fitting (post-intervention).

    <textblock>
      OpenSound Navigator (OSN) is a speech enhancement hearing aid algorithm developed by Oticon
      that utilizes an adaptive directional microphone system with an automatic gain control noise
      reduction program. This hearing aid feature is intended for adult hearing aid users and its
      potential benefits of speech, vocabulary and listening development in pediatric users has not
      been investigated. Here the investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy of OSN programming in
      pediatric hearing aid users (6-12 years of age) diagnosed with a symmetrical sensorineural
      hearing loss in the mild to moderately-severe range. The investigators used a within-subjects
      study design with pre- and post-comparisons. All participants were fit with bilateral Oticon
      OPN™ behind-the-ear hearing aids with the OSN feature enabled. Participants will undergo
      standard audiometric diagnostic testing and will be fit with the hearing aids by a licensed
      clinical audiologist. Participants are required to wear the hearing aids full time (at least
      6 hours per day average) during the duration of the study. The evaluation measures will
      include speech recognition testing in controlled background noise and the Speech, Spatial and
      Qualities of Hearing Scale questionnaire (completed by parents/legal guardian). Testing will
      be performed within a week of the hearing aid fitting (pre-intervention) and two months post
      fitting (post-intervention).

    <measure>Word Recognition in Noise Abilities</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Aided speech perception in noise was evaluated using a novel word recognition in noise test. Recorded target word intensity was fixed at 65 decibels (dB) sound pressure level (SPL) with an adaptive noise level set at an initial level of 55 dB SPL. Participants were instructed to keep their head still, listen closely to the target word and repeat the word back. If the repeated word was correct, the noise level increased by 4 dB, if incorrect, the noise reduced by 4 dB. After the second reversal, the adaptive noise level changed to 2 dB increments. This continued for six more noise level reversals for an overall signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold calculation. The final threshold score indicates the estimated SNR level in which the participant correctly recognizes monosyllabic words 50% of the time (SNR-50). This test was performed within a week of hearing aid fitting and again after two months.</description>

    <description>Long-term vocabulary memory and episodic memory were evaluated using subtests from the standardized NIH Tool Box test. Subtests included the Picture Vocabulary test and the Picture Sequence Memory Test. Tests produced a standardized age-adjusted numeric score.

    <measure>Speech, Spatial Qualities of Hearing Scale (SSQ) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale (SSQ), a survey utilizing an ordinal scale specifically measuring hearing aid benefit with regard to speech understanding, spatial awareness, perceptual quality of sound, and conversation, was completed by parents/legal guardian within a week of the hearing aid fitting and after wearing the study hearing aids for two months. There are 4 survey sections. Section A: Speech has 8 questions, Section B: Spatial Hearing has 5 questions, Section C: Qualities of Hearing has 8 questions and Section D: Conversational Uses of Hearing has 5 questions. Each question uses a scale ranging from 0 (poorest possible outcome) to 100 (best possible outcome). Each section calculates an average score across the corresponding questions for a total of 4 individual scores.</description>

    <description>Glasgow Hearing Aid Benefit Profile, a survey utilizing an ordinal scale with regard to perceived hearing aid benefit was completed by parents/legal guardians within a week of the hearing aid fit and after two months of hearing aid use. It includes 24 questions assessing change in hearing disability, handicap, hearing aid use, benefit and satisfaction and residual (aided) disability relative to the benefit of their previous hearing aids. Each question uses a scale ranging from -100 (reduced benefit) to +100 (increased benefit) with all questions averaged to make a final numeric score.</description>
