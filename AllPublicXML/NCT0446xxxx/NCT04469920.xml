      This will be a Phase 1, Open-label Study of Participants with Hepatic Impairment, Cholestatic
      Liver Disease, and NASH with Advanced Fibrosis and Normal Hepatic Function
    </textblock>

    <textblock>
      Male and female participants 18-80 years of age (inclusive) with normal hepatic function or
      hepatic impairment/disease who meet all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria.
      Subjects with hepatic impairment will be enrolled based upon the Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT)
      classification system for mild hepatic impairment (Group 1 CPT Class A without PHT; Group 2
      CPT Class A with PHT), moderate hepatic impairment (Group 3 Decompensated CPT Class B), or
      severe hepatic impairment (Group 4 Decompensated CPT Class C). Group 5 will include subjects
      with cholestatic liver disease and Group 6 will include subjects with non-cirrhotic advanced
      fibrosis secondary to NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis). The control group (Group 7) will
      consist of demographic matched subjects with normal hepatic function.
