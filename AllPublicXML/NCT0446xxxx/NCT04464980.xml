    <textblock>
      This is a two phase study investigating combinations of pharmacological and behavioral
      interventions to optimize the treatment of Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). The retention phase
      will assess strategies for improving retention on Buprenorphine (BUP) and Extended-Release
      Injection Naltrexone (XR-NTX). The discontinuation phase will assess which approaches are
      most likely to lead to long-term success (absence of relapse), and what characteristics of
      participants distinguish those who can safely discontinue Medications for Opioid Use Disorder
      (MOUD) from those who remain at risk of relapse and should not discontinue.

      The main objectives of this study are:

        1. To test, among patients seeking treatment for OUD, strategies to improve retention in
           treatment on MOUD.

        2. To test, among patients who have achieved stable remission on MOUD and want to
           discontinue MOUD, strategies to improve outcomes.

        3. To develop predictive models of successful discontinuation of MOUD among patients who
           discontinue medication, based on patient characteristics, including duration of MOUD
           prior to discontinuation.

      The study will have a multicenter, randomized, non-blinded design.

        in order to be eligible to participate in the study.

          1. 18 years of age or older;

          2. Meet DSM-5 criteria for current opioid use disorder (heroin, fentanyl or other
             synthetic opioids, and/or prescription opioids);

          3. Seeking treatment for opioid use disorder and choosing either buprenorphine (BUP) or
             extended-release injection naltrexone (XR-NTX);

          4. If choosing buprenorphine, willing to be randomized to SL-BUP-16mg, SL-BUP-32mg, or
             XR-BUP;

          5. Willing to be randomized to either MM (standard Medical Management plus counseling
             treatment as usual available at the site) or MMR (MM plus usual counseling and access
             to the reSET mHealth app);

          6. In good-enough general health (meaning good enough health to be in outpatient
             treatment) as determined by the study medical clinician on the basis of medical
             history, review of systems, and physical/mental status exam, to permit treatment with
             XR-NTX or BUP;

          7. Willing and able to provide written informed consent;

          8. Able to speak English sufficiently to understand the study procedures;

          9. If female of childbearing potential, willing to practice an effective method of birth
             control for the duration of participation in the study (participants who become
             pregnant during the study will continue to be followed; treatment may be modified
             consistent with pregnancy).

        Exclusion Criteria for Retention Phase: Individuals meeting any of the exclusion criteria
        will be excluded from study participation.

          1. Serious medical, psychiatric, or co-occurring substance use disorder or concomitant
             medication that, in the opinion of the study medical clinician, makes the patient not
             appropriate for outpatient treatment with buprenorphine or XR-NTX, but instead
             requires a higher or different level of care. Examples include:

               1. Disabling or terminal medical illness (e.g., uncompensated heart failure,
                  cirrhosis or end-stage liver disease) as assessed by medical history, review of
                  systems, physical exam and/or laboratory assessments;

               2. Severe, untreated or inadequately treated psychiatric condition (e.g., active
                  psychosis, uncontrolled bipolar disorder) as assessed by history and/or clinical
                  interview, requiring a different level of care (e.g., hospitalization);

               3. Current severe alcohol, benzodiazepine, or other depressant or sedative hypnotic
                  use, requiring a different level of care (e.g., hospitalization);

          2. Suicidal or homicidal ideation or behavior requiring a different level of care (e.g.,
             hospitalization);

          3. Known allergy or sensitivity to preferred medication or its components (i.e.,
             buprenorphine, naloxone, etc. for those preferring BUP; naltrexone,
             polylactide-co-glycolide, etc. for those preferring XR-NTX);

          4. Maintenance on methadone at the time of signing consent;

          5. For those preferring XR-NTX, presence of pain of sufficient severity as to require
             ongoing pain management with opioids;

          6. For those preferring XR-NTX, body habitus that, in the judgment of the study
             physician, precludes safe intramuscular injection of XR-NTX (e.g., BMI&gt;40, excess fat
             tissue over the buttocks, emaciation);

          7. If female, currently pregnant or breastfeeding or planning on conception;

          8. Are currently in jail, prison or other overnight facility as required by court of law
             or have pending legal action that could prevent participation in study activities;

          9. Have used the reSET or reSET-O mHealth app in the 3 months prior to consent;

         10. Other major reasons that might prevent an individual from participating in the study
             (e.g., a planned move out of the area).

        Inclusion Criteria for Discontinuation Phase: Individuals must meet all of the inclusion
        criteria in order to be eligible to participate in the study.

          1. 18 years of age or older;

          2. Have been receiving buprenorphine for OUD for at least the past year or XR-NTX
             pharmacotherapy for OUD for at least the past 6 months prior to consent for the
             Discontinuation Phase;

          3. Express the desire to discontinue MOUD after a shared decision-making discussion with
             the treating provider;

          4. Meet stability criteria, i.e., have abstained from opioids (other than buprenorphine),
             cocaine, methamphetamine, and non-prescribed benzodiazepines for the past ≥12 weeks,
             and do not meet DSM-5 criteria for current (≥12 weeks) alcohol use disorder
             (participants with cannabis use will be eligible);

          5. If currently taking buprenorphine, are willing to take either SL-BUP or XR-BUP if
             randomized to that condition;

          6. Willing to be randomized to either MM or to MMD;

          7. Able to provide written informed consent after discussion with their provider
             regarding the risks of discontinuation;

          8. Able to speak English sufficiently to understand the study procedures;

          9. If female of childbearing potential, willing to practice an effective method of birth
             control for the duration of participation in the study (participants who become
             pregnant during the study will continue to be followed; treatment may be modified
             consistent with pregnancy).

        Exclusion Criteria for Discontinuation Phase: Individuals meeting any of the exclusion
        criteria will be excluded from study participation.

          1. Serious medical or psychiatric disorder or concomitant medication that, in the opinion
             of the study medical clinician, would make study participation hazardous to the
             participant or compromise study findings or would prevent the participant from
             completing the study. Examples include:

               1. Disabling or terminal medical illness (e.g., uncompensated heart failure,
                  cirrhosis or end-stage liver disease) as assessed by medical history, review of
                  systems, physical exam and/or laboratory assessments;

               2. Severe, untreated, or inadequately treated psychiatric condition (e.g., active
                  psychosis, uncontrolled bipolar disorder) as assessed by history and/or clinical
                  interview, requiring a different level of care (e.g., hospitalization);

          2. Suicidal or homicidal ideation or behavior requiring a different level of care (e.g.,
             hospitalization);

          3. For participants entering the study taking buprenorphine, presence of pain requiring
             or likely requiring ongoing pain management with buprenorphine or other opioids;

          4. If female, currently pregnant or breastfeeding or planning on conception;

          5. Use of opioids (other than buprenorphine), cocaine, methamphetamine, or non-prescribed
             benzodiazepines in the past 12 weeks;

          6. Meets current DSM-5 criteria for any current alcohol use disorder;

          7. Are currently in jail, prison or other overnight facility as required by court of law
             or have pending legal action that could prevent participation in study activities;

          8. Have used the Connections mHealth app in the 3 months prior to consent;

          9. Other major reasons that might prevent an individual from participating in the study
             (e.g., a planned move out of the area.
