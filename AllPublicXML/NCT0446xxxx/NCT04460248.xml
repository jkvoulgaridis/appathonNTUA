        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment-naive pathologically confirmed patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
             (DLBCL)

          -  Reluctant to undergo systemic chemotherapy or not suitable for chemotherapy defined as
             ECOG&gt;2, ADL&lt;100 or CCI&gt;1

          -  Radiography detects measurable lesions defined as at least 1 clearly defined
             lesion/nodule with both long and short diameters longer than or equal to 1.5cm

          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 months determined by researchers

          -  The patient or his or her legal representative must provide written informed consent
             prior to any special examination or procedure for the research

          -  Research drugs have not been used before

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has received systemic or local anti-lymphoma treatment, including
             chemotherapy, within three weeks before enrollment

          -  The patient has complications of uncontrolled cardiovascular diseases, blood clotting
             disorders, connective tissue diseases, serious infectious diseases and other diseases

          -  Laboratory measures meet the following criteria at screening (unless caused by
             lymphoma):

               1. Neutrophils&lt;1.5 x 10^9/L

               2. Platelets&lt;80 x 10^9/L

               3. ALT or AST is 2 times higher than the normal upper limit, AKP and bilirubin are
                  1.5 times higher than normal upper limit

               4. Creatinine is 1.5 times higher than the normal upper limit

          -  Other concurrent and uncontrolled medical conditions that the researchers believe that
             they will affect the patient's participation in the study, including patients with
             psychosis or other known or suspected patients who cannot fully comply with the
             research protocol

          -  HIV-infected patients

          -  Patients with HbsAg positive are required to have negative HBV DNA before entering the
             group. In addition, if the patient is HBsAg negative but HBcAb positive (regardless of
             HBsAb status), HBV DNA test is also required, and if the result is positive,
             anti-viral treatment is also required, and negative HBV DNA is required before
             entering the group

          -  Other medical conditions determined by the researchers that may affect the study
