  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ALMS and BBS syndromes are rare diseases with overlapping features of multiple sensory and
      metabolic impairments, including diabetes mellitus. There are to date no specific treatments
      available and limited information on the natural history of the diseases. the investigators
      aim to establish a French cohort for these diseases to improve patient care and assess the
      effect of actual therapies on quality of life.

      The purpose of this study is to establish a cohort of Bardet-Bield syndrome (BBS) and ALström
      syndrome (ALMS) patients in order to formalize and address questions concerning the in-depth
      natural clinical and biological history of the disease on the long term for a given patient,
      establish the impact on the quality of life of various clinical manifestations

    <description>RaDiCo-COBBALT is considered as an interventional with minor associated risks and constrains study due to the presence of skin biopsies that may not all be part of the usual medical practice. Risks are those linked to the biopsy procedure:
risk of pain due to the procedure performed under local anaesthesia
can leave a visible scar (about 2 x 1 cm)</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients of both sex

          -  Age minimum*

          -  patients with social protection

          -  Written informed consent form signed prior initiating any trial related procedure:

               -  by &gt; 18-year old patients

               -  by both parents for minor patients &gt; 4 months or legal representative for
                  protected adults, and by minor and protected adults patients if able to
                  understand and/or give their assent.

               -  For foreign patients, a third party will translate, if required, the information
                  prior to the consent.

          -  a diagnosis of BBS or ALMS based on molecular assessment or clinical evaluation/or
             patient with mutation and none of the diagnosis criteria

          -  and/or an identified mutation in BBS genes or ALMS1 gene

               -  The inclusion of children is essential to a cohort study that is attempting an
                  early identification of visual, metabolic and renal abnormalities. Many of the
                  age-dependent manifestations of BBS develop during childhood and the average age
                  of diagnosis is 9.2 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Serious active intercurrent pathology that may impact the collected data

          -  Patient under judicial protection

          -  Participation in another interventional clinical trial which includes an exclusion
             period

          -  Non protected adult with difficulty of comprehension, or inability to understand the
             delivered information (emergency situation ...).
