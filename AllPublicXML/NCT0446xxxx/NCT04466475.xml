    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of 211At-OKT10-B10 when given
      together with melphalan before a stem cell transplantation in treating patients with multiple
      myeloma. The radioimmunotherapy drug 211At-OKT10-B10 is a monoclonal antibody, called
      OKT10-B10, linked to a radioactive substance called 211At. OKT10-B10 attaches to CD38
      positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers 211At to kill them. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as melphalan, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells,
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Giving 211At-OKT10-B10 with melphalan before a stem cell transplant may kill more
      cancer cells.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of 211At-OKT10-B10.

      Patients receive 211At-OKT10-B10 intravenously (IV) continuously on days -7 to -4 and
      melphalan via infusion on day -2. Patients then undergo peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC)
      transplantation on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days, between 80 and 90
      days, at 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months, and then annually thereafter.
