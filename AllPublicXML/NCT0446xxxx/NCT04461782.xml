  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vaginal microbiota is abundantly colonized by Lactobacillus genera. When vaginal microbiota
      gets altered, opportunistic microorganisms may proliferate and become abundant species giving
      rise to dysbiosis.

      Probiotics are living organisms that provide the host certain benefits. Despite probiotics
      have been historically linked to intestinal microbiota, several research groups have
      published positive results for some Lactobacillus strains in vaginal microbiota. The
      Lactobacillus strain investigated in the presented project showed the ability to prevent
      recurrent vaginal Candidiasis in women with high vaginal candidiasis prevalence.

      Nowadays the Lactobacillus strain here investigated is commercialized as vaginal caps,
      however oral intake is widely preferred among consumers. Because of that, this study aims to
      determine whether this Lactobacillus strain is able to colonize vaginal microbiota when
      administered orally.
