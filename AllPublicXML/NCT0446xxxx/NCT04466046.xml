  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nausea and vomiting after surgery are one of the complications that occur after general
      anesthesia, and the frequency is reported to range from 10% to 80% in the high-risk group.
      Several studies have introduced drugs and methods to prevent nausea and vomiting after
      surgery. Among them, midazolam administered before surgery is known to have anti-anxiolytic
      and sedative effects on the prevention of nausea and vomiting after surgery. It has also been
      reported to increase its effectiveness when administered with other antiemetic agents.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of administration of combination with
      midazolam and different antiemetic agents on the prevention of postoperative nausea and
      vomiting in high-risk patients.

      This prospective study evaluates female, nonsmoking patients undergoing laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy. The patients are randomly allocated to either group MR (midazolam 0.05mg/kg
      with ramosetron 0.3mg) or group MP (midazolam 0.05mg/kg with palonosetron 0.075mg). The
      incidence of PONV, severity of nausea, use of rescue antiemetics, and pain severity was
      evaluated at 2 hours, 24hours, and 48 hours after surgery.
