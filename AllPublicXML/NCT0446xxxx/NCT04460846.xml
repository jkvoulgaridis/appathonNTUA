  <brief_summary>

      To conduct a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial in a population
      of chronically, moderately dehydrated people comparing two waters on hydration status.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled cross-over study design will be used to
      evaluate the effects of consumption of alkaline water against reverse osmosis water. The
      study is of 5 weeks' duration, with evaluation at baseline, 2 weeks (beginning of wash-out
      period), 3 weeks (end of wash-out period), and 5 weeks.
