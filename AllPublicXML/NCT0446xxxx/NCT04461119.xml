  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, 4-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study designed
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability, EEG effects, and preliminary efficacy of two fixed oral
      doses of evenamide of 7.5 mg and 15 mg bid (15 and 30 mg/day) in outpatients with chronic
      schizophrenia who are receiving treatment at constant doses of one of the following atypical
      antipsychotics: aripiprazole, clozapine, quetiapine, olanzapine, paliperidone or risperidone.
      Approximately 120 patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either evenamide
      7.5 or 15 mg, or placebo, given bid.
