    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to measure the evolution of the quality of life in infants
      between 0 and 5 months old, not breastfed and suffering from regurgitation or colic,
      following nutritional management of these disorders by a preparation for thickened infants,
      reduced in lactose content and supplemented with Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938. Quality of
      life is assessed using the QUALIN questionnaire (APPENDIX 1).
