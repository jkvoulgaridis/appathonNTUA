  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this proposal is to investigate the effect of non-invasive repetitive
      cerebellar transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on motor control in progressive
      supranuclear (PSP). The central hypothesis is that augmenting cerebellar inhibition via
      cerebellar rTMS will decrease postural instability in patients with PSP by increasing
      functional connectivity between the cerebellum, thalamus, and primary motor cortex.

    <intervention_name>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)</intervention_name>
    <description>Aim 1: To determine the clinical effects of rTMS targeting the cerebellum on postural instability in PSP. The hypothesis to be tested is that TMS augmentation of cerebellar inhibition will improve cerebellum-dependent balance symptoms of PSP for a period of time sufficient to improve rehabilitation outcomes. The investigators will measure a battery of objective posturography metrics and other measures of motor control, including sway and center of pressure changes to backward tilt and forward translation.
Aim 2: To determine the effects on brain network connectivity of rTMS targeting the cerebellum in PSP. The hypothesis to be tested is that resting state fMRI connectivity between the cerebellum, thalamus, and cortex will be enhanced after rTMS, reflecting increased cerebellar inhibition of the motor cortex after treatment.</description>
