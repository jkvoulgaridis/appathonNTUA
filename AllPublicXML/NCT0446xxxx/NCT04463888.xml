  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed study, the investigators assumed that high dose of repetitive motor task
      training using an exoskeleton robot-assisted system may provide benefits in motor shaping and
      greater brain priming for hand paresis of the stroke patients. Nevertheless, the amount of
      therapeutic activity with clinicians' guidance is often short of number in therapy
      sessions.Therefore, using Internet of Things (IoT), connected rehabilitation products and the
      data they generate that are a new trend of rehabilitation strategy for providing remote
      home-programs support. The specific aim of this study is to to explore the feasibility of
      introducing the rental services of a Smart Home-based Exoskeleton Robot System through the
      IoT business model. And the second purpose is to investigate the effects of applying the
      exoskeleton robotic device for tenodesisgrip training as a home-based treatment for chronic
      stroke patients.The expected outcomes of this research are to clarify the feasibility of
      using IoT business model for launching smart rehabilitation device rental service and the
      effects of application a high dosage of hand movement training as home program on motor and
      hand function for patients with chronic stroke.
