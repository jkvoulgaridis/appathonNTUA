  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stretching is reported to decrease muscle strength and thus suggested to be avoided prior to
      athletic events but with conflicting reports. This time course study aimed to assess acute
      effects of static stretching of different durations on isometric maximum voluntary
      contraction force of calf muscle.

      Stretching is reported to decrease muscle strength and thus suggested to be avoided prior to
      athletic events but with conflicting reports. This time course study aimed to assess acute
      effects of static stretching of different durations on isometric maximum voluntary
      contraction force of calf muscle. Pretest posttest experimental design was used. 14 subjects
      participated in three experimental trials: Static stretching for 2 minutes (SS2), static
      stretching for 4 minutes (SS4), and static stretching for 8 minutes (SS8). Strength was
      measured before (pre), immediately after (post), and at 10- and 20- minutes post stretching.
      Each static stretching (SS) trial involved varied repetitions of 30-seconds self-stretches
      and 20-seconds relax periods.
