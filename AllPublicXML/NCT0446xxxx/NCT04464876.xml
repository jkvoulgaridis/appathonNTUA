        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18 years or older.

          2. Severe functional mitral regurgitation (≥ Grade 3+).

          3. NYHA functional Class ≥ II. If Class IV, patient must be ambulatory.

          4. Treatment and compliance with optimal guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for
             heart failure for at least 30 days.

          5. Not a suitable candidate for open mitral valve surgery due to high operative risk, as
             determined by the Heart Team.

          6. Able to complete quality-of-life assessment (KCCQ).

        General Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Excessive frailty or comorbid conditions that preclude the anticipated benefit of the
             valve replacement.

          2. Life expectancy &lt;1 yr due to noncardiac conditions.

          3. Active endocarditis.

          4. Active systemic infection.

          5. Modified Rankin Scale ≥4 disability.

          6. Hemodialysis/ chronic renal failure (eGFR &lt; 35 mL/min/m2).

          7. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (fixed PAS &lt; 60mmHg). 8) COPD on home oxygen.

        9) Refuses blood transfusions. 10) Documented bleeding or coagulation conditions (hypo- or
        hyper-coagulable states).

        11) Severe connective tissue disease under chronic immunosuppressive or cortisone therapy.

        12) Pregnant/ lactating. Females of childbearing age must be willing to take
        contraceptives.

        13) Participating in other investigational studies likely to confound the results or affect
        the study.

          3. Severe extracardiac arteriopathy (safety measure for extra-circulatory support if
             surgical conversion is needed).

          4. Prior mitral valve treatment (e.g. valve repair or replacement, MitraClip, etc.),
             and/or anticipated mitral valve treatment prior to enrollment.

         11. Adequately treated for cardiac condition per applicable standards, such as for
             coronary artery disease, left ventricular dysfunction, mitral regurgitation, or heart
             failure. No need for revascularization.

         12. Prior or planned heart transplantation (UNOS status 1).

         13. Physical evidence of right-sided congestive heart failure:

               1. Patients with ascites.

               2. Patients with anasarca (generalized edema / hydropsy).

         14. Chest condition that prevents transapical access.

         15. Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to procedural or post-procedural medication
             (e.g., contrast solution, anticoagulation therapy).

         16. Documented hypersensitivity to nickel or titanium.

        Cardiac Exclusion Criteria (evaluated by Core Labs):

          1. Left ventricular EF ≤ 30% by imaging.

          2. Severe mitral annular calcification, severe mitral stenosis, valvular vegetation or
             mass.

          3. Extensive mitral flail leaflets.

          4. Left ventricular thrombus, mass, or vegetation.

          5. Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter &gt; 7.5 cm.
