    <measure>The ability to calculate and display cardiac output (CO).</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, approximately 2 days</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the number of times a CO calibration sequence is successfully completed and the CO is displayed divided by the number of times the pinging sequence is attempted. The endpoint is a rate and therefore has no units of measure. It is the &quot;number of times CO was successfully completed, and CO is displayed&quot; divided by the &quot;number of times the pinging sequence was attempted&quot;</description>

    <description>Subjects will receive the Impella® with the Impella® Hemodynamics Platform prior to High risk percutaneous coronary intervention (HRPCI). Device escalation or early termination of the study will be allowed for subjects as deemed necessary by the treating physician. Subjects will be consented for follow-up through discharge from the index HRPCI admission.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 18 years

          2. Subject presents for elective PCI

          3. Subject or the subject's LAR has signed the informed consent

          4. Subject indicated for Impella® support

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any contraindication or inability to place an Impella® including tortuous vascular
             anatomy, femoral bruits or absent pedal pulses

          2. Cardiogenic shock defined as systemic hypotension (SBP&lt;90mmHg or the need for
             inotropes/vasopressors to maintain an SBP &gt;90mmHg) plus one of the following:

               1. Any requirement for inotropes/vasopressors prior to arrival at the catherization
                  lab

               2. Clinical evidence of end organ hypoperfusion

               3. Use of IABP or any other circulatory support device

          3. Suspected systemic active infection

          4. Suspected or known pregnancy

          5. Known contraindication to heparin, pork, pork products, or contrast media

          6. Subject has other medical, social, or psychological problems that, in the opinion of
             the Investigator, compromises the subject's ability to give written informed consent
             and/or to comply with study procedures

          7. Participation in the active treatment or follow-up phase of another clinical study of
             an investigational drug or device which has not reached its primary end point.

          8. Subject belongs to a vulnerable population [Vulnerable subject populations are defined
             as individuals with mental disability, persons in nursing homes, children,
             impoverished persons, homeless persons, nomads, refugees, and those permanently
             incapable of giving informed consent. Vulnerable populations also may include members
             of a group with a hierarchical structure such as university students, subordinate
             hospital and laboratory personnel, employees of the Sponsor, members of the armed
             forces, and persons kept in detention
