      Objective: Verification of ADHD Treatment Effectiveness of Mobile Neurofeedback to Subjects
      of Child and Youth with ADHD.

      Method: Mobile Neurofeedback Program is implemented for 165 ADHD patients aged 8 to 15 to
      verify their effectiveness by conducting pre-post evaluation. Prior to the implementation of
      the intervention, we conduct a survey with demographic information, behavioral
      characteristics, clinical global impression, neuropsychological test, brain MRI, NIRS and
      EEG.

      The drug naive subjects are randomly assigned to the mobile Neurofeedback group or Sham
      control group. The subjects on medication are randomly assigned to the mobile Neurofeedback
      group or Sham control group, In addition to the medication being administered.

      The intervention are conducted three times a week, twice a day, and 10-20 minutes for 12
      weeks, and the effectiveness is assessed four times in advance, third month, sixth month and
      twelfth months.

      However, the Sham control group were provided the same machines and programs as the
      Neurofeedback exercise, but feedback is generated randomly regardless of ectroencephalogram
      change of the subjects.

    <description>to maximize usability and effectiveness, we would like to conduct a study that regulates theta/beta ratio using mobile app-based Neurofeedback Training Equipment (OmniCNS).
The actual Neurofeedback training allows you to download and use the omnifit brain_Game, an application with an audio guide. After the pre-assessment, the researcher will provide guidance to subjects and carers on how to use the application, and demonstrate how to use it in practice. For 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 6 weeks, phone calls are conducted to check whether they are used or not and for any inconvenience. After 12 weeks of Neurofeedback training, the device is returned and post-evaluated.
The application is equipped with four types of games and is instructed to use the three-day-a-week application. For Neurofeedback attention and cognitive training, use a headset with left and right frontal lobe 2 channel-EEG sensors to perform the game through feedback to see if it is concentrating well.</description>

    <description>It uses the sham devices and programs as the Neurofeedback, but it is not usually possible to obtain the expected effects of the Neurofeedback by providing random feedback regardless of actual brain waves.
In case of Sham control group, parental education is conducted the same for each clinical evaluation, and in case of Sham control group, actual Neurofeedback is applied if patients and parents want it after the end of the study.</description>
