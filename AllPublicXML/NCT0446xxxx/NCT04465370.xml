  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess Cardiac Output Monitoring in pediatric subjects by comparing FloTrac and ClearSight
      system to intermittent thermodilution Swan-Ganz, in order to expand the indications of
      FloTrac, ClearSight and Swan-Ganz thermodilution pulmonary artery catheter to the pediatric
      population 12 to 18 years of age.
