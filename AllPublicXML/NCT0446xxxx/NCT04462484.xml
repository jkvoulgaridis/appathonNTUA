  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the efficacy of MAGO (Online Self-care Training Program for
      Psychologists), a new person-directed, individual, occupational intervention via
      videoconference in six weekly sessions. By promoting self-care behaviors, it is expected to
      reduce burnout levels and to increase work engagement in clinical psychologists working in
      Chile.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical psychologists are susceptible to develop burnout as a result of facing consistently
      emotionally taxing job demands and a high requirement for empathy. Implementing self-care
      behaviors can help to prevent negative consequences of work stress and the promotion of
      positive outcomes such as optimal professional functioning and enhanced well-being in
      psychologists.

      The intervention will be a person-directed, individual, primary occupational intervention. It
      will be carried out via videoconference in six weekly sessions of 45 minutes. MAGO is a new
      program derived from Self-care Assessment for Psychology (SCAP). From a preventive
      perspective on self-care, items represent strategies or behaviors that may be integrated into
      one's professional and personal life on a more ongoing and proactive basis to promote
      well-functioning.

      Chile has presented a slow but progressive development of e-mental health research, and
      Internet-based interventions are at an early stage of development in this country. Using
      videoconference and web-delivered questionnaires are crucial in reaching psychologists
      considering problems such as long distances of transportation and a tiny budget for mental
      health. Nevertheless, Chile scores 52 in the Global Connectivity Index, while digital
      technologies are highly utilized across all social strata.

    <description>The intervention will be a person-directed, individual, primary occupational intervention. It will be carried out via videoconference in six weekly sessions of 45 minutes. Through guided dialogue, individual difficulties and opportunities of each subject will be examined in order to gain self-awareness of personal characteristics (strengths, limitations, maximum workload capacity) in their particular set of job demands and resources. Participants are encouraged to adopt the set of self-care strategies in each dimension, adapting them to their specific context. Activities will be carried out in Spanish by the researcher.</description>
