      The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with BAN2401 is superior
      to placebo on change from baseline of the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite 5 (PACC5)
      at 216 weeks of treatment (A45 Trial) and to determine whether treatment with BAN2401 is
      superior to placebo in reducing brain amyloid accumulation as measured by amyloid positron
      emission tomography (PET) at 216 weeks of treatment (A3 Trial).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

        Participants must meet all of the following criteria to be included in this study:

          1. Male or female, age 55 to 80 years inclusive at the time of informed consent

             • Those 55 to 64 must have 1 of the following additional risk factors, given the
             relatively low rates of amyloid positivity less than (&lt;) 65 years:

               -  First degree relative diagnosed with dementia onset before age 75, or

               -  Known to possess at least 1 apolipoprotein E4 variant (APOE4) allele, or

               -  Known before screening to have elevated brain amyloid according to previous PET
                  or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing. Individuals with historical amyloid PET
                  scans with intermediate brain amyloid (example, from preclinical Alzheimer's
                  disease (AD) studies such as A4 or EARLY) are eligible to be screened, provided
                  the participant did not participate in any clinical studies involving
                  anti-amyloid therapies subsequent to the PET assessment

          2. Global Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of 0 at screening

          3. Mini Mental State Examination score greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 27 (with educational
             adjustments) at screening

          4. Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised Logical Memory subscale II (WMS-R LM II) score at
             screening of &gt;=6

          5. A45 Trial: Elevated brain amyloid pathology by amyloid PET: defined as approximately
             greater than (&gt;) 40 Centiloids on screening scan

             A3 Trial: Intermediate levels of brain amyloid pathology by amyloid PET: defined as
             approximately 20 to 40 Centiloids on screening scan

          6. Has a study partner that is willing to participate as a source of information and has
             approximately weekly contact with the participant (contact can be in-person, via
             telephone or electronic communication). The study partner must have sufficient contact
             such that the investigator feels the study partner can provide meaningful information
             about the participant's daily function

          7. Provide written informed consent

          8. Willing and able to comply with all aspects of the protocol

        Exclusion criteria:

        Participants who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from this study:

          1. Females who are breastfeeding or pregnant at screening or baseline

          2. Females of childbearing potential who:

             • Within 28 days before study entry, did not use a highly effective method of
             contraception

             For sites outside of the European union (EU), it is permissible that if a highly
             effective method of contraception is not appropriate or acceptable to the participant,
             then the participant must agree to use a medically acceptable method of contraception

          3. History of transient ischemic attacks (TIA), stroke, or seizures within 12 months of
             screening

          4. Current or history within the past 2 years of psychiatric diagnosis or symptoms that,
             in the opinion of the investigator, could interfere with study procedures

          5. Contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, including cardiac
             pacemaker/defibrillator, ferromagnetic metal implants or exhibit other significant
             pathological findings on brain MRI at screening

          6. Hypersensitivity to any monoclonal antibody treatment

          7. Any immunological disease which is not adequately controlled, or which requires
             treatment with immunoglobulins, systemic monoclonal antibodies (or derivatives of
             monoclonal antibodies), systemic immunosuppressants, or plasmapheresis during the
             study

          8. Bleeding disorder that is not under adequate control (including a platelet count
             &lt;50,000 or international normalized ratio [INR] &gt;1.5) at screening

          9. Results of laboratory tests conducted during screening that are outside the following
             limits:

               -  Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) above normal range

               -  Abnormally low (below lower limit of normal [LLN]) serum vitamin B12 levels for
                  the testing laboratory (if participant is taking vitamin B12 injections, level
                  should be at or above the LLN for the testing laboratory). A low vitamin B12 is
                  exclusionary, unless the required follow-up labs (homocysteine and methylmalonic
                  acid [MMA]) indicate that it is not physiologically significant

         10. Known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive

         11. Any other clinically significant abnormalities that in the opinion of the investigator
             require further investigation or treatment or may interfere with study procedures or
             safety

         12. Malignant neoplasms within 3 years of screening (except for basal or squamous cell
             carcinoma in situ of the skin, or localized prostate cancer in male participants with
             treatment cycles completed at least 6 months before screening). Participants who had
             malignant neoplasms but who have had at least 3 years of documented uninterrupted
             remission before screening need not be excluded

         13. Answer &quot;yes&quot; to Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) suicidal ideation Type
             4 or 5, or any suicidal behavior assessment within 6 months before screening, at
             screening, or at baseline, or has been hospitalized or treated for suicidal behavior
             in the past 5 years before screening

         14. Known or suspected history of drug or alcohol abuse or dependence within 2 years
             before screening or a positive urine drug test at screening. Participants who test
             positive for benzodiazepines, opioids, or tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in urine drug
             testing need not be excluded unless in the clinical opinion of the investigator this
             is due to potential drug abuse

         15. Taking prohibited medications

         16. Participation in a clinical study involving:

               -  Any therapeutic monoclonal antibody, protein derived from a monoclonal antibody,
                  immunoglobulin therapy, or vaccine within 6 months before screening (anti-amyloid
                  therapies within 1 year before screening), unless it can be documented that the
                  participant was randomized to placebo or never received study drug

               -  BAN2401

               -  Any new chemical entities or investigational drug for AD within 6 months before
                  screening unless it can be documented that the participant received only placebo

               -  Any other investigational medication or device study in the 8 weeks or 5
                  half-lives (whichever is longer) of the medication before randomization unless it
                  can be documented that the participant was in a placebo treatment arm

         17. Planned surgery during the prerandomization phase or within 3 months of randomization,
             which requires general anesthesia
