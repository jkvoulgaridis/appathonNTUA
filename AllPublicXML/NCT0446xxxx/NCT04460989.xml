  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the benefit of personalized prostheses
      compared to conventional prostheses on patient satisfaction 24 months after total knee
      arthroplasty.

    <textblock>
      Prospective randomized monocentric prospective comparative study carried out as a single
      blind study on two parallel groups (standard implant or customized implant).

      Secondary Objectives: Compare between groups :

        -  the functional outcome of the arthroplasty

        -  pain progression

        -  the evolution of the quality of life

        -  the conditions of the surgery (duration of surgery, length of hospitalization, blood
           loss)

        -  the frequency of adverse events related to arthroplasty

    <measure>IKS self-questionnaire Score at M24</measure>
    <time_frame>24 MONTHS</time_frame>
    <description>The score obtained on the IKS self-questionnaire at 24 months will be compared between the two treatment groups by an analysis of covariance, with the basal IKS score as a covariate and the type of prosthesis as a factor.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SF12 score at M24</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The comparison between groups will be made on the evolution of scores, in relation to the baseline value, by an analysis of covariance with treatment and time as fixed factors, the subject as a random factor and the baseline value as a covariate. The interaction Time x Treatment will be added to the model. The effects of time and treatment will be tested at each evaluation point.</description>
