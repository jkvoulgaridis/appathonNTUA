    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of THC,
      11-OH-THC and CBD following a single inhaled dose of PPP001 administered by vaporization.

      The secondary objective of this study was to determine the safety and tolerability of THC and
      CBD after a single inhaled dose of PPP001 administered by vaporization in healthy volunteers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Body mass index within 21.0 to 32.0 kg/m2, inclusively

          -  A light-, non- or ex-smoker of nicotine

          -  A history of recreational cannabis use (at least 10 times in the last 5 years)

          -  Consumed cannabis in the last 3 months before Day 1 of the study, but not within 1
             month before Day 1 of the study

          -  Presence of intact oral mucosa

          -  Able to follow instructions at the training vaporizing session

             investigator

          -  No clinically significant diseases captured in the medical history or evidence of
             clinically significant findings on the physical examination (including vital signs),
             or ECG, as determined by an investigator
