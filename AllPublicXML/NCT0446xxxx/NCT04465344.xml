  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a multicentric, prospective open-label ethics committee approved clinical
      study to investigate safety, visual outcomes, contrast sensitivity and rotational stability
      after bilateral implantation of Isatis TF IOL following cataract surgery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentric, prospective, open-label clinical study whereby patients undergoing
      routine cataract surgery will have bilateral implantation of hydrophobic acrylic refractive
      trifocal intraocular lenses (Isatis TF).

      The investigational device and all study products, including the devices used for the study
      examinations, will be used within the intended use specifications from the manufacturer. In
      addition, no invasive or other burdening examinations will occur for the patient.

      The study will be carried out in up to five clinical centers in Spain.

      The device under investigation is a hydrophobic acrylic trifocal intraocular lens (IOL)
      manufactured by the sponsor of this study. The trifocality of this investigational device is
      based on a purely refractive principle with the goal to provide additional near and
      intermediate visual acuity with low photic side effects. The IOLs will be implanted in the
      course of routine cataract surgery and will benefit to patients suffering from cataract
      development.

      In total 120 patients will be recruited for this clinical study and undergo bilateral
      implantation of the Isatis TF intraocular lens. Subjects participating in the trial will
      attend a total of maximum 10 study visits over a period of 4-6 months. Subjects would have
      the option for unscheduled visits if required medically.

      Final data analyses will be performed after the last patient finished the final postoperative
      examination (120-180 days after surgery of second eye).

The investigator observes this projection on the eye through a reflected light microscope. The slitlamp is used to observe the anterior and posterior part of the eye, including cornea, lens and anterior chamber. By dilating the pupil the fundus can also be examined.

    <measure>IOL rotation</measure>
    <time_frame>day of surgery, 1-2 days postoperative, 7-14 days postoperative, 30-60 days postoperative, 120-180 days postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the rotational stability of the lenses after implantation, the actual IOL orientation has to be recorded as the intended surgical position during surgery using a photograph through the surgery microscope or within one hour after surgery using a photograph through a slit lamp to document the rotational position of the IOL. Additional orientations are measured and recorded at the follow up visits by taking retroilluminated photographs in mydriasis using the slit lamp.
To determine the rotational stability, it is important that the IOL axis marks of the IOL are visible as well as concurrent structures of the eye (in the same image) that are fixed and stable. Preferred fixed structures are limbal vessels. The pupil is dilated if necessary to visualize the IOL axis marks.</description>
