  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a registry of general use of Avance Nerve Graft and is intended to evaluate the
      uses, response rates, and safety of Avance Nerve Graft in the real-life clinical setting.
      Optional addendums 1 and 2 included in the protocol are intended to establish comparative
      groups and focused subgroups within the registry.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter registry study to collect utilization, safety, and outcomes data from
      medical record chart review of nerve reconstruction procedures throughout the body with
      Avance® Nerve Graft.

      Addendum 1 (MATCH) establishes a comparative arm to collect data on nerve injuries repaired
      with nerve autografts and nerve tube conduits at select RANGER® participating sites.

      Addendum 2 (Sensation-NOW) establishes a focused arm to collect data on autologous breast
      reconstructive procedures where neurotization was completed. Post-mastectomy autologous
      breast reconstruction procedures without neurotization will serve as an internal control
      group to allow for comparisons.
