  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of atomoxetine and its effect primarily
      on the biologic markers (substances that may indicate the presence of a disease) in the
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of participants diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).
      Additionally, information will be gathered to identify the dose of atomoxetine that is most
      beneficial, and how taking this medication affects thinking and behavior, as well as imaging
      and blood biomarkers.The study will also explore rates of change in biomarkers of
      neurodegeneration (Aß, tau, brain atrophy rates). The results of this research will help
      determine if atomoxetine alters signs of inflammation and other biomarkers associated with
      Alzheimer's disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Alzheimer's Disease (AD) epidemic is a looming crisis, with an urgent need for new
      therapies to delay or prevent symptom onset and progression. Advances in AD biomarker
      research have demonstrated changes in amyloid, brain metabolism, and other pathophysiologies
      prior to the onset of memory loss, with some markers possibly changing one or two decades
      earlier. Since MCI coincides with the onset of brain atrophy, this early stage of AD
      pathogenesis may offer a critical window of time to initiate novel therapies aimed at the
      secondary wave of events that lead to progressive neurodegeneration.

      From recently emerged basic research in animal models of AD: loss of norepinephrine (NE)
      incites a pro-inflammatory condition that is neurotoxic and reduces Aß clearance, and
      remarkably, rescue of norepinephrine reverses these effects and slows neurodegeneration. This
      study seeks to extend this proof-of-concept to humans for the first time. The study proposes
      that atomoxetine, a selective norepinephrine transport inhibitor, is an ideal drug to
      translate these findings to humans because it is already FDA-approved and safe in the elderly

      Subjects with mild cognitive impairment (amnestic or multi-domain subtypes) will be randomly
      assigned to treatment with placebo or flexible doses of the Norepinephrine Transporter (NET)
      inhibitor atomoxetine, starting with 10 mg po daily and increasing weekly by increments to a
      maximum of 100 mg po daily or the maximum tolerated dose. Participants will be treated for
      upto 29 weeks, and will undergo venous blood draws and lumbar puncture for biomarker analyses
      at baseline and up to weeks 29. At a maximum of 29 weeks time point, subjects assigned to
      active treatment will crossover to placebo and those subjects who were initially randomized
      to placebo will initiate active treatment.

      Participants who complete study are eligible to receive open-label Atomoxetine at the
      maximum-tolerated dose received during the double-blind phase of the trial. Subjects in the
      open label are seen every at week 29 upto maximum of 2 years.

        <description>This study will examine the effects of Atomoxetine and Inactive compound on biomarkers of inflammation by measuring and comparing the levels of Interleukin 1 (IL 1-alpha) using the assay of CSF at Baseline, Week 29 and Week 58 among the two groups. The study hypothesizes that the period that participants are treated with atomoxetine will have reductions in levels of these pro-inflammatory biomarkers among the two groups.</description>

        <population>Only 15.1 % of the samples were above the limit of detection for Interleukin 1 (IL 1-alpha) alpha in CSF, precluding the planned analysis and comparing the mean and standard deviation of Interleukin 1 (IL 1-alpha) alpha levels in treatment versus placebo groups. Hence the analysis was not done and the outcome was not measured.</population>

          <title>Change in Mean Level of Thymus-Expressed Chemokine (TECK) in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) in Participants With Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) Treated With Atomoxetine / Inactive Compound Compared to Participants Treated With Inactive Compound / Atomoxetine</title>
          <description>This study will examine the effect of Atomoxetine and Inactive Compound on biomarkers of inflammation by measuring and comparing the mean levels of Thymus-Expressed Chemokine (TECK). These levels are measured using the assay of CSF at Baseline, Week 29 and Week 58. The study hypothesizes that the period that participants are treated with atomoxetine will have reduction in levels of these markers among both groups.</description>
          <population>Only 49.1 % of the samples were above the limit of detection for TECK in CSF among the groups that are included in the analysis below. The levels for only 18 participants in Atomoxetine group and 18 participants in Inactive compound were analyzed</population>
