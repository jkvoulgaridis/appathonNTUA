      This is a prospective, multicenter phase II trial designed to determine efficacy and safety
      of a combination chemotherapy consisting of Bendamustine + Dexamethasone + Thalidomide in
      patients with multiple myeloma (MM) after treatment with lenalidomide and bortezomib or which
      are ineligible to one of these drugs.

      Eligible patients will be treated according to the following scheme until the occurrence of
      maximum response, dose limiting toxicity or disease progression. Repeat cycles every 28 days
      for a maximum of 6 cycles and a minimum of 4.

        -  Bendamustine 60 mg/m2 i.v. days 1, 8, 15

        -  Dexamethasone 20 mg p.o. days 1,8 , 15, 22

        -  Thalidomide 100 mg daily p.o. days 1-28; initial dose of 50 mg/day, with an increment to
           100 mg after the first 15 days of treatment.

    <description>Thalidomide can directly inhibit the growth and survival of myeloma cells, by oxidative damage to DNA mediated by free radicals. The drug can induce apoptosis even in drug resistant myeloma cells. Thalidomide modulates cell adhesion molecule expression, so it may interfere with the mutually stimulatory interactions between myeloma cells and the bone marrow microenvironment.</description>
