      The purpose of this study is to examine the long-term safety and tolerability of USL261 in
      the treatment of seizure clusters.

      Participants who completed study P261-401 (NCT01390220), a randomized double-blind study of
      USL261 (intranasal midazolam) versus placebo to acutely treat a seizure cluster episode, were
      eligible to to enroll in this open-label extension study (P261-402). The participant's
      caregiver administered a USL261 5 milligram (mg) dose for a seizure episode meeting study
      criteria. A second USL261 5 mg dose could be administered after 10 minutes and up to 6 hours
      after the first dose for persistent or recurrent seizures, unless the participant met
      exclusions to administration of the second dose. A participant could have more than 1 seizure
      cluster episode treated during his/her study participation.

The B-SIT is a self-administered 12-item test; the score indicates odors correctly identified (0 to 12). The B-SIT was added while the study was already ongoing (Protocol Amendment 4, 20 May 2015) in response to a regulatory request. The test was only implemented at sites in the United States and included only participants considered by the investigator to have adequate cognitive ability to perform the test. Baseline was defined as the latest non-missing value prior to administration of USL261 in the Test Dose Phase of Study P261-401.</description>

        <description>Change in participant Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT) score from baseline to last visit with assessment. The B-SIT is a self-administered 12-item test; the score indicates odors correctly identified (0 to 12). The B-SIT was added while the study was already ongoing (Protocol Amendment 4, 20 May 2015) in response to a regulatory request. The test was only implemented at sites in the United States and included only participants considered by the investigator to have adequate cognitive ability to perform the test. Baseline was defined as the latest non-missing value prior to administration of USL261 in the Test Dose Phase of Study P261-401.</description>
