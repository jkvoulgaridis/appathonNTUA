      Pharmacokinetics of a single Oral Dose of Maxmarvil® in healthy postmenopausal women without
      a previous history of fractures

        1. evaluation of Pharmacokinetics

             -  Urine collection : Pre-dose(pre 1hour), post-dose 0~6 hour, 6~12 hour, 12~24 hour

             -  Evaluation Variables : Aet

        2. Evaluation of safety, pharmacodynamics

             -  Adverse Event : check it every and frequently

             -  Physical exam : screening, just before injection, post-dose 24 hour and post-study
                visit

             -  Vital sign : screening, just before injection, post-dose 1 hour, 24 hour and
                post-study visit

             -  Laboratory test : screening, post-dose 24hour
