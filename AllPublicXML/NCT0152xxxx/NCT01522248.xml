    <textblock>
      Some people experience symptoms just after receiving the seasonal inactivated influenza
      vaccine. The cause of some of these symptoms is likely to be an immune response to the
      vaccine. The investigators would like to look at the earliest immune responses to the
      inactivated influenza vaccine. This pilot study will help us to determine at what time points
      we should look.

    <description>This was an exploratory trial to look at the kinetics of early cytokine response to influenza vaccine. Serum collected was assessed for cytokines, and PBMCs may be assessed for innate and adaptive immune responses, as well as for genetic markers associated with immune responses to vaccination. Data for Cohort 1 reported as 0 hours and 24 hours. Data for Cohort 2 reported as 0 hours and 16 hours. Data was combined for the Cohorts and reported as 0 hours (baseline) and 14 days.</description>

        <title>Levels of Cytokine Interferon Gamma (IFN-gamma) Responses to Inactivated Influenza Vaccine</title>
        <description>This was an exploratory trial to look at the kinetics of early cytokine response to influenza vaccine. Serum collected was assessed for cytokines, and PBMCs may be assessed for innate and adaptive immune responses, as well as for genetic markers associated with immune responses to vaccination. Data for Cohort 1 reported as 0 hours and 24 hours. Data for Cohort 2 reported as 0 hours and 16 hours. Data was combined for the Cohorts and reported as 0 hours (baseline) and 14 days.</description>
