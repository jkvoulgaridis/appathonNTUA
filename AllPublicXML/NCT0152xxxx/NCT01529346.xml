    <measure>Total Pain Relief From 0 to 6 Hours (TOTPAR[6])</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>TOTPAR(6) was defined as the total area under pain relief (PR) curve through first 6 hours after dosing, calculated using trapezoidal rule. PR was assumed to be 0 at 0 hour. PR assessed on a 5-point categorical scale: 0(none), 1 (a little), 2 (some), 3 (a lot) and 4 (complete), at different time points during study up to 6 hours. Total score range for TOTPAR(6): 0 (worst) to 24 (best), higher value indicated greater degree of PR. Posterior mean, standard deviation were estimated based on analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with non-informative priors within outlier robust Bayesian framework.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Peak Pain Relief (PPR)</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>PPR was defined as the highest PR score achieved at any time point during the evaluation period, prior to rescue medication. PR was assessed on a 5-point categorical scale: 0 (none), 1 (a little), 2 (some), 3 (a lot) and 4 (complete).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Relief (PR) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>15, 30, 45, 60, 90 minutes, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>PR was assessed on a 5-point categorical scale; 0 (none), 1 (a little), 2 (some), 3 (a lot) and 4 (complete).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Intensity Difference (PID)</measure>
    <time_frame>15, 30, 45, 60, 90 minutes, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>PID was calculated as pain intensity at baseline (baseline pain severity score range 2 [moderate] to 3 [severe]) minus pain intensity at the respective post-baseline visit (pain severity score range 0 [none] to 3 [severe]). Total possible score range for PID: -1 (worst) to 3 (best).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Summed Pain Intensity Difference (SPID)</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 6 hours; 0 to 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>SPID: area under the PID effect curve from 0 to 6 hours (SPID[6]) and 0 to 24 hours (SPID[24]). AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. Total score range: -6 (worst) to 18 (best) for SPID(6), and -24 (worst) to 72 (best) for SPID(24). Higher value of SPID indicated greater degree of pain relief. PID was calculated as pain intensity at baseline minus pain intensity at the respective post-baseline visit. Pain intensity was assessed on a categorical scale ranging from 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate) and 3 (severe).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Pain Relief From 0 to 24 Hours (TOTPAR[24])</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>TOTPAR(24) was defined as the total area under the PR curve through the first 24 hours after dosing, calculated using trapezoidal rule. PR was assumed to be 0 at 0 hour. PR assessed on a 5-point categorical scale: 0 (none), 1 (a little), 2 (some), 3 (a lot) and 4 (complete), at different time points during the study up to 6 hours. Total score range for TOTPAR (24): 0 (worst) to 96 (best), higher value indicated greater degree of PR. The least square mean and standard error are based on ANCOVA model with treatment as a fixed effect and baseline pain intensity as a covariate</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Onset of First Perceptible Pain Relief</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 24 hours</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Onset of Meaningful Pain Relief</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 24 hours</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to First Use of Rescue Medication</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Time to first use of rescue medication (acetaminophen 500 mg or hydrocodone 5 mg) was calculated by subtracting time of first administration of study medication from the rescue medication administration time.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Global Evaluation of Study Medication</measure>
    <time_frame>6, 24 hours, prior to rescue medication (assessed up to 24 hours)</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Study Medication Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>6, 24 hours, prior to rescue medication (assessed up to 24 hours)</time_frame>

        <title>Total Pain Relief From 0 to 6 Hours (TOTPAR[6])</title>
        <description>TOTPAR(6) was defined as the total area under pain relief (PR) curve through first 6 hours after dosing, calculated using trapezoidal rule. PR was assumed to be 0 at 0 hour. PR assessed on a 5-point categorical scale: 0(none), 1 (a little), 2 (some), 3 (a lot) and 4 (complete), at different time points during study up to 6 hours. Total score range for TOTPAR(6): 0 (worst) to 24 (best), higher value indicated greater degree of PR. Posterior mean, standard deviation were estimated based on analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with non-informative priors within outlier robust Bayesian framework.</description>

        <description>SPID: area under the PID effect curve from 0 to 6 hours (SPID[6]) and 0 to 24 hours (SPID[24]). AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. Total score range: -6 (worst) to 18 (best) for SPID(6), and -24 (worst) to 72 (best) for SPID(24). Higher value of SPID indicated greater degree of pain relief. PID was calculated as pain intensity at baseline minus pain intensity at the respective post-baseline visit. Pain intensity was assessed on a categorical scale ranging from 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate) and 3 (severe).</description>

        <population>FAS included all randomized participants who received &gt;=1 dose of study treatment and had &gt;=1 evaluable (&gt;=90 minutes post-dose) pain relief score. Analysis excluded influential outliers. Participants who received rescue medication prior to 90 minutes were not included in FAS. Missing data were imputed using LOCF.</population>

          <title>Summed Pain Intensity Difference (SPID)</title>
          <description>SPID: area under the PID effect curve from 0 to 6 hours (SPID[6]) and 0 to 24 hours (SPID[24]). AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. Total score range: -6 (worst) to 18 (best) for SPID(6), and -24 (worst) to 72 (best) for SPID(24). Higher value of SPID indicated greater degree of pain relief. PID was calculated as pain intensity at baseline minus pain intensity at the respective post-baseline visit. Pain intensity was assessed on a categorical scale ranging from 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate) and 3 (severe).</description>
          <population>FAS included all randomized participants who received &gt;=1 dose of study treatment and had &gt;=1 evaluable (&gt;=90 minutes post-dose) pain relief score. Analysis excluded influential outliers. Participants who received rescue medication prior to 90 minutes were not included in FAS. Missing data were imputed using LOCF.</population>

        <description>TOTPAR(24) was defined as the total area under the PR curve through the first 24 hours after dosing, calculated using trapezoidal rule. PR was assumed to be 0 at 0 hour. PR assessed on a 5-point categorical scale: 0 (none), 1 (a little), 2 (some), 3 (a lot) and 4 (complete), at different time points during the study up to 6 hours. Total score range for TOTPAR (24): 0 (worst) to 96 (best), higher value indicated greater degree of PR. The least square mean and standard error are based on ANCOVA model with treatment as a fixed effect and baseline pain intensity as a covariate</description>
