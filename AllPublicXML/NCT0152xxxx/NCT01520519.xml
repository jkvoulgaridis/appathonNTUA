  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) combined with
      rituximab can help to control CLL and SLL. The safety of this combination will also be
      studied.

      Ibrutinib is designed to stop a protein from working in the cells, which may cause the cancer
      cells to die or stop growing.

      Rituximab is designed to attach to cancer cells and damage them, which may cause the cells to
      die.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive rituximab by
      vein on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1 (+ 3 days) and then on Day 1 (+/- 7 days) of Cycles
      2-6.

      Each cycle is 28 days.

      You will take Ibrutinib capsules by mouth 1 time each day starting on Day 2 of Cycle 1. You
      should take it with 1 cup (8 ounces) of water.

      You will also take allopurinol by mouth 1 time each day during the first 1-2 weeks of study
      treatment to lower the risk of side effects.

      Study Visits:

      On Days 7, 14, 21, and 28 of Cycle 1 (+/- 3 days):

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking.

      At the end of Cycles 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12 (+/- 1 month):

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking.

      At the end of Cycles 3 or 6, and 12 (+/- 1 month), and then every 12 cycles (+/- 1 month)
      after that if the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have CT scans of the chest, abdomen
      and pelvis to check the status of the disease.

      At the end of Cycles 3, 6, and 12 and then every 12 cycles (+/- 1 month) after that, you will
      have a bone marrow aspiration to check the status of the disease. If the doctor things these
      bone marrow aspirations are no longer needed, you will no longer have to have them.

      Every 3 months (+/- 1 month) for Cycles 13-36 and every 6 months (+/- 1 month) after that:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue taking the study drug combination of rituximab and Ibrutinib for up to 6
      cycles, after which Ibrutinib will be continued for up to a total of 12 cycles. It will be
      possible to continue with Ibrutinib treatment beyond 12 cycles if the study doctor thinks it
      is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease
      gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study
      directions.

      This is an investigational study. Ibrutinib is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of patients with mantle cell lymphoma, CLL and SLL. Its use in this study is
      investigational. Rituximab is FDA approved to treat CLL and SLL.

      Up to 40 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 1.Patients must have a diagnosis of high-risk CLL/SLL and be previously treated with
             up to 3 lines of prior therapy. High-risk CLL and high-risk SLL is defined by the
             presence of a 17p deletion or 11q deletion or TP53 mutation. Any CLL and SLL patient
             who has a short remission duration of less than 3 years after prior first-line
             chemo-immunotherapy, such as the FCR regimen, also fulfills criteria of high-risk
             CLL/SLL, regardless of the presence or absence of cytogenetic abnormalities.

          2. 2.CLL and SLL patients with 17p deletion or TP53 mutation will not be required to have
             received any prior therapy, given the poor outcome of CLL/SLL patients to standard
             frontline chemo-immunotherapy, such patients will be eligible if they are untreated or
             if they have received up to 3 lines of prior therapy.

          3. Patients must have an indication for treatment by 2008 IWCLL Criteria.

             potential include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone
             successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or
             bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal. Post menopause is defined as
             follows: Amenorrhea &gt;/= 12 consecutive months without another cause and a documented
             serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level &gt;35 mIU/mL; a male of childbearing
             potential is any male that has not been surgically sterilized.

          7. Adequate renal and hepatic function as indicated by all of the following: Total
             bilirubin &lt;/=1.5 x institutional Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) except for patients with

             Alanine (ALT) &lt;/=2.5 x ULN; and an estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) of &gt; 30
             mL/min, as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation unless disease related.

          8. Free of prior malignancies for 3 years with exception of currently treated basal cell,
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast.
