  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation phase 1 study of intravenous (IV)
      LY2495655 in participants with advanced cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will consist of the following parts:

        1. Dose Escalation - Cohorts of at least 3 participants will be treated with increasing
           doses of LY2475655 until maximum tolerated dose (MTD) criteria are met in 1 of the 6
           dose levels, or the 6th cohort is completed without meeting maximum tolerated dose
           criteria.

        2. Dose Confirmation - Up to 10 more participants will be enrolled to the MTD dose level,
           or if it was not possible to define the MTD during dose escalation, all clinical and
           bioanalytical data will be reviewed to select the recommended Phase 2 dose and an up to
           10 additional participants will be enrolled to this dose level.

    <description>A summary of other non-serious AEs, and all SAE's, regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Events section. An AE is summarized if the onset date is on or after the first dose of study drug and within 30 days after the last dose, or it occurred before the first dose of study drug and worsened while on the therapy.</description>

    <description>AUC(0-336h) is the area under the drug concentration versus time curve within a dosing interval (0-336 hours). Due to the small number per cohort (participants dropping out) calculations of the accumulation factor of exposure for repeated every-other-week dosing were based on simulated area under the drug concentration versus time curve within a dosing interval (AUCτ) instead of observed values. The 90-percentage confidence interval was calculated as the predictive interval.</description>

Starting dose in Part 1 (dose escalation) will be 2 mg. The dose will be subsequently increased to 7 mg, 21 mg, 70 mg, 210 mg, and 700 mg. The dose administered in Part 2 (dose confirmation) will be determined from Part 1.</description>

        <title>Pharmacokinetics (PK): Area Under the Concentration-time Curve From Time 0 to 336 Hours (AUC[0-336]) of LY2495655</title>
        <description>AUC(0-336h) is the area under the drug concentration versus time curve within a dosing interval (0-336 hours). Due to the small number per cohort (participants dropping out) calculations of the accumulation factor of exposure for repeated every-other-week dosing were based on simulated area under the drug concentration versus time curve within a dosing interval (AUCτ) instead of observed values. The 90-percentage confidence interval was calculated as the predictive interval.</description>
        <time_frame>Cycle 1 and Cycle 4 Days 1 (pre-dose, end of infusion, 2hr, 6hr, 10-12hr after the infusion ends) and Day 2, 3, 5, 8</time_frame>
        <population>All participants who received at least one dose of study drug and had evaluable pharmacokinetic data. Confidence Interval calculated as predictive interval and summarized from simulated PK profiles in 1000 virtual participants for each dose using a population PK model for LY2495655.</population>
