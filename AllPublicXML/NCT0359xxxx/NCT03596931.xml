  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effect of statin for primary prevention, towards lowering the
      incidence of heart failure, acute lung edema, malignant arrhythmia and death in ACS patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients (≥ 18 years of age) with acute coronary syndrome which are diagnosed under
      ICD-10 coding of I24.9 without a prior history of heart failure, acute lung edema and
      arrhythmia were included in this study. The inclusion criteria are patients with primary
      diagnosis of I24.9 and with a complete record of prior medical and treatment history,
      electrocardiographic findings, cardiac marker results and outcomes. Participants were grouped
      into 2 groups - statin and non-statin based on prior history of statin use prior to ACS.
      Diagnosis of ACS was made based on clinical, electrocardiographic and cardiac marker findings
      found in the medical record.

      Data such as age, sex, ethnic, education, prior medical and treatment history,
      electrocardiographic and cardiac enzyme results as well as outcomes were collected from the
      patients' medical records. Outcomes of interest were defined as either concomitant heart
      failure, acute lung edema, malignant arrhythmia, mortality or combinations of them as
      diagnosed in the medical records. Heart failure is defined based on echocardiographic
      findings from the medical records. Acute Lung Edema is defined based on medical records or
      reported clinical findings of lung edema - rhonchi reported in 1/3 of the lungs with oxygen
      saturation &lt;90%. Whereas malignant arrhythmia is defined as the presence of ventricular
      tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF).
