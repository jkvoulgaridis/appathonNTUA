  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health care professionals lack tools to deal with acute pain in patients with moderate to
      severe dementia during daily nursing situations. Care-induced pain in institutionalized
      persons with cognitive impairments can cause anxiety and behavioral problems.The aim of this
      study is to demonstrate that a systematic identification of pain associated with the use of
      social robots such as the PARO robot may contribute to a better anticipation and management
      of care-induced pain. The investigators hypothesize that an individual use of the PARO robot
      would bring relaxation to the patient, a distraction regarding the aversive situation of care
      and, thus, it would prevent manifestations of acute pain in patients with dementia.

      Secondary objectives of the study :

        1. determine the effect of the use of PARO during painful cares on quality of life,
           medication of patients, and perceived workload of the health-care team.

        2. examine socio-demographic and clinical responders' participants to the intervention,
           and,

        3. identify essential elements regarding cost-effectiveness of a systematic evaluation of
           pain and a mediation with the PARO robot in care-induced pain

      in is a frequent problem in persons with moderate to severe dementia and has been associated
      to different care situations. Daily observations in care homes show that pain frequently
      causes anxiety and behavioral symptoms, including agitation and opposition to nursing care. A
      key recommendation of the International Psychogeriatric Association (IPA) is the use of
      psychosocial approaches as first-line therapy for behavioral problems in persons with
      dementia. Indeed, a wide range of non-pharmacological interventions for persons with dementia
      exist, such as biofeedback, music therapy, therapeutic touch or relaxation. Most of these
      interventions have shown positive results on health status, quality of life, socialization,
      and functional capacity in dementia. However, to date, little is known on the effect of
      psychosocial interventions on care-induced pain in this population. In consequence, there is
      still a need for the development of innovative interventions.

      At a time when modern technologies are assuming a central role in our society, investigators
      are currently witnessing an important evolution of the use of social robots in healthcare
      interventions. In this research area, numerous studies have been conducted with social
      robots, such as PARO®, an animal-like robot modeled on a baby harp seal. Most of them have
      been successful in encouraging communication and/or social behaviors and also reducing
      Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD), loneliness, stress' levels,
      agitation and the use of pain medication. However, although these results indicate a
      potential application of robot-assisted therapies for pain management in persons with
      dementia, the use of PARO during painful care-situations is still to be investigated.

      The investigators propose a new combination of current health cares, namely to mediate
      care-induced pain with the PARO robot.

      Consequently, a randomized AB/BA crossover design will be employed. Patients will be assigned
      randomly to either phase A during which they will benefit from a systemic pain assessment and
      from the PARO robot as a therapeutic mediator, followed by phase B during which patients will
      benefit from a systemic pain assessment without the PARO robot, or phase B followed by phase
      A.
