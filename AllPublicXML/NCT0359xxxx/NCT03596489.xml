  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study utilizes a unique technology to determine nerve fiber sensitivity. This will
      allow us to determine whether this method and device can discern changes in pain intensity
      and type, which is predicated on differing nerve fiber sensitivities.

    <description>The primary measurable endpoint is the change in the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the three sensory nerve fiber types that occurs as a response to tourniquet ischemia and reperfusion. The change is calculated by the difference between measurements at various time points: baseline, tourniquet application, and tourniquet release.</description>
