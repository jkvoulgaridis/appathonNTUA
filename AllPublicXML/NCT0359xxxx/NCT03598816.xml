  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reported in the 2018 NEJM (378; 1277) article, the combination of checkpoint inhibitors
      ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4 antibody) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) phase III trial
      Checkmate 214 demonstrated statistically significant (P&lt;0.0001) improvement of overall
      response rate (ORR) at 42% (95% confidence interval (CI), 37-47%) compared to standard of
      care (SOC) sunitinib at 27% (95% CI, 22-31%) in treatment na√Øve advanced or metastatic clear
      cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). This study also showed increased survival benefit of
      Ipi+Nivo over sunitinib in the IMDC intermediate-poor risk ccRCC patients. Accordingly, the
      Ipi+Nivo was just approved by U.S. FDA in April 2018 for treating metastatic ccRCC. Hence,
      the investigators hypothesized that the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab is
      similarly efficacious in advanced or metastatic RCC. Furthermore, the investigators also
      hypothesize that the administration of personalized neoantigen DNA vaccine will further
      enhance anti-tumor immune response in RCC.
