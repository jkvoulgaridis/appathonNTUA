      genital shedding rate in patients with recurrent genital HSV-2 infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-stage, randomized, double-blind, dose-ranging, multi-center phase 2 study
      designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and PK of UB-621 given at 2.5 or 5 mg/kg in adult
      subjects with recurrent genital HSV-2 infection. The study consists of 2 stages of
      enrollments, in which 40 subjects will be enrolled in the first stage and randomly assigned
      to receive placebo or UB-621 at 2.5 mg/kg in a 1:3 ratio into Cohort 1 at Bv6 (Day B57), and
      another 40 subjects will be enrolled in the second stage and randomly assigned to receive
      placebo or UB-621 at 5 mg/kg in a 1:3 ratio into Cohort 2 at Bv6 (Day B57) after review by
      the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC). The DSMC will review safety data after all
      subjects of Cohort 1 complete the visit Fv6 (Day F28) and make the recommendation whether to
      proceed with enrollment for Cohort 2.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change of HSV-2 shedding rate.</measure>

    <description>The primary endpoint for this study is to evaluate the reduction in HSV-2 shedding rate within subjects in the Baseline Period versus Follow-up Period.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change of HSV-2 viral load</measure>
    <time_frame>112 days</time_frame>
    <description>Anogenital swab samples collected from subjects during the Baseline Period and Follow-up Period will be used to quantify HSV-2 DNA copies to evaluate efficacy of UB-621 in reducing viral load.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change of genital lesion rates</measure>
    <time_frame>140 days</time_frame>
    <description>Subject self-assessment of genital lesions will be recorded in subject diary as daily routine tasks from Bv1 (Day B1) until Fv11/EOS visit (Day F140). Data from subject self-assessment of genital lesions will be used to evaluate the efficacy of UB-621 in reducing genital lesions rates. Genital lesion rate will be measured by the number of days with lesion(s) reported divided by the number of days of study periods (Baseline Period, Transition Period, or Follow-up Period).
Reduction in genital lesion rates will be evaluated before and after study drug treatment within subjects (Baseline versus Follow-up values).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical and Subclinical HSV-2 Shedding Rates</measure>
    <time_frame>196 days</time_frame>
    <description>Daily record of subject self-assessment of genital lesions in subject diary in addition to anogenital swabs collected daily from subjects during the Baseline and Follow-up Periods will be used to evaluate the efficacy of UB-621 in reducing clinical (lesional) and subclinical (non-lesional) HSV-2 shedding rates.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of HSV-2 Shedding Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>196</time_frame>
    <description>Another secondary efficacy assessment includes the rate of HSV-2 shedding episodes as measured by the number of onsets of shedding episodes divided by the total number of days with swabs collected. Shedding episodes are defined as consecutive HSV-2 positive swab results including no more than 1 consecutive negative result or missed swab. The episodes are preceded and followed by 2 consecutive negative swab results.
Daily record of subject self-assessment of genital lesions in subject diary in addition to anogenital swabs collected daily from subjects during the Baseline and Follow-up Periods will be used to evaluate the efficacy of UB-621 in reducing the rate of HSV-2 shedding episodes. Reduction in the rate of HSV-2 shedding episodes will be evaluated before and after study drug treatment within subjects (Baseline versus Follow-up values).</description>
