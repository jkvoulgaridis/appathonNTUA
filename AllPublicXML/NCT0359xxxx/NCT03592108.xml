  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome affects 40-60% of patients presenting with
      cardiovascular diseases. Cheyne-Stokes respiration is a type of central apnea characterised
      by the presence of at least three consecutive episodes of apnea and/or hypopnea separated by
      a crescendo-decrescendo variation of the breathing amplitude with a cycle length ≥ 40 seconds
      and a central apnea/hypopnea index ≥ 5/h, for at least two hours of recording.

      The association between heart failure and Cheynes-Stokes respiration is known and a recent
      study showed that Cheynes-Stokes respiration was associated with more severe heart failure.
      Moreover, a medical and medical/financial benefit of the early detection of cardiac
      decompensation has been reported.

      The purpose of this feasibility study is to investigate the benefit of Cheyne-Stokes
      respiration remote monitoring in CPAP-treated patients with OSA for the early detection of
      significant cardiac events (heart failure, rhythm disorder, diastolic dysfunction).

      To achieve this aim, a modified approach of CPAP remote monitoring is proposed based on the
      performance of the latest generation of positive pressure devices from ResMed, AirSense™ 10
      Autoset™, which can detect and record the presence of Cheynes-Stokes respiration. For a
      period of 12 months, in addition to the usual daily remote monitoring (CPAP adherence,
      pressure settings, level of air leakages), the healthcare provider will systematically
      monitor the CSR data whenever the AHI increases significantly. Physicians will be alerted
      when a CSR occurs and they will see the patients within a short time for pulmology and
      cardiology consultations in order to screen the onset of significant cardiac event.

      After the 12-month period of modified remote monitoring, the telemedicine returns to the
      usual procedure. Patients who had at least one CSR occurrence during the first 12-month
      period will be followed up to 24 months to assess their medical condition.
