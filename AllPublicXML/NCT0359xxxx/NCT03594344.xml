  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of additional hyperbaric oxygen therapy after lower extremity
      amputation. The patients will be randomized after amputation to either a treatment group
      receiving hyperbaric oxygen therapy, or control group.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been used to treat hard to heal wounds for decades. Amputation,
      especially distal lower extremity amputations have the same problem with healing and patients
      often need to be re-amputated more proximally. In these patients oxygen levels are often the
      decisive factor. Providing additional oxygen under hyperbaric conditions will increase tissue
      oxygen concentration sufficient for the amputation stump to heal. This will give the patients
      a more distal amputation with better condition for ambulation.

    <description>Healed and intact skin at the site of primary amputation without need for more proximal amputation.Healed amputation is defined as epithelialization of the wound examined by a orthopedic surgeon. Level of primary amputation is decided by the surgeon. Planned 2-session amputation, for example Guillotine amputation with a final amputation later is considered being primary amputation. Healed primary amputation will be measured at 12 weeks.</description>
