  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) occurs approximately 200,000 times/yr in hospitals in the
      UnitedStates, with 18% of patients surviving to discharge. Just over half of these survivors
      are neurologically intact or with mild defiits at the time of discharge. Do-not-resuscitate
      (DNR) orders are used to withhold CPR from patients who are unlikely to benefi or for whom it
      is inconsistent with their treatment goals or personal preferences. It would be helpful to
      identify patients with a very low likelihood of survival to discharge neurologically intact
      or with mild defiits were they to experience cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA), so their physician
      can present the option of a DNR order. This information would also be useful anytime a
      patient raises the question of the likelihood of survival should they undergo CPA.The
      objective of this study was to determine key indicators for good outcome in patients with
      sudden cardiac arrest undergoing CPR and develop a prediction model to predict survival to
      hospital discharge in these patients.

      A CPR coordinator prospectively collected data for the CPR registry according to the
      Utstein-style guidelines. Te registry included the following information:

      demographic data, comorbidities, whether the arrest was witnessed, the incidence of suspected
      or confrmed trauma, presumed arrest time; presence of bystander CPR, frst documented arrest
      rhythm by the emergency medical service (EMS) provider, any return of spontaneous circulation
      (ROSC), presence of ECPR, the presence of return of spontaneous heart beating (ROSB) after
      CPR, presumed cause of arrest; the application of therapeutic hypothermia and the use of
      coronary angiography(CAG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI),24-hour survival, the
      presence of ROSC more than 20 min, hospital length of stay (LOS), survival to hospital
      discharge,Glasgow-Pittsburgh cerebral performance category (CPC) score at discharge, and the
      fnal diagnosis at discharge. Te comorbidity score was calculated using the Charlson
      comorbidity index. Te duration of CPR was defned as the time interval from the frst chest
      compression provided by healthcare providers to the termination of resuscitation eforts due
      to ROSC (more than 20 min),ROSB after CPR, or a declaration of death. A favorable neurologic
      outcome was defned as a CPC score of 1 or 2 on the fve-category scale.
