  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Birth exposes the newborn to oxidative stress, as due to the switch from a protected,
      relatively hypoxic intrauterine milieu into an environment with a high oxygen pressure. The
      full-term newborn is well prepared to this massive redox challenge at the time of birth due
      to his well-integrated antioxidant defenses. On the contrary, numerous bibliographical data
      and our own work demonstrate the fragility of preterm newborns in this context of oxidative
      stress, linked to the immaturity of his antioxidant defenses.

      Premature birth abruptly propels the fetus from the protected, relatively hypoxic
      intrauterine milieu to an environment at risk of free radical injury caused by mechanical
      ventilation strategies, including the use of high inspired oxygen fractions or inhaled nitric
      oxide, generating excessive reactive oxidative species (ROS). Several studies highlight the
      key role of ROS in adverse outcomes of preterm infant suffering from low birth weight,
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis or retinopathy.

      This project aims to evaluate a therapeutic anti-oxidative strategy in order to correct the
      oxidative status of preterm infants. The investigators propose an early intervention that
      consists in an antenatal maternal supplementation with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), the acetylated
      precursor of both cysteine and glutathione, a key physiological antioxidant. This strategy
      could be promising for the development of simplified and personalized care of preterm
      infants.

      GSH MAP is a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study that aims to determine if NAC
      supplementation in women admitted to hospital care due to preterm labor (prior to 34 weeks of
      gestational age) may correct glutathione deficiency in neonatal cord blood.

      GSH MAP is a randomized single-blind, placebo-controlled study. The design will include the
      recruitment of 120 pregnant women admitted to hospital care due to preterm labor (above 18
      yrs of age, gestational age between 24 and 34 weeks). According to the risk of preterm
      delivery, women will be treated following two different schedules :

        -  High risk of prematurity: NAC supplementation -9 g intravenously-6g/day per os until day
           7-1,8g/day per os until 37 weeks of gestational age.

        -  Moderate risk of prematurity: NAC supplementation -6g/day per os until day 7-1,8g/day
           per os until 37 weeks of gestational age.

      Biological samples collected: maternal blood at inclusion, maternal/cord blood and placenta
      at delivery, breast milk samples during the first week of lactation in case of exclusive
      breastfeeding.

      Levels of glutathione and related metabolites will be measured in plasma, red blood cells,
      placenta and breast milk.

      In ancillary studies, metabolome and lipidome profilings will be performed on maternal and
      cord blood and on breast milk samples.
