  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Noninvasive respiratory supports (NRS), such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP),
      noninvasive ventilation, high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) or nasal oxygen (O2), are commonly
      used in preterm newborns hospitalized in neonatal intensive care unit. However, given the
      lack of validated criteria, clinicians usually choose the NRS according to clinical
      parameters and patients' comfort. Several studies have demonstrated the interest of the
      measurement of the work of breathing (WOB) to optimize the settings of NRS in children, but
      no study has already demonstrated the utility of WOB to optimize the settings of NRS in
      preterm infants. Therefore, the aim of this study is to measure the WOB during the
      utilisation of three different NRS (CPAP, HFNC, O2), in order to optimize the choice of the
      type and settings of NRS in a randomized group of 30 newborns born prematurely before 30
      gestational weeks and still requiring NRS at 29 post conceptual weeks. Moreover, the
      investigators will compare in the newborns with the optimized NRS by WOB vs. a standard care
      control group (NRS type and settings determined as clinical routine): 1) the respiratory
      morbidity and mortality one month after the initial assessment, and at the time of hospital
      discharge (or transfer) or at 36 weeks of age corrected (whatever comes first), 2) the
      weaning time of the NRS, 3) the incidence and severity of broncho-pulmonary dysplasia (BPD)
      at 36 weeks of age corrected. Indeed, incidence of BPD is still around 40% in premature
      infants born before 28 gestational weeks. The hypothesis of the investigators' study is that
      the optimization of the type and settings of the NRS could reduce the weaning delay and
      contribute to reduce the incidence and severity of BPD in premature newborns.
