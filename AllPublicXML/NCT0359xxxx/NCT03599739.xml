      The purpose of this study is to determine if different influenza vaccines produce different
      outcomes in nursing facility residents receiving the required annual influenza vaccination.

      This study will enroll facilities who participated in the adjuvanted influenza vaccine study
      in 2016-2017 to document the vaccine choice for the 2017-2018 influenza season through a
      survey. Additional facilities will be enrolled that did not participate to answer a survey
      responding to questions regarding the vaccine choice for the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 flu
      season. Both groups will also gather information on vaccination rates for residents and
      staff, policies and procedures, and influenza outbreaks.

      The facility will complete a profile and answer questions regarding influenza vaccination in
      their facilities for the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 flu seasons.

      The study team will obtain data from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services in 2019 to
      determine the study outcomes. None of the data used in the analysis will be linked to
      individual residents in facilities.

    <description>We will survey an additional 1000 facilities (i.e., facilities not participating in the original 2016-2017 study, but meeting the same entry criteria, except prior use of high dose vaccine will be allowed) in order to capture a cohort that used a wide range of self-selected vaccine choices. We anticipate a 50% response rate from this sample.</description>
