    <textblock>
      This pilot trial studies how well active surveillance and chemotherapy before surgery work in
      treating participants with stage II-III rectal cancer. Active surveillance involves
      monitoring participants for additional tumor growth after receiving cancer treatment. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is
      not yet known whether deferring surgery after active surveillance and chemotherapy will work
      better in treating participants with stage II-III rectal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To quantify the rates of organ preservation and tumor regrowth with non-operative
      management of locally advanced rectal cancer in patients achieving a clinical complete
      response (cCR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate clinical, radiographic, and pathologic findings after neoadjuvant therapy for
      rectal cancer.

      II. To determine the impact of active surveillance with deferral of surgery on oncologic
      outcomes.

      III. To assess decision quality for patients with rectal cancer facing multiple treatment
      options.

      IV. To explore the impact of patient-provider communication on patient decisions for surgical
      versus nonsurgical treatment decision for rectal cancer.

      V. To assess safety of deferral of surgery in distal rectal cancer patients with possibility
      of cohort expansion to more proximal locally advanced rectal cancer patients.

      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. Obtain tissue to monitor treatment response and any future biomarker analyses

      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Participants who have achieved clinical complete response undergo standard surgical
      resection.

      GROUP II: Participants who have achieved clinical complete response receive active
      surveillance and consolidated chemotherapy for up to 4 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants with incomplete response or regrowth of
      tumor, undergo surgical resection as in Group I.

      After the completion of study treatment, participants in Group I are followed up at 6 and 12
      months, and then once a year for up to 3 years. Participants in Group II are followed up
      every 3 months for 18 months, every 6 months for 2 years, and then every year for up to 3
      years.

    <description>The study will estimate overall organ preservation rate at 12 months and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). The exact confidence interval will be computed when observed number of events is limited. The 12-month organ preservation rate corresponds to the proportion of patients alive and not having surgery within 12 months. The study will use Kaplan-Meier methods to estimate probability of overall organ preservation at 12 months at 12 months for all patients and for deferral patients respectively.</description>

    <description>The aspects of the patient's decision making process will be documented and studied to assess what criteria, including the impact of patient-provider communication, seem to be driving the patients' decision to delay surgery or not. The decision evaluation questions such as decision quality survey, satisfaction with decision and anticipated regret questionnaire will be documented and summarized. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize continuous variables and frequency and percentage will be used to tabulate categorical variables. The study will summarize quality of life measures, toxicity, surgical success rates, clinical, radiographic and pathologic findings, and exploratory comparisons among patient cohorts will be done.</description>

          -  Eligible for curative resection of rectal adenocarcinoma

          -  Rectal tumor location =&lt; 12 cm from the anal verge as determined by endoscopy or
             magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (if endoscopy report is not available or deemed
             inadequate my treating oncologist)

          -  Nodal involvement confined to the radiation field

          -  Radiologically measurable or clinically evaluable disease as defined in the protocol
