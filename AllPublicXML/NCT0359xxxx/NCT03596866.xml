  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of brigatinib versus alectinib in
      participants with ALK+ locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have progressed on crizotinib
      as evidenced by progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by response evaluation criteria
      in solid tumors (RECIST) v1.1.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called brigatinib. Brigatinib has been demonstrated to
      benefit people with ALK+ NSCLC.

      The comparator drug is called alectinib. Alectinib has been demonstrated to benefit people
      with ALK+ NSCLC. Both drugs belong to a class of drugs called anaplastic lymphoma kinase
      (ALK) inhibitors. Both drugs are taken by mouth. Both drugs are approved by the United States
      Food and Drug Administration (US FDA).

      The study will enroll approximately 246 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) in 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment groups:

        -  Brigatinib

        -  Alectinib

      All participants will be asked to take brigatinib or alectinib at the same time each day
      throughout the study.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted the United States, Argentina, Austria, Canada,
      Chile, China, Croatia, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Italy, Mexico, Romania, Russia,
      South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand. The overall time to participate in this study
      is 5 years. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and 30 days after last dose
      of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

               -  Have documented ALK rearrangement by a different test and be able to provide
                  tumor sample to the central laboratory. (Note: central laboratory ALK
                  rearrangement testing results are not required to be obtained before
                  randomization).

          4. Had PD while on crizotinib, as assessed by the investigator or treating physician.
             (Note: crizotinib does not need to be the last therapy a participant received. The

             to complete local therapy and be neurologically stable (with no requirement for an
             increasing dose of corticosteroids or use of anticonvulsants) for 7 days before
             randomization.

             affect oral absorption of the study drug.

         15. Have an ongoing or active infection, including but not limited to, the requirement for
             intravenous antibiotics.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
