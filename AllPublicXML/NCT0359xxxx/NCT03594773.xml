      We will enroll 64 individuals meeting DSM 5 criteria for major depressive disorder, currently
      depressed. Participants will receive brief, evidence-based psychotherapy for 8 sessions
      delivered over 8-12 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to either Interpersonal

    <measure>Depression severity</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Depression severity will be measured at the visits 1, 4, and 8 via the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-17), which consists of 17 items with Likert scale of either 0 to 4 or 0 to 2. Scores can range from 0 to 54. We will compare HRSD-17 scores at visits 1, 4, and 8.
Scale ranges are as follows:
0-7= Normal 8-13= Mild Depression 14-18= Moderate Depression 19-22= Severe Depression &gt;=23 = Very Severe Depression</description>

    <measure>Working Alliance Inventory--Short Revised Client Version (WAI-SR-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-SR), client version, measures three key aspects of the therapeutic alliance: (a) agreement on the tasks of therapy, (b) agreement on the goals of therapy and (c) development of an affective bond.
WAI-SR, client version, has three scales:
Goal
Task
Bond Each scale ranges from 4 to 20. Higher scores represent better alliance.
WAI-SR, client version, will be measured at each weekly visit. Score at final visit will be reported.</description>

Goal (3 items): Range from 3 to 15.
Task (3 items): Range from 3 to 15.
Bond (4 items): Range from 4 to 20. Total score ranges from 10 to 50. Higher scores indicate better alliance.
