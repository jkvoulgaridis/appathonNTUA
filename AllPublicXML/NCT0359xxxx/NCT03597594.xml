  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) have a profound decrease in number and
      function of immune cells, and therefore remain highly vulnerable to infection. If not
      corrected this often leads to death. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) from matched
      sibling donor is the standard treatment for these patients, unfortunately though; most SCID
      patients lack a sibling donor. Building upon experience and existing data, the investigators
      are proposing a trial the goals of which are: to provide a conditioning regimen that is well
      tolerated, and provision of immune cells that altogether should establish rapid immune
      recovery providing protection from life threatening infections without increasing the risk of
      dangerous Graft-Versus-Host-Disease.

      Primary Objectives

        1. To evaluate the safety of a TCRα/β/CD19-depleted graft with CD45RA-depleted DLI in
           infants with SCID

        2. To estimate overall survival at 1 year post transplantation

      Exploratory Objectives

        1. To evaluate the significant donor T cell reconstitution of a TCRα/β/CD19 depleted graft
           with CD45RA-depleted DLI at 1 year (+/-2 weeks).

        2. To evaluate engraftment at day 30, 100, month 6, and years 1 to 10 post HCT.

        3. To evaluate B cell reconstitution at years 1 to 10 post HCT.

        4. To evaluate biomarkers of immune reconstitution at day 30, 60 100, month 6 and years 1
           to 10; e.g. immunophenotype (including epigenetic profiling) of T, B, and NK cells, and
           assays to determine their function.

        5. To evaluate clinical outcomes, post HCT.

        6. To define the incidence and severity of acute (at day 100, month 6), and chronic (month
           6, 12, 24) GVHD following HCT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators propose to investigate T and B cell recovery using
      peripheral blood manipulation that removes potentially Graft-Versus-Host-Disease (GVHD)
      inducing α/β and CD45RA+ T cells, while still providing potentially beneficial donor γδ and
      memory T cells.

      Donors will undergo a standard hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) mobilization regimen
      consisting of 5 days of G-CSF given subcutaneously at 10 micrograms/kilogram. The graft will
      be collected by leukapheresis on days 5 and if needed 6 of G-CSF. The HPC product(s) will be
      T-cell depleted (TCD) using the investigational CliniMACS device.

      The initial HPC product(s) will be split into two portions; one portion will be used for TCR
      TCRαβ/CD19 depletion and the second portion for CD45depleted DLI product.

        1. TCRα/β/CD19-depleted stem cell transplant: All participants will undergo a preparative
           regimen based on the type of Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) they have. This is
           followed by infusion of TCRα/β/CD19-depleted donor cells (with the exception of
           participants who undergo matched sibling donor HCT).

        2. Donor Lymphocyte Infusion (CD45depleted DLI product): Participants, other than those who
           undergo matched sibling HCT transplant, will receive one dose of CD45RA depleted DLI
           infusion post TCRα/β/CD19-depleted graft infusion.

      During the Phase I portion of the study, up to 4 different dose levels of CD45depleted DLI
      product will be evaluated.

      On the Phase II portion of the study, all participants will receive the Phase I determined
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of DLI.

      Participants on both the Phase I and Phase II portions of the study that are unable to
      receive protocol defined dosing of DLI due to insufficient dose generated will be eligible to
      receive the entirety of the generated product.

    <description>The mechanism of action of the CliniMACS Cell Selection System is based on magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS). The CliniMACS device is a powerful tool for the isolation of many cell types from heterogeneous cell mixtures, (e.g. apheresis products). These can then be separated in a magnetic field using an immunomagnetic label specific for the cell type of interest, such as CD3+ human T cells.</description>
