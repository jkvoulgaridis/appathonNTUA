  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity if known to be associated with brain insulin resistance in humans and evidence is
      rapidly accumulating that brain insulin resistance influences peripheral metabolism, eating
      behavior and cognition. A reduced insulin response in the brain is found mainly in people
      with a metabolically unfavorable fat distribution - high visceral fat. Visceral fat produces
      inflammatory mediators and elevated inflammatory levels are closely linked to insulin
      resistance. Inflammation of the brain (i.e., neuroinflammation) has been proposed as a
      possible cause of brain insulin resistance. Interestingly, rodent models of a high calorie
      diet show that these inflammatory mechanisms occur rapidly in the brain, even prior to weight
      gain of the animals. Among other things, it has been shown in humans that a short-term
      increase in calories, especially carbohydrates and fats, reduces insulin sensitivity in the
      body and increases inflammatory parameters in the blood. Whether a high-calorie diet triggers
      insulin resistance or inflammation in the human brain is currently unknown.

      Aim of study:

      The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of a five-day high calorie diet in healthy
      young male volunteers on peripheral and brain insulin sensitivity as well as on eating
      behavior, mood and cognition. Brain insulin sensitivity, peripheral metabolism and different
      behavioral assessments will be evaluated before, 1 week and 2 weeks after high caloric diet.
