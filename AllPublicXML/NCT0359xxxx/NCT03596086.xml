      Study to assess the safety and efficacy of HSV-tk (gene therapy), valacyclovir, radiotherapy
      and chemotherapy in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective phase I-II study to assess the efficacy and toxicity of HSV-tk +
      valacyclovir gene therapy in combination with radiotherapy in recurrent glioblastoma
      multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma. This study is comprised of patients who have failed
      standard of care treatment (maximal safe resection followed by chemoradiation).

      Clinical response will be evaluated by neurological evaluation, neuropsychological testing,
      and imaging studies as well as by histological examination wherever a re-operation is
      clinically indicated. Blood samples will be taken for systemic immunological response, blood
      counts and liver functions tests. Toxicity will be graded by the Common Terminology Criteria
      for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) neuro-toxicity scores.
      Patients will also be followed to assess median time to progression and median survival.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must have biopsy proven recurrent anaplasatic astrocytoma or glioblastoma
             multiforme without evidence of multifocal tumor or leptomeningeal metastatic disease
             or brainstem involvement. Multifocal disease does not exist if enhancing areas are
             connected by abnormal T2 FLAIR on the MRI scan.

          -  Radiographic evidence of recurrence/progression by iRANO criteria

          -  ≥ 3 weeks since any major surgery, completion of RT, or completion of all prior
             systemic anticancer therapy (adequately recovered from the acute toxicities of any
             prior therapy).

          -  Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks.

          -  Patients should have the following characteristics: recurrent glioblastoma or AA
