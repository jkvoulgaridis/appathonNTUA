  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our long term hypothesis is that giving premature infants breast milk that was pumped during
      the night and has high concentration of melatonin will improve outcome of several clinical
      conditions related to premature infants. Prior to testing this, we need to learn the
      pharmacokinetics of melatonin in vitro.

      In this preliminary research we would like to check the levels of melatonin in breast milk
      pumped during the night, and evaluate the rate of degradation of the melatonin to determine
      the half life of melatonin in pumped breast milk (in vitro).

      The study includes 10 nursing women. Each woman will bring a frozen 5 ml sample of breast
      milk that was pumped at 03:00 AM. The samples will be collected at the NICU department of
      Carmel Medical Center and will be stored at deep freeze (-20Â°C). The samples will be
      numerically coded and will be kept anonimously. After defrosting the samples, melatonin
      concentration will be checked in the hospital laboratory every hour, for 4 hours. If meltonin
      levels will be detectable after 4 hours, continous measurements will be done at 8 hours and
      at 12 hours after defrosting. The samples will be tested with IBL Melatonin ELISA kit. For
      control we will use breast milk that was pumped at 10:00 am (when melatonin excretion is
      minimal). At the end of the analysis the samples will be thrown away.
