      This pilot study will test the acceptability and feasibility of a sleep extension
      intervention in community-dwelling, short-sleeping, racially/ethnically diverse middle-aged
      adults with MetS. Baseline sleep habits will be assessed and used to guide individualized
      strategies to extend sleep. A 1-group pretest-posttest study design will test the efficacy of
      this 18-week study (2 weeks of baseline data collection, 1 week of study intervention
      planning, 12 weeks of sleep intervention delivery, final follow up 3 weeks after last day of
      the 12-week intervention) on sleep duration, MetS risk behaviors (reduced physical activity,
      increased sedentary behavior, poor diet quality), symptoms associated with MetS risk
      behaviors (poor affective well-being, fatigue), and self-regulation. Socio-ecological
      barriers and facilitators to the intervention will be identified using a quantitative and
      qualitative approac

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Greater than or equal to 35 years of age and less than or equal to 60 years of age.
             Middle aged adults have the highest prevalence of short sleep compared to other stages
             of adulthood.

          -  Objectively confirmed MetS defined by three or more of the following: a) waist
             circumference greater than 120cm (men) or 88cm (women), b) blood pressure greater than
             or equal to 135 mmHg systolic or greater than or equal to 85 mmHg diastolic or
             antihypertensive medication use, c) fasting glucose greater than or equal to 110 mg/dL
             or insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication use, d) serum triglycerides greater than or
             equal to 150mg/dL or hypertriglyceride medication use, e) HDL-c less than 40mg/dL
             (women) or less than 50 mg/dL (men) or medication use for low HDL-c1. MetS was
             selected because individuals with MetS are at high risk for multiple chronic
             conditions.

          -  Accelerometry confirmed short sleep (average work day sleep less than or equal to 6.5
             hours/night). Self-reported sleep may overestimate sleep duration. This will ensure
             that participants will have short sleep patterns that are associated with MetS
             outcomes.

          -  English speaking. Participants will need to demonstrate adequate English comprehension
             (assessed during informed consent).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy/lactation (self-reported). Pregnancy and lactation can disrupt habitual
             sleep patterns, and hormonal changes during pregnancy increase insulin resistance and
             may confound MetS.

          -  Current chemotherapy treatments (self-reported). Current chemotherapy treatments may
             contribute to fatigue and sleep disturbances.

          -  Alcohol abuse/dependence will be assessed with the Alcohol Use Disorders
             Identification Test (a measure that has demonstrated good reliability and validity).
             Alcohol abuse/dependence may contribute to sleep disturbances and limit the
             participant's ability to take part in sleep interventions.

          -  Night shift or shift work (previous 2 months), trans-meridian travel (previous 4
             weeks), or planned shift work or trans-meridian travel during intervention period
             (self-reported). These will be to ensure that sleep estimates from baseline represent
             participants' habitual sleep and to ensure adherence with the sleep intervention.

          -  Moderate-severe or severe depression will be assessed with the PHQ-9. Moderate-severe
             depression or severe depression may contribute to sleep disturbances and interfere
             with the participant's ability to adhere to the sleep interventions.

          -  Chronic use of sleep-promoting medications (self-reported). These may interfere with
             sleep patterns and limit the participant's ability to take part in the sleep
             interventions.

          -  Habitual napping, defined as 2 naps per day or &gt; 90 minutes of napping on 3 or more
             days of the week will be assessed during baseline with accelerometry. This will be to
             ensure adherence with the sleep intervention.

          -  Diagnosed but untreated obstructive sleep apnea.
