  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate whether the cocktail of natural antioxidants
      XXS-2A-BR2 comprising vitamin E and coupled with omega-3 helps to prevent and / or reduce the
      deleterious effects induced by long term physical inactivity through antiorthostatic bedrest.
      During a randomized 60 day bed rest study in 20 healthy male adults the two following aims
      will be undertaken:

        -  Sixteen scientific protocols will assess the changes in the cardiovascular, metabolism,
           muscle, bone, neuro sensorial, hematological and immunology systems.

        -  In the above mentioned systems, the potential beneficial effects of the countermeasure
           protocol will also be investigated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Space flights have shown the possibilities and limitations of human adaptation to space. For
      the last 50 years, results showed that the space environment and microgravity in particular,
      cause changes that may affect the performance of astronauts. These physiological changes
      particularly challenge the cardiovascular, metabolic, muscle and bone functions. Space
      agencies regularly conduct simulations on the ground on healthy volunteers to mimic the
      effects of weightlessness (head down bed rest model) to better understand the mechanisms of
      adaptations of the organism to space, and develop ways to prevent and / or reduce the
      negative biological effects of microgravity on astronauts. These protocols are called
      countermeasures. Since the beginning of space missions, various countermeasures have been
      tested on the ground and in-flight, including different exercise protocols. To date, however,
      none has been entirely satisfactory and space agencies continue to conduct simulation studies
      to evaluate new countermeasures. Nowadays, the human spaceflight program has entered the next
      phase of space exploration towards the Moon and Mars and there are clearly inherent medical
      challenges with such a goal, among which, countermeasure developments are a clear priority.

      Based on recent evidences, the next countermeasure to be tested during a 60-day bed rest
      includes a nutritional countermeasure composed of an anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory
      dietary mix.

    <measure>Change in B lymphopoiesis</measure>
    <time_frame>60 days</time_frame>
    <description>Next generation sequencing (NGS) of IgM heavy chain transcripts extracted from PBMC will 1) indicate if the expression frequencies of Ig gene segments are modified during bed rest thereby indicating a change in B lymphopoiesis (because each B cell created in the marrow is characterized by its own VH-D-JH-CÂµ mRNA) and 2) allow the assessment of the activities of enzymes required for the formation of the B cell antigen receptor repertoire.
Flow cytometry will be used to determine if there is an egress of HSC/progenitors from the bone marrow into blood stream thereby indicating a decrease of the interactions between HSC and their niche. The same technique will be used to determine if there are changes in B cell subsets in peripheral blood.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in head movements in response to a virtual projectile</measure>
    <time_frame>60 days</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects perform a video game-like task of shooting a projectile out of a hand-held tool so that it passes between the gaps of an oriented target grill. Since the projectile and the tool are long and narrow, the subject must place the tool at the same orientation as the grill to achieve success. On certain trials, the subject is required to move the head between the time that the target is acquired and the moment of the response. Trials vary in terms of what the subject can see and feel during the execution of the task, and on body posture.
A 3D motion caption system is used to track in real-time the movements of the subject' head and hands. A virtual reality helmet is used to provide visual and audio information. A moving head support will be used to allow the subject to tilt the head laterally in both seated and laying conditions.</description>

    <measure>Accuracy and precision of vestibular-evoked sway responses</measure>
    <time_frame>60 days</time_frame>
    <description>In a healthy standing subject, Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS) evokes a postural sway response directed towards the anode electrode. The direction of the response is fixed in head coordinates and so it will rotate as the head is turned. To determine if bedrest has affected the accuracy and precision of this sway response, we will measure the direction of the ground reaction force (GRF) response evoked by GVS in standing volunteers under different head orientations. The mean direction (accuracy) along with the trial-to-trial variability (precision) of the GRF vector will be separately determined. Any reduction in accuracy or precision will indicate degraded vestibular control of balance.</description>

    <measure>Change in T wave morphology</measure>
    <time_frame>60 days</time_frame>
    <description>24h ECG Holters will be done at different timepoints of the study (pre, during and after the bedrest phase). A conventional Holter analysis will be performed using dedicated commercial software. Moreover, the recordings obtained will be analyzed using several advanced signal processing techniques, which will be focused on different aspects of ventricular repolarization.</description>
