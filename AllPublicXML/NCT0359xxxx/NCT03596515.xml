      Introduction:

      Sensory Integration (SI) is a theory and framework conceptualized by Dr. Jean Ayres, a highly
      experienced occupational therapist, with its main objective as enhancing the brain's capacity
      to perceive and organize sensory information to produce a more normal, adaptive response;
      thus, to provide the foundation for mastering academic tasks (Case-Smith and O'Brien, 2010).

      Objectives:

      The aim of the study is to investigate the effectiveness of ASI interventions for school-aged
      children with sensory modulation and sensory processing deficits.

      Methodology:

      A cross-clustered single-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted in 5 occupational
      therapy outpatient department within Hospital Authority, to assess the difference in clinical
      outcomes between subjects in experimental group (received ASI) and control group (on usual
      waitlist for treatment). Participants in experimental group (EG) would receive 16 sessions
      (45 minutes each) of individualized ASI. The sessions were scheduled on weekly basis and
      would be completed within five months once treatment was initiated. Post-assessment outcomes
      would be measured at this time-point. Post-assessment outcomes would also be measured for
      subjects in control group (CG) at the same time-point. ASI would then be initiated for
      participants in CG according to usual clinical scheduling.

    <description>Goal attainment scaling (GAS) is the full name of this scale. It is an individualized, criterion-referenced measures of changes. In involves defining a set of unique goals for a client, and then specifying a range of outcomes, which reflect concrete activities. It is a goal-setting process determining intervention outcomes expressly relevant to individuals and their families. It can show functional and meaningful outcomes that are often challenging to assess using standardized measures. It is a 5-point rating scale ranging from -2 to +2 (-2 is the least favorable treatment outcome, 0 is the predicted expected level of performance, and +2 is the most favorable treatment outcome). In this study, three individualized goals were developed for each participant by occupational therapists in conjunction with the parents or caregivers. The occupational therapists transferred the score of each child in each goal in the pre- and post-assessments according to parents' ratings.</description>

    <measure>Change on the Sensory Integration and Praxis Test scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre and post of the treatment intervention, an average of 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Sensory Integration and Praxis Test (SIPT) is the full name of this scale. This is a standardized test for assessing the sensory integration and praxis of children between the ages of four years and eight years, eleven months. This study used six subtests of the SIPT - standing and walking balance, postural praxis, post-rotary nystagmus, motor accuracy, sequencing praxis, and graphesthesia - based on expert opinions. SIPT offers is computer scoring and interpretation. Therapists simply record the child's performance and enter into the software. The software will generates the S.D. scores and percentile scores. Average SD scores are usually considered to fall between -1 to +1. Scores below -2 generally indicate definite problems, while scores between -2 and -1 are indicative of possible problems.</description>

    <measure>Change on the Chinese Sensory Profile</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre and post of the treatment intervention, an average of 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Chinese Sensory Profile is the full name of this scale.This is a judgment-based questionnaire answered on a 5-point Likert scale. It is regarded as a standardized assessment for screening the sensory processing abilities of children between the ages of three and 12 years. Score each response according to the following criteria:1. Always = 1 point; 2. Frequently = 2 points; 3. Occassionally = 3 points; 4. Seldom = 4 points; 5. Never = 5 points.To determine the section raw score total, add the item scores for each section and transfer the total to the section summary table. Plot the child's section raw score totals in the classification column corresponding to the raw score total for each section.Cut scores were determined for each section in the following manner: 1. Typical performance includes scores at or above 1 S.D. below the mean; 2. Probable difference is includes scores at or above 2 S.D. below the mean; 3. Definite difference is includes scores below 2 S.D. below the mean.</description>
