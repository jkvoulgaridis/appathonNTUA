  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study focuses on physiological explanations of difficulties with physical activity and
      exercise in individuals with Down syndrome, by non-invasively examining cardiac output and
      the regulation of blood flow to working muscles during exercise.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Work capacity is an important predictor of declining health or physical function, and of
      mortality, and is commonly measured as peak oxygen consumption. Peak oxygen consumption is
      very low in individuals with Down syndrome, the most prevalent genetic cause of intellectual
      disability. Previous research suggests individuals with Down syndrome may experience a double
      disadvantage when they are exercising: they may not be able to increase cardiac output
      sufficiently and they may not be able to allocate adequate blood flow to the working muscles.

      The aim of this research study is therefore to determine the impact of limitations in central
      and peripheral regulation of blood flow on work capacity in individuals with DS. The results
      of this project will aid our understanding of the underlying mechanisms and determine the
      potential to improve health across the lifespan of individuals with Down syndrome by
      tailoring exercise interventions.

    <measure>Brachial blood flow</measure>
    <time_frame>In minute 4 of the 5-minute bout of grip strength exercise</time_frame>
    <description>Forearm blood flow and vascular conductance will be measured in both the exercising and non-exercising arm using high definition ultrasound (Alpha 7, Aloka-Hitachi). The brachial artery will be imaged in dual mode allowing for simultaneous determination of artery diameter (B-mode) and flow velocity (Doppler mode). Blood flow will be determined from the following formula: Forearm Blood flow = (Mean blood velocity) x (Brachial Cross Sectional Area) x (60) and expressed as ml/min. Forearm vascular conductance will be determined by dividing forearm blood flow by mean arterial pressure. Forearm blood flow and vascular conductance will be normalized to forearm lean mass to account for differences in lean mass between individuals.</description>

    <measure>Muscle oxygenation</measure>
    <time_frame>In minute 4 of the 5-minute bout of grip strength exercise</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle oxygenation will be measured with near-infrared spectography (NIRS), which is a simple, noninvasive method for measuring the presence of oxygen in muscle. It can monitor changes in muscle oxygenation and blood flow during submaximal and maximal exercise. During exercise, the extent to which skeletal muscles deoxygenate varies according to the type of muscle, type of exercise and blood flow response.</description>

    <time_frame>Every second minute until the 12th minute of the maximal test.</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiac output will be measured during a graded maximal test protocol using ultrasonography, by measuring the aortic diameter at the level of the valve form the peristernal long axis. Ascending aortic blood flow will be measured using continuous Doppler echocardiography using a pedoff probe in the suprasternal notch.</description>

    <description>For participants with Down syndrome, the first visit includes baseline measures and familiarization with the graded maximal exercise test protocol. If necessary, additional familiarization sessions will be scheduled for people with Down syndrome. The second visit, we perform the graded maximal exercise test and familiarize the participant with the procedures for the third visit: the hand grip exercise protocol and the lower body negative pressure (LBNP) box. The third visit we assess the peripheral blood flow during the hand grip exercise protocol without and with the LBNP. For control subjects, the first and second visit are combined. Their second visit is the same as the third visit for individuals with Down syndrome.</description>
