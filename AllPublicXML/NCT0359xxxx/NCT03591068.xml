    <textblock>
      This is a 24-week, open-label, multi-center study designed to assess the efficacy and safety
      of OPN-375 186 μg twice a day in subjects with nasal polyps using Nasoendoscopic video. The
      total planned number of subjects is approximately 10, with each subject receiving OPN-375 186
      μg twice a day.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of OPN-375 186 μg
      twice a day in adults with Bilateral Nasal Polyps using Nasoendoscopic video. The secondary
      objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety of OPN-375 via adverse event reports,
      vital signs, and nasal examination. In addition, to measure any change in subject symptoms
      and functioning from Baseline to 12 and 24 weeks during the study, using the Sinonasal
      Outcome Test -22 (SNOT-22), Patient's Global Impression of Change (PGIC), and measurement of
      nasal polyps by independent, blinded reader, and any changes throughout the study.

    <description>The Sinonasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) , is a subject-completed questionnaire consisting of 22 symptoms and social/emotional consequences of their nasal disorder. the scale ranges from 0=no problem to 5=problem is bad as it can be</description>

    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Day 1), Visit 3 ( Week 24)</time_frame>
    <description>The Sniffin' Sticks n-butanol (Extended test) are used to investigate human olfactory performance by use of odor pens. the Extended Test consists of 3 different subtests: Threshold, Discrimination and Identification. the Threshold test is used to ascertain the patient's olfactory threshold. the Discrimination test requires the patient to differentiate smells. The Identification test requires the patient to identify everyday smells by means of a card with different choices. The result of this test is expressed as the sum of the results of the 3 subtests, the so called TDI score (threshold, discrimination, identification). A score of more than 30 rates as normal, a score of 30 or less indicates hyposmia and a score of 15 and below point to functional anosmia in form of complete loss of the sense of smell or an extremely weakened smell ability.</description>
