  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective pilot study of participants who have stable coronary heart disease
      (CHD). Participants undergo risk stratification using the SomaLogic CVD Risk Panel blood test
      at baseline and again 4-12 months after the initial test. Participant surveys and chart
      abstractions are conducted at baseline and follow-up to collect feedback about the test
      report and actions taken. Care teams may consider using the risk information from the
      SomaLogic panel to address care gaps. Medical treatment decisions and recommendations are
      confirmed by established clinical methods, including blood pressure monitoring, BMI, lipid
      and CRP measurements, and physician's clinical judgment.

      This is a prospective pilot study of participants who have stable coronary heart disease
      (CHD). Objectives of this study are to understand whether CVD Secondary Risk Panel scores
      change from baseline to follow-up (4-12 months after baseline) and actions taken, if any,
      based upon the results. Participants are surveyed to learn what the test results mean to them
      and assess if the results affect adherence to therapy and lifestyle choices (diet, exercise,
      alcohol, and tobacco use). In addition, this study will investigate the characteristics of
      patients that physicians choose to test with the CVD Secondary Risk Panel, and what actions
      the care team takes because of the results of the test. Medical treatment decisions and
      recommendations are confirmed by established clinical methods, including blood pressure
      monitoring, BMI, lipid and CRP measurements, and physician's clinical judgement. Chart
      abstractions and participants surveys occur at the baseline and follow-up visits, and charts
      may be abstracted annually for up to 10 years post enrollment.
