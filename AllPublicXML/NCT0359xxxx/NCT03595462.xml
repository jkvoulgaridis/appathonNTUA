  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized snack study in normal to overweight adults that will
      test whether the consumption of different afternoon snacks will have different effects on
      appetite, mood, blood sugar control, and food intake.

      Aim 1: To examine whether the addition of hummus as part of an afternoon snack will improve
      diet quality, particularly through assessments of daily:

        -  Vegetable consumption

        -  Snacking behavior

        -  Energy intake

        -  Food choices

      Aim 2: To examine whether the addition of hummus as part of an afternoon snack will improve
      appetite control and satiety including assessments of:

        -  Appetite Control (hunger, desire to eat, prospective food consumption)

        -  Cravings (sweet, salty, savory)

        -  Satiety (fullness)

        -  Eating initiation

      Aim 3: To examine whether the addition of hummus as part of an afternoon snack will improve
      free-living glycemic control.

      Aim 4: To explore whether the addition of hummus as part of an afternoon snack will improve
      mood/energy states

      Experimental Design: For 6 consecutive days/treatment, the participants will consume either
      hummus and pretzels, granola bars, or no snack between 2-4 pm and refrain from eating
      anything else during this time. On day 7, the participants will consume a standard breakfast,
      at home, and will come in to the investigator's facility 1 h prior to their habitual lunch
      time. The participants will be placed in a comfortable room, void of all time cues and a
      standardized lunch will be consumed. At 3 h after lunch, the participants will complete
      baseline appetite, satiety, and mood questionnaires. The respective snack will be given to
      the participants, and they will have 20 minutes to eat the snack. Snack palatability will
      also be assessed. The participants will continue to complete the previous questionnaires
      until they voluntarily choose to eat (again). At 3 h after snack, they will be presented with
      ad libitum dinner and evening snacks. They will be permitted to eat as much or as little as
      they would like to eat over the remainder of the day. In addition, from day 3 to day 8 of the
      testing week, continuous glucose monitoring will be completed to assess glucose control.

    <description>Free-living energy intake will be assessed on the in-clinic testing day of each treatment. When the participant leaves the testing facility, the participant will be provided with an excess of snacks to consume, ad libitum, throughout the remainder of the day. The quantity of food provided will be ~50% more than their estimated, weight-maintaining energy intake. All food items will be initially weighed and recorded. The participants will be instructed to return all uneaten foods as well as all wrappers and containers from consumed food. Any partially eaten, returned items will be weighed accordingly. The daily energy content will be assessed from these pack-outs.</description>
