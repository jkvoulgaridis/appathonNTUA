    <textblock>
      We have demonstrated for the very first time that it is possible to isolate CPCs (circulating
      pulmonary cells) in patients with COPD in a sample of 17 patients (with a recovery rate of
      nearly 40%) and none of 10 healthy, non- smokers controls with a patented method [provisional
      Spanish Patent Application (P201730724)], based on liquid biopsy methodology (Romero Palacios
      et at, submitted 2017), showing that patients with COPD and isolation of CPCs have a more
      severe disease (expressed as higher BODEx index) and a trend towards a higher rate of decline
      of lung function as well as an increased rate of exacerbations, suggesting that CPCs
      isolation could be of value as a diagnostic and prognostic tool identifying patients with
      more active diseases. However, due to the small sample, no definitive conclusions could be
      made. Moreover, as there were no healthy smokers included in this study, we couldn´t evaluate
      if CPCs could be isolated in this type of population.

      The fact that CPCs could be isolated in a group of patients with COPD and its relationship
      with greater severity suggests that this could be a marker of progression of the disease and
      could detect those patients more likely to benefit from newer antiinflamatory therapies(17)

      1. HYPOTHESIS 1.1. MAIN HYPOTHESIS.

             -  CPCs isolation is frequent in COPD patients and also (to a lower level) in smokers
                without COPD but is not possible in healthy non-smokers.

             -  CPCs isolation is related to important clinical outcomes in COPD. 1.2. SECONDARY
                HYPOTHESIS.

             -  CPCs isolation in COPD is related to a higher rate of decline of lung function,
                measured by changes in FEV1 during a 3 year period.

             -  CPCs isolation in COPD is related to indirect measures of emphysema (DLCO and kCO).

             -  Isolation of CPCs in COPD patients is related to a higher risk of exacerbations
                during follow- up.

             -  Isolation of CPCs in COPD is related to a higher burden of symptoms, measured by
                standardized questionnaires as CAT (COPD Assessment Test) and mMRC (modified
                Medical Research Council Scale).

             -  Isolation of CPCs in COPD is more frequent as disease progress to a more severe
                disease.

             -  Isolation of CPCs in COPD is related to a higher extent of radiologic emphysema,
                measured by %LAA (percentage of low attenuation areas).

        2. OUTCOMES. 2.1. PRIMARY OUTCOME 2.1.1. To evaluate the prevalence of CPCs isolation in

      between subjects with and without CPCs isolation after adjustment for confounding variables
      2.2.10. To evaluate if there are differences in the rate of CPCs isolation between those
      patients with early onset COPD (defined as those with COPD before 60 years of age) and those
      with normal onset COPD (defined as those with COPD after 60 years of age).
