  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to administer single dose (100 mg) glasdegib tablet to subjects
      with normal, moderate and severe renal impairment and estimate the effect, if any, of this
      renal impairment on glasdegib pharmacokinetics.

             the exception of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperparathyroidism, ischemic heart
             disease, etc. as long as, in the opinion of the investigator, the subject is medically
             stable, is on a stable drug regimen and can abide by the meals and dietary
             restrictions outlined in protocol identified by a detailed medical history, full
             physical examination, measurement of pulse rate and 12 lead ECG as well as clinical
             laboratory tests (except serum creatinine and eGFR).

               2. Severe renal impairment: eGFR &lt;30 mL/min, but not requiring hemodialysis. For
                  subjects in all groups, the values of serum creatinine obtained at the two
                  screening visits should not be more than 20% different.

                  Exclusion Criteria:

                  -Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy,
                  achlorhydria).

                  Renal allograft recipients

                  Urinary incontinence without catheterization.

                  Concurrent use of any of the following food or drugs known to inhibit CYP3A4
                  (consult the Sponsor if in doubt whether a food or a drug falls into any of the
                  above categories) within 7 days or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to
                  the dose of glasdegib, until the completion of the last PK sample collection.

                  Concurrent use of any of the following food or drugs known to induce CYP3A4
                  (consult the Sponsor if in doubt whether a food or a drug falls into any of the
                  above categories) within 12 days or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to
                  the first dose of trial medication until the completion of the last PK sample
                  collection.

                  Pregnant female subjects; breastfeeding female subjects; fertile male subjects
                  who are unwilling or unable to use two highly effective methods of contraception
                  as outlined in this protocol for the duration of the study and for at least 90
                  days after the last dose of investigational product and, refrain from sperm
                  donation for the duration of the Study and for at least 90 days after the last
                  dose of investigational product.

                  Subjects with ANY of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at
                  Screening, as assessed by the study specific laboratory and confirmed by a single
                  repeat test, if deemed necessary:

                    -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level &gt;
                       upper limit of normal (ULN);

                    -  Total bilirubin level 1.5 × ULN; subjects with a history of Gilbert's
                       syndrome may have direct bilirubin measured and would be eligible for this
                       study provided the direct bilirubin level is not greater than 0.5 mg/dL.

                  For subjects with renal impairment, the following important additional criteria
                  are:

                  Subjects with other clinically significant disease that may affect the safety of
                  the subject or that may affect the pharmacokinetics of glasdegib (including drug
                  allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at time of
                  dosing). Subjects with any significant hepatic, cardiac, or pulmonary disease or
                  subjects who are clinically nephrotic. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
                  hyperparathyroidism, ischemic heart disease, etc is not cause for exclusion as
                  long as the subject is medically stable and any drugs that are administered for
                  these conditions are not expected to interfere with the pharmacokinetics of
                  glasdegib.

                  Screening blood pressure =&gt;180mm Hg (systolic) or&gt;=110 mm Hg (diastolic),
                  following at least 5 minutes of supine rest. If initial blood pressure (BP) is
                  180 mm Hg (systolic) or 110 mm Hg (diastolic), the BP should be repeated two more
                  times and the average of the three BP values should be used to determine the
                  subject's eligibility.

                  Screening supine 12 lead ECG demonstrating QTcF &gt;470 msec or a QRS interval &gt;120
                  msec. If initial QTcF exceeds 470 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should
                  be repeated two more times and the average of the three QTcF or QRS values should
                  be used to determine the subject's eligibility.
