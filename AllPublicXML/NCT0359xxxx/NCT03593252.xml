    <textblock>
      Infections after elective intestinal surgery remain a significant burden for patients and for
      the health care system. The cost of treating a single surgical site infection is estimated at
      approximately $27,000. In adult patients, there is good evidence that the combination of oral
      antibiotics and mechanical bowel preparation is effective at reducing infections after
      intestinal surgery. In children, the body of evidence is much weaker. In this population,
      little evidence exists for oral antibiotics reducing infections and no data exists as to the
      effect of combining antibiotics with mechanical bowel preparation (such as polyethylene
      glycol (PEG)). The goal of the proposed study is to examine the effects of oral antibiotics
      with and without the combined use of mechanical bowel preparation on the rate of
      post-operative infectious complications in children aged 6 months to 18 years. This will be
      compared to current practices, which is to abstain from any type of mechanical bowel
      preparations or oral antibiotic administration before intestinal surgery.

      Background:

      Colorectal surgery is associated with high rates of surgical site infections (SSI) in both
      children and adults, reported in excess of 25%, attracting great interest for patient care
      quality improvement. In a recent NSQIP-Pediatric database review, colorectal procedures
      accounted for 2.5% of the caseload and contributed 7.1% of the SSI burden, making this group
      of procedures an important target for SSI reduction. Some measures under investigation are
      mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) (oral or rectal) and oral non-absorbable antibiotics (OA)
      like neomycin, erythromycin and metronidazole. The former is thought to potentially decrease
      the stool load and decrease contamination during surgery, while the latter is thought to
      decrease SSI by decreasing the bacterial load in bowel. Nichols and Condon popularized bowel
      preparation in 1972 and 1973, after showing reduction of post-operative infectious
      complications with the use of MBP and OA. The regimen extended over three-days, requiring
      hospital admission, diet alteration (low residue / clear diet), oral and rectal MBP and OA.
      This has changed to a shorter prep, yet the regimen of OA (neomycin and erythromycin or
      metronidazole PO, 4 doses starting afternoon before surgery) is still cited as most commonly
      used in adult studies. The possibility of increase in colonic bacterial resistance moved
      surgeons away from OA, but recent adult studies have showed the contrary renewing interest in
      their use. The current adult literature shows clear benefit gained by the use of OA. This is
      less clear in the pediatric literature. Both adult and pediatric literature are lacking in
      the knowledge of benefit added by using MBP to OA.

      Our current practice, as is the case of multiple pediatric center, is to use NO bowel
      preparation in any pediatric intestinal procedure.

      Purpose:

      This is a pilot study to check the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial to
      assess the efficacy of oral nonabsorbable antibiotics, with or without the use of mechanical
      bowel preparation, in reducing the rate of post-operative infectious complications occurring
      within 30 days post-operatively in children and adolescents (aged 6 months to 18 years)
      undergoing elective intestinal surgery.

      The investigator intend to study two subgroups: small bowel surgery and colorectal surgery.

      Post-operative complications include: surgical site infections (incisional, organ-space, and
      anatomic leak), length of hospital stay, readmission, post-operative use of therapeutic
      antibiotics, re-operation, occurrence of electrolyte disturbances (in case MBP was used), and
      occurrence of C. difficile infection.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be stratified into small bowel surgery and large bowel surgery, then randomized to the following study arms. Note: small bowel surgery do not require mechanical bowel preparation since the content is already fluid. So this subgroup will be randomized to groups 2 and 3 only.
Combination bowel prep: Mechanical preparation and oral non-absorbable antibiotics + standard care.
Oral antibiotics + standard care.
No preparation, with standard care.
Standard care (all groups):
Standard nil per os (NPO) prior to general anesthesia
Solids until 8 hours prior to surgery, formula until 6 hours, breast milk until 4 hours, clear fluids until 2 hours
Prophylactic IV antibiotics
Cefazolin (30mg/kg) and metronidazole (15mg/kg) within 60 minutes of incision
Re-dosing if procedure exceeds 4 hours
In case of beta-lactam allergy allergy, clindamycin 5mg/kg and gentamicin 7mg/kg will be used.</intervention_model_description>
