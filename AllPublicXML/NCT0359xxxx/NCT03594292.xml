      The FASTFORWARDTM Bunion Correction system has been cleared by the United States Food and
      Drug Administration for sale. This study is to investigate the clinical outcome of MedShape
      FASTFORWARDTM Bunion Correction system in treating hallux valgus patients at CMUH.

      Criteria-There will be 12 subjects with a painful bunion and hallux valgus between 20 and 65
      years of age and an adequate range of movement. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, failed
      previous hallux valgus surgery and symptomatic and/or radiological arthritis of the MTP joint
      will be excluded.

      Protocol-The PI and SC explain the detail and purpose of the project to the patient to the
      language to the patient is comfortable with. The explanation has to be at least 1 hour. Be
      sure the patients understand the full detail before the surgery.

      Computer tomography scan, gait analysis and blood biochemical analysis will be taken in 1-2
      weeks after patient is enrolled in the subject. Before surgery, the titration bone tether
      plate designed to match patent's second metatarsal contour will be manufactured using 3D
      printing technology. Printed titanium plate and PEEK screws used to secure tethering suture
      tape in the first metatarsal will be sterilized prior implantation. The surgery time,
      recovery period and effectiveness after implantation will be recorded. To observing the
      recovery situation, patients will back to out-patient clinic at 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th,
      12th, 24th weeks. During these period, physical examination, wound dressing, VAS, X-ray scan
      will be arranged. The detail arrangements below:

      1.1st week: physical examination, wound dressing, VAS

      2.2nd week: physical examination, wound dressing, VAS

      3.3rd week: physical examination, wound dressing, VAS, X-ray scan, remove stiches

      4.4th week: physical examination, VAS

      5.6th week: physical examination, VAS, X-ray scan

      6.12th week: physical examination, VAS, X-ray scan

      7.24th week: physical examination, VAS, X-ray scan, CT scan, gait analysis

    <description>The participants are treated with FASTFORWARDTM Bunion Correction system. The FASTFORWARDTM Bunion Correction system employed 3D printed titanium bone tether plate at second metatarsal. Due to the merit of 3D printing technology, the plate is designed to broadly distribute forces across bone to secure mechanical integrity of the bone. The FASTFORWARDTM Bunion Correction system has been cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration.</description>
