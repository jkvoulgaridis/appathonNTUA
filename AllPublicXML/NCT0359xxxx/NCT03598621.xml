  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare four different semaglutide versions and different injection tools.
      The study aims to show similar levels of semaglutide in the blood using different versions of
      semaglutide. The researchers also want to look at how well the injection tools work.
      Participants will get two versions of semaglutide at two separate dosing visits. One of them
      is a version that doctors already can prescribe and the other will be one of the new
      versions. Which version participants get first is decided by chance. Participants will get
      semaglutide as an injection under the skin. The time between injections is 7 to 8 weeks. The
      study will last for about 16 weeks. Participants will have 27 study visits with the study
      doctor. For two of the visits, participants will stay at the clinic for 4 days and 3 nights.
