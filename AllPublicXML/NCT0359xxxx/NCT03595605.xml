  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will incorporate the use of wearable actigraphy devices (Fitbit) on research
      participants admitted to medicine inpatient units at Tisch Hospital and/or NYU Brooklyn. The
      investigator's sample size will be 600 randomized into two groups, with basic inclusion
      criteria including age greater than 65 years and pre-hospital ambulatory status. While both
      groups will be monitored in terms of their activity (specifically pedometer data), the
      intervention group will have twice daily encouragement of ambulation. Once a subject is
      enrolled, data will be collected daily and at time of discharge.
