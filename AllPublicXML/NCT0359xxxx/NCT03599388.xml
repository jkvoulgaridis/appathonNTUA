    <textblock>
      This pilot study will test acceptability and feasibility of a sleep extension intervention in
      community dwelling, short sleeping, racially/ethnically diverse middle aged adults with
      Metabolic Syndrome (METs). Baseline sleep habits will be assessed and used to guide
      individualized strategies to extend sleep. A 1-group pre-test, post-test study design will
      test the efficacy of this 18 week study (2 weeks of baseline data collection, 1 week of study
      intervention planning, 12 weeks of sleep intervention planning, 12 weeks of sleep
      intervention delivery, final follow up 3 weeks after last day of the 12 week intervention) on
      sleep duration, MetS factors (waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting glucose,
      trigycerides, HDL-c), MetS risk behaviors (poor affective well-being, fatigue) and self
      regulation. Socio-ecological barriers and facilitators to the intervention will be identified
      using a quantitative and qualitative approach.

    <description>Bedtimes and wake times will be prescribed each week for each participant and allow for gradual increases in sleep opportunity. Bedtimes will be set 15 minutes earlier each week provided sleep efficiency remains &gt;90%. Earlier betimes will extend sleep duration by increasing the opportunity for sleep. Wake times will not be changed because wake times are often determined by external demands, such as work schedules</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Greater than or equal to 40 years of age and less than or equal to 60 years of age.

          -  Objectively confirmed MetS defined by three or more of the following:

               1. waist circumference greater than 120cm (men) or 88cm (women),

               2. blood pressure greater than or equal to 135 mmHg systolic or greater than or
                  equal to 85 mmHg diastolic or antihypertensive medication use,

               3. fasting glucose greater than or equal to 110 mg/dL or insulin or oral
                  hypoglycemic medication use,

               4. serum triglycerides greater than or equal to 150mg/dL or hypertriglyceridia
                  medication use,

               5. HDL-c less than 40mg/dL (women) or less than 50 mg/dL (men) or medication use for
                  low HDL-c1. MetS was selected because individuals with MetS are at high risk for
                  multiple chronic conditions35.

          -  No obstructive sleep apnea.

          -  Accelerometry confirmed short sleep (average work day sleep less than or equal to 6
             hours/night).

          -  English speaking.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy/lactation

          -  Current chemotherapy treatments

          -  Alcohol abuse/dependence

          -  Insomnia

          -  Moderate-severe or severe depression
