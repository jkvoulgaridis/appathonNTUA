    <textblock>
      This study is designed to treat systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) patients with an autologous
      stem cell transplant using a regimen of immune suppressant drugs and chemotherapy that is
      less toxic to your heart.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant used in this research study is an
      investigational procedure that uses cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (chemotherapy), rabbit
      anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG) (a protein that kills the immune cells that are thought to be
      causing your disease), and rituximab (a biologic drug that targets B cells of your immune
      system). After use of these treatments, the patient will receive their own previously
      collected blood stem cells (autologous stem cell transplant). The ability of these
      experimental treatments to stop relapses and progression (worsening) of your systemic
      sclerosis will be assessed.

          8. Liver cirrhosis, transaminases &gt;2x of normal limits, or bilirubin &gt; 2.0 unless due to
             Gilbert's disease

          9. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or any other illness that in the opinion of the
             investigators would jeopardize the ability of the patient to tolerate aggressive
             treatment

         10. Prior history of malignancy

         11. Positive pregnancy test, inability or unable to pursue effective means of birth
             control, or failure to willingly accept or comprehend irreversible sterility as a side
             effect of therapy

             consent impossible
