  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the NEO-PV-01 vaccine, either with
      APX005M or ipilimumab, and nivolumab is safe for the treatment of patients with advanced or
      metastatic melanoma. The study will also investigate an alternative schedule for the
      administration of the NEO-PV-01 vaccine. Study interventions will be assessed by both
      clinical and immune responses to treatment.

    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will enroll patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma not having
      received treatment for metastatic disease. The 5 agents being used in this study are:

        -  A new, investigational, personal cancer vaccine called &quot;NEO-PV-01&quot;.

        -  Poly-ICLC (Hiltonol), an investigational adjuvant that is used to help stimulate the
           immune system.

        -  A cancer drug called APX005M, a drug that stimulates specific types of immune cells that
           help the immune system to recognize specific targets.

        -  A cancer drug called ipilimumab

        -  A cancer drug called nivolumab

      NEO-PV-01, APX005M, ipilimumab, and nivolumab are considered immunotherapies and work using
      the immune system to fight cancer. NEO-PV-01 is a personal vaccine therapy in that it is
      manufactured specifically to include targets for the immune system that are present uniquely
      on your cancer. Poly-ICLC is an adjuvant that helps stimulate the immune system and make the
      vaccine, NEO-PV-01, more effective.

      The purpose of this study is to find out if treatment with NEO-PV-01 + Poly-ICLC (the
      NEO-PV-01 vaccine) in combination with either APX005M or ipilimumab, and nivolumab is safe
      and useful for patients with melanoma. The study also will assess if the NEO-PV-01 vaccine,
      when given at different intervals, can improve your response compared with the standard
      schedule. This study will also assess the effects of poly-ICLC in combination with nivolumab.
      The side effects of all study drugs will be monitored and additional research tests will be
      done to assess your immune response to your cancer. There is no guarantee that you will
      benefit from therapy with the study drugs.

      The FDA has not yet approved the NEO-PV-01 vaccine for use alone or in combination with other
      cancer drugs such as APX005M, ipilimumab, and nivolumab. Neither APX005M nor Poly-ICLC are
      approved for use in your type of cancer. Ipilimumab and nivolumab are both approved for use
      in your type of cancer.

             will be required.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method of
             contraception, as outlined in the protocol, for the course of the study through 120
             days after last dose of study medication.

          -  Male patients of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of
             contraception, as outlined in the protocol, starting with the first dose of study
             therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy. Abstinence is
             acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the patient.

             Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from AE due to agents
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Have had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy

             baseline) from AEs due to a previously administered agent.

               1. Note: Patients with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy or ≤ Grade 2 alopecia are an exception
                  to this criterion and may qualify for the study.

               2. Note: If patients received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately
                  from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting

             imaging modality for each assessment, either magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or
             computed tomography (CT) scan] for at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of trial

          -  Have active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2
             years (i.e., with use of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or
             immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or
             physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency)
             is not considered a form of systemic treatment.

          -  Have a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy
             (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of

             Hepatitis C (e.g., hepatitis C virus [HCV] RNA [qualitative] is detected).

          -  Have an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or
             active infection requiring treatment, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable
             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia.

          -  Have any underlying medical condition, psychiatric condition, or social situation
             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise study administration as per
             protocol or compromise the assessment of AEs.

          -  Have a planned major surgery.

          -  Are pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit through 120 days
             after the last dose of trial treatment.

          -  Nursing women are excluded from this study because there is an unknown but potential
             risk of AEs in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with nivolumab,
             personalized neoantigen peptides, adjuvant, ipilimumab, and APX005M.

             for the following:

               1. Individuals with a history of invasive metastatic disease are eligible if they
                  have been disease free for at least 2 years and are deemed by the Investigator to
                  be at low risk for recurrence of that metastatic disease;

               2. Individuals with basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the
                  skin, in situ cervical cancer, or local papillary thyroid cancer, who have
