    <textblock>
      This is a 3-month extension study (DCLP3 Extension) following a primary trial (DCLP3 or
      NCT03563313) to assess efficacy and safety of a closed loop system (t:slim X2 with Control-IQ
      Technology) in a large randomized controlled trial. Upon completion of the NIH 3-month
      extension study, subjects will be invited to participate in a continued use phase with
      Control-IQ Technology, funded by Tandem Diabetes Care, until the equipment has received FDA
      approval for commercial use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants in the 6 month primary trial (DCLP3) will be invited to continue in this 3-month
      extension study (DCLP3 Extension) following completion of the primary trial. The closed-loop
      control (CLC) Intervention Group participants from the primary trial will be randomly
      assigned to continue CLC or to switch to Predictive Low-Glucose Suspend (PLGS) therapy with
      t:slim X2 with Basal-IQ and Dexcom G6 for 3 months. The Sensor-Augmented Pump (SAP) Control
      Group participants from the primary trial will be assigned to CLC using t:slim X2 with
      Control-IQ Technology and Dexcom G6 (CGM) for 3 months. Upon completion of the extension
      study, subjects will be invited to participate in continued use of the Control-IQ Technology
      until the equipment has received FDA approval for commercial use.

      This extension phase has two separate objectives:

      Objective 1: Among participants who used CLC in the primary trial: the primary efficacy
      outcome for the RCT is time in target range 70-180 mg/dL measured by CGM in CLC group vs.
      PLGS group over 3 months. Safety outcomes also will be assessed Objective 2: Among
      participants who used SAP in the primary trial: the primary outcome is to obtain additional
      safety data. Efficacy also will be assessed as a pre-post within participant analysis

      Note: Primary Trial (DCLP3) is NCT03563313

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Successful completion of the original 6-month RCT within the prior 14 days

          2. For females, not currently known to be pregnant. If female and sexually active, must
             agree to use a form of contraception to prevent pregnancy while a participant in the
             study. A negative urine pregnancy test will be required for all females of
             child-bearing potential. Participants who become pregnant will be discontinued from
             the study. Also, participants who during the study develop and express the intention
             to become pregnant within the timespan of the study will be discontinued.

          3. For participants &lt;18 years old, living with one or more parent/legal guardian
             knowledgeable about emergency procedures for severe hypoglycemia and able to contact
             the participant in case of an emergency.

          4. Willingness to not use a personal CGM for the duration of the study

          5. Investigator has confidence that the participant can successfully operate all study
             devices and is capable of adhering to the protocol

          6. Willingness to use only lispro (Humalog) or aspart (Novolog), and to use no other
             insulin during the study.

          7. Willingness not to start any new non-insulin glucose-lowering agent during the course
             of the trial

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Concurrent use of any non-insulin glucose-lowering agent other than metformin
             (including GLP-1 agonists, Symlin, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT-2 inhibitors,
             sulfonylureas).

          2. Hemophilia or any other bleeding disorder

          3. A condition, which in the opinion of the investigator or designee, would put the
             participant or study at risk

          4. Participation in another pharmaceutical or device trial at the time of enrollment or
             during the study

          5. Employed by, or having immediate family members employed by Tandem Diabetes Care,
             Inc., Dexcom, Inc., or TypeZero Technologies, LLC, or having a direct supervisor at
             place of employment who is also directly involved in conducting the clinical trial (as
             a study investigator, coordinator, etc.); or having a first-degree relative who is

    <ipd_description>Will follow the NIH Data Sharing Policy and Implementation Guidance on sharing research resources for research purposes to qualified individuals within the scientific community.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_time_frame>Generally, data will be made available after the primary publications of each study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>The Data Sharing Agreements will be formulated by the Steering Committee in collaboration with the NIH Project Scientist Program Official.
In addition, under special arrangements, complete data sets will be provided to industry partners who would use the data for regulatory clearance (PMA - pre-market approval) of the tested artificial pancreas system. This will be done in response to the specific requirements of RFA-DK-14-024 for this project to &quot;...generate data able to satisfy safety and efficacy requirements by regulatory agencies regarding the clinical testing of artificial pancreas device systems in the target population of people with type 1 diabetes.&quot;</ipd_access_criteria>
