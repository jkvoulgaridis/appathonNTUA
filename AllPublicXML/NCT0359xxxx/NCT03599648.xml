  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Pro-Parenting Study seeks to determine the added benefit of targeting both parenting
      stress and parent management strategies to more effectively reduce behavior problems among
      children with developmental delay (DD). Findings from this study will improve the scientific
      understanding of evidence-based interventions for behavior problems among children with DD
      and the mechanisms underlying therapeutic change.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Behavior problems are a common and concerning challenge among children with developmental
      delay (DD). Approximately 50% of children with DD have a comorbid mental disorder or serious
      behavior problems- a prevalence three times as high as that found in typically developing
      youths. Behavioral parent training (BPT) is the gold-standard intervention for treating child
      behavior problems in typically developing children and in children with DD. However, high
      levels of parental stress are associated with reduced or no response to BPT for children with
      DD. Consequently, parental stress may attenuate the efficacy of the gold-standard,
      empirically supported treatment for behavior problems among children with DD. As such,
      parental stress is a critical point of intervention for improving both parent and child
      outcomes in families of children with DD. The purpose of this study is to quantify the
      therapeutic benefit of adding a parent stress-reduction intervention prior to delivering BPT
      in order to more effectively reduce child behavior problems, and to investigate the
      mechanisms through which intervention outcomes occur.

    <description>Parents and teachers report on child behavior using the Child Behavior Checklist-Ages 1.5-5 years (Achenbach, 2000) and the Caregiver/ Teacher Report Form (Achenbach, 2000), respectively. The total behavior problems T-score from each form is used to assess externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. Verbal and physical disruptive behavior and noncompliance are noted using our observation systems (Phaneuf &amp; McIntyre, 2007; Jabson &amp; Dishion, 2004, 2005). These sources of information will be used to build a &quot;child behavior problem&quot; latent construct. Our criteria for including an indicator in a construct are as follows: The items comprising the indicator must show internal consistency (&gt;.60; item-total correlation &gt; .20), and the scale or indicator convergence in SEM must meet acceptable fit criteria; a comparative fit index and Tucker-Lewis or nonnormed fit index &lt;.95, root mean square error of approximation &lt; .06, and standardized root mean square residual &lt; .08.</description>

    <description>Parents report on three forms of stress. General distress in the parenting role is assessed using the parental distress subscale of the Parenting Stress Index-Fourth Edition, Short Form (PSI4-SF; Abidin, 1995). The Negative Impact scale of the Family Impact Questionnaire (Donenberg &amp; Baker, 1993) is used to assess stress specific to the child with DD. The intensity subscale of the Parenting Daily Hassles questionnaire (Crnic &amp; Greenberg, 1990) assesses parents' perceived intensity of daily stressors related to caregiving demands. These sources of information will be used to build a &quot;parenting stress&quot; latent construct.

    <description>Participants randomized to the BPT-M condition receive the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) intervention, followed by Behavioral Parent Training (BPT). The MBSR module includes six weekly 2.5 hour group sessions, 30-45 minutes of daily home practice guided by audio CDs, and an MBSR parent workbook. In the sessions, participants practice formal mindfulness exercises, and are provided instruction on stress physiology and using mindfulness for coping with stress in everyday life.
The BPT component of the intervention includes 10 weekly sessions lasting 2.5 hours. Each session is structured around videotape vignettes and uses discussion, role-playing, modeling, and feedback to foster mastery of the material. Parents are given weekly homework assignments and practice their skills.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the BPT-E condition will received 6 weeks of a psychoeducation program followed by 10 weeks of the Behavioral Parent Training (BPT) used in both conditions. The psychoeducation module consists of 6 weekly 2.5-hour sessions, daily homework that includes monitoring progress on goals identified at the end of each session, and a workbook for parents of children with special needs that provides parents with information regarding their child's development, disability, and associated considerations. Each of the 6 weekly sessions includes a general topic for discussion. These include preparing for IEP meetings, navigating the regional center and developmental service agencies, communicating with teachers, advocacy, sibling issues, and community resources.</description>

          -  Parent reports elevated parenting stress, as indexed by a total score above the
             recommended cutoff at the 85th percentile on the Parenting Stress Index-4.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Parent screens positive for active psychosis, substance abuse, or suicidality;
