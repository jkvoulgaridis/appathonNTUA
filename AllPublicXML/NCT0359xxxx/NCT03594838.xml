  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate two novel approaches to improve access to Hepatitis C virus (HCV)
      confirmatory viremia testing. Both approaches are &quot;Harm reduction site-based (HRS)&quot; because
      HCV viremia testing will be initiated and test results will be provided at the HRSs. These
      approaches will be compared to the current standard of care (control) in which
      anti-HCV-positive individuals must travel to a HCV treatment centre for HCV viremia testing.
      The investigators hypothesize that improving access to viremia testing improves linkage to
      care and reduces loss to follow-up among those who screen anti-HCV-positive.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A major step in identifying HCV infected individuals in Georgia has already been implemented
      by providing rapid anti-HCV testing for people who inject drugs (PWID) at HRS. However,
      access to HCV confirmatory viremia testing remains limited as PWID must be referred to
      treatment centers for testing.

      Two novel approaches to improve access to HCV viremia testing will be evaluated.

      In the first approach, participants with a positive anti-HCV test will have blood drawn and
      HCV RNA test performed at the HRS. Test results will be provided the same day (or the
      following day if the participant is unable to wait for results) at the HRS.

      In the second approach participants with a positive anti-HCV test will have blood drawn at
      the HRS. The blood will be processed on site and a plasma sample shipped to a central
      laboratory for viremia testing. Test results will be communicated to the participants by HRS
      staff at a follow-up visit as soon as the results are available.

      In both groups, participants who test positive will be referred to a treatment centre for
      further assessments and subsequent treatment initiation.

    <intervention_model_description>A non-randomized 3 arm-interventional study at eight HRSs to evaluate two novel approaches of HCV viremia testing and compare them to the current standard of care. The HRS will be assigned to one of three study arms.
Six HRSs will provide HCV viremia testing on-site using one of two approaches as follows and two HRS will refer patients off-site for testing (current standard of care).
The three arms will be compared to determine differences in the proportion of anti-HCV-positive patients that receive HCV viremia test results.</intervention_model_description>
