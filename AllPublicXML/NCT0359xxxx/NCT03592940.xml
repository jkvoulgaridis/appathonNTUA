  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nutritional status in patients with neuroendocrine tumours (NETs), especially of
      gastroenteropancreatic origin, can be deeply affected by excessive production of
      gastrointestinal hormones, peptides, and amines, which can lead to malabsorption, diarrhoea,
      steatorrhea, and altered gastrointestinal motility. Besides, the surgical and/or medical
      management of NETs can lead to alteration of gastrointestinal secretory, motor, and
      absorptive functions, with both dietary and nutritional consequences. Indeed, disease-related
      malnutrition is a frequently encountered yet both underrecognized and understudied clinical
      phenomenon in patients with NETs, with substantial prognostic and socioeconomic consequences.
      Most of these conditions can be alleviated by a tailored nutritional approach, also with the
      aim of improving the efficacy of cancer treatments. In this setting, skilled nutritionists
      can play a fundamental role in the multidisciplinary health care team in NETs management and
      their presence should be recommended.

        One hundred patients with neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) were consecutively enrolled (aged
        18-60 years) in this cross-sectional observational study. Anthropometric measures were
        evaluated. A validated 14-item questionnaire PREDIMED (PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea)
        was used for the assessment of adherence to the MD. Dietary data were collected by a 7-day
        food records.
