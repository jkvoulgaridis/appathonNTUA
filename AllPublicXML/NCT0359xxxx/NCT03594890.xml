  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is a first-in-man clinical trial evaluating OVX836, a recombinant broad
      spectrum vaccine for Influenza.

      This clinical trial will evaluate the safety and the immune response of increasing doses of
      OVX836 after intramuscular or intranasal administrations in healthy volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single center, randomized, sequential dose escalation, placebo-controlled,
      observer-blind study conducted in healthy subjects aged 18-49 years.

      The OVX836 recombinant vaccine is based on the well conserved nucleoprotein of the Influenza
      virus.

      Three different dose levels of OVX836 (30µg, 90µg, 180µg) will be assessed sequentially and
      administered either by the intramuscular route (Study Part A) or by the intranasal route
      (Study Part B).

      There will be 6 cohorts in total with one cohort testing one dose level and one route of
      administration. Each study cohort will be composed of 12 subjects, with 9 subjects receiving
      the OVX836 vaccine and 3 subjects receiving the placebo. Each subject will receive one
      administration of OVX836 or placebo on Day 1 and one administration on Day 29.

      The study duration for each subject is approximately 5 months.
