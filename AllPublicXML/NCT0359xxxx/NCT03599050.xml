  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will utilize a three-phase approach that is informed by a theory-driven
      implementation framework to: 1) conduct a needs analysis in order to identify individual-,
      health care team-, and practice-level barriers and facilitators to conducting adherence
      counseling in safety-net primary care practices; 2) develop a virtual communication
      simulation designed to improve the quality of adherence counseling by allowing nurses
      repeated opportunities to practice discussing medication adherence with virtual patients; and
      3) conduct a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy
      of the simulation on changes in: a) nurses' collaborative communication skills, b) medication
      adherence, and c) reduction in BP in a sample of 20 patients with uncontrolled hypertension
      (HTN) who are non-adherent to their medications.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  PCPs and nurses will be enrolled if they fulfill the following criteria:

               2. having uncontrolled HTN (BP&gt;140/90 mmHg) at two visits in the past year

               3. being prescribed at least one antihypertensive medication and are non-adherent

               4. are â‰¥age 18 years

               5. fluent in English

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unable to give consent
