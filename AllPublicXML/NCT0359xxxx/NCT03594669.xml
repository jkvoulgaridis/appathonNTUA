      The purpose of this research project is to evaluate the effectiveness of an injury prevention
      intervention for collegiate soccer players. The hypothesis is that measures of sensorimotor
      control will improve and injury incidence rate will decrease after participation in an
      intervention aimed at restoration/refinement of sensorimotor control. This study will be
      conducted as a 1-arm intervention with pre- and post-participation measurement of
      sensorimotor control and completion of an exercise intervention. Statistical analyses will be
      completed to determine within group change pre-to post-intervention and injury risk by
      comparing injury rate in 2018 to injury rate of a historical control.

    <intervention_model_description>This study will be conducted as pilot of a one-arm intervention using,1) pre- and post-participation measures of sensorimotor control and 2) injury incidence rate over the sports-season directly after completion of the intervention compared to injury incidence rate of a historical control (the 2017 soccer season at Mississippi College). Participants will include men and women athletes on soccer teams from one Division II institution.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>When enrolled into the study, the participants will be asked to join a group in WhatsApp for purposes of the research study. The application will be used to: deliver reminders for each treatment session; deliver daily prompts for the home exercise program; and present a web-link to the home exercise program (HEP).
Participants will receive physical therapist delivered multi-modal sensorimotor training interventions. The exercises delivered at each intervention will be delivered in a group format, using a circuit of exercises that each athlete will complete in a session. Subsequent sessions will build upon previous sessions to work the sensorimotor control system in progressively more challenging and sport-specific scenarios. This present study will complete 8 sessions over 4 weeks.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female athletes on the soccer roster who are eligible to play in the fall
             2018 season at Mississippi College

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any athlete who has a current diagnosis of concussion (i.e. a non-medically cleared
             concussion), lower-extremity musculoskeletal injury, or other medical diagnosis that
             will prevent the athlete from participation in the intervention.
