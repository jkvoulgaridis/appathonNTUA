      Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is considered as nonmalignant recurrent or continuous pain related
      to the structures of the pelvis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of
      graded exposure therapy in women with chronic pelvic pain.

    <textblock>
      Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is considered as nonmalignant recurrent or continuous pain related
      to the structures of the pelvis. This condition lasts at least 6 months, and many times is
      associated with negative cognitive, emotional, sexual and behavioral consequences.In addition
      to the high economic cost, CPP is also costly in emotional and psychological suffering. This
      clinical trial aims to evaluate the effects of a program based on graded exposure therapy in
      women with chronic pelvic pain.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fear-avoidance behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline to the end of the intervention will be assessed with the Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ) using the physical activity subscale. This subscale focus on patients' beliefs about how physical activity affected their pain. The values ranges from 0 to 24 with higher scores indicating higher levels of fear-avoidance beliefs.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline to the end of the intervention on pain will be assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory. This instrument evaluates the intensity of pain and also the degree to which the pain interferes in activities of daily living. The arithmetic mean ranging from 0 to 10 of the four severity items will be used as measures of pain severity; the arithmetic mean ranging from 0 to 10 of the seven interference items will be used as a measure of pain interference. Higher score represents worse pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline to the end of the intervention will ibe assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index. It includes 10 items that assess how pain affects common daily activities. Scores range from 0 (no disability) to 100 (completely disabled), so higher scores indicate higher disability.</description>
