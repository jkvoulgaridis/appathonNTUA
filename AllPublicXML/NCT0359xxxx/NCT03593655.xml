      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of and adherence to a vaginal matrix ring
      (VR) containing dapivirine and oral emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) in
      adolescent and young adult females.

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety of and adherence to a vaginal matrix ring (VR) containing
      dapivirine and oral emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) in adolescent and
      young adult females.

      The study will enroll healthy, HIV-uninfected adolescent and young adult females between 16
      and 21 years of age. Participants will be randomized to one of two sequences of one VR
      containing 25 mg of dapivirine to be inserted monthly for 24 weeks and one 200 mg FTC/300 mg
      TDF oral tablet taken daily for 24 weeks. After completing the randomized sequence of two
      study product use periods, participants will then select between the two study products to
      use in the final 24 weeks of the trial. Participants will be able to choose either or neither
      study product during the third product use period. The study includes approximately 76 weeks
      of follow-up per participant.

      Participants will attend monthly study visits, which may include behavioral
      assessments/counseling; physical and pelvic examinations; and blood, urine, and pelvic sample
      collection.

               -  Note: Otherwise eligible participants diagnosed during screening with a UTI, PID
                  or STI/RTI requiring treatment per WHO guidelines — other than asymptomatic
                  bacterial vaginosis (BV) and asymptomatic candidiasis — are offered treatment
                  consistent with WHO recommendations. If treatment is completed and symptoms have

                  participant may be enrolled. Genital warts requiring treatment also must be
                  treated prior to enrollment. Genital warts requiring therapy are defined as those
                  that cause undue burden or discomfort to the participant, including bulky size,
                  unacceptable appearance, or physical discomfort.

          -  At Enrollment, has a clinically apparent Grade 2 or higher pelvic exam finding.

                  specimen collection judged to be within the range of normal according to the
                  clinical judgment of the Investigator of Record (IoR)/designee is considered
                  expected non-menstrual bleeding and is not exclusionary.

               -  Note: Otherwise eligible participants with exclusionary pelvic exam findings may
                  be enrolled/randomized after the findings have improved to a non-exclusionary
                  severity grading or resolved. If improvement to a non-exclusionary grade or
                  resolution is documented within 70 days of providing informed assent/consent for
                  screening, the participant may be enrolled.

          -  Participant report and/or clinical evidence of any of the following:

               -  Known adverse reaction to any of the study products (ever).

                  vaginal products or vaccines within 60 days of Enrollment.

               -  At Enrollment, as determined by the IoR/designee, has any significant
                  uncontrolled active or chronic cardiovascular, renal, liver, hematologic,
                  neurologic, gastrointestinal, psychiatric, endocrine, respiratory, immunologic
                  disorder or infectious disease.

          -  Has any of the following laboratory abnormalities at Screening Visit:

               -  Positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAG).

               -  Hemoglobin Grade 2 or higher.

               -  Calculated creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min by the Schwartz Equation.

                    -  Note: Otherwise eligible participants with an exclusionary test may be
                       re-tested during the screening process; re-testing procedure details can be
                       found in the MTN-034 Study Specific Procedures (SSP) Manual. If improvement
                       to a non-exclusionary grade or resolution is documented within 70 days of
                       providing informed assent/consent for screening, the participant may be
                       enrolled.

          -  Has any other condition that, in the opinion of the IoR/designee, would preclude
             informed assent/consent, make study participation unsafe, complicate interpretation of
             study outcome data, or otherwise interfere with achieving the study objectives.
