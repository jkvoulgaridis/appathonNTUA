      A phase I dose escalation study to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the candidate
      vaccine ChAdOx1 Chik in healthy volunteers.

      Volunteers will be recruited and vaccinated in Oxford, England.

      All vaccinations will be administered intramuscularly. Three different doses will be tested
      (5x10^9 vp, 2.5x10^10 vp and 5x10^10vp).

      The total duration of the study will be 26 weeks from the day of enrolment for all
      volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open label, dose escalation trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity
      of the ChAdOx1 Chik vaccine in healthy volunteers

      There will be 3 study groups with a total of 24 volunteers. ChAdOx1 Chik will be administered
      intramuscularly as a single vaccination at 3 different doses: 5x10^9 vp (group 1), 2.5x10^10
      (group 2) and 5x10^10 vp (group 3)

      Vaccination of groups will be sequential from Group 1 to Group 3 with interim safety reviews
      prior to dose escalation

      Volunteers will be recruited and undergo screening, vaccination and follow-up visits at the
      trial site. Blood samples for safety and immunology purposes will be performed on the visit
      time points indicated in the schedule of attendances.

      Safety will be assessed by the frequency, incidence and nature of adverse events and serious
      adverse events arising during the study.

      Immune responses will be assessed pre and post vaccination procedure at different time points
      throughout the trial
