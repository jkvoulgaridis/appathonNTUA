  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RGX-202-001 is a Phase 1, first-in-human, dose escalation and expansion study of RGX-202-01
      as a single agent and in combination with FOLFIRI. RGX-202-01 is a small molecule inhibitor
      of the creatine transporter SLC6a8, a novel metabolic target that drives gastrointestinal
      cancer progression.

      During the dose escalation stage, multiple doses of orally administered RGX-202-01 with or
      without FOLFIRI (single agent or combination therapy) will be evaluated in patients with
      advanced gastrointestinal tumors (i.e., locally advanced and unresectable, or metastatic) who
      have had PD on available standard systemic therapies or for which there are no standard
      systemic therapies of relevant clinical impact.

      In the expansion stage of the study, additional patients with advanced gastrointestinal
      malignancies selected by expression of the creatine kinase B (CKB) biomarker,
      gastric/gastroesophageal cancer, or colorectal cancer (CRC) will be treated at the MTD (or
      maximum tested dose if no MTD is identified, or dose below the MTD if there is evidence
      suggesting a more favorable risk/benefit profile). This stage will provide further
      characterization of the safety, efficacy, PK, and pharmacodynamics of RGX-202-01 as a single
      agent (selected by expression of the CKB biomarker) and in combination with FOLFIRI
      (gastric/gastroesophageal cancer and CRC).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient must have histologic or cytologic evidence of a malignant gastrointestinal
             tumor (gastric or gastroesophageal junction, pancreatic, biliary, small intestine, or
             colorectal) of adenocarcinoma or poorly differentiated histology and must have disease
             that is resistant to or relapsed following available standard systemic therapy or for
             which there is no standard systemic therapy or reasonable therapy likely to result in
             clinical benefit or if such therapy has been refused by the patient. Documentation of
             the reason must be provided for patients who have not received a standard therapy
             likely to result in clinical benefit.

          2. The patient must have advanced disease, defined as cancer that is either metastatic or
             locally advanced and unresectable (and for which additional radiation therapy or other
             locoregional therapies are not considered feasible).

          3. The patient must have disease that is measurable by standard imaging techniques by
             RECIST version 1.1. For patients with prior radiation therapy, measurable lesions must
             be outside of any prior radiation field(s), unless disease progression has been
             documented at that disease site subsequent to radiation.

                  institutional ULN; patients with hepatic metastases may have AST and ALT ≤ 5 ×
                  institutional ULN;

               5. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5×109/L;

               6. Hemoglobin ≥8 g/dL and no red blood cell (RBC) transfusions during the prior 14

             either echocardiography (ECHO) or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scanning.

          9. If the patient is a woman of child bearing potential (WOCBP), she has had a negative
             serum or urine pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to treatment.

         10. The patient (men and WOCBP) agrees to use acceptable contraceptive methods for the
             duration of time on the study and continues to use acceptable contraceptive methods
             for 1 month after the last dose of study therapy.

         11. The patient has signed informed consent prior to initiation of any study-specific
             procedures or treatment.

         12. The patient is able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements, including follow-up for survival assessment.

         13. Patients with diabetes mellitus should be on a stable regimen of oral hypoglycemic
             therapy and/or insulin before beginning study therapy with RGX-202-01 and serum
             glucose values should consistently be grade 2 or less.

         14. Tumor tissue (a minimum of 5 and up to 15 unstained slides, from a fresh tumor biopsy
             prior to starting study therapy must be available prior to the first dose of study
             therapy. This biopsy should be obtained within 28 days prior to starting RGX-202-01. A
             biopsy obtained earlier than 28 days prior to start of RGX-202-01 may be considered
             acceptable, especially if obtained within 3 months and if no systemic anti-cancer
             therapy has been administered since the date of the biopsy. If a biopsy is deemed by
             the investigator to not be feasible and/or in the patient's best interest, prior
             approval must be obtained from the Medical Monitor to waive this requirement. In this
             case, archived tumor tissue must be made available prior to commencing study
             treatment.

        Additional Inclusion Criteria for Expansion Stages:

          1. For the single agent therapy expansion cohort, patients must have a gastrointestinal
             malignancy expressing the CKB biomarker and must have received only one prior regimen
             for advance/metastatic disease. Patients treated with more than one prior regimen must
             be approved by the Medical Monitor. Only patients exhibiting positive expression of
             CKB in tumor cells detected by an immunohistochemistry (IHC) method will be enrolled.

          2. For the combination therapy expansion cohort, patients with gastroesophageal junction
             or gastric cancer must have received only one prior systemic regimen in the metastatic
             setting. Prior therapy with a checkpoint inhibitor (PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor) is allowed
             and patients may have received up to two prior regimens in the metastatic setting.

          3. For the combination therapy expansion cohort, patients with colorectal cancer must
             have have a tumor expressing the CKB biomarker by an immunohistochemistry (IHC)
             method. Patients must have received at least one irinotecan-containing and one
             oxaliplatin-containing regimen in the metastatic setting or have refused such therapy.
             Patients with KRAS wild-type colorectal cancer must have received prior therapy with
             cetuximab or panitumumab. Patients may have received up to two prior systemic regimens
             in the metastatic setting. Patients with a Microsatellite Instability-High (MSI-High)
             tumor must have received a checkpoint inhibitor (PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor) and may have

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has persistent clinically significant toxicities (Grade ≥2) from previous
             anticancer therapy (excluding Grade 2 chemotherapy-related neuropathy and alopecia
             which are permitted and excluding Grade 2-3 laboratory abnormalities if they are not
             associated with symptoms, are not considered clinically significant by the
             Investigator, or can be managed with available medical therapies).

          2. The patient has a gastrointestinal malignancy of small cell, neuroendocrine, or
             squamous histology.

          4. The patient has received treatment with an investigational systemic anticancer agent
             within 5 half-lives of the investigational systemic therapy prior to study therapy
             administration.

          5. The patient has an additional active malignancy that may confound the assessment of
             the study endpoints. Patients with a past cancer history with substantial potential
             for recurrence must be discussed with the Medical Monitor before study entry. Patients
             with the following concomitant neoplastic diagnoses are eligible: non-melanoma skin

         16. The patient has clinically significant ascites (i.e. requiring paracentesis within the
             preceding 28 days or treatment with pain medication).

         17. The patient has any medical condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             places the patient at an unacceptably high risk for toxicities.

             The following exclusion criteria are relevant for patients who will be treated with
             RGX-202-01 plus FOLFIRI, per protocol, on both Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion
             Cohorts:

         18. The patient has known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency or is on
             treatment with DPD inhibitors, including sorivudine or its chemically related
