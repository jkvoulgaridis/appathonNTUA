  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compelling epidemiological evidence indicates that alterations of mitochondrial DNA,
      including mutations and abnormal content of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), are associated with
      the initiation and development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).The aim of this study
      was to explore association between mtDNA content in peripheral blood cells could be used as a
      risk predictor for ALL.

    <description>The ratio of mitochondrial DNA contents to hemoglobin contents was calculated for each sample from standard curves. After that, the ratio for each sample was normalized to a calibrator DNA in order to standardize between different runs, and then defined as the measurement of relative mtDNA contents.Relative expression of mtDNA were measured in young adults suffered from chronic lymphocytic leukemiawhen compared with control group.</description>

    <description>Mitochondria are responsible for multiple cellular functions including regulation of energy production, modulation of oxidation-reduction status, generation of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis. Each mitochondrion possesses multiple copies of a mitochondrial genome comprised of independently replicating double stranded DNA (mtDNA).</description>

        A total of 150 eligible chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients were anticipated to include
        in this study. Moreover, 50 healthy controls without previous cancer history were also
        recruited from individuals who visited investigator's hospital for physical examination
        during the same time period.
