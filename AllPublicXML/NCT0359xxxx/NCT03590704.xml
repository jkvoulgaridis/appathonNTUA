  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seroma is the most common complication at the beginning of healing after surgery for breast
      cancer treatment. Its incidence varies in the literature from 2.5 to 90% and is defined as a
      collection of serous fluid that develops through skin flaps in the dead space after
      mastectomy or axillary dissection. The physiopathology for seroma formation has not yet been
      fully understood, but appears to be multifactorial with surgery being the main factor.
      Although seroma formation is not a threat to life, it can lead to important morbidity due to
      associated with necrosis, dehiscence, predisposition to sepsis, reduction of shoulder
      functions due to muscle weakness due to restriction of movement, prolonging the recovery
      period and, consequently, leading to delay in adjuvant therapy. The best seroma treatment is
      still not well defined in the literature and the compressive therapy aims to rebalance fluid
      exchange between the lymphatic system and blood, having as effects the increase of the
      interstitial pressure, the improvement of the effectiveness of muscular work, increased
      resistance of the skin and prevention new collection of interstitial fluid. Recently, the
      Kinesio® Taping method were inserted into clinical practice for its ability to reduce pain
      and local swelling. Objective: To evaluate the safety of taping in the seroma after surgical
      treatment of breast cancer. Methodology: This is a pre and post-clinical application of
      taping on the seroma in women submitted to surgical treatment for breast cancer in the Cancer
      Hospital III / INCA. The intervention was performed by applying the compression bandage over
      the seroma region for an average of five days, when the reassessment was performed.

      Patients identified by the nursing team with seroma and with indication of aspiration
      puncture, will be evaluated for eligibility criteria. Those who agree to participate in the
      study will be assessed and submitted to the intervention on the same day, they will remain
      with four days approximately for nursing and physiotherapy revaluation for intervention
      suspension. The neuromuscular bandage will be applied after skin antisepsis with 70% alcohol.
      A 5 cm width Vitaltape® neuromuscular bandage will be used. For the bandage application, a
      distal base (anchor) with two centimeters of diameter will be maintained with maximum
      stretching on the fluctuation region (seroma) and finalized with another base without
      stretching, of 2 centimeters, in the proximal region. How many bundles of bandages are
      required according to the patient's body characteristics and aspect of the flotation region.
      The bandage will not be applied on the scar. If there are any complications such as itching,
      redness, discomfort and / or others, the patients will remove the material at home and
      communicate on return to the institution. The interview will be conducted at the entrance to
      the study, prior to the intervention and the end of the study. In the initial interview will
      be collected sociodemographic data and life habits. They will be evaluated by questionnaire
      as the local symptoms caused by the use of the bandages, the tolerance and feeling / referred
      sensation during and at the end of intervention period, the percentage of seroma volume
      alteration before and after the use of the bandage, the number of days of use and bandage
      detachment. All reviews will be carried out by another professional who will not make the
      interventions. From the hospital record, information will be collected regarding the oncology
      treatment, histopathological report and clinical data on curative care.
