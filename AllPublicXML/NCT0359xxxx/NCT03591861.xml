  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will develop the concept of a sex-specific therapeutic intervention for
      gliomas that is based upon dietary carbohydrate restriction. The investigators will integrate
      metabolomics tools and FDG-PET imaging to validate the ketogenic diet on a sex-specific
      basis.

    <description>Children under 2 years will immediately start on a full calorie classical 3:1 ketogenic diet. The 3:1 ratio indicates that the diet contains 3 g of fat for every 1 g of protein + carbohydrate, which results in about 87% of calories coming from fat.
Children 2 years or older will skip breakfast and lunch on the day of admission but start a full calorie 3:1 ketogenic diet at dinner.</description>
