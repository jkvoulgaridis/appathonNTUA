  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Temocillin prescription frequency may be increased in order to reduce the use of
      carbapenems to reduce the progressive increase in carbapenem resistance observed in recent
      years. The investigators wish to study the responsibility of Temocillin in the occurrence of
      adverse effects in patients in the hospital of Amiens receiving a treatment containing this
      molecule.

      The study &quot;Continuous versus intermittent infusion of temocillin, a directed spectrum
      penicillin for intensive care patients with nosocomial pneumoniae: stability, compatibility,
      population pharmacokinetic studies and breakpoint selection, R. De Jongh, et al, 2007 &quot;, the
      author states that no adverse effects were found following injection of Temocillin. In the
      study &quot;Temocillin use in England: clinical and microbiological efficacies in infections
      caused by extentedspectrum and / or derepressed AmpC β-lactamase-producing
      Enterobacteriaceae, I. Balakrishnan, et al, 2011, the author faced two cases of Clostridium
      difficile with a positive toxin test. The first patient received three doses of Amoxicillin /
      clavulanic acid followed by one week's treatment with Temocillin. This one has developed
      Clostridium difficile diarrhea on the last day of antibiotic treatment. The second patient
      did not not received Temocillin in the 6 weeks prior to diarrhea but received 8 days of
      Meropenem just before this diarrhea. In all cases, Temocillin can not be clearly attributed
      to this adverse effect and no patient developed pseudomembranous colitis.
