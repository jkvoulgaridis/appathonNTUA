  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the impact of local compression by chest bandage on the number of seroma
      punctures in patients treated by mastectomy with or without lymphadectomy. Half of the
      participants will have local compression by chest bandage in addition to seroma punctures
      while the other half will only have punctures.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most common complication induced by mastectomy is seroma formation. This seroma is a
      serolymphatic effusion that is created in the days following surgery. Iterative puncture is
      the only treatment for seroma mentioned in the literature. A retrospective study in the
      investigator's establishment on 1800 patients determined that a second puncture greater than
      250ml is predictive of a chronicisation of punctures. The research hypothesis is that by
      applying local compression by chest bandaging with the Urgo® K2 kit, the &quot;dead space&quot; created
      by surgery would be removed. This would help resorb the seroma and reduce the number of
      punctures.

    <description>After the second puncture, the local compression by thoracic bandage will be put in place.
The system being effective 7 days, it will be left in place between each visit. A visit will be made for all patients 7 days after the installation of the device. However, if necessary, an intermediate visit may be carried out.
During these visits, a puncture will be made according to the criteria mentioned above. The bandage will be renewed after each visit.
The device will be removed after 15 days without indication of a new puncture. The patient will be seen again between 10 and 15 days after the bandage is removed for a final evaluation.</description>
