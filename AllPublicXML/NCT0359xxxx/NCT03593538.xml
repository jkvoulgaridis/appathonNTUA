  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of a medication called metformin
      (Glucophage®) on smoking behavior. This medication is FDA-approved for treatment of type-2
      diabetes. It is being used for research purposes in this study. Participants will be
      randomized to one of 3 treatment groups: low dose of metformin, high dose of metformin, or
      placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a need for novel approaches to optimize smoking cessation treatment to help more
      smokers quit. Mood disturbance and cognitive deficits during nicotine withdrawal may be
      important treatment targets given their association with smoking relapse. In addition,
      factors such as HIV-1 infection may exacerbate abstinence effects on mood and cognitive
      deficits thus increasing the probability of smoking relapse among HIV-infected smokers
      (HIV+), compared to HIV-uninfected smokers (HIV-). The investigators hypothesize that the
      FDA-approved medication, metformin, will attenuate withdrawal-related mood disturbance and
      cognitive deficits. This study will explore whether HIV status moderates these effects. Using
      a well-validated abstinence challenge paradigm, the investigators propose a
      placebo-controlled double-blind parallel arm study with one between-subjects factor of
      medication (low dose: 500 mg, high dose: 1500 mg, and placebo). Non-treatment seeking smokers
      (HIV-: n=54; 18 per group and HIV+: n=30; 10 per group) will complete this 23 day study.

The scale assesses eight DSM-IV items of nicotine withdrawal including: dysphoria or depressed mood, insomnia, irritability/frustration/anger, anxiety, decreased heart rate, difficulty concentrating, restlessness, and increased appetite/weight gain. Participants rate the intensity of their symptoms on the following scale: 0 = none, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe and a summary score will be calculated. Withdrawal is assessed using a &quot;past week&quot; time reference for all time points except the 24-hr testing visit on Day 23, which uses a 24-hr time reference.</description>

          4. For safety reasons, HIV-infected smokers taking dolutegravir (Tivicay) or drugs that
             contain dolutegravir (e.g., Triumeq) should not take more than 1000 mg of metformin

             the placebo condition or the low dose condition.

        Subjects will be instructed to refrain from using any study prohibited drugs/medications
        (both recreational and prescription) throughout their participation in the study. After
        final eligibility is confirmed, subjects who report taking contraindicated medication(s)
        over the course of the study period may only remain eligible if the Study Physician and/or
        Principal Investigator determines that the contraindicated medication(s) do/did not impact
        the study design, data quality, and/or subject safety/welfare. Subjects are permitted to
        take necessary prescription medications not included within the exclusion list during the
        study.

        General Exclusion:

          1. Current, anticipated, or pending enrollment in another research program over the next

             materials (e.g., intravenous urogram, intravenous cholangiography, angiography, and
             computed tomography (CT) scans with intravascular contrast materials) during the
             course of study participation.

          7. Inability to provide informed consent or complete any of the study tasks as determined
             by the Principal Investigator.
