  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common and serious post operative complication and may occur
      in up to 50% of all patients undergoing cardiac surgery and is associated with 8% mortality
      rate compared with 0.9% in non-affected patients and remains a major factor for post surgery
      adverse outcomes. Early interventions to prevent postoperative AKI can help decreasing
      morbidity and mortality in these patients. Using cardiopulmonary bypass during cardiac
      surgery triggers systemic inflammatory response and recruits pro-inflammatory cytokines such
      as tumor necrosis factor, interleukin -10 (IL-10) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) accompanying with
      production of free oxygen radicals which provokes oxidative stress in the milieu of ischemic
      reperfusion injury. Pentoxifylline as a non-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor, can
      suppress the production of some factors of inflammatory response and oxidative stress,
      probably prevent post surgery AKI with these mechanisms.

      This is a double blind randomized multicenter clinical trial, enrolling 100 consecutive
      patients undergoing elective Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery (CABG). Patients randomly
      and within concealment method divided into two groups, one to receive oral pentoxifylline 400
      mg every 8 hours from three days before surgery and the other group received placebo. All the
      intubation , surgery and weaning protocols were the same.
