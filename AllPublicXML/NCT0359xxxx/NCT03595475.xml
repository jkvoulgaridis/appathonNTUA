    <textblock>
      REM sleep behavior disorder (typical or 'idiopathic' RBD, iRBD) is a novel and distinct
      parasomnia characterized by recurrent dream enactment behaviours and polysomnographic
      features of loss of normal REM-sleep related muscle atonia, with a male predominance commonly
      occurring at the age of 60's. A majority of the patients with iRBD will eventually develop
      α-synucleinopathy (e.g., Parkinson's disease). On the other hand, growing evidence reveals a
      specific group of psychiatric patients demonstrating comparable clinical RBD features (pRBD)
      (e.g., abnormal REM-related electromyographic (EMG) activities) as found in typical iRBD, but
      with less male predominance occurring at the age of mid 40's to early 50's. Although recent
      findings from both cross-sectional and prospective studies have suggested that pRBD is likely
      to be a persistent parasomnia with close association with clinical and neuroimaging
      biomarkers related to neurodegeneration, the nosology of the development of RBD symptoms
      among patients with psychiatric disorders, notably major depressive disorder, remains unclear
      as to whether they are simply antidepressants related, or represent a part of the early phase
      of α-synucleinopathy neurodegeneration. Family studies on iRBD have confirmed a significant
      familial aggregation of iRBD with a higher rate of RBD cases and presence of prodromal
      neurodegenerative biomarkers (e.g. tonic EMG activity during REM sleep, constipation, and
      motor function impairments) of α-synucleinopathy neurodegeneration among first-degree
      relatives (FDRs) of patients with iRBD. Thus, the investigators propose this family study to
      examine the following hypotheses: 1) FDRs of patients with pRBD have a higher rate of RBD
      symptoms and its core features when compared to FDRs of controls with and without psychiatric
      disorders; 2) FDRs of pRBD are more likely to exhibit the features associated with prodromal
      markers of α-synucleinopathy neurodegeneration when compared with FDRs of controls with and
      without psychiatric disorders; 3) FDRs of patients with pRBD have a higher rate of
      α-synucleinopathy neurodegeneration when compared with FDRs of controls with and without
      psychiatric disorders. A total of 176 FDRs from each group (e.g., pRBD cases, psychiatric
      controls, and healthy controls) will be recruited to undergo a face-to-face clinical
      interview and a series of assessments on prodromal markers of Parkinson's diseases (as
      according to the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society research criteria)
      respectively.

      All FDRs with possible RBD and a subset of FDRs without possible RBD will be invited to
      undergo one-night video-polysomnographic assessment to confirm the clinical diagnosis of RBD
      and to assess the abnormal REM-related EMG muscle activities.

      REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a novel REM sleep parasomnia characterized by dream
      enacting behaviors and sleep-related injuries. Ample evidences have suggested that idiopathic
      RBD (iRBD) is a precursor of α-synucleinopathy neurodegeneration (e.g. Parkinson's disease,
      PD) in which dopamine dysfunction is one of the core pathophysiologies. In recent decade, our
      group has identified a cohort of patients with psychiatric disorders (mainly major depressive
      disorder, MDD) comorbid with RBD (pRBD). While there was a postulation that RBD symptoms in
      this psychiatric population may simply be side effects of antidepressant medication (by
      enhancing REM-sleep related muscle activity), accumulating evidence from case-control and
      prospective cohort studies suggested that pRBD is only partially explained by antidepressant
      usage and is better considered as a variant of typical iRBD in terms of comparable clinical
      presentation with typical iRBD and its close association with neurodegenerative markers.
      Nonetheless, more evidence is needed to substantiate that pRBD is a distinct diagnostic
      entity rather than a symptom secondary to antidepressant use. In this study, the
      investigators will employ genetic epidemiology approach to: 1) determine the familial genetic
      contribution; 2) search for biomarkers and endophenotypes; and 3) validate the diagnostic
      entity of a disease.

      This proposed study will enrich the limited scientific literature of the potential
      pathogenesis of pRBD and its relationship with α-synucleinopathy. In addition, the
      understanding of psychiatric disorders, notably MDD, is often limited by its heterogeneity.
      Our proposed study will, by determining the familial aggregation of pRBD, help us to identify
      certain subtype of the psychiatric populations who may likely harbour an underlying
      neurodegenerative basis. By using a family study design, a number of important aspects with
      regard to the pathogenesis of pRBD will be answered. First, if first-degree relatives (FDRs)
      of patients with pRBD have a higher rate of possible RBD or clinical diagnosis of RBD (as
      confirmed by video-polysomnography) as well as the presence of neurodegenerative diseases
      when compared with FDRs of controls, it will substantiate the argument that pRBD is not
      merely a side effect of antidepressants but rather harbouring a familial and genetic
      predisposition to RBD and, ultimately α-synucleinopathy neurodegeneration. Second, the
      determination of biomarkers of neurodegeneration among unaffected FDRs of patients with pRBD
      will also help to identify high-risk individuals for clinical intervention and prevention.
      Third, the calculation of heritability will help to delineate to which extent the additive
      genetic contribution is responsible for the variance of pRBD phenotypes. Finally, the
      findings from this proposed study will be compared with our on-going family study of typical
      iRBD to determine the extent to which iRBD and pRBD are similar or different to each other in
      terms of genetic and familial associations.

      In this proposed study, the investigators hypothesize that:

        1. FDRs of patients with pRBD have a higher rate of RBD symptoms and its core features
           compared with FDRs of controls;

        2. The unaffected FDRs of patients with pRBD are more likely to exhibit the features
           associated with prodromal markers of Parkinson's disease compared with FDRs of controls;

        3. FDRs of patients with pRBD have a higher rate of Parkinson's disease (and other
           α-synucleinopathy neurodegeneration) compared with FDRs of controls.

        In this study, we will employ a combination of family history (proxy report for
        unavailable/inaccessible subjects) and study (face-to face interview, clinical and sleep
        study) method in determining the familial aggregation of pRBD. The flowchart of subject
        recruitments is presented in Figure 1. The study subjects are the FDRs of pRBD cases,
        psychiatric controls and healthy controls. As previous studies have suggested that
        depression is a significant risk factor of development of Parkinson's Disease, we will
        include two control groups. First, those FDRs of patients with psychiatric disorders in
        addition to the FDRs of healthy controls (free of depression and RBD), in consideration of
        the potential associations of proband's psychiatric disorders with prodromal markers of
        Parkinson's Disease in the FDRs.
