  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational research study will evaluate medical gender affirmation delivered in
      primary care as an intervention to reduce disparities in HIV-related outcomes (e.g., low
      rates of PrEP uptake for HIV-uninfected patients, high rates of viral suppression for
      HIV-infected patients) for transgender patients in two urban federally-qualified community
      health centers.

    <textblock>
      This observational, longitudinal prospective cohort study will evaluate whether medical
      gender affirmation delivered in primary care improves HIV-related outcomes for transgender
      patients. Medical gender affirmation therapies—hormones and surgical interventions—are
      medically necessary treatments shown to improve psychological functioning and quality of life
      for transgender patients. It is not yet known whether these treatments improve HIV-related
      outcomes over time because studies providing the best evidence of medical gender
      affirmation's clinical effectiveness do not examine HIV-related outcomes in transgender adult
      patients. To fill this gap, the proposed study will prospectively evaluate the effects of
      medical gender affirmation delivered in primary care on HIV-related outcomes in a multi-site
      clinic-based cohort of 4,500 diverse transgender patients from two urban U.S. health centers
      who are leaders in transgender healthcare. Transgender adult primary care patients at Fenway
      Health in Boston, MA and Callen-Lorde Community Health Center in New York City, NY will be
      enrolled over 12 months and followed prospectively for 12 months. Bio-behavioral data will be
      linked, including electronic patient-reported outcomes (baseline, 6-month, 12-month
      assessments), and electronic health record (EHR) data.

    <ipd_description>De-identified IPD may be available to outside individuals by contacting the principal investigator (PI). The first will be after all of the baseline data is collected. The investigators will institute a concept plan process where internal study staff first have the availability to write primary papers or give presentations on particular topics. After this, if outside individuals wish to analyze data, the investigators may welcome this collaboration. A similar process will happen for outcome data; however this will not be possible until the publication and release of the outcome paper(s). Information regarding the availability of data for analysis will be listed on the PI's web page. Contact information for the PI will be listed in all manuscripts and publications as another means to access data.</ipd_description>
