  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug as a possible treatment for heparin induced
      thrombocytopenia (HIT) or Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (HITT).

      The drug involved in this study is apixaban.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved apixaban as a treatment
      option for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      HIT and HITT are common and severe complications of heparin therapy. Once patients are
      diagnosed with either one of these, they are typically switched to a non-heparin
      anticoagulant (a type of drug that thins your blood). As of now the only drug that is FDA
      approved for HIT or HITT is argatroban, which is administered continuously through an IV over
      multiple days and is extremely costly.

      In this research study, the investigators are researching the activity and tolerability of
      apixaban in participants with HIT or HITT. The investigators believe that apixaban will work
      just as well as argatroban and will be more convenient for this population. The oral route of
      apixaban allows for the potential outpatient treatment of HIT or HITT which is both
      convenient and less expensive than treatment with argatroban.

             of cytochrome P-450 3A4 or p-glycoprotein are ineligible. Because this list of these
             agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a
             frequently-updated list. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the
             patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents and what to do
             if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new
             over-the-counter medicine or herbal product.

             the near future.

             days prior to enrollment.

          -  In the judgment of the investigator, any disease or circumstance that would interfere
             with the objectives of the study.

          -  Participants with known brain metastases.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to apixaban.
