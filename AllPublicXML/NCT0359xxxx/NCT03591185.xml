  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fall prevention programs should include strength and balance training, home hazard assessment
      and intervention, vision assessment and referral and also medication review with
      modification/withdrawal. Evidence exists that a tailored exercise program can reduce falls by
      as much as 54%.

      Several studies recognize the benefits of the Otago Exercise Program (OEP) on physical
      functioning and falls reduction in older people. The program includes strength and balance
      exercises with a difficulty level progression by increasing weights and number of
      repetitions, in association with a walking plan.

      FallSensing clinical tool includes a software, a pressure platform and two inertial sensors.
      The software includes a range of exercises based on Otago Exercise Program, including
      warming, balance and strength exercises. The software allows that healthcare professional
      prescribes a tailored exercise program according to the individual needs. During exercise
      performance, pressure distribution can be analysed by the healthcare professional, providing
      real time feedback to the individual.

    <description>FallSensing clinical tool will be applied to a group of community-dwelling adults aged 50 years or over, including a initial evaluation, 24 intervention sessions (2 or 3 sessions per week) and a final evaluation.
Inicial and final evaluation consists in six functional tests (Grip Strength, Timed Up and Go, 30 seconds Sit-to-Stand, Step test, 4 Stage Balance test &quot;modified&quot; and 10 meters Walking Speed) and a questionnaire concerning self-efficacy for exercise.</description>
