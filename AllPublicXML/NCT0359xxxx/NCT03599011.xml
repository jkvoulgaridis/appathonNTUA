      - Assess gustatory thresholds among a sample of depressed Egyptian adults (age from 20 to 50
      years old) under anti-depressants therapy ( for at least 3 months) using filter paper
      disc(FPD) method through a scoring system. - Determine the taste intensity at supra-threshold
      among these patients using a psychophysical method through a scoring system. - Identify
      possible modulators for developing gustatory dysfunction among these patients using a
      questionnaire ( appendix) with a binary measuring unit (yes/no).

      PECO

        -  P Population: depressed Egyptian adults under anti-depressants therapy

        -  E1 Exposure 1: commonly prescribed tricyclic antidepressants (Imipramine, Amitriptyline,
           Clomipramine HCL)

        -  E2 Exposure 2: commonly prescribed Selective Serotonin Re-uptake inhibitors
           antidepressants ( Fluoxetine, Fluvoxamine, Sertraline, Citalopram, Paroxetine)

        -  C control (non exposure) : non-pharmacological treatment ( psychotherapy)

        -  O Outcome:

      Primary 1ry : Assess gustatory thresholds among a sample of depressed Egyptian adults (age
      from 20 to 50 years old) under anti-depressants therapy ( for at least 3 months) using filter
      paper disc(FPD) method through a scoring system.

      Secondary 2ry: - Determine the taste intensity at supra-threshold among these patients using
      a psychophysical method through a scoring system. - Identify gustatory dysfunction modulators
      among these patients using a questionnaire ( appendix) with a binary measuring unit (yes/no).

    <time_frame>during anticipated period of 6 months from January 2019 till June 2019</time_frame>
    <description>- C.M will assess the gustatory thresholds using filter paper disc method in which five concentrations of the substances will be used to test the four tastes: sweet, salty, sour and bitter and the concentrations of each taste shall be scored from disc number 1 (lowest) to number 5 (highest). - If the subject cannot detect the taste at the highest concentration, a score of 6 will be given. - The mean of three measurements for each test will be calculated.</description>

    <measure>Taste intensity at supra-threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>during anticipated period of 6 months from January 2019 till June 2019</time_frame>
    <description>- C.M will assess the taste intensity at supra-threshold level on a 9 point vertical labeled scale (extremely strong, very strong, strong, slightly strong, neutral, slightly weak, weak , very weak, extremely weak) in which subjects indicate the intensity perceived when tasting a substance</description>

    <measure>Gustatory dysfunction modulators</measure>
    <time_frame>during anticipated period of 6 months from January 2019 till June 2019</time_frame>
    <description>-C.M will use an assessment questionnaire (appendix) to assess possible modulators for developing gustatory dysfunction including a number of short-term and long-term factors such as body mass, gender, age, local and systemic diseases, excessive alcohol drinking, drug dependence, smoking, state of oral hygiene, consumption of some foods or drugs</description>

        Depressed Egyptian adults under anti-depressants therapy The patients will be recalled
        using their phone numbers recorded in their follow up records in order to come to the
        Diagnosis center at the faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University to be assessed for gustatory
        functions and will be given identification numbers and divided into three groups, to which
        the operator shall be blinded.
