  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 open label multicentre study of SHR9549 administered orally in patients
      with advanced estrogen receptor (ER) positive human epidermal receptor 2 (HER2) negative
      breast cancer. The study design allows an escalation of dose with intensive safety monitoring
      to ensure the safety of patients. The study will determine the maximum tolerated dose(MTD).
      In addition, expansion cohort(s) at potential therapeutic dose(s) in patients will be
      enrolled to further determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and biological
      activity of SHR9549.
