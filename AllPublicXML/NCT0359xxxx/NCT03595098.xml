  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the benefits and harms, and the neural and neurocognitive mediators of
      treatment response, in family-based cognitive behavioural therapy versus family-based
      psychoeducation and relaxation training in children and adolescents with obsessive compulsive
      disorder. The aim is to conduct this investigation in an optimal trial design with the lowest
      possible risk of bias.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder is the fourth most common psychiatric disorder, affecting 1-3%
      of children and adolescents globally. The recommended first-line treatment is cognitive
      behavioral therapy with exposure and response prevention. Yet, more than 40% of patients do
      not, or only partially, benefit from therapy. A better understanding of the mechanisms
      underlying response to cognitive behavioral therapy is needed to improve treatment. In the
      TECTO study, we will conduct a combined randomized clinical trial and longitudinal
      case-control study to elucidate how neural, cognitive, emotional, and neuroendocrine factors
      moderate and mediate treatment response. At baseline, 128 children and adolescents with
      obsessive-compulsive disorder will be compared to 128 healthy control participants to map
      neurobiological, cognitive, and emotional markers of obsessive-compulsive disorder. After
      baseline assessment, patients are randomly assigned to 16 weeks of either cognitive
      behavioral therapy with exposure and response prevention or an active control treatment with
      psychoeducation and relaxation training. This design allows us to test how factors that are
      specific to cognitive behavioral therapy (e.g. exposure and response prevention) contribute
      to observed treatment effects. Our primary outcome is OCD symptom severity measured with the
      Children's Yale-Brown Obessive-Compulsive Scale. Secondary outcomes are health-related
      quality of life and negative treatment effects. To detect neural and cognitive mediators of
      treatment, we will measure brain structure and function, and cognitive performance, at
      baseline and end-of-treatment. Furthermore, we will monitor a range of therapeutic,
      emotional, family, and neuroendocrine factors before, during, and after treatment. We expect
      that findings from TECTO will have important theoretical implications and will help refine
      our understanding of OCD as a heterogeneous and multidimensional disorder. Finally, we expect
      that our findings will contribute significantly to the improvement of psychotherapy and
      development of more targeted interventions for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder, which
      can minimize the use of medication, prevent chronicity, and reduce the substantial
      socioeconomic burden of the disorder.

    <measure>Change in Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, 4, 8, 16 and 40</time_frame>
    <description>Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) is a 10-item questionnaire assessing the severity of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Severity of compulsions and obsessions are rated on a scale from 0 (none) to 4 (extreme). The total score is calculated by summing the 10 individual scores and ranges from 0 to 40, where higher scores indicate more extreme symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 0, 4, 8, 16 and 40</time_frame>
    <description>The KIDSCREEN instruments assess children's and adolescents' subjective health and well-being- health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Questionnaire consisted of 52 items which assessed HRQoL in 10 dimensions: physical well-being, psychological well-being, moods and emotions, self perception, autonomy, relation with parents and home life, social support and peers, school environment, social acceptance, and financial resources. Rasch scores are computed for each dimension and are transformed into T-values with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10; higher scores indicate better HRQoL and well-being.</description>

    <measure>Occurrence of negative adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4, 8, 16 and 40</time_frame>
    <description>The occurrence of negative adverse events is assessed with the Negative Effects Questionnaire (NEQ). The questionnaire is used for both parental reports and self-reports. It consists of 32 items that are scored on a five-point Likert-scale (0-4) where the highest value represents a severe negative effect of the event. The questionnaire differentiates between negative effects that are attributed to the treatment and those possibly caused by other circumstances, as well as one open-ended question.</description>

    <measure>Family Accommodation Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4, 8, 16 and 40</time_frame>
    <description>This is exploratory outcome showing family factors. Family Accommodation Scale (FAS): a 13-item parent-report measure designed to assess accommodation of a child's OCD-related behaviors over the previous month. In an effort to assess multiple dimensions to accommodations (rather than one in isolation), items are anchored with respect to either frequency or magnitude utilizing a 5-pt Likert scale ranging from 0 (Never) to 4 (Daily) with higher scores indicating greater parental accommodation.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Family Environment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0</time_frame>
    <description>This is exploratory outcome showing family factors. Family Environment Scale (FES)is composed of 90 items and 10 subscales that measure actual, preferred, and expected family social environments. The 10 subscales assess three dimensions: relationship dimensions, personal growth (or goal orientation) dimensions, and system maintenance dimensions. There are three FES forms (real, ideal, and expectations); only the FES real form will be used, which examines a family member's perception of the family as it is. The scale ranges from 10 to 40, with a score of 10 being representative of no family conflict and a score of 40 being representative of the greatest magnitude of family conflict. Therefore, a decrease in score represents a decrease in self-reported family conflict.</description>

    <measure>Parental Stress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4, 8, 16 and 40</time_frame>
    <description>This is exploratory outcome showing family factors. Parental Stress Scale (PSS)measures parental stress in the parental relationship and consists of 18 items. The parent answers different statements about his or her relationship to the child by scoring each item on a five-point Likert-scale (1-5), 5 representing the highest amount of agreement with the statement and 1 representing the highest amount of dis-agreement. The positively formulated items are scored in reverse. PSS is thus scored on a scale from 18 to 90, where higher scores reflect greater stress.</description>

    <description>Family Based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (FCBT) focuses on the interrelation between thought, emotion, and behaviour, Exposure and Response Prevention, family involvement, homework assignments, and formulating of specific goals for the child. The important, active components is Exposure and Response Prevention. It involves exposing the child to a feared object, situation or thought, and preventing the child from carrying out compulsions to show the child that distress/anxiety can decrease or disappear without performing rituals.</description>
