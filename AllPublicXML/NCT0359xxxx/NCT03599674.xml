  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this research is to evaluate a new program designed to address basic
      human needs, create a safe and supportive environment for families, and help families build
      skills and confidence for navigating the health care system.

      Specifically, we aim to pilot test the feasibility and acceptability of the Targeted
      Inpatient Navigation (TNav) program for families of low income, minority hospitalized
      children.
