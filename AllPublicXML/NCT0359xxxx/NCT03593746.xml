  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes has become a widespread epidemic, primarily because of the increasing prevalence and
      incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D is a significant cause of premature mortality and
      morbidity related to cardiovascular disease, blindness, kidney and nerve disease, and
      amputation.

      Physical activity improves blood glucose control and can prevent or delay T2D, along with
      positively affecting lipids, blood pressure, cardiovascular events, mortality, and quality of
      life. At present, although physical activity is a key element in the prevention and
      management of T2D, the most effective exercise strategy (intensity, duration, and type of
      exercise) for improving glucose control and reducing cardiometabolic risk in type 2 diabetes
      has not been defined.

      Studies with Light-Emitting Diode (LED) therapy have demonstrated its ability to promote pain
      relief, improve muscle and cardiopulmonary performance, minimize muscle fatigue, and
      stimulate wound healing. In relation to patients with T2D, who have prolonged conditions of
      hyperglycemia, studies to investigate the impact of photobiomodulation associated with
      physical training have not been found so far.

      The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of different types of physical
      training associated with Light-Emitting Diode (LED) therapy on cardiometabolic status and
      quality of life in patients with T2D.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a significant health problem worldwide due to its high prevalence
      and mortality. It is chronic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from
      a relative deficiency in insulin through either reduced insulin secretion or reduced insulin
      action or both. The subsequent chronic hyperglycaemia causes glycation of tissues, which
      almost inevitably leads to acute disturbances in metabolism and long term end organ damage,
      especially the blood vessels, heart, and nerves, and severe health complications.

      Individuals with T2D have reduced aerobic fitness characterized by lower peak pulmonary
      oxygen uptake. Many potential mechanisms could explain this impaired response, for example,
      reduced muscle blood flow and capillary density, defects in muscular oxygen diffusion, and
      lower mitochondrial oxygen utilization and function.

      T2D is also associated with lower baroreflex sensitivity and abnormal chronotropic response,
      altering heart rate regulation. In addition, prolonged hyperglycemia in T2D causes a number
      of pathological changes in vascular endothelial cells, increasing the production of reactive
      oxygen species and inflammatory cytokines that cause mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative
      damage.
