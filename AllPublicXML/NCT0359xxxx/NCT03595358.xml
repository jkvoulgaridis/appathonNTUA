  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to validate the sensitivity and specificity of the Ellume
      Home Flu Test and the ellume.lab Flu A+B Test in detecting influenza A and influenza B as
      compared to reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)

      Secondary aims are to:

      Validate the sensitivity and specificity of the Ellume Home Flu Test and the ellume.lab Flu
      A+B Test in detecting influenza A and influenza B as compared to viral culture; Evaluate the
      participant's satisfaction with the convenience and ease of use of the Ellume Home Flu Test;
      Evaluate the participant's interpretation of the Ellume Home Flu Test results compared to the
      interpretation by site staff; Evaluate the operator's satisfaction and ease of use of the
      ellume·lab Flu A+B Test.

    <description>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT_PCR) is a molecular diagnostic technique for the detection and identification of influenza viruses, both for clinical samples and isolates. The Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) allows template viral RNA to be reverse transcribed producing complementary DNA (cDNA) which can then be amplified and detected.</description>
