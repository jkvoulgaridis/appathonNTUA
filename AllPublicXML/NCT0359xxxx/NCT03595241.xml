  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness of Burst DR stimulation as a treatment for persistent abdominal
      refractory visceral pain secondary to chronic pancreatitis. Abdominal pain is a main symptom
      in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Patients have a background constant pain with acute
      episodes needing admissions. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a recognised treatment for
      neuropathic pain. This involves placing an electric wire in the spine and the use of
      electricity to manage the pain. This is a pacemaker for controlling pain. Burst DR
      stimulation delivers a wave form which mimics the way nerves conduct electrical signals,
      there are short bursts or spikes of stimulation followed by short periods of rest. The key
      aims and objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy of Burst DR SCS as a treatment
      for persistent pain secondary to chronic pancreatitis

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female participants aged 18 years or older (no upper age limit) and willing to

          -  Participant is able and willing to comply with the follow-up schedule and protocol

          -  Participants diagnosed with persistent refractory visceral pain secondary to chronic
             pancreatitis for at least 6 months with or without dermal hyperalgesia or allodynia

          -  Minimum baseline pain score of 6 on eleven point NRS scale (0-10) for their visceral
             pain

          -  Previously tried and failed at least one conservative treatment for chronic pain
             including but not limited to pharmacological therapy, physical therapy and
             interventional pain procedures for persistent pain

          -  Been deemed suitable for the study by the pancreatic or pain MDT

          -  Total daily dose of opioids equivalent to ≤120mg of Morphine or 50% reduction in
             opioid dose. If the patients are taking more than this dose, they will be offered a
             referral to our opioid reduction clinic to achieve the target opioid dose and the
             baseline opioid will be taken as the dose on referral

          -  In the investigators opinion, the patient is a suitable candidate for Spinal Cord
             Stimulation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female participants of childbearing potential who are pregnant/nursing or plan to
             become pregnant during the course of the trial

          -  Escalating or changing pain condition within the past month as evidenced by
             investigator examination

          -  Sphlanchnectomy or radiofrequency treatment within the past 6 months

          -  Currently has an active implantable device including pacemakers, spinal cord
             stimulator or intrathecal drug delivery system

          -  In the investigators opinion has an active infection

          -  Participated in another clinical investigation within 30 days

          -  Medical co-morbidities that preclude surgical intervention

          -  Patient is incapable of understanding or operating the patient programmer handset

          -  Patient is morbidly obese (BMI ≥ 40)

          -  Participant has a current or previous condition, which will probably require MRI
             investigation sometime in the following 2 years

          -  Participant has had a spinal surgical procedure or has spinal pathology that would
             significantly impede lead implantation at the level planned for implantation

          -  Participant has another persistent painful condition other than persistent refractory
             visceral pain secondary to chronic pancreatitis.

          -  History of alcohol abuse in the last year or IV drug abuse in the last three years.

          -  No increases of more than 40% from baseline amylase and lipases
