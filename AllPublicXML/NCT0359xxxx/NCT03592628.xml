  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-cesarean delivery discharge instructions are not currently at an appropriate health
      literacy level. Enhancing discharge instructions with a visual aid did not improve scores on
      comprehension quizzes, either immediately or two-weeks post-discharge. However, participants
      preferred to have access to visual images with discharge instructions.

      Objective:

      To evaluate the effect of a visual aid on improving comprehension of hospital discharge
      instructions for cesarean wound care.

      Methods:

      A randomized control trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio and an intention to treat analysis was
      performed at an urban, tertiary care center from June-November 2017. Fifty English-speaking
      patients ages 18-50 who had undergone a cesarean delivery were randomized to receive either
      standard or enhanced discharge instructions regarding post-cesarean incision care. Enhanced
      instructions included a visual aid not present in the standard instructions. Participants
      completed a comprehension quiz prior to hospital discharge and again 2 weeks after discharge
      as well as the REALM literacy assessment prior to discharge.
