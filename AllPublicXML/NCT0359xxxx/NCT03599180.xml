    <textblock>
      Based on the research background and the preliminary research basis of the research group, in
      order to answer the material basis and micro-physical environment change characteristics of
      knee osteoarthritis sensitization acupoints and provide scientific basis for in-depth study
      of sensitization of acupoints. This study plans to use knee osteoarthritis as a research
      vehicle, and use microdialysis combined with high performance liquid chromatography to
      analyze the local material basis and key indicators of common sensitization points in knee
      osteoarthritis.

      This trial is a single-centre, normal controlled, parallel group, clinical trial. The trial
      is an explorative, pilot trial designed to reveal the change of the main material group in
      sensitized acupoints caused by knee osteoarthritis, and provide the key signal substance and
      its changing characteristics of knee osteoarthritis sensitized acupoints.
