  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The importance of physical activity and exercise-based interventions in neuro-orthopaedic
      rehabilitation is undisputed. Yet, patients and clinicians do not implement minimally
      required doses of physical activity in standard rehabilitation programs. This is partly due
      to intrinsic factors such as motivation, or due to physical condition that prevent any kind
      of exercise. In most cases, however, it is owed to limited time spent with therapists who
      would be able to supervise and apply the required doses to induce any potential exercise
      effects. Methods to semi-autonomously exercise with high motivation and continuous feedback
      would complement existing therapies and allow adherence to minimal dose recommendations.

      For this study, a prototype of a new portable training solution for intensive walking
      exercise with built-in sensor-technology and a smartphone interface will be tested regarding
      its usability and its efficiency in a clinical setting.

    <description>Participants will be asked to rate the perceived usability based on the System Usability Scale (SUS). SUS assesses perceived effectiveness (can users successfully achieve their objectives), information quality (how much effort and resource is expended in achieving those objectives) and general satisfaction (was the experience satisfactory). The SUS hast 10 items that can be rated on a 5-point likert scale. The items will be scored as follows:
For odd-numbered items, user response-1. For even-numbered items 5-user response. This scales all values from 0 to 4 (with four being the most positive response). Ref: Jeff Sauro, measuring usability
Add up the converted responses for each user and multiply that total by 2.5 (to convert the range of possible values from 0 to 100 instead of from 0 to 40).
single missing values are replaced with a neutral 3. Normative values will be used to grade the achieved median score (A through D, with D being least acceptable grade).</description>

    <measure>Usability: Assists</measure>
    <time_frame>3-4 weeks</time_frame>

    <description>The newly developed Tonefit Reha is based on the existing fitness device, the TONEFIT belt. Similar to Nordic Walking, the device aims to include upper limb activity in walking exercise to train the shoulder girdle and arm. While Nordic Walking uses poles, the existing TONEFIT belt uses body-worn resistance handles to actively involve the upper body. It is worn around the waist, like a belt. The two independent pull-push elements with non-adjustable resistance on each side allow increased intensity for strengthening and endurance training during walking, particular for upper extremities and trunk stability.</description>
