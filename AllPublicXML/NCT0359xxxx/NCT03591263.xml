  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes
      obstructed airflow from the lung, characterized by chronic cough, dyspnea, and sputum
      production, which often misunderstood as aging or catching a cold. These symptoms may be
      progressive over time. To provide better disease management and early detecting, pulmonary
      rehabilitation is now considered a fundamental component of the integrated disease management
      of this population. However, few studies have evaluated the beneficial outcomes in patients
      referred to pulmonary rehabilitation. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate
      the clinical outcomes in patients referred to pulmonary rehabilitation in National Taiwan
      University Hospital.

    <description>Hand grip strength is performed by using hand dynamometer</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Lung hygiene</measure>
    <time_frame>Lung hygiene is evaluated as the frequency of acute exacerbation in the the past one year</time_frame>
    <description>Lung hygiene is evaluated by the frequency of acute exacerbation</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Home-based physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Record the home-based physical activities everyday that the subjects have in the past one week that lasting for one year.</time_frame>
    <description>All subjects were encouraged to increase their daily physical activity and recorded the amount of physical activity on patient-self-record training log.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle strength: leg press</measure>
    <time_frame>Maximum leg press measurement needs about four minutes to complete</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum leg press is performed by using seated leg press machine</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Heart rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Hospital-based physical training takes 30 minutes, once a week, and it also takes 30 min to measure continuously</time_frame>

    <time_frame>It takes less than one minute to evaluate perceived dyspnea.</time_frame>
    <description>Rating of perceived dyspnea is measured by using Borg scale at rest, during hospital-based physical training, and home-based physical activity. The most widely used tool is the &quot;Borg scale&quot;, with rating ranges from 0 (nothing at all) to 10 (extremely dyspnea).</description>
