      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and the feasibility, and the success of
      engraftment of the introduction of Cal-1 gene-transduced haematopoietic cell populations (Ttn
      and HSPCtn) in patients with HIV-1-related high-risk lymphoma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Eligible subjects will undergo screening assessments at three time points:

          -  Screening 1 at the beginning of chemotherapy,

          -  Screening 2 (first &quot;check-point&quot;) after the harvest for CD34,

          -  Screening 3 (second &quot;check-point&quot;) before the ASCT procedure. Potential subjects must
             satisfy all of the inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study and proceed with the
             first apheresis (day -39).

        In-A. Prior to any study-related procedures, signed informed consent indicating that they
        understand the purpose, risks and procedures required for the study and are willing to
        participate in the study In-B. Individuals aged 18 to 60 years of age (inclusive) at time
        of consent In-C. Women with child-bearing potential must be on adequate effective
        contraception (continuous progestative contraception) In-D. Documented HIV-1 infection at
        or before the time of lymphoma diagnosis In-E. Treatment with antiretroviral agents
        (excluding NNRTI) introduced or optimized at the time of screening

        In-F. Biopsy-proven lymphoma meeting one of the following criteria:

                  plasmablastic lymphoma (after multidisciplinary consultation regarding the

               -  relapsed after initial complete remission

                  disease)

        confirmed in 2 successive blood samples) Ex-L. Evidence of chemoresistant lymphoma at
        screening 2 Ex-M. Any contra-indication to ASCT at any time during the pre-infusion period
        Ex-N. Participation in any study involving any investigational drug or medical device
        within 3 months prior to Screening 1 Ex-O. Receipt of a vaccine for HIV-1 or any gene
        transfer product at any time Ex-P. Subjects who will not accept transfusions of blood
        products Ex-Q. Pregnant or breast-feeding woman at any time Ex-R. Woman of child-bearing
