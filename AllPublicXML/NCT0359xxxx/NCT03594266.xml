      A BIOTRONIK wearable stimulator will be utilized in order to investigate the effects of two
      study spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapies on subject reported pain and paresthesia
      perception observed over 12 days of study stimulation testing following the conclusion of a
      successful SCS commercial trial.
