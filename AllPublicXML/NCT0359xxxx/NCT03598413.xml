  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bowel cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death in the UK, with 50,000
      new cases and over 15,000 deaths annually. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment and the most
      common complications are an infection of the wound or lungs. These can lengthen hospital
      stay, reduce the quality of life, and even increase the risk of death. Bowel cancer patients
      are often malnourished. Optimising nutrition with supplements such as fish-oils can improve
      the immune response of patients, helping prevent such complications, shorten hospital stay,
      improve quality of life and overall survival.

      Bowel cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death in the UK, with 50,000
      new cases and over 15,000 deaths annually. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment and the most
      common complications are an infection of the wound or lungs. These can lengthen hospital
      stay, reduce the quality of life, and even increase the risk of death. Bowel cancer patients
      are often malnourished. Optimising nutrition with supplements such as fish-oils can improve
      the immune response of patients, helping prevent such complications, shorten hospital stay,
      improve quality of life and overall survival. We are increasingly familiar with the term BMI,
      body mass index, which we use to categorise obesity in healthcare. A newer term in this realm
      is that of sarcopenia, a low muscle mass relative to your size, unrelated to your weight or
      fat density. This can be measured in a number of ways, including on a scan performed
      routinely in bowel cancer care, a CT scan. Evidence shows that people with low muscle mass,
      irrespective of their overall weight, experience more complications than those who have
      healthier amounts of muscle. We hypothesise that patients supplemented with fish oils both
      before and after surgery will experience an enhancement of their immune response, and
      subsequently encounter fewer infectious complications, a shorter length of hospital stay and
      improved quality of life. We also predict fewer patients having extra nutrition before and
      after surgery will develop sarcopenia and avoid the risks associated with that condition. The
      trial will only take place in those with bowel cancer who are planned to have a keyhole
      operation, as this is now the most commonplace approach to surgery. We plan to recruit 50
      patients, 25 to receive the supplement, and 25 to form a comparison or control group.

    <description>Quality of life questionnaire EORTC: QLQC30. A 30 element validated questionnaire. Symptoms are grouped into scales: Physical Function, Role Function, Emotional Function, Cognitive Function, and Social Function. In addition symptom scales including: Fatigue, Nausea, vomiting, pain, dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhoea, and financial difficulties. 28 of the scales range from 1 to 4, 4 being most symptomatic, 1 least so. The 2 remaining scales for overall health and quality of life are scaled 1-7, with 7 being the best and 1 the worst. The 30 questions can be combined for a global score, in which instance the 2 global scales are reversed so that 7 becomes the worst quality of life or health and 1 the best.</description>
