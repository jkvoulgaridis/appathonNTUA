      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of pralatrexate when given
      together with pembrolizumab and how well they work in treating patients with peripheral
      T-cell lymphomas that has come back after a period of improvement or has not responded to
      treatment. Pralatrexate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may
      help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor
      cells to grow and spread. Giving pembrolizumab and pralatrexate may work better in treating
      patients with peripheral T-cell lymphomas.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of a regimen combining pembrolizumab and pralatrexate
      in patients with relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL).

      II. Establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the
      combined pralatrexate and pembrolizumab regimen.

      III. Estimate the overall response rate (ORR) according to the Lugano Classification in
      patients treated with pembrolizumab plus pralatrexate at the RP2D.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the complete response (CR) rate according to the Lugano Classification duration
      of response (DOR), overall survival (OS) and progression‐free survival (PFS) in patients
      treated with pembrolizumab plus pralatrexate.

      II. Estimate the ORR and CR rate according to the International Harmonization Project
      response criteria.

      III. Evaluate responses and disease progression according to the Lymphoma Response to
      Immunomodulatory therapy Criteria (LYRIC).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Explore immunologic and genomic biomarkers of response to pembrolizumab plus pralatrexate
      therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of pralatrexate followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive pralatrexate intravenously (IV) over 3-5 minutes on days 1 and 8 and
      pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 24 months
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days, every 12
      weeks for 1 year, and then every 18 weeks thereafter.
