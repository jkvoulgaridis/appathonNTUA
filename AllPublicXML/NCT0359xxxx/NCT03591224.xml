    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial comparing pharmacogenomic guided versus standard pharmacist
      care to optimize antidepressant drug therapy. This study evaluates the effectiveness of
      pharmacists utilizing pharmacogenomic testing in the community pharmacy setting to help
      patients find the most appropriate drug therapy option(s) and minimize the risk of side
      effects in collaboration with prescribing physicians.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physicians and pharmacists have long been aware of subtle differences between patients in
      their responses to medications, but until recently did not have the tools to predict a
      patient's response to a drug before prescribing it. Many commonly prescribed medications are
      either ineffective or cause significant side effects for some patients. Individual variation
      in response to prescription drugs due to genetic factors (pharmacogenetics) is a substantial
      part of this serious clinical issue. Such variation in patient response ranges from failure
      to benefit from a drug, to adverse drug reactions, and drug-drug interactions when several
      drugs are taken at the same time. After years of uncertainty over the value of personalized
      medicine, recent studies show promising approaches for incorporating pharmacogenetics (PGx)
      data into routine patient care in order to reduce medication issues due to genetic factors.

      Over the last decades, clinical PGx research has made significant progress in defining which
      genetic variations are important for influencing inter-patient variability in drug response.
      Evidence-based consensus therapeutic guidelines for multiple drug-gene pairs are available
      and promoted by the Clinical Pharmacogenetic Implementation Consortium (CPIC). Although the
      primary focus of PGx testing has been on improving drug selection and dosing, a secondary
      benefit of testing is the improvement of medication adherence.

      GeneYouIn has developed the PillcheckÂ® drug response test that provides personalized insights
      on a patient's predicted response to medications. To implement the Pillcheck test, GeneYouIn
      is working with pharmacists who are adept in understanding pharmacogenetic terminology and
      can consult with prescribing physicians and patients within current scope of practice.
      GeneYouIn will provide educational seminars on the latest advances in pharmacogenetics and
      using the Pillcheck report.

      This demonstration project will provide critical education to clinical pharmacists to enable
      utilization of patients' pharmacogenetic data for evidence-base treatment optimization. The
      Pillcheck report has been carefully designed to make it easy to interpret and integrate in
      the clinical pharmacy setting. The study will provide insights on the impact of
      pharmacogenetics testing on solving Drug Therapy Problems.

      The Pillcheck test assesses variations in 14 genes responsible for drug transport and
      metabolism for over 140 commonly prescribed medications. The Pillcheck report can enable
      pharmacists to effectively identify Drug Therapy Problems and advise physicians on
      personalized treatment options thus allowing for more rational medication choices and/or
      dosing.

    <intervention_model_description>Enrolled subjects will be randomly assigned to either the control arm (pharmacist standard of care) or intervention arm (pharmacogenetic guided decision making by the pharmacist) in optimizing antidepressant drug therapy. Randomization is done by the primary investigator who isn't directly involved with patient consultations.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Participant, Care Provider)</masking>
    <masking_description>Patients are not told of their group assignment until the end of the study, at which point they would receive a copy of their pharmacogenetic report. The consulting pharmacist also does not have knowledge of the patient's group assignment in the first encounter for baseline data collection. Group assignment is only revealed to the pharmacist after two weeks when the pharmacogenetic report is available on the Pillcheck online portal. Patients assigned to the control group will have their report appear blank to the pharmacist, whereas the intervention patient group will have their full pharmacogenetic report accessible by the consulting pharmacist. Prescribers are also informed via fax briefly of the study protocol and asked to maintain blinding of their patient's group assignment.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Satisfaction with Medicines Questionnaire (SATMED-Q) - general measure of satisfaction to drug therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Change of score from baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This scale evaluates patient satisfaction of drug treatment for with any chronic disease. It's a brief, self-administer multidimensional generic questionnaire comprising 17 items. There are six categories of questions assessing satisfaction of (1) drug efficacy, (2) side-effects, (3) convenience of use, (4) medical care, (5) impact on activities of daily living and (6) general satisfaction. Scores of individual items range from 0=not at all, 1=a little bit, 2=somewhat, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much. A higher total score is an indication of greater satisfaction with drug therapy. Only scores from the side effects category would be summed as negative values. There is no recommended cutoff score, however is used to monitor the overall satisfaction to treatment over the period of the study.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) - measure/monitor the severity of depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Change of score from baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>PHQ-9 is a clinical evidence-based scale used to assess the severity of depression. There are nine diagnostic criteria for major depression based on the Diagnostic and Statistical 4th Ed. (DSM-IV) which are scored '0' (not at all), '1' (several days),'2' more than half the days, '3' (nearly every day). The nine items cover experience of pleasure, feeling down, sleep disruption, energy levels, appetite, feeling a failure, trouble concentrating, speaking slowly or being fidgety and having negative thoughts around suicide or self-harm over the previous 2 weeks. The total sum indicates depression severity: 0-4 none, 5-9 mild, 10-14 moderate, 15-19 moderately severe, 20-27 severe.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) - measure/monitor the severity of anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Change of score from baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evidence-based questionnaire used to monitor the severity of generalized anxiety. The GAD-7 score is calculated by assigning scores of '0' (not at all), '1' (several days),'2' more than half the days, '3' (nearly every day). Questions assess the tendency of feeling nervous, not being able to stop or control worrying, worrying too much about different things, trouble relaxing, being so restless that it's hard to sit still, becoming easily annoyed or irritable, feeling afraid as if something awful might happen. Total sums of 5, 10, and 15 represent mild, moderate, and severe anxiety, respectively.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sheehan Disability Scale - measure of functional impairment in work/school, social life, and family life</measure>
    <time_frame>Change of score from baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This scale assesses functional impairment using three 0 to 10 point visual analog scales. This can also be interpreted as percentages. Each of the three scales would have the patient represent how have their symptoms disrupted (1) work/school life, (2) social life, and (3) family life/responsibilities. The points from the 3 scales are summed as a global functional impairment score ranging from 0 (unimpaired) to 30 (highly impaired). There is no recommended cutoff score, however is used to monitor the response to treatment over the period of the study. In general, a score of 5 or greater on any of the three scales is associated with significant functional impairment.</description>
