  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed at determining if use of Cytal® Burn Matrix
      in the management of partial-thickness burns to the hand shows improved wound healing times
      when compared to EZ-Derm Porcine Xenograft.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single site, two arm, parallel-design randomized trial comparing Cytal® Burn Matrix to
      EZ-Derm® Porcine Xenograft, for patients with partial-thickness burns to the hand. Up to 60
      patients from a single center will be recruited and randomized (using a 1:1 randomization
      scheme) to receive either Cytal® Burn Matrix or EZ-Derm®. Scar formation, number of wounds
      requiring autografting, wound infections, rate of healing, hand function and impact of
      treatment will be compared between study arms. Additionally, a cost analysis and review of
      individual and group changes in narcotic prescription patterns and employment status will be
      evaluated. The protocol defined patient follow-up is 6 months.

      An independent biostatistician will review all participant data for power and futility
      analysis. In addition, a clinical events committee will adjudicate adverse events (AEs) and
      serious adverse events (SAEs)

    <description>Hand function measured by Michigan Hand Scale, Quick DASH and occupational therapy evaluation
MHQ measures overall hand function, activities of daily living, pain, work performance, aesthetics, and satisfaction. The score ranges from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) performances and satisfaction. Pain ranges from 0(no pain) to 100 (worst pain).
Quick DASH uses a 5 point Likert scale with 0(no disability) to 5(most severe disability) to measure disability/symptom and sport/music performance or work modules.</description>

    <measure>Impact of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain assessment using Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS) and inpatient length of stay. VAS measures subjective characteristics or attitudes regarding perceived pain levels from participants. Participants are asked to draw a vertical line on a 10 cm horizontal line indicating what their current pain level would be with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable. The distance between the start of the horizontal line to the vertical line is calculated in cm.</description>

    <description>Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADEs) between Group 1 and 2. AEs being any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in humans, whether or not considered intervention-related. SAEs being any suspected adverse reaction considered &quot;serious&quot; by the Investigator or Sponsor. UADEs being any serious adverse effect associated with the device that affects the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.</description>
