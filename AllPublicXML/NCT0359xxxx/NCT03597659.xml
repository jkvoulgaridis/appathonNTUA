      Performing a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) identifying clinical diagnoses
      associated with a polygenic predictor of Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels identified
      by a previously published genome-wide association study (GWAS). PheWAS will be applied in an
      electronic-health-record (EHR) cohort including North American (n: 37,154) and European
      participants using 1,318 phenotypes.

BioVU is VUMC's de-identified collection of patients whose DNA was extracted from discarded blood and linked to phenotypes through a de-identified EHR.
All subjects were born prior to 1990 and fell within 4 standard deviations for each of the first 2 principal components based on common single nucleotide variants (SNVs) for the subset of subjects self-identified as &quot;White, non-Hispanic&quot;.</description>
