  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases, which in most cases produce increased pressure within
      the eye (intraocular pressure or IOP). Over time, the elevated IOP causes damage to the optic
      nerve, which can then lead to visual loss and if unchecked, to complete blindness over the
      course of years. OMT has been shown to affect cranial structure physiology including the
      possibility of lowering IOP by improving the drainage of intraocular fluid. This randomized
      study is designed to obtain data to evaluate the effect of OMT on IOP lowering and, if
      supportive, provide preliminary data for larger clinical trials.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The design of this preliminary pilot trial to be conducted is a double-masked (blind),
      randomized, No Treatment-controlled, parallel group design to determine the IOP-lowering
      efficacy and safety of a single osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) on intraocular
      pressure (IOP) in un-medicated confirmed ocular hypertensive (OHT), glaucoma suspect, or
      subjects who have been diagnosed with glaucoma but who have gone through a medically
      supervised medication washout period or 4 weeks.

      Potential subjects responding to recruitment who are currently on IOP lowering medication
      will be prescreened and if interested in proceeding will undergo a 4 week medication washout
      period. Potential subjects not on IOP lowering medication will proceed directly to the
      Baseline screening visit.

      All subjects will be seen for a Baseline Screening Visit followed by a second Baseline
      Enrollment Visit, during which subjects must satisfy all inclusion criteria and their IOP
      must qualify in at least one (1) eye, the same eye, at all time points. Qualified subjects
      will be scheduled for a Study Day 3 Visit. Subjects whose IOP still qualifies at the Visit 3
      time point will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive OMT or No Treatment followed by IOP
      measurements and +7.5 HR (4 PM [± 1 hour]) post-OMT or No Treatment. Follow-up visits will be
      conducted at Visit 4 (1 day following OMT vs No Treatment), and Visit 5 (1 week following OMT
      vs No Treatment). Both Visit 4 and Visit 5 will have IOP measured twice.

    <description>Osteopathic manipulation involves a number of different manual (hands-on) techniques. These include muscle inhibition (applying pressure to a muscle to induce relaxation); myofascial release (applying pressure to the fascia and moving it toward/away from a strain); muscle energy stretch (contraction of a stretching muscle); counterstrain (shortening a strained muscle); facilitated positional release (moving a vertebra into a restriction and applying a gentle compression); osteopathy in the cranial field (balancing the cranial tissue); balanced ligamentous tension/ligamentous articular strain (moving a joint into ease to release tension in the ligament); one or all of these techniques may be used. Participants will be positioned on an exam table supine, seated, lateral decubitus, prone, or in their position of greatest comfort for the procedure.</description>
