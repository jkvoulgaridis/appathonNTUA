  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the role of flexible bronchoscopy in the pre-operative workup of
      ground glass opacity featured lung cancer. All enrolled patients receive the flexible
      bronchoscopy examination before surgery. Investigators observe the intra-bronchial findings
      of bronchoscopy and the impact of these findings on established surgical plan.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The appropriateness of routine use of bronchoscopy in the operative workup of a solitary
      pulmonary nodule（SPN） is debatable. Options expressed in the literature vary from routine
      preoperative bronchoscopy having no role in obtaining tissue diagnosis in small SPNs to it
      begin very useful in determining underlying etiology and surgical strategy. The American
      College of Chest Physicians（ACCP）guidelines recommend bronchoscopy only if air-bronchogram is
      present or if operator has expertise with newer guided techniques. Previous study showed that
      bronchoscopy is not indicated in SPNs that present with ground-glass opacity on CT. The
      purpose of this analysis is to define that role by examining in GGO patients
      （1）intra-bronchial findings （2）impact of these findings on established surgical plan.

    <intervention_model_description>We hypothesized incidence rate that bronchoscopic findings would have changed the rate of established surgical plans as less than 2.0% (P0), then preoperative bronchoscopy examination would have limited impact on the surgical plan for GGO featured lung cancer; If bronchoscopic findings would have changed the rate of established surgical plans as more than 4.0% (P1), then bronchoscopy examination would be regarded as one routine preoperative work-up. Null hypothesis: H0: P≤P0; Alternative hypothesis: HA: P ≥ P1. α = 0.05, 1-β = 0.9. Using Simon's two-stage approach, the first phase enrolled 612 patients. If ≥18 patients supported the alternative hypothesis, they entered the second phase, otherwise the trial was terminated; the second phase enrolled 451 patients. If the patient number who eventually changes the surgical plan is ≤27, the null hypothesis is accepted, that preoperative bronchoscopy examination would be unnecessary for GGO featured lung cancer.</intervention_model_description>
