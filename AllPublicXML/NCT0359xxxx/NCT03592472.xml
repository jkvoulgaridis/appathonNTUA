  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of pazopanib plus
      abexinostat versus pazopanib plus placebo in patients with locally advanced unresectable or
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized, Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients will be
      randomized 2:1 to receive either a combination of pazopanib plus abexinostat or pazopanib
      plus placebo. At the time of disease progression, patient treatment assignment will be
      unblinded, and those patients randomized to the pazopanib plus placebo treatment arm will
      have the option of crossing over to receive treatment with a combination of pazopanib plus
      abexinostat. After providing written informed consent, patients will be screened for study
      eligibility within 28 days before their first dose of study drug. After screening
      assessments, patients who are eligible for inclusion in the study will be randomized and
      receive their first dose of study drug on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1), within 7 days of
      randomization. A treatment cycle is 28 days in length. Patients may continue to receive study
      drug until any of the following events: the development of IRC-verified radiographic
      progression as assessed by RECIST version 1.1, clinical disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity, another discontinuation criterion is met, withdrawal of consent, or closure of the
      study by the sponsor. No maximum duration of therapy has been set.

             Screening is not required unless clinically indicated.

          -  Has an additional malignancy requiring treatment within the past 3 years. Patients
             with the following concomitant neoplastic diagnoses are eligible: non-melanoma skin
             cancer, carcinoma in situ, and non-muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma.

          -  Poorly controlled hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 or diastolic
             blood pressure ≥ 100 mmHg. Use of anti-hypertensives and rescreening is permitted.

          -  A new pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis diagnosed within 3 months prior to
             randomization.

          -  Has a QTcF interval &gt; 480 msec.

          -  New York Heart Association Class III or IV congestive heart failure.
