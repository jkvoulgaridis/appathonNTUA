  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent evidence has shown that obese and overweight children exhibit states of chronic
      inflammation. In obese adults, a high carbohydrate meal induces an inflammatory response;
      however, the effects of a high carbohydrate meal on biomarkers of inflammation has not
      previously been examined in children. The purpose of this research project is to characterize
      the inflammatory response to a high carbohydrate versus a low carbohydrate meal in healthy
      weight, overweight, and obese children (age 7-17 years). After completing informed
      consent/assent, a Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scan, and baseline blood draw on
      experimental day 1, children will then return to the lab two times to ingest either a high or
      low carbohydrate beverage followed by post-meal blood collection for a total of 3 blood
      draws. Biomarkers of inflammation will be analyzed by flow cytometry and enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Participants will be recruited through various studies through
      the Neurocognitive Kinesiology Lab/Body Composition and Nutritional Neuroscience Labs as well
      as through the local Champaign-Urbana community. Data from this project will provide a better
      understanding of the inflammatory response to different meals in healthy weight, overweight,
      and obese children.
