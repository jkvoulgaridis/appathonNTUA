      The purpose of this phase II study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety in TG-2349
      combination with DAG181 (± Ribavirin) in treatment naïve subjects with chronic hepatic C
      virus genotype I infection. Approximately 132 subjects will be enrolled in this study and
      divided into six groups:

      Group 1 to 4: Chronic hepatics C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infected, treatment naïve,
      non-cirrhotic subjects.

      Group 5 to 6: Chronic hepatics C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infected, treatment naïve, cirrhotic
      subjects.
