  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will prospectively measure the effectiveness of a core strengthening program on
      reducing the inter-rectus distance (IRD) and abdominal wall muscle contraction in postpartum
      women with diastasis rectus abdominus (DRA). Additionally, this study will aim to investigate
      and clarify the association between IRD and low back pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DRA is a separation of the abdominal wall muscles that commonly occurs during pregnancy and
      is caused by the stretching of the linea alba to accommodate a growing fetus. Separation of
      core muscles is thought to be factor in postpartum low back pain, stress urinary
      incontinence, and core strength, as well as being cosmetically undesirable. This study will
      evaluate the effect of a core strengthening program on shortening the IRD and improving the
      connectivity and strength of abdominal wall muscles in postpartum women with a DRA. It will
      also investigate the relationship between IRD and low back pain.

    <description>All subjects will participate in the study for a total of 24 consecutive weeks. During the first 12 weeks, subjects will participate in weekly online exercise classes for Core Muscle Strength training and will be asked to perform daily homework assignments. Following completion of the 12-week intervention, subjects will be asked to continue the exercises on their own.</description>

    <description>All subjects will participate in the study for a total of 24 weeks. During the first 12 weeks, subjects will serve as the control group, and they will be advised to continue their baseline level of exercise and lifestyle. During the subsequent 12 weeks, subjects will participate in the exact same program as Group A performed during the first 12 weeks (Core Muscle Strength Training).</description>
