  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers propose to study how functional nausea in adolescents may be characterized
      noninvasively by the use of multichannel electrogastrogram (EGG) and magnetogastrogram (MGG)
      recordings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional nausea (FN) is a GI disorder that affects millions of Americans, particularly
      adolescents, but diagnoses remain largely exclusionary relying on symptomology with an
      otherwise normal diagnostic workup.

      Successful completion of the project could contribute to understanding the altered physiology
      of functional nausea (FN), to stratification of FN patients according to physiological and/or
      psychological phenotypes, to improve diagnosis and provide objective measures of nausea and
      to inform and guide treatment options.

      The analysis of slow wave activity represents the first physiologically-quantifiable
      noninvasive assessment method for pathological processes associated with functional nausea in
      adolescents.

    <description>Determine if there are differences in the slow wave activity in healthy versus disease stomach in the pediatric population. The percentage of normal slow waves (PNSW) will be used for comparison. PNSW is computed as the relative time of recording containing slow waves with a dominant frequency between 2-4 cpm from centrally-located EEG and MGG channels.</description>
