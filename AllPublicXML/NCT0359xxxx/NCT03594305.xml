  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a cluster randomized trial to determine the effectiveness of
      an educational intervention for religious leaders in promoting uptake of family planning in
      Tanzania.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this community randomized trial, the investigators will randomize 12 rural villages to
      receive an educational seminar for their religious leaders about family planning. The
      investigators will compare these uptake of family planning in these 12 villages with 12
      matched villages whose religious leaders do not attend an educational seminar about family
      planning. The investigators will also determine women's reasons for seeking family planning
      at the village dispensaries..

      Prior to the start of the trial, the study team will ensure that dispensaries in all villages
      in the trial will have a reliable supply of contraceptive options. To mitigate the effect of
      economic barriers and medication shortages on access to contraception, a dedicated medication
      supply team will make certain that all dispensaries remain well-stocked with standard
      contraceptives that are free from the Tanzanian Ministry of Health. These include oral
      contraceptive pills, implants, injections, copper intrauterine devices, and condoms.

      Villages will be paired by proximity (within 50 kilometers of one another). Within the pair,
      one village will be randomly assigned, using a computer-generated algorithm, to receive the
      intervention of religiously- and culturally-informed teaching intervention about family
      planning for religious leaders. The other village will be the control village. Each
      intervention village will be followed, and its religious leaders mentored in groups, for 12
      months after the start of the intervention. Mentorship groups of 25 leaders, led by the study
      team, will meet for 1 hour per month. The investigators will also conduct focus groups in
      both intervention and control villages to understand community perceptions of family
      planning.

    <description>Villages randomized to this arm will receive a one-day educational seminar, which their religious leaders of all denominations will be invited to attend. The seminar will address religious, cultural, and medical aspects of family planning. Leaders who attend will also have the opportunity to participate in mentorship group discussions after the intervention. In addition, both villages will have standard teaching provided by nurses at dispensaries about family planning, and a continual supply of contraceptive options at dispensaries in all villages will be ensured.</description>
