    <measure>Reproducibility of CBC parameters provided by the OLO device</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Reproducibility studies will be conducted using 3 levels of commercial control materials (low, normal and high) to measure all CBC reported parameters. Control material will be run on two instruments at each site. Standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV) will be calculated for each measurand for: (1) Between lots/sites; (2) Between instruments; (3) Between days; (4)Between operators/runs; (5) within-run and (6) total variability</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Repeatability of CBC parameters provided by the OLO device</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Performance of the OLO device will be measured through repeatability of 20 replicates for 11 residual samples on each site. Samples collected for this study will include 4 within lab reference range, 3 around lower medical decision levels for HGB, PLT and WBC, and 4 around the upper range for RBC, HGB, WBC and PLT to cover all pathological levels and medical decision points. Standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV) will be computed for each measurand per sample by site.</description>

    <measure>Sample Matrix Comparison</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Paird capillary and venous whole blood samples will be collected. The samples will be analyzed in duplicate on the Sight OLO device. Analysis will include Passing-Bablok Regression analysis per parameter (Bland Altman plots, slope, intercept, with 95% confidence intervals, correlation coefficient, and % bias), between: The average of venous whole blood samples scans and average of capillary whole blood sample scans from the same individual on the Sight OLO device</description>

    <measure>Method Comparison</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the performance of the OLO device in comparison to values achieved with the predicate. Analysis will include Regression parameters (slope, intercept with 95% CI) between measurement of Sight OLO and measurement on predicate (Correlation coefficient, Bland Altman plots and overall % bias between predicate and Sight OLO device including % bias at medical decision points).</description>

    <measure>Reference Interval Range</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Establish adult venous and fingerprick reference intervals for the OLO device. The non-parametric method will be used to calculate the lower and upper limits of the reference range.</description>
