  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center randomized trial that seeks to determine if the use of an automated
      real-time electronic medical record Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) risk score can improve patient
      outcomes through the use of an early standardized nephrology focused intervention.

    <description>The primary endpoint of interest, change in serum creatinine (SCr), is the peak change from study entry in SCr level over a 7-day interval. The change in SCr is defined as the maximal change in creatinine over this interval, and aim to detect a clinical difference in change in SCr between the SOC and ENC treatment groups.</description>

    <description>The differences will be measured by treatment group in the proportion and time to event of patients who a) develop &gt; Stage 2 AKI, b) require renal replacement therapy (RRT), c) undergo intensive care unit (ICU) transfer, and/or d) require non-research nephrology consult.</description>

    <description>The electronic risk prediction algorithm (ESTOP-AKI) will interface with electronic medical data to determine the likelihood for the patient to develop AKI. Early Nephrology Consult (ENC) will be implemented. A nephrologist will assess the subject and consult with their care team to advise a treatment plan during the hospitalization.</description>
