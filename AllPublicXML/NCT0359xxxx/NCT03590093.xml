    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare surgical treatment of periodontal infrabony defects with
      and without the adjunct of an enemal matrix derivative (EMD) in terms of acute-phase
      responses, in systemic healthy patients.

    <description>After local anesthesia injection an intrasulcular flap is designed according to minimally invasive techniques. After flap elevation, careful removal of granulation tissues from the periodontal defects is performed. Scaling and root planing of the involved dental roots is ensured and finally suture is placed.</description>
