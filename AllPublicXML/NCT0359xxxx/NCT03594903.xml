    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a video intervention, which was
      designed to improve therapy expectation of persons with critical attitudes towards
      psychotherapy via violating their expectations about therapy. Therefore, 120 participants
      will be recruited and randomized to two groups:

      (1) An experimental group that is watching a video with patients (actors) that are giving
      oral information about their therapy and the mostly positive therapy outcome, (2) a control
      group that is watching a video with the same patients before therapy or after the first
      therapy session who are giving information about symptoms and their expectation on therapy.
      The primary outcome is the Milwaukee Psychotherapy Expectation Questionnaire (MPEQ) collected
      before and after the video.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Therapy expectation is one of the main predictors of therapy outcome. This could be shown
      through many results in the medical sector as well as in studies that are focusing on
      psychotherapeutic interventions across different mental disorders. Although psychotherapy is
      a successful treatment for many disorders it is still hold in low esteem by some parts of the
      population and from some patient groups in particular. This can cause (that) patients who are
      in need of treatment not being recommended to the right therapy. Furthermore patients with
      low therapy expectation are more likely to (prematurely) abandon their therapy or having a
      lower therapy outcome. So therapy expectation should definitely be addressed in the very
      first therapy sessions because of it´s high impact.

      The Violex-model gives an overview on how expectations in general are developed, maintained
      or modified. The model postulates that a process called immunization can lead to maintenance
      of expectation even if they receive information that contradicts their expectation. However
      no trial has yet examined weather the suggestions of the model are adaptable to therapy
      expectation. Therefore the investigators are recruiting participants with critical attitudes
      towards psychotherapy and trying to provoke expectation violation via an online experiment
      containing videos with patients reporting about their mostly positive outcome of
      psychotherapy. A control group is watching a video with patients who are just giving
      information about their symptoms and their first impressions on psychotherapy. The primary
      outcome is the Milwaukee Psychotherapy Expectation Questionnaire (MPEQ) collected before and
      after the video. Furthermore the participants are asked about their attitudes towards
      psychotherapeutic treatment (QAPT, German Version FEP), their own experience with
      psychotherapy and experiences of relevant others, behavioral intensions towards seeking
      psychotherapy, their mental wellbeing and demographic data. Before watching the video
      participants are also asked to formulate one to three individual expectations on
      psychotherapy. After watching the video they are asked how much they still believe in their
      individual expectation.

      The investigators are aiming to modify low therapy expectation by generating expectation
      violation and paying particular attention to the issue of persistence of expectations via
      having a closer look on possible immunization strategies. For doing so they developed
      immunization items (data- and construct-orientated) that are shown at the end of the
      experiment.

    <description>The investigators asked experts (psychotherapist and scientists in the area of clinical psychology) about typical therapy expectation violations in therapy and searched the literature for information about typical therapy processes and outcomes. Having these information they designed a script for the experimental video. The patients in the video are played by actors aged from 28 to 58 years (two male and two female actors). Patients are representing common mental disorders (depression, anxiety disorder, alcohol addiction, depression after physical disease). The abbreviated name, age and disorder of the patients is displayed for 3 seconds in the video. The patients are giving information about the mostly positive outcome and the process of their therapy. All participants are watching a video with all patients (7 minutes). The videos (control and experimental group) have been evaluated by 12 experts (psychotherapist and scientists in the area of clinical psychology).</description>
