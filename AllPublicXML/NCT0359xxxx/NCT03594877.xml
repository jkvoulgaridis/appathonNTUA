    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of dietary supplement consisting of sublimated mare milk on
      intestinal microbiota among psoriasis and healthy participants.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The gut microbiome is believed to play an important role in the immune system regulation,
      since intestines are the largest lymphoid organ in a human body. Deviations from healthy
      composition of intestinal flora are associated with various diseases including allergy and
      autoimmunity. Psoriasis is the one of the long-lasting autoimmune diseases that is
      characterized by patches on the skin and further health complications throughout the life.
      However, lack of studies does not allow proper evaluation of role of gut microbiome in
      psoriasis patients. Therefore, potential interplay between gut microbiome and immune system
      in psoriasis would be studied in this clinical trial. Particularly, the investigators
      hypothesize that sublimated mare milk supplement can have an impact on gut immune system and
      gut microbiome composition in the psoriasis patients.

      In this trial, there will be two parallel groups: crossover psoriasis patients (standard
      treatment first for 3 months, next 3 months standard treatment plus sublimated mare milk
      supplement) and healthy volunteers group. Subsequently, association of intestinal flora with
      immune status will be analyzed and compared between these groups.
