      The PAPRICA implementation trial aims to test the efficacy of an educational intervention
      about HPV vaccination and targeting general practitioners in Lyon

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PAPRICA study aims to test if an intervention directed to General Practitioners (GP) to
      train them in methods for recommending HPV vaccine with greater confidence and efficiency is
      effective to increase HPV vaccination coverage in France. As each health professional is
      associated in France to a specific reference number i.e. &quot;RPPS number&quot;, RPPS numbers for all
      General Practitioners (GP) from the city of Lyon will be randomly allocated either to the
      intervention arm or to the control arm to ensure that each arm contains 50% of the total
      number of GPs. After allocation, GPs in the allocation arm will be identified and invited to
      attend the intervention i.e. a 3-hour workshop at IARC in the presence of HPV vaccination
      specialists. The effect of the intervention on the HPV vaccination coverage in Lyon will be
      measured through HPV vaccines reimbursement data extracted from the Inter-Scheme National
      Information System within the National Health Insurance System (SNIIR-AM : Système National
      d'Information Inter-Régimes de l'Assurance Maladie ). Linkable data between girls and General
      Practitioners (GP) via RPPS numbers will allow us to allocate girls either in the
      intervention or the control arm. Vaccination coverage will be estimated within each of these
      cohorts.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessing change from baseline HPV vaccination coverage of Lyon's girls aged 11-14 obtained by the GP from the intervention arm at 18 months after the intervention (increase in number of vaccinated girls as assessed by questionnaire in the study cohort)</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The French SNIIRAM (Système national d'information inter-régimes de l'assurance maladie) database will be used to calculate a proxy of HPV vaccination coverage. SNIIRAM contains anonymous and individualized data for all health expenditure claims in France. Data related to HPV and DTP (Diphtheria,Tetanus, Pertussis) vaccines prescribed by GP from Lyon will be extracted from SNIIRAM for girls aged 10-14. These data will be assigned either to the intervention or control arm by linkage with GP's ID DTP booster coverage, which is stable overtime and very high in France (92%), will be used as a control.</description>

    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>GP's attitude and knowledge towards HPV vaccination will be assessed before and 1 month after the intervention through a specific questionnaire designed to measure GP's knowledge and beliefs upon HPV vaccination.</description>

    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Parents and girls whose GP are in the intervention arm will be interviewed 18 months after the intervention to assess whether or not their attitude towards HPV vaccination has changed. Parents and girls whose GP are in the control arm will be used as control.</description>

    <ipd_access_criteria>(1)Data from RPSS and SNIIRAM databases and data originated from original data analysis: All data will be stored in encrypted and password-locked files at IARC, while transmission of information via electronic means will be performed using encrypted data files. Measures ensuring confidentiality of personel data will be used. (2) Data generated from GPs: Data collected from questionnaires and focus groups will be anonymous, aggregated and no linkage between GP's opinion and attitude about vaccination and identity will be possible. Data will be kept and used according to the Data Protection Act (DPA). The Data Protection Act (DPA) of 1978 (revised in 2004) is the main law protecting data privacy in France. Data from GPs will be stored in encrypted and password-locked files at IARC. Only anonymised data will be transferred to IARC external collaborators.</ipd_access_criteria>
