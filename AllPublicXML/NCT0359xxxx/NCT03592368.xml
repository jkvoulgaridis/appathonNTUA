  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hostile interpretation bias may be a feature of severe, chronic irritability in children, one
      of the most common psychiatric symptoms of childhood. Interpretation bias training (IBT) is a
      computer-based training program that may reduce irritability in youths. This trial lays the
      groundwork for a test IBT on irritability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial lays the foundation for a preliminary test of efficacy of IBT on irritability by
      establishing IBT's neurocognitive treatment targets: hostile interpretation bias and response
      in the neural threat-learning system.

      The design is a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial of IBT on its targets. The study
      will have four arms, with 25 participants in each arm for all four conditions of training
      (active versus sham) and scanning (in MRI or out of MRI scanner). During IBT, participants
      judge as happy or angry facial expressions which are on a continuum between happy and angry.
      The point at which judgments shift from predominantly happy to angry on this continuum is the
      indifference point. During training feedback encourages no change in the indifference point
      or a change in the indifference point towards more happy judgments of ambiguous faces. A
      shift in indifference point towards more benign judgments is interpreted as a reduction in
      hostile interpretation.

      The design will test whether active relative to sham IBT shifts the indifference point
      towards more benign judgments. Neural response to active versus sham IBT will be measured in
      half the sample.

    <time_frame>Up to one day before and after the single 1 day training session of Interpretation bias training session.</time_frame>
    <description>Interpretation bias is measured by the indifference point of happy-angry judgments of a continuum of morphed images between happy=1 to angry=15 facial expressions. Lower indifference points indicate a higher bias towards hostile (or angry) judgments. Change in interpretation bias is the difference between the post- and pre-IBT indifference points.</description>

    <description>Amygdala functional connectivity to ventromedial prefrontal cortex is measured by covariance in fluctuations in blood oxygen-level dependent signal between these regions during functional magnetic resonance imaging during the course of training. These fluctuations are expected to be significantly modulated by interpretation bias training.</description>
