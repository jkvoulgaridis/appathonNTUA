      Objective: To examine the effects of a structured advance care planning (ACP) guide among
      patients with advanced illness in hospital care setting.

      Methods: This is a 24-month stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial to be conducted
      in the Department of Medicine in an acute hospital. Patients are eligible to the study if
      they are aged 18 or over, are communicable, and meet the indicators of health deterioration
      or advanced condition in the Supportive and Palliative Care Indicators Tool (SPICT). Ward
      nurses will be trained to be interventionists to conduct ACP by means of a structured ACP
      guide. The guide is adapted from a culturally sensitive ACP programme developed in the local
      context with reference to the format of the Serious Illness Communication Guide, which is an
      evidence-based best practice in end-of-life care communication to support the ACP process.

      Main outcome measures: Data will be collected at baseline (T0), one week (T1), three months
      (T2) and six months (T3) after intervention. The primary study outcome is the documentation
      of ACP discussion in medical records and completion of advance directives. Secondary outcomes
      are communicating end-of-life care preferences with family carers, quality of life and
      concordance of care preferences and treatment provided.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advance care planning (ACP) is defined as a communication process among patients, their
      family members and healthcare providers about end-of-life care, before the patients lose
      their capacity to decide for themselves. The main purpose of this study is to embed ACP into
      the usual care process in acute hospital setting through building staff capacity to conduct
      ACP. This will be a 24-month stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial, with
      randomization built into the phasing of intervention implementation. This crossover design
      enables all study venues sequentially switched from control to experimental. This study will
      be conducted in all eight wards of the medical department of an 800-bed acute hospital. The
      ACP in this study is a facilitator-based intervention with a structured communication guide
      as a tool to aid the interventionists in broaching end-of-life care issues and eliciting
      patients' values and preferences in a consistent manner. The primary study outcome is the
      documentation of ACP discussion in medical records. Secondary outcomes are communicating
      end-of-life care preferences with family carers, quality of life and concordance of care
      preferences and treatment provided. Data collection will be conducted at baseline, one week,
      three months and six months after intervention.

    <description>The ACP guide is adapted from the Serious Illness Communication Guide and a culturally-sensitive ACP programme developed in the local context. The trained ACP facilitators will initiate the conversation by introducing the concepts of ACP with the support of the guide and assessing the patient's illness understanding and readiness to think about end-of-life care issues.</description>
