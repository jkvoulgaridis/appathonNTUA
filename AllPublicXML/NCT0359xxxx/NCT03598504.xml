      This study uses closed-loop control of tendon vibration to implement clinically meaningful
      management of muscle spasms after spinal cord injury (SCI), and to understand the mechanisms
      responsible for spasm generation change in response to vibration.

      The specific aims of this study are listed below:

      1a) Evaluate the ergonomics of the wearable device that will be used to record and detect
      spasms, then to deliver vibration to tendons to dampen spasms.

        1. b) Determine the vibration parameters that best reduce spasms in leg muscles paralyzed
           by spinal cord injury (SCI) in the laboratory using the wearable device.

        2. a) Examine the efficacy of tendon vibration in altering muscle spasms by treating spasms
           as they occur in real world environments using 24-hour electromyographic (EMG)
           recordings.

      Hypothesis 2a: Achilles tendon vibration will dampen spasms acutely, and may alter their
      distribution Assess excitatory and/or inhibitory mechanisms that underlie spasms, and changes
      induced with vibration, by recording physiological, clinical, functional and self-reported
      measures of different aspects of spasticity, and health-related quality of life, before and
      after conditioning spasms with vibration. These data will provide insight into the site(s),
      magnitude, and time-course of changes with vibration; and user perspective on the effects of
      the therapy.

      Achilles tendon vibration will dampen spasms by reconfiguring circuits generating 6-13 Hz
      shared drive to motoneurons.

    <description>Quantitative and qualitative survey for subjects developed to evaluate comfort and user-friendliness of device. The questionnaire includes 11-point scale questions to rate spasms and effect of the device (0 means no effect and 10 means complete satisfaction. Values for each answer will be interpreted separately and a 10 signifies a better outcome); dichotomous (yes/no) questions about the device, where &quot;no&quot; signifies no interruption to their different routines and therefore &quot;no&quot; represents a better outcome; and free-answer questions to collect qualitative data on concerns and recommendations.</description>

    <description>1a. A focus group to gather information about the perceptions, opinions, beliefs, and attitudes towards management of muscle spasms by vibration using our portable device, information that will drive design improvement (size, fit, weight).
1b. In the lab, we will trigger spasms in paralyzed leg muscles in one of two common postures (seated, reclined), detect the contractions using electromyography (EMG), and condition alternate spasms with vibration using our custom device. We will examine the vibration parameters that reduce muscle spasms best.
2. Participants will complete 1 or 2 multi-day experiments. EMG (24-hour) data will be collected at baseline (day 1), during the vibration intervention (day 2), and post intervention (day 3) to examine the acute effects of vibration on muscle spasms</description>
