  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tendinopathy of the flexor hallucis longus (FHL), colloquially referred to as &quot;dancer's
      tendinitis,&quot; is a common condition in dancers and attributed to high demand on this muscle in
      positions of extreme ankle plantarflexion and metatarsophalangeal (MTP) flexion and
      extension. Tradicional conservative treatment includes rest from pain-inducing activities
      including pointe work and jumping, physical therapy a focusing on movilization of the joints
      of the first ray and subtalar joint, and antiinflamatory medications. Unfortunately, dancer
      frecuently do not follow recommendations to rest due to the competitive nature of the field.
      Those who do not respond to conservative treatment undergo more serious interventions
      including steroid injections or surgery, each with additional risks and recovery time. To
      develop experimental protocols aimed at prevention and nonsurgical interventions are needed.
      Therefore, the aim of this study was To investigate the effects of one shot of low-frequency
      percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (PENS) vs. one shot of transcutaneous electrical
      nerve stimulation (TENS) in performance of the Flexor Hallucis Longus muscle in young
      dancers.

    <description>This intervention consisted in the application of an asymmetric biphasic rectangular current. The subject lay prone with her feet outside the table. The FHL muscle was located at 50% of the distance between the fibular head and inferior border of the lateral malleolus on the posterior aspect of the fibular by ultrasound machine (cross-section) (Logiq, GE Healthcare, USA) and then, a needle (0.30mm x 0.40mm) was inserted, perpendicular to the surface of the skin, until the muscle belly. Prior to inserting a neddle, the underlying skin was cleaned with isopropyl alcohol. The intensity of the current was necessary to cause an exacerbated muscle contraction, during 1.5 min acording to the Valera and Minaya protocol´s.
This intervention was performed once in each participant, on one leg only (stance limb), It's only once, it was not a treatment</description>

The FHL muscle was located at 50% of the distance between the fibular head and inferior border of the lateral malleolus on the posterior aspect of the fibular by ultrasound machine (cross-section) (Logiq, GE Healthcare, USA),and then, one self-adhesive electrode was placed on the back of the leg and the other on the sole of the foot. The intensity of the current was necessary to cause an exacerbated muscle contraction, during 1.5 min.
