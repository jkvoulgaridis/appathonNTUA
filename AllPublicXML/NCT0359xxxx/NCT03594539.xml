  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elevated phosphate concentrations in the blood have been associated with multiple negative
      health outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease as well as in the general population.
      These negative outcomes include an increased risk of vascular complications like heart attack
      and stroke. While complications like heart attack and stroke reflect obstructive disease in
      large blood vessels, recent evidence suggests that elevated phosphate concentrations may
      first lead to disease in small blood vessels.

      This single site clinical trial will randomize 20 veterans with end stage renal disease on
      hemodialysis to either a phosphate binder or placebo and evaluated for changes in their
      microvascular function using laser-Doppler flowmtery and nail-fold capillaroscopy.

      Project Background: Recent studies have suggested that increased serum phosphate and
      phosphate intake may acute impair microvascular blood flow. However, this has never been
      directly tested using imaging techniques that directly measure microvascular flow. The
      end-stage renal disease population on hemodialysis at the VA San Diego is an ideal population
      to evaluate this effect.

      Project Question: Does reduction of serum phosphate through the use of a phosphate binder
      (lanthanum carbonate) increase microvascular blood flow in persons with ESRD? Project
      Methods: The investigators propose a 4 week, randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled,
      single-center, crossover trial. Participants will have their microvascular function assessed
      at the baseline of the study using laser-Doppler flowmetry and nail-fold capillaroscopy. They
      will then be randomized to either lanthanum carbonate or placebo for 2 weeks. Microvascular
      measurements will be repeated at the end of the 2 week period. Participants will then
      cross-over to the other study arm. After 2 weeks in the other study arm, they will have
      microvascular measurements repeated and the trial will then be complete. The primary outcome
      of the study will be the % change in skin blood flow after heating from 31 degrees Celsius to
      44 degrees Celsius. This will be compared within each individual after they complete each arm
      of the study. Changes seen on nail-fold capillaroscopy, acceptability, safety, and adherence
      will be key secondary outcomes.

    <measure>% Change in flux of blood after skin heating to 44 C as measured using laser-Doppler flowmtery.</measure>
    <time_frame>Performed at initial study visit, at the end of the first arm of the study (Day 14) and again at the end of the second arm of the study (Day 28)</time_frame>
    <description>Flux of blood through skin will be measured using a Perimed PF5000. This will be performed at baseline in a temperature controlled room. Baseline skin measurements will be made at 31C. Skin will then be heated to 44 C. The percent change will be the outcome. This outcome will be compared within each person at the conclusion of each arm. Measurements will all be made on the Monday or Tuesday, the day of the participant's first dialysis treatment of the week. Measurements will be made prior to dialysis.</description>

    <measure>Change in capillary count seen post occlusion from pre occlusion, as determined by nail-fold capillaroscopy.</measure>
    <time_frame>Performed at initial study visit, at the end of the first arm of the study (Day 14) and again at the end of the second arm of the study (Day 28)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will undergo nail fold capillaroscopy using a CapiScope (KK Technology, Honiton United Kingdom) at baseline and then at the end of each treatment arm. Using a capillarascope a capillary count will be made. After measurement a BP cuff will be inflated to 200 mm Hg occlude flow to a single digit for 1 minute. 30 sec after release the count will be made again. This change will be compared within individuals between measurements made at the completion of each arm in the study. Measurements will all be made on the Monday or Tuesday, the day of the participant's first dialysis treatment of the week. Measurements will be made prior to dialysis. Values at the end of each treatment arm will be compared.</description>

    <description>In this trial, placebo represents the intervention and not the control. Standard therapy for hyperphosphatemia in end-stage renal disease includes treatment with a phosphate binder. In this trial the intervention will be to withhold the phosphate binder and use placebo instead. In this way the effect of a higher serum phosphate can be evaluated.</description>
