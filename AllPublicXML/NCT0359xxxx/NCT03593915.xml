  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alvocidib, a cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK 9) inhibitor, in time-sequential therapy
      demonstrated significant clinical activity in secondary AML patients with prior MDS. Patients
      with IPSS-R intermediate and above MDS have an increased risk of developing AML and may be
      treated with the same chemotherapy regimens used in patients with AML. Eight Phase I or II
      clinical trials have been completed in patients with AML, totaling more than 400 patients
      with both relapsed/refractory or newly diagnosed AML.

      Preclinical studies have demonstrated that decitabine exposure increased the expression of
      NOXA, which is a specific antagonist of the survival factor MCL 1. Pharmacologic
      downregulation of MCL-1 via CDK 9 inhibition, as well as upregulation of the MCL-1
      antagonist, NOXA, following decitabine exposure may result in enhanced antileukemic activity
      in MCL-1-dependent malignancies.

      PHASE 1b:

      Patients will be enrolled in cohorts of 3-6 patients. Escalation of the alvocidib dose will
      follow a standard 3+3 design with sequential cohorts of 3 patients treated with incrementally
      higher doses of alvocidib administered in sequence after decitabine or azacitidine until a
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed and the MTD is established.

      Once the MTD or preliminary RP2D of alvocidib administered via hybrid dosing is identified, 2
      cohorts of at least 3 patients each will receive azacitadine followed by alvocidib
      administered as a 1-hour IV infusion.

      Expansion at MTD Once the MTD or preliminary RP2D of alvocidib administered as a 1 hour IV
      infusion is determined, up to 25 patients will be enrolled in an Expansion cohort to receive
      alvocidib following either decitabine or azacitadine to confirm safety, explore potential
      biomarkers, and evaluate potential signals of alvocidib activity. Once this Expansion cohort
      is completed, the study will progress to Phase 2

      PHASE 2:

      Phase 2 design is based on the Simon 2-stage minimax design (Simon 1989).

        -  Stage 1: Up to 15 evaluable patients will be enrolled and treated at the RP2D identified
           in the Phase 1b study.

        -  Stage 2: Ten patients will be enrolled to bring the total enrollment in Phase 2
           (including Stage-1 patients) to 25 evaluable patients. Stage-2 patients will also
           receive the RP2D dose of alvocidib administered by 1-hour IV infusion identified in the
           Phase 1b study. If 6 or more responses are observed in 25 patients, the conclusion will
           be that the combination regimen is worthy of further investigation.

Decitabine administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion daily for 5 days at a dose of 20 mg/m2 followed on Day 8 by alvocidib as a loading dose over 30 minutes followed by a 4-hour IV infusion (hybrid dosing) Once the maximum dose of alvocidib administered via hybrid dosing has been determined, 2 cohorts of patients will receive azacitidine followed by alvocidib administered as an IV infusion. Azacitidine may be administered as either an IV bolus over 10 to 40 minutes or as a subcutaneous (SC) injection on either a 7 day or 5-2 2 schedule. Regardless of which azacitidine schedule or route of administration is used, alvocidib will be given on Day 10 as a 1-hour IVI
