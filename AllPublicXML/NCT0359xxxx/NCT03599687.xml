  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In more than one-in-five cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, airways are blocked by
      vomit and blood. Sometimes, paramedics cannot clear the airway using methods they have been
      taught. If the airway cannot be cleared, the patient will die.

      Usually, these patients will have a breathing tube placed into their windpipe (intubation),
      as this provides protection from vomit and blood. To do this, the paramedic needs to be able
      to see the entrance to the windpipe.

      A new method of clearing the airway called SALAD has been used in patients to help insert a
      breathing tube, but it is not known whether the method can help paramedics. This study will
      use a manikin to see if paramedics can insert a breathing tube more often on their first
      attempt, using SALAD.

    <description>The training session will be delivered, and will take around 45 minutes to complete, including time for participant practice. The training intervention will adopt the Advanced Life Support Group/Resuscitation Council 4-stage approach of skills teaching, and is comprised of: A real-time demonstration of the SALAD technique by the researcher; A repeated demonstration with an explanation of the rationale of the steps taken when performing SALAD (not real-time); Another demonstration of the SALAD technique conducted by the researcher, but guided by one of the participants; An attempt by the same participant who guided the researcher in the previous step, followed by a practice attempt by the other participants.</description>
