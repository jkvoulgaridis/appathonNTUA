    <textblock>
      A randomized, parallel-group, clinical trial will be conducted to compare the immediate
      effects of the inclusion of a neurodynamic intervention into a multimodal physiotherapy
      program on pressure pain sensitivity, pain and manual dexterity in patients with multiple
      sclerosis
