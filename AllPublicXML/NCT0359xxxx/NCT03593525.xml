  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supportive care Prioritization, Assessment and Recommendations for Kids (SPARK) is a
      web-based application which builds upon the Symptom Screening in Pediatrics Tool (SSPedi) and
      consists of two components: (1) a symptom screening component centered on SSPedi; and (2) a
      supportive care clinical practice guideline (CPG) component. This proposal is a randomized
      controlled trial that compares daily completion of SSPedi via SPARK for 5 days with symptom
      feedback to healthcare providers compared with standard of care

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be children with cancer or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)
      recipients who are 8-18 years of age and who can understand English, and who are expected to
      be in hospital or in clinic daily for 5 days. This will be a multi-center RCT in which we
      will randomize children to either undergo daily symptom screening for 5 days with symptom
      reports provided to the healthcare team or standard of care. The primary outcome will be the
      self-reported day 5 total SSPedi score (range 0-60; higher worse). Secondary outcomes will be
      the day 5 self-reported individual symptom, pain and QoL scores, and documentation of
      symptoms and provision of interventions for symptoms over the 5 day trial. We will enroll 345
      participants over 4 years from 7 Canadian centers

    <measure>SSPedi (Symptom Screening in Pediatrics) Total Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Measure will be completed by all participants on day 5±1 day.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome will be the self-reported total SSPedi score on day 5. The total SSPedi score is a validated measure that reflects the total burden of bothersome symptoms experienced. The total score is the sum of each of the 15 items' Likert scores which range from 0 (not at all bothered) to 4 (extremely bothered) to yield a total score that ranges from 0 (no bothersome symptoms) to 60 (worst bothersome symptoms).</description>

    <measure>Faces Pain Scale-Revised</measure>
    <time_frame>Measure will be completed by all participants on day 5±1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported pain will be assessed using the Faces Pain Scale-Revised which consists of a series of horizontal faces that depict a neutral facial expression of no pain on the left and worst pain on the right. It has 6 faces and may be scored on a 0 to 10 scale in which higher numbers denote more pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PedsQL (pediatric Quality of Life) 3.0 Acute Cancer Module</measure>
    <time_frame>Measure will be completed by all participants on day 5±1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported QoL will be measured using the PedsQL 3.0 Acute Cancer Module. This measure is a multidimensional instrument that is reliable and valid in children with cancer. It assesses pain and hurt, nausea, procedural anxiety, treatment anxiety, worry, cognitive problems, perceived physical appearance and communication. The self-report 7-day recall version will be used. The problems are rated from 0; never a problem to 4 if it is almost always a problem.Higher scores denote better health.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete symptom screening using SPARK once daily on a study-supplied iPad. For inpatients, daily reminders to complete SSPedi will appear on the iPad. Reports will be available to the child at any time. For outpatients, clinical research associates will provide the iPad in person daily and reports may be viewed at those encounters. The intervention is daily symptom screening with provision of reports to the healthcare team. Severe symptoms will result in email alerts. More specifically, SSPedi reports will be printed daily and provided in the patient chart. On days 1 and 3, an alert will be emailed to the physician providing direct medical care if any symptom is &quot;a lot&quot; or &quot;extremely&quot; bothersome (score 3 or 4 on 0-4 scale). Reports and alerts will have links to SPARK-housed CPGs.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the control arm will not complete daily symptom screening. They will complete SSPedi on days 1 and 5 to obtain the primary outcome. Health care providers will not be notified of their SSPedi scores and no symptom reports or symptom alerts will be generated.</description>
