      Study Design: This study is a comparative, single-center study. This is a minimal risk study
      (as defined in 21 CFR Part 56) using a non-significant risk device (as defined in 21 CFR Part
      812.3). A minimum of 60 subjects will be enrolled in the study. Subject participation will
      last approximately 1 hour.

      Objective(s):

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the two Fingertip Respiratory Rate (FTRR)
      algorithms performance of Nonin's Onyx 3 by attempting to demonstrate a mean error for FTRR &lt;
      1.0 BPM during spontaneous breathing.
