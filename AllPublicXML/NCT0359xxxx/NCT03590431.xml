  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iodine deficiency remains a global problem impairing health and development in affected
      populations. Although there has been remarkable global progress against iodine deficiency,
      mild and moderate iodine deficiency remain common globally, including European countries.
      Besides salt, milk and dairy products are important iodine sources in many industrialized
      countries, with varying contributions depending on the milk iodine concentration and the
      amount of milk and dairy consumed.

      Iodine absorption in humans depends on the iodine species and possibly on the iodine status
      of the person. Very little data is available on iodine absorption or bioavailability from
      different dietary sources including milk. Inorganic iodide is thought to be absorbed almost
      completely (&gt;90%). In contrast, only about two-thirds of some forms of organically-bound
      iodine are absorbed. The absorption of iodine from milk has not been quantified in humans. In
      this balance study, the investigators want to quantify the absorption of iodine in cow's milk
      in male and female adults and compare with the bioavailability from an iodine water solution
      (potassium iodide). The results of this study will inform on the bioavailability rate of
      iodine from cow's milk. Knowing the actual iodine bioavailability from milk is critical
      because milk and dairy products are major iodine sources in many industrialized countries.

      The primary objective of this randomized, cross-over design study is to assess iodine
      bioavailability (measured using excretion in urine) from whole cow's milk delivering an
      iodine level of about 600 µg/L and compare them with a control iodine solution. The
      investigators will test three drinks within one subject: 1) a milk with an intrinsic iodine
      concentration of about 600 µg/L; 2) a milk with a naturally low iodine concentration and an
      added amount of potassium iodide (extrinsic iodine in milk matrix) to reach a level of about
      600 µg/L (adapted to the intrinsic concentration in 1)); and 3) control iodine solution
      (extrinsic iodine in water matrix) with the same iodine concentration.

These two milks will be labelled with &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; and masking will be applied to the participant only (single-blinded). The code will be held by the Study coordinator.
