    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the oxidative stress parameters in females with polycystic ovary
      syndrome (PCOS) and clinically healthy. Because of the fact that both oral disease included
      periodontitis and dental caries, and metabolic syndrome are associated with systemic
      inflammation, these two disorders may be linked through a common pathophysiologic pathway

      Power analysis was performed with the G-Power software package to determine sample size. To
      cover possible data loss, 10% of a group were added to each group. Medical and dental
      examination will be performed both of control and experimental groups. Age and body mass
      index (BMI) will be recorded.

      In dental examination decayed, missing, or filled teeth (DMFT) index will be used according
      to World Health Organization (WHO 1997) criteria. All teeth were visually using the
      International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS-II). To analyze the correlation
      between oral health status and polycystic ovary syndrome linear regression test and for
      comparison of both the groups (case and control), two sample t test and chi square test were
      used.

    <description>All teeth were visually using the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS-II). The chosen sites were recorded as: 0 = sound;
= first visible sign of noncavitated lesion seen only when the tooth is dried;
= visible noncavitated lesion seen when wet and dry;
= microcavitation in enamel;
= noncavitated lesion extending into dentine seen as an undermining shadow;
= small cavitated lesion with visible dentine: less than 50% of surface;
= large cavitated lesions with visible dentine in more than 50% of the surface.</description>

Abundance of soft matter within the gingival pocket.
Calculation: Total scores of 6 (16, 12, 24, 36, 32, 44) teeth / No of surfaces examined

oligomenorrhea and/or anovulation
Hyperandrogenism (clinical and/or biochemical) One of the signs for clinical hyperandrogenism is hirsutism, which represents hair growth in a male pattern on a female with four different degrees of severity in 11 different body parts: 1) upper lip; 2) chin; 3) chest; 4) upper back; 5) lower back; 6) upper abdomen; 7) lower abdomen; 8) arm; 9) forearm; 10) thigh; and 11) lower leg. The Ferriman-Gallwey scoring system is used to score the degree of excess male-pattern body hair to indicate hirsutism.</description>
