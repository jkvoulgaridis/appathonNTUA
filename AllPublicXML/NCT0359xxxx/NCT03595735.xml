  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical evaluation to assess the safety and performance of the Zenflow Spring
      System when used as intended to relieve symptoms of obstructive Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia
      (BPH).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A multi-center, prospective, single arm safety, performance, and effectiveness trial. The
      study will be conducted in two stages. Upon the successful completion of stage 1, the study
      will be expanded and continue to stage 2.

      Stage 1 will enroll subjects in the Intent to Treat (ITT) cohort. The purpose of stage 1 is
      to assess acute safety and performance of the Zenflow System at the time of the procedure,
      through discharge, 2 weeks and 1 month, in up to 10 subjects enrolled at up to 7
      investigational sites, to determine continuation to stage 2.

      Upon successful completion of stage 1, the study will be expanded to stage 2 with sites added
      and continued enrollment in the ITT cohort. All subjects, including those enrolled in the
      stage 1 evaluation, will continue to be followed at all the designated follow-up time points
      for the full duration of the study (24 months).

      Whether or not the study continues to Stage 2, all enrolled subjects will be followed for the
      entire duration of the study (24 months), or until exited.
