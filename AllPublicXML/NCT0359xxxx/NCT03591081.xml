  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a novel feasibility study to test the participant acceptance and usability of a
      specifically designed smart phone app. It will also explore the effects of smart phone
      technology in improving self-referrals into the diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) service.
      Furthermore, it will be explored if this increase in self-referrals will influence the
      outcome of people with diabetes who have recently had a healed foot ulceration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale behind this study is if the investigators can introduce a new technology (a
      smart phone app) which is acceptable to patients, engages them and prompts people to take
      preventative health behaviours then the investigators may be able to influence the low rates
      of appropriate self-referral. There is evidence that links poor glycaemic control and
      hypertension to DFUs, so engagement in these areas of wider diabetes management needs to be
      reviewed, the latest National Diabetes Audit (NDA) shows only 20% of people with Type 1 and
      42% of people with Type 2 diabetes achieve the 3 NICE standards for HbA1c, BP and
      cholesterol. In addition, healthcare providers are being asked to investigate new systems
      that may increase patient engagement with and the uptake of the NICE 8 annual care processes.
      The latest NDA shows only 40% of patients with type 1 and 60% of patients with type 2
      diabetes currently have all 8 .
