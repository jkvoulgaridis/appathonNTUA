  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open label study to evaluate puff topography in adult smokers using a JUUL 5%
      ENDS. Up to 30 subjects will be enrolled and evaluated on Day 1 and Day 15. The duration of
      the study is 15 days with up to a 28 days screening window.
