      To establish prospective cohort of healthy population and corresponding serum sample bank in
      Sichuan province to provide platform for exploring early diagnosis and screening strategy of
      gastric cancer by a prospective cohort study.

    <textblock>
      H. pylori was one of the most important carcinogenic factor for gastric cancer and play a
      crucial role in inducing gastritis, atrophy and canceration. Chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG)
      was a common precancerous disease, people with CAG become high-risk population and need
      regular follow-up. However, study about occurrence risk prediction for gastric cancer when H.
      pylori infection concurrence with CAG was still spare. In especial, there was still no
      population screening program based on serology. The relative clinical epidemiology for
      providing evidence for China gastric cancer screening program was very rare.

      This study aim to evaluate gastric cancer occurrence risk and diagnostic value of people
      combined with H. pylori infection and CAG by Serological methods in Sichuan province China.
      We also project to design optimized screening program suitable for people in sichuan province
      China.
