  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is responsive to RR&amp;D's current special areas of interest for
      non-pharmacological activity-based interventions for chronic pain impacting pain reduction,
      function and quality of life. This project aligns with the VA mandate for complementary and
      integrative health (CIH) care for Veterans and their families. CIH complements traditional
      care for Veterans managing chronic conditions, such as chronic pain and PTSD. Mission
      Reconnect (MR) is a user-driven, dyadic, CIH self-care management program delivered remotely
      that teaches techniques the Veteran/partner dyad can use to reduce pain, anxiety and stress,
      promote well-being and improve relationship quality. The research goal is to evaluate MR as
      an approach to manage chronic pain and PTSD symptoms, for potential subsequent
      implementation. This study will possibly provide a model for establishing remote access and
      sustainable implementation of CIH within VA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is one of the most prevalent medical conditions in the Veteran population. Pain
      often presents with comorbid conditions, specifically post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
      Comorbid chronic pain and PTSD significantly impact the quality of life of Veterans and their
      families. Multi-faceted therapies leveraging complementary and integrative health (CIH) are
      mandated within VA to complement clinical practice guidelines improve Veterans' quality of
      life and ability to function. This research will evaluate a CIH intervention to manage pain
      and PTSD related outcomes within a bio-psychosocial framework. The proposed intervention,
      Mission Reconnect (MR), a user-driven, dyadic, self-care management program delivered online
      and by mobile app that has previously shown to be effective in a non-clinically defined
      community-based Veteran/military population. This research is needed to test MR's effects in
      a clinically defined population as a complement to clinical services to assess for potential
      subsequent implementation within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

      This proposal resubmission is responsive to Veterans' reported desire for CIH and several VA
      initiatives, including RR&amp;D's current special areas of interest for non-pharmacological
      activity-based interventions for chronic pain impacting pain reduction, function and quality
      of life. The VA Secretary of Health Strategic Priorities and the emerging VA Whole Health
      Program identify access to CIH for pain and self-care management as a priority to achieve
      optimal Veteran health. To be responsive to these priorities the 2016 VA State-of-the-Art
      Conference (SOTA) and Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act (CARA) mandated VA's commitment to
      conduct rigorous research to integrate non-pharmacological and CIH approaches into care, with
      emphasis on pain management. This proposal is also responsive to the VA's Opioid Safety
      Initiative (OSI) and Pain Care Mission which prioritize the need for nonpharmacological
      treatment options for pain. The short-term goal of this study is to determine the effects of
      MR on (1) chronic pain, PTSD and related outcomes and (2) relationship outcomes for Veterans
      and their partners. The long-term goal is to determine the effectiveness and sustainability
      of using CIH self-care management programs like MR to improve outcomes for Veterans with
      chronic pain and PTSD, and their partners. The investigators propose a four-year
      mixed-methods randomized controlled trial of MR with two arms (treatment &amp; wait-list control)
      in a clinical sample of Veterans with comorbid pain and PTSD, and their partners (e.g.,
      spouse). The specific aims are to: (Aim 1) Determine MR effectiveness for physical (pain,
      sleep), PTSD (intrusion, arousal, avoidance, numbing), and psychological (depression, stress,
      anxiety) symptoms, and global health (quality of life); (Aim 2) Determine MR effectiveness
      for social (relationship satisfaction, compassion for self/others) outcomes among Veterans
      and their partners; and (Aim 3) Describe Veteran and partner perceived value of MR in a
      sub-sample of participants. The sample will consist of Veteran and partner dyads (N = 336) at
      the Ann Arbor, Puget Sound, and Tampa VA facilities. Aim 1 &amp; 2 data collection will include
      self-report assessment of 4-data points over a 4-month period to evaluate physical,
      psychological, and social outcomes. Eight weekly reports will also be collected for the first
      two months of MR use to assess MR utilization, and pain and stress levels. Aim 3 data
      collection will include telephone interviews from a randomly selected sub-sample of MR
      treatment group dyads (n = 42) to examine MR user experiences and their suggestions making MR
      useful for Veterans and their partners.

MR was designed for Veterans who face obstacles accessing formal mental health services. It can also be used to complement formal services.

    <description>Usual Care Waitlist Control Arm: For ethical reasons, this study will use a waitlist control arm to ultimately provide all participants exposure to the MR intervention. Dyads in the control arm will participate in all assessments like those in the treatment group, however, they will be asked to agree to not access the public web site during their participation. Wait-list control participants will be instructed to seek advice about treatment from their providers. Other than this initial advice, there will be no attempt by study personnel to influence condition management unless an issue (i.e., suicidal ideation) arises. The control condition will account for potential temporal effects that occur from passage of time (brief), and expectation effects associated with anticipation of MR participation. The control group will receive access to MR after they complete data collection.</description>

                  &quot;likely to represent chronic pain&quot; recorded at visits separated by at least 30
                  days within past six months

               -  (2) Having high impact chronic pain = 2+ occurrences of targeted musculoskeletal
                  ICD-9-CM codes separated by at least 30 days within the past six months previous
                  to study recruitment and two or more pain scores greater than or equal to 4
                  separated by at least 30 days within past six months.

          -  For pain scores, the investigators will use the 0-10 numeric pain rating scale that is
             routinely collected at the VA.

               -  The investigators will count two ICD-9-CM codes or pain scores recorded on the
                  same day as one code/score.

               -  Veteran is considered to have PTSD if he or she has a flag in his/her record
                  indicating confirmed condition by the VA Compensation and Benefits program, has
                  at least two outpatient visits in the year with the primary diagnosis being
                  listed as PTSD (ICD-9-CM code 309.81) and/or had PTSD listed on the problem
                  list], Veteran must also have PTSD (defined by PTSD diagnosis-ICD-9-CM 309.81),
