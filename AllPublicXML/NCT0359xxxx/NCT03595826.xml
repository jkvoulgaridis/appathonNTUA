  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to establish and present the prevalence figures and demographics of the
      co-morbidity of ADHD and DCD.

      It further aims to design an exercise intervention, to be utilised in the management of the
      symptoms of both conditions.

      Furthermore, it aims at establishing the efficacy of this exercise intervention, when
      compared with the current and most commonly used intervention, that is: neurostimulant drugs.

      This study is an experimental design, having three phases. The study looks at children, aged
      8 to 9, in remedial units or LSEN classes, in and around Durban, Kzn, SA; who have been
      diagnosed with ADHD/ADD.

      Phase 1: Teachers of the children identified with ADHD/ADD, will be asked to complete a
      modified teacher Conner's rating, to confirm the diagnosis of ADHD/ADD. The parent will then
      be asked to complete a DCD questionnaire (DCDQ) to give the PI an idea of whether
      co-ordination difficulties exist. The PI will then administer a Motor Assessment Battery for
      Children (MABC) to confirm the diagnosis of DCD. From the scores derived from the 3 above
      tests, co-morbidity will be diagnosed. The prevalence figures of co-morbidity will be
      calculated and presented. Demographics of prevalence figures will be given: Gender,
      Population group, average age.

      Phase 2: The exercise intervention will be designed, drawing from the literature and similar
      interventions already used in various publications.

      This programme will be validated by experts (Physiotherapists and O.Ts from special needs
      schools) and when 70% consensus is reached on all aspects of the programme, the final version
      will be drafted.

      Phase 3: The children found to have both conditions, in co-morbidity, will be assigned to one
      of 4 groups, according to parental choice, medical advice from paediatricians, GPs etc and an
      intervention a child is already on.

      The four groups will be: medication, exercises, medication plus exercises and a control
      group. The intervention designed in phase 2 will be administered to the two groups opting for
      the exercise intervention, for a minimum of 8 sessions. The 3 pre intervention scores
      (Conner's, DCDQ and MABC) will be derived from phase 1, post intervention scores will be done
      6 months after completion of the intervention, as it is stipulated by the rules of the MABC
      that the test may not be repeated sooner. The pre and post intervention scores will be
      compared to calculate improvement and average improvement within each group, will be
      calculated, to establish which intervention or combination of interventions, is the most
      effective.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity will be rated, using Conners rating scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>Aproximately 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement or regression in symptoms of ADHD will be rated using the modified Conner's teacher rating scale, pre intervention and post intervention:
10 factors on inattention will be rated 0 (Not at all), 1 (Just a little), 2 (Pretty much) and 3 (Very much); 5 factors on impulsivity will be rated using the same scale as above and 5 symptoms of hyperactivity as well. Percentages will be derived from these ratings. A 70% or more indicates a positive diagnosis for inattention/impulsivity/hyperactivity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Motor co-ordination will be rated, using DCD questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Aproximately 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement or regression in symptoms of co ordination, will be rated by the parent, using the Developmental Co-ordination Disorder Questionnaire, pre and post intervention: 15 statements related to co-ordination will be rated on the following scale: 1 (Not at all like child), 2 (A bit like child), 3 (Moderately like child), 4 (Quite a bit like child) and 5 (Extremely like child). The score will be totalled and scores of 55 and above mean that the child does NOT have co-ordination issues, scores below 55 indicate that the child has co-ordination issues.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Motor co-ordination will be measured using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children</measure>
    <time_frame>Aproximately 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement or regression of motor/co-ordination symptoms, will be tested by the therapist/primary investigator, using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children. 8 age-appropriate motor tests will be administered and scored.A total Motor Impairment score (TOMI) of under 10,5 indicates that the child is fine, scores from 10,5 to 14 indicate that the child is borderline and scores of 14,5 and above indicate definite motor/co-ordination problems.</description>
