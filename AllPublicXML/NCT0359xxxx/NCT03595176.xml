      The study design is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, global IDE study to evaluate the
      safety and effectiveness of the Shockwave Medical Coronary Intravascular Lithotripsy (IVL)
      System in de novo, calcified, stenotic coronary arteries prior to stenting. Disrupt CAD III
      is being conducted as a staged pivotal study.
