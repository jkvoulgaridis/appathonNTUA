  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, prospective, descriptive study of the Nellcor™ Bedside
      Respiratory Patient Monitoring System using the Nellcor™ Respiration Rate parameter and
      Nellcor™ Adult Respiratory Sensor The study is intended to gain further information in the
      clinical space on the function of the Nellcor™ Respiration Rate parameter. The primary
      objective is to describe spot check (e.g. manual observation) of respiration rate versus
      cumulative automated counting (trend) of respiratory rate as measured using the Nellcor™
      Bedside Respiratory Patient Monitoring System with the Nellcor™ Respiration Rate parameter.

        Patients will be included who provide informed consent, who are prescribed non-invasive
        respiratory monitoring via spot check vital signs at least every 4 hours and are without
        any contact skin allergies to adhesives found in standard pulse oximetry sensors. Potential
        subjects are those who will be admitted to the General Care Floor. The subject pool will be
        approximately divided equally between medical/non-surgical and surgical patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 18 years or older.

          2. A patient who meets the weight requirement for the sensor (e.g. &gt;30kg).

          3. A patient at the study site on a General Care Floor (surgical or medical/non-surgical
             to be distributed equally) and prescribed standard vital sign checks.

          4. Patient is willing and able to provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Expected length of stay is &lt; 4 hours.

          2. Patient is pregnant or lactating.

          3. Patient has severe contact allergies that may cause a reaction to standard adhesive
             materials found in pulse oximetry sensors, ECG electrodes, respiration monitor
             electrodes or other medical sensors.

          4. Patient has an abnormality that may prevent proper application of the device.

          5. Patient is in atrial fibrillation.

          6. Patient has a documented history of frequent premature atrial contractions (PACs) or
             premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), defined as greater than 3 in 30 seconds or
             greater than 6 in 60 seconds within the past 3 months.

          7. Patient has an implanted pacemaker.

          8. Patient has excessive nail polish that cannot be removed or other dye or discoloration
             of the finger.

          9. Patient has diagnosed central apnea or diagnosed significant obstructive sleep apnea.

         10. Patient is currently using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).

         11. Patient is unwilling or unable to sign informed consent.

         12. Evidence that the patient cannot understand the purpose and risks of the study and
             would require a legally authorized representative to sign informed consent.

         13. Patient is participating in another potentially confounding clinical study.

         14. Extreme motion conditions such as patient is prescribed to walk more than once per
             hour or is prescribed a medical device resulting in constant movement.
