      To assess the efficacy and feasibility of high-dose intensity-modulated radiotherapy with
      concurrent weekly paclitaxel and cisplatin for patients with locoregionally advanced
      non-small lung cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Local failure remains high in patients with locoregionally advanced non-small lung cancer.
      Given that a biological equivalent dose (BED)more than 100 Gy yields approximately a local
      control rate of 90% in early-stage non-small lung cancer, this BED or ever higher is
      logically required to control local disease for locally advanced non-small lung cancer.
      However, dose escalation is limited by radiation-related toxicity. Use of hyperfractionated
      radiation Therapy boost to residual metabolic disease as defined by positron emission
      tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) immediately after standard chemoradiotherapy
      (SCRT) using image-guided (IG) IMRT could potentially improve local control and perhaps
      survival

          -  Stage III ( American Joint Committee on Cancer AJCC, 7th ed.).

          -  No prior radiation to the thorax that would overlap with the current treatment field.

          -  Adequate bone marrow, renal and hepatic functions as assessed by the following:
             Hemoglobin &gt;/= 10.0 g/dl, Platelet count &gt;/= 1 00,000/ mm^3,absolute granulocyte count
             (AGC) ≥2 × 10^9 cells/L,bilirubin and Aspartate transaminase ≤1.5 ×upper limit of
             normal (ULN), Creatinine &lt;/ =1 .5 times ULN.

          -  Induction chemotherapy is allowed.

          -  Life expectancy more than 3 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with any component of small cell lung carcinoma are excluded from this study.

          -  Patients with evidence of a malignant pleural or pericardial effusion are excluded.

          -  Prior radiotherapy that would overlap the radiation fields.

          -  Uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to: Chronic Obstructive
             Pulmonary Disease(COPD) exacerbation or other respiratory illness, serious
             uncontrolled infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF),unstable angina
             pectoris, uncontrolled hypertension,or psychiatric illness/social situations that
             would limit compliance with the study requirements.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to paclitaxel.

          -  Any other condition or circumstance that would, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             make the patient unsuitable for participation in the study.
