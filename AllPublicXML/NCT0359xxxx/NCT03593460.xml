  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIa open label adaptive design dose finding study in male and female patients
      with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) with compensated liver function currently under standard of
      care. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the sPIF dose that normalizes and maintains
      the serum ALT when given for 14 doses.

      Autoimmune Hepatitis is disease where the patient's immune system produces an inappropriate
      immune response against their own liver. PreImplantation factor (PIF) is a substance that is
      secreted by viable fetuses during pregnancy. PIF initiates both maternal tolerance preventing
      the loss/rejection of the fetus. Synthetic PIF (sPIF) successfully translates PIF endogenous
      properties to pregnant and non-pregnant immune disorders. sPIF was found to be effective in
      preclinical models of autoimmunity and transplantation. Specifically, sPIF protected the
      liver against immune attack.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is an open label, dose finding trial in patients with AIH who have an elevated ALT
      levels. Patients will be administered a starting dose of sPIF 1mg/kg (n=10/cohort) for 14
      days assessing safety, tolerability and clinical response based on the effect on ALT levels
      until day 84. This will be followed by enrolling (n=10) patients administering 2mg/kg sPIF
      for 14 days assessing safety, tolerability and clinical response based on the effect on ALT
      levels until day 84. This be followed by an interim analysis that will determine clinical
      efficacy by comparing the 1mg and 2mg dose results; testing the decrease in mean ALT percent
      and determining the number of patients in remission defined as normalized ALT level. The
      successful cohort will enroll additional patients to enable power analysis. If no significant
      improvement is observed in the two cohorts, N=10 patients will be enrolled and administered
      3mg/kg sPIF for 14 days assessing safety and tolerability. If no significant improvement is
      noted and safety and tolerability is maintained additional 10 patients will be enrolled at
      4mg/kg. Following the same analysis, the maximal dose to be administered will be 5mg/kg.
