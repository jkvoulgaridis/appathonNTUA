  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interscalene brachial plexus block (ISB) constitutes the analgesic criterion standard for
      shoulder surgery. However, it is associated with a high incidence of hemidiaphragmatic
      paralysis (HDP) that may not be tolerated by patients with chronic pulmonary disease.
      Continuous ISBs have not avoided this complication with the reported and regularly used local
      anesthetic dilutions (i.e. 0.125% bupivacaine, 0.25% ropivacaine, etc). This observational
      study will register the incidence of HDP in continuous interscalene block (CISB) using a very
      diluted solution of levobupivacaine (0.04%) in patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder
      surgery.

      The main objective of this study is to determine the frequency of HDP the first postoperative
      day before patient discharge(POD).
