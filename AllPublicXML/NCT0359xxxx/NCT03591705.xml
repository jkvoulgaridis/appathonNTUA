  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most commonly malignant tumors around the world.
      Hepatic resection or liver transplantation is the radical method to cure the disease.
      However, due to large tumors, surgical treatment is suitable for early-stage and
      well-reserved liver function patients. Therefore, in clinical practice, transarterial
      chemoembolization (TACE) is a preferential and standard treatment of potentially resectable
      HCC.

      EACH trial opened the door to FOLFOX-based system chemotherapy for advanced HCC patients.
      Recently, investigators have showed that hepatic arterial infusion of FOLFOX-based
      chemotherapy (HAIC) was safe and efficient for HCC patients. Several clinical studies showed
      that HAIC bring better tumor response rate that the conditional TACE. The combination of TACE
      with HAIC (TACE-HAIC), theoretically can significantly increase the local doses of
      chemotherapeutic agents in the liver, reduce the viability of HCC cells and increase the
      hepatectomy rate. However, this hasn't been verified in clinical application. To identify a
      more effective and safety way for treating potentially resectable HCC patients, this study is
      designed to compare the safety and efficacy between HAIC and TACE-HAIC for those patients.
