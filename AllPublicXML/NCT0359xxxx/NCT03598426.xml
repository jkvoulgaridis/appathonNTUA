    <textblock>
      This study is a single center, prospective, randomized, open-label study aimed at determining
      the most effective means of preventing hypersensitivity reactions in gynecologic oncology
      patients receiving paclitaxel infusions. The study will therefore provide clinicians with the
      best ways of preventing paclitaxel hypersensitivity reactions in their patients during
      treatment. Subjects will be randomized using the block randomization method into one of these
      three commonly used treatment methods:(1) Conventional method: oral dexamethasone (20 mg),
      taking 12 hours and 6 hours prior to paclitaxel infusion and intravenous administration of
      histamine-1 (H1), and a histamine-2 (H2)receptor antagonists administered 30 minutes prior to
      paclitaxel infusion. (2) Short-course method: intravenous dexamethasone (20 mg), administered
      concurrently with H1 and H2 antagonists, 30 minutes prior to paclitaxel infusion. (3)
      Combined method: oral dexamethasone (20 mg), taking 12 hours prior to treatment in addition
      to intravenous dexamethasone (20 mg), H1 and H2 receptor antagonists administered 30 minutes
      prior to paclitaxel infusion. The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) would be used to
      determine if there is any significant difference between the different strategies that are
      used to pre-medicate patients prior to paclitaxel infusion. P-values of less than 0.05 will
      be considered statistically significant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the potentially serious and dose-limiting toxicities of paclitaxel is the development
      of hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs). Up to 42% of patients receiving paclitaxel experience
      an HSR, with serious (&gt; grade 3) reactions observed in about 2% of patients. Paclitaxel
      prescribing information and many other references therefore strongly recommend pre-medicating
      patients who are to be treated with paclitaxel-containing regimen with a corticosteroid, a
      histamine-1 (H1), and a histamine-2 (H2) antagonist prior to paclitaxel infusion. This is
      done to help prevent or minimize the occurrence of HSRs that could be caused by treating
      patients with paclitaxel. However, the method and timing of administering these
      pre-medications (particularly in the case of dexamethasone) have not been standardized. The
      current and most commonly used methods of preventing paclitaxel HSR includes one of the
      following: 1. Administering oral dexamethasone (20 mg), 12 hours and 6 hours prior to
      paclitaxel infusion and intravenous administration of H1 and H2 receptor antagonists 30
      minutes prior to paclitaxel infusion (Conventional method); 2. Administering intravenous
      dexamethasone (20 mg), concurrently with H1 and H2 antagonists, 30 minutes prior to
      paclitaxel infusion (Short-course method); 3. Administering oral dexamethasone (20 mg), 12
      hours prior to treatment in addition to intravenous dexamethasone (20 mg), H1 and H2 receptor
      antagonists administered 30 minutes prior to paclitaxel infusion. The goal of this study is
      to do a single center, prospective, randomized, open-label study to determine the most
      effective method in preventing paclitaxel HSR among these three commonly used methods.
