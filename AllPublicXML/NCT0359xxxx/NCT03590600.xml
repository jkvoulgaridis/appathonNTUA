  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study to
      evaluate safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single doses of BTZ043 in healthy
      adult volunteers. The study is conducted at a study centre in Germany. Up to 50 male and
      female participants will be included in this study in up to 5 cohorts; each cohort will
      consist of 10 subjects: in each cohort 8 subjects will be assigned to BTZ-043 and 2 to
      placebo. The doses tested will be: 125mg, 250mg, 500mg, 1000mg and 2000mg. Safety will be
      assessed via regular vital sign measurement, 12-lead ECG parameters, physical examination and
      safety laboratory assessments.

      Subjects will be hospitalized from Day -1 until discharge in the morning of Day 3. After
      completion of all Day 3 assessments of a cohort, blinded safety data will be reviewed and the
      next dose increment will be decided by the Trial Steering Committee (TSC).
