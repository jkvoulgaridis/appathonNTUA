      Inadequate recovery from Bell's palsy is not uncommon and as consequence, physical and social
      impairment are exist in these patients. The medical options for chronic condition of Bell's
      palsy are insufficient. Low-level laser therapy has shown a favorable prognosis in the
      regeneration of peripheral nerves. Moreover, laser acupuncture therapy (LAT) become widely
      used method to stimulate acupuncture points, but its efficacy as treatment method for Bell's
      palsy and during the chronic stage is unclear.

      Background: Inadequate recovery from Bell's palsy is not uncommon and as consequence,
      physical and social impairment are exist in these patients. The medical options for chronic
      condition of Bell's palsy are insufficient. Low-level laser therapy has shown a favorable
      prognosis in the regeneration of peripheral nerves. Moreover, laser acupuncture therapy (LAT)
      become widely used method to stimulate acupuncture points, but its efficacy as treatment
      method for Bell's palsy and during the chronic stage is unclear.

      Methods: This clinical trial settings are a randomized, placebo control, double blind pilot
      study including patients with the unsatisfactory recovery of Bell's palsy with the following
      two groups: LAT (N=16) and a sham LAT (N=16). The LAT will receive treatments for 6 weeks,
      compare to sham control group. The primary outcome measure will be change in the Facial
      Disability Index at week 6. Statistical analysis will also include changes in the
      House-Brackmann grading system, the Sunnybrook grading system and stiffness scale at 1, 3 and
      6 weeks after randomization.

      Expected outcome: The investigators hypothesis that LAT will have an effect on functional
      outcomes in patients with chronic facial paralysis. Moreover, changes in the S-B facial nerve
      grading system is also expected to have an improvement. Last, social subscale of FDI is
      expected to have an improvement.

    <description>The primary outcome measurement in this study is the change of FDI after completing 6 weeks of laser acupuncture therapy. FDI scoring system consists of two domains; physical score and social score and each section consists five multiple choice question related to either physical or social issues occurred in the previous month. Subjects will fill up the questionnaire and the assessor will calculate the score according to the calculation in each section; physical section: total score (questions 1-‚Äê5) minus N divided by N multiple 100 divided 4 equals to total score. social section; total score (questions 6--10) minus N divided by N multiple 100 divided by 5 equals to total score (N equals to number of questions answered). Higher values represent a better outcome. FDI evaluations will be performed on the first visit, the 9th visit and 18th visit and will be compared to the score at baseline.</description>

    <measure>The change in the House-Brackmann (H-B) facial nerve grading system</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment will take place at baseline, end of third week and six week.</time_frame>
    <description>The change of H-B facial nerve grading system will be compared after completing 6 weeks of laser acupuncture therapy. H-B facial nerve grading system includes 6 grades of facial paralysis; normal, mild, moderate, moderate severe, severe and complete paralysis. The study assessor asks the patient to move the facial muscles and then according to the result the assessor decides the grade of paralysis. The evaluations will be performed on the first visit, the 9th visit and 18th visit.</description>

    <measure>The change in the Sunnybrook (S-B) facial nerve grading system</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment will take place at baseline, end of third week and six week.</time_frame>
    <description>The change of S-B facial nerve grading system will be compared after completing 6 weeks of laser acupuncture therapy. S-B facial nerve grading system includes 3 subscales; resting symmetry (eye, cheek and mouth), symmetry of voluntary muscles and synkinesis. Besides the resting symmetry, in the two others subscales the assessor asks the patient to move the facial muscles and then give a score between 1 to 5 ( 1= unable to move 5= complete moment). Subscales are combined to compute a total score; symmetry of voluntary muscles subscale minus resting symmetry subscale minus synkinesis subscale equals to total score. Higher values represent a better outcome. The evaluations will be performed on the first visit, the 9th visit and 18th visit.</description>

    <measure>The change in the stiffness scale</measure>

    <description>The change of the stiffness score will be compared to baseline. The stiffness scale will be hand in each session and the subject will choose one number from a five-point scale (1= no stiffness to 5= very stiff) according to the feeling in the face after receiving laser acupuncture therapy. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>
