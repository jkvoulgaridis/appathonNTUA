  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because of the risk of pulmonary aspiration, patients are asked to comply with the fasting
      guidelines when they are scheduled for an elective cesarean section. This fasting can result
      in increased insulin resistance, and that this can delay patient recovery from surgery.
      Giving a patient a carbohydrate-rich beverage before surgery has been shown to reduce the
      post-operative insulin resistance and reduce the length of stay in the hospital.

      In order to safely provide pregnant women with a carbohydrate-rich drink when admitted to the
      hospital in preparation for an elective cesarean delivery, the investigators must ensure that
      their stomach has emptied by the time they go to the operating room.

      The objective is to investigate whether women admitted to the hospital, having complied with
      the fasting guidelines, will have an empty stomach 2 hours after being offered 400 ml of a
      beverage containing 50g of carbohydrate. This can easily be done with the use of an
      ultrasound exam of the stomach.

      The hypothesis is that patients will have an empty stomach 2 hours after drinking 400 ml of a
      carbohydrate-rich beverage.

  <detailed_description>

      Fasting, even if for brief periods, results in a marked reduction in insulin sensitivity.
      This insulin resistance developed after surgery has been implicated in the increase of the
      length of stay at the hospital. Randomized studies involving either preoperative glucose
      infusion or ingestion of a carbohydrate-rich beverage have shown that postoperative insulin
      resistance may be reduced by about 50% when preoperative fasting is avoided.

      One of the recommended methods to avoid the insulin resistance in the perioperative period is
      the provision of isotonic, carbohydrate-containing clear fluids up to 2 hours preoperatively,
      so that patients begin their surgery in a fed rather than fasted state. This has been called
      &quot;carbohydrate loading&quot;. An amount of 50 g of carbohydrates is sufficient to produce an
      insulin response similar to that of a mixed solid meal.

      Beverages containing different combinations of carbohydrate or protein have been used in
      different patient populations and support the safety of their use in the perioperative
      period. Although there is substantial evidence that gastric emptying is similar in
      non-laboring term pregnant women and non-pregnant it is unknown whether the maternal anxiety
      preceding the procedure and the addition of a 50 g carbohydrate containing beverage may cause
      delayed gastric emptying and increase the risk of aspiration in the obstetric population.

      Bedside ultrasound assessment of the gastric content has shown good intra- and inter-rater
      reliability. Our group has previously demonstrated that in 103 women scheduled for elective
      cesarean, 95% of fasting subjects presented with an antral cross-sectional area ≤10.3 cm2.

      In order to implement and to standardize a beverage containing 50 g of complex carbohydrate
      offered to women when admitted to the hospital in preparation for their elective cesarean
      delivery, the investigators must ensure that women have an empty stomach by the time they
      arrive to the operating room.
