    <textblock>
      This study compares general to regional anesthesia concerning morbidity and mortality in
      patients older than or equal to 65 years old who receive clopidogrel and are to be submitted
      in hip fracture surgery. Half of participants will receive general anesthesia the first 48
      hours and the other half will receive regional anesthesia after 5 days of the discontinuation
      of clopidogrel.
