  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the ConfirmMDx assay is useful in finding prostate
      cancer in patients who are at increased risk for prostate cancer based on elevated PSA and
      prostate lesion identified on mpMRI.

        Subjects were selected due to increased risk of prostate cancer with prior elevated
        prostate specific antigen (PSA), mpMRI, prostatic lesions and negative MRI-ultrasound
        guided fusion biopsy due to the potential for prostate cancer that was not detected prior.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior documented elevated PSA (&gt; 4.0 ng/ml)

          -  MRI lesion based on PIRADS scoring within the past 3 years

          -  Completed MR/US fusion prostate biopsy with concurrent systematic biopsy for PIRADS
             score 2-5 with negative pathological findings completed subsequent ConfirmMDx assay
             (regardless of result). The most recent biopsy can be within 4 years if ConfirmMDx
             already completed.

          -  May have had prior negative biopsy sessions prior to the most recent MR/US fusion
             biopsy

          -  Must be able to stop anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy 5-7 days prior to obtaining
             biopsy

          -  Ability to give informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any metastatic cancer

          -  Any prostate cancer

          -  Active infection: urinary tract infection or prostate infection precluding prostate
             biopsy

          -  Anal stenosis or severe anal disease preventing prostate biopsy
