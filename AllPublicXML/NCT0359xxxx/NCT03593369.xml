  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of KLOX BioPhotonic System (composed
      of KLOX LumiHeal Gel and KT-L Lamp) on the expression of wound biomarkers in the treatment of
      venous leg ulcers (VLU). Patients will be randomized in three groups, two different
      dispensing schedules of KLOX BioPhotonic System in addition to Standard of Care (SOC) will be
      used, and SOC alone.

             venous hypertension;

          7. Ulcer to be treated must be measurable and with an area between 5 and 100 cm2
             inclusively, with a maximum depth of 1 cm and maximum diameter less or equal to 10 cm;

          8. If applicable, patients (male a female) must be willing to adhere to a
             medically-accepted birth control method (verified by the Investigator);

          9. Stable wound surface area with an absolute change in wound area less than 30% as

          3. The ulcer to be treated requires operative debridement or revascularization;

          4. The ulcer has significant necrotic tissue, as defined by more than 20% of the ulcer
             area after debridement;

          8. Patient who has experienced a hip fracture in the past 3 months;

          9. Patient with known osteomyelitis or active cellulitis;

         13. Concurrent participation in another clinical trial that involves an investigational
             drug or device that would interfere with this study, or participation within the past
             60 days in another interventional wound healing clinical trial;

         14. History of radiation therapy to the wound region;

         15. Pregnancy, or breast feeding;
