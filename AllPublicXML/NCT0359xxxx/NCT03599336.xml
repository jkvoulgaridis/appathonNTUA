    <time_frame>2 year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score is a well-validated, patient-reported outcome measure used by shoulder and elbow surgeons. The score ranges from 0-100 with 100 signifying the best outcome. Half of the score correlates to pain and half to function, both on a 0-50 scale where higher is again considered a better outcome. The pain portion is tabulated by taking the patient's response on a visual analogue scale (0 to 10 scale where 0 represent no pain and 10 represents worst pain imaginable), subtracting it from 10, and then multiplying by 5. The function score is tabulated by taking the patient's response on 10 questions rated on an ordinal scale from 0-3 and then multiplying the cumulative score by 5/3.</description>

    <description>Subjects allocated to the nonoperative treatment arm will maintain sling immobilization for 3 weeks. The sling will be removed for elbow, wrist and hand range of motion (ROM), hygiene, and dressing only. At 3 weeks passive ROM in external rotation (ER) and forward elevation (FE) will be added. At 6 weeks from injury, the sling will be removed and stretching in all planes will be allowed. Use of the arm will be up to a fork/knife/toothbrush only. At 3 months from injury, strengthening will be added. Supervised physical therapy will be offered to patients for use at their discretion, as is current practice.</description>
