  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the last decades, assisted reproductive technique has been transformed from a miracle
      to real and has become widely used for treatment human infertility.

      this was associated with increased the rate of twin pregnancies
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twin pregnancies are associated with an increased risk of maternal mortality &amp; morbidity and
      an increase in the incidence of neonatal morbidity and mortality compared to singleton
      pregnancy.

      The heterogeneous results reported so far can also depend on differences in the studied
      populations and/or in the management approach to twin pregnancy, variability in data
      regarding neonatal and maternal outcomes.

      Evidence on pregnancy outcomes of twins conceived by artificial reproductive technology (ART)
      compared with those naturally conceived (NC) is conflicting, A 2004 systematic review and a
      large 2008 study both were praised that in cases of twin pregnancy after assisted conception
      the perinatal mortality is significantly lower, when compared with those spontaneously
      conceived .

        Twin delivery was identified when coming to outpatient clinic &amp; labour ward into two
        groups, first group iatrogenic conceived twins (either ART, or medical ovulation induction
        mainly clomiphene citrate and gonadotrophins).The second group is a twin pregnancy who
        conceived naturally .

        Demographic characters, maternal and neonatal outcomes were compared in both groups
