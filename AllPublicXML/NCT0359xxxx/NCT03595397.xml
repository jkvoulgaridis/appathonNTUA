    <textblock>
      This work aims at comparing the analgesic effect of Thoracic Epidural Magnesium sulfate
      versus Fentanyl when added as adjuvants to Bupivacaine in patients with multiple traumatic
      fracture ribs.

    <textblock>
      Rib fractures are a common condition following trauma with a reported incidence of up to 10%
      in trauma in general, and up to 39% in blunt chest trauma. Traumatic rib fractures are
      associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and mortality rates reaching 10-16% has
      been reported. An estimated one third of patients with traumatic rib fractures develop
      secondary pulmonary complications with an associated mortality rate as high as 65% . Pain is
      recognized as a contributing factor to adverse outcome in traumatic rib fractures due to
      pain-induced inadequate respiratory efforts leading to atelectasis, difficulties in clearing
      secretions and an increased risk of developing pneumonia. Consequently, adequate analgesia is
      considered a core intervention in the management of patients with traumatic rib fractures.

      There are a variety of ways to manage a patient's pain. Oral analgesic drugs and regional
      modes are more likely to be used .

      Regional analgesia is often supplemented with a small dose of either NSAIDs or opioids and
      pain reduction is typically strong and immediate. There is little sedation, so evaluation of
      head and abdominal injuries is easier. A major disadvantage is the technical complexity of
      the procedures, leading to occasional errors in the administering of the treatments. They can
      also be painful while the needle is entering (or catheter is being installed), toxicity is a
      possibility, and the patients require more intensive monitoring and care by the physicians
      and nurses. There are a variety of modes; the four most common are TEA, thoracic
      paravertebral block, intercostal block, and intrapleural block. This study focuses on
      thoracic epidural analgesia.

      Narcotic infusions and continuous local anesthetic can be delivered through thoracic or
      lumbar epidural catheters. Opioid receptors exist in the spinal cord that can alter the
      perception of pain without needing stimulation of receptors in the brain. After inserting the
      catheter into this area, local anesthetics and narcotics are administered, blocking the
      anterior and posterior nerve roots crossing this space. The anesthetic/analgesic agents
      diffuse across the dura and begin to block sensory nerves. Motor nerves are affected to a
      lesser degree. It takes a large dose to achieve the desired effect.

    <time_frame>48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analog scale [VAS] is a measure of pain intensity. It is a continuous scale comprised of a horizontal or vertical scale usually 10 cm or 100 mm length. For pain intensity, the scale is most commonly anchored by &quot;no pain&quot; (score of 0) and &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot; or &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot; (score of 100 [on 100-mm scale].
The pain visual analog scale is self completed by the respondent. The respondent is asked to place a line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represents their pain intensity.
After the patient has marked, using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark.
The scores can be from 0-100.
A higher score indicates greater pain intensity.
Based on the distribution of pain, the following cut points on the pain VAS have been recommended:
No pain (0 -4 mm) Mild pain (5-44 mm) Moderate pain (45-74 mm) Severe pain (75-100 mm)</description>
