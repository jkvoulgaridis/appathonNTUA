    <description>The percentage of patients achieved 20% improvement according to American College of Rheumatology response criteria.
The ACR Criteria is a dichotomous variable with a positive (=responder) or negative (=non-responder) outcome. The ACR Criteria measures improvement in tender / swollen joint counts and improvement in at least three of the following parameters: 1) patient assessment 2) physician assessment 3) pain scale 4) disability/functional questionnaire 5) acute phase reactant (ESR or CRP). ACR 20 / 50 / 70 has a positive outcome if 20% / 50% / 70% improvement in tender and swollen joint counts was achieved as well as a 20% / 50% / 70% improvement in at least three of the other five criteria.</description>
