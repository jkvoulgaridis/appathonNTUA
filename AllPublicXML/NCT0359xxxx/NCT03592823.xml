  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia in clinic. It can lead to heart failure or
      stroke, and has a high disability rate and mortality rate. At present, although
      radiofrequency ablation can cure atrial fibrillation, the success rate is only 50~70%, and
      has a high recurrence rate. In recent decades, no effective new antiarrhythmic drugs have
      been introduced, but there are side effects in long-term application of the existing
      antiarrhythmic drugs. Therefore, it is urgent to provide new and effective antiarrhythmic
      drugs.

      Autophagy level of atrial myocytes in atrial fibrillation patients was significantly higher
      than that in sinus rhythm. Hydrochloroquine (HCQ) is a hydroxychloroquine sulfate composed of
      4- amino quinoline compounds. As an effective inhibitor for autophagy, HCQ could effectively
      prevent the increased autophagy level of atrial myocytes in atrial fibrillation rabbits,
      prevent atrial effective refractory period (AERP) shortening, and decrease the rate and
      duration of atrial fibrillation.

      At present, hydroxychloroquine is mainly used in the treatment of rheumatic immune system
      diseases and anti malaria. Because of its good safety and small side effects, HCQ has become
      an indispensable member of drugs in the combined treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and
      systemic lupus erythematosus patients. In recent years, studies have reported that
      hydroxychloroquine plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular
      diseases. Chloroquine could effectively shorten the action potential of atrial myocytes by
      blocking the inward rectifier potassium ion channel (Kir2.1) and reducing the inward
      potassium ion current Ik1. HCQ could also reduce 72% (P=0.002), and 70% for the risk of
      coronary heart disease, stroke, and transient ischemic disease. So the investigators
      speculate that HCQ may be a potential drug to block the occurrence of acute atrial
      fibrillation.
