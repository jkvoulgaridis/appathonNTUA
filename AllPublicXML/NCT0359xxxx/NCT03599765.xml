  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well systemic therapy with or without local consolidative
      therapy work in treating patients with solid tumor that has spread to 1 site of other places
      in the body. Treatment with up-front local consolidative therapy may be better in helping to
      control the disease.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. In patients with oligometastatic malignancies, to assess progression free survival (PFS)
      with upfront local consolidative therapy (LCT) versus (vs.) no LCT among randomized patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. In patients with oligometastatic malignancies, to assess overall survival (OS) with
      upfront LCT vs. no LCT among randomized patients.

      II. In patients with oligometastatic malignancies, to assess time to next line systemic
      therapy with upfront LCT vs. no LCT.

      III. In patients with oligometastatic malignancies, to assess time to new lesion failure with
      upfront LCT vs. no LCT.

      IV. To assess safety/tolerability of upfront LCT in patients with oligometastatic
      malignancies.

      V. In patients with oligometastatic malignancies, to assess quality of life with upfront LCT
      vs. no LCT.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify predictive/prognostic biomarkers that are associated with a benefit to LCT
      across disease sites.

      II. To investigate the systemic immune activating effects of radiation.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive up-front standard of care LCT including but not limited to surgical
      resection, cryotherapy, and radiofrequency ablation. Patients then receive routine drug
      therapy.

      ARM II: Patients receive routine drug therapy. Patients may later receive LCT at the
      discretion of doctor.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 18 weeks.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Oligometastatic solid tumors (see protocol for relevant disease sites) patients (=&lt; 5
             metastatic lesions at the time of study entry)

          -  Candidate for definitive local therapy to all sites of active disease per the
             discretion of the treating physicians

          -  No more than 4 prior lines of systemic therapy administered to treat metastatic
             disease

          -  Pathologically confirmed diagnosis of cancer as specified in protocol

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 500/mcL (performed within 6 weeks prior to study
             enrollment)

          -  Hemoglobin &gt;=7 g/dL (performed within 6 weeks prior to study enrollment)

          -  Serum total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 mg/dl (except for subjects with Gilbert syndrome, who may
             have total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dl) OR direct bilirubin =&lt; upper limit normal (ULN) for
             subjects with total bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 mg/dl (performed within 6 weeks prior to
             study enrollment)

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and
             alanine aminotransferase (ALT) serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) =&lt; 3 X ULN
             OR =&lt; 5 X ULN for subjects with liver metastases (performed within 6 weeks prior to
             study enrollment)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a diagnosis of active scleroderma, lupus, or other rheumatologic disease which in
             the opinion of the treating radiation oncologist precludes safe radiation therapy

          -  Metastatic effusion (e.g. pleural effusion or ascites). Note that patients with an
             effusion that is too small to sample will be eligible for the trial

          -  Diffuse metastatic processes including leptomeningeal disease, diffuse bone marrow
             involvement, and peritoneal carcinomatous, which by the discretion of the treating
             physician cannot be treated definitively

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial

          -  In the event that a curative systemic option exists for metastatic disease from a
             given disease site. First-line metastatic patients (those patients who have had no
             prior lines of systemic therapy targeting their metastatic disease) are only eligible
             for enrollment if they have completed their curative systemic therapy per the judgment
             of the treating oncologist and have persistent disease

          -  Is pregnant or expecting to conceive within the projected duration of the trial at the
             screening visit

               -  Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
                  pregnancy within 6 weeks prior to study registration up to the first fraction of
                  radiation

               -  Note: If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum
                  pregnancy test will be required

          -  Additional diagnosis of another primary malignancy outside of the malignancy being
             treated on trial that per the discretion of the treating physicians and
             investigational team offers a substantial risk to the patient's life (e.g. primary
             lung cancer definitively treated in the past 6 months would offer a significant risk
             to the patient's life, while a basal cell carcinoma treated with local excision would
             not)
