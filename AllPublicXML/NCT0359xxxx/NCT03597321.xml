  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT) is a curative option for
      patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, transplantation related toxicity and
      mortality as well as the existence of HLA identical sibling donor represent major
      limitations. Over the 20 past years, the development of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC)
      regimen and the use of alternative donors allowed extending the possibility of Allo-HSCT for
      AML, with decreased toxicity and mortality. This invited to propose this strategy to more
      advanced patients, making that AML recurrence has become one of the main issues after
      Allo-HSCT. Thus, to develop prophylactic and preemptive strategies to minimize disease
      recurrence after Allo-HSCT is now the main challenge in the field. Among cellular and/or
      pharmacological treatments after Allo-HSCT, donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) is probably one
      of the most commonly used treatments after Allo-HSCT. Indeed, DLI were reported as a
      potential efficient immunotherapy more than 20 years ago for the treatment of patients with
      leukemia relapsing after Allo-HSCT. However, most of experiences were reported in the setting
      of relapse after Allo-HSCT and no prospective evaluation of prophylactic DLI is available so
      far. Thus no strong recommendation for the use of DLI after Allo-HSCT can be made. Our study
      proposal would like to assess the question of prophylactic DLI efficacy, as a proof of
      concept of early immune intervention after Allo-HSCT. The investigators, therefore, designed
      a prospective multicenter randomized trial evaluating the impact of early DLI on outcome
      after Allo-HSCT for AML.

    <description>DLI will be collected from the donor by leukapheresis according to local standard procedures of each center. Cell product could be collected in one time or more, and administered fresh or after a frozen storage, according to each center's guidelines. A sufficient amount of T-cell dose should be collected to theoretically perform 3 DLI. DLI procedure will be performed according to local guidelines of each center.</description>
