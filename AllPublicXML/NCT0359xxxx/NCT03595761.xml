    <textblock>
      Purulent meningitis are life-threatening diseases in childhood. Cerebral vasculitis have been
      described in bacterial meningitis, but poor is known about their physiology and their impact
      on outcome.

      The investigators decide to realize a retrospective mono-centric study carried out at
      Montpellier university hospital which looks back at a 7-year study(2009-2016).

      The Investigators selected purulent meningitis cases based on the bacteriological data
      provided by the HDB (hospital data base). The Investigators divides in two groups : Group A
      if patients present a cerebral vasculitis ( radiologic diagnostic by RMI or
      tomodensitometry), in all, cases the diagnosis of vasculitis was confirmed by a radiologist
      specialised in neuropaediatrics by a second reading;Group B purulent meningitis with a
      cerebral vasculitis imaging.

      Tuberculous meningitis, meningitis in CSF shunt, and in patients having chemotherapy were
      excluded.

      The investigators report clinical and biological finding, inflammatory marker at the onset.
      The Investigators register also the clinical evolution and sequelae

      Meningitis steel are a cause of death in childhood. Cerebral complication are often
      responsable of poor prognosis. One of these complication vasculitis is steel not weel
      understood. There are only few study about it on children.

      It is a retrospective study about 17 cases of chil which bacterial meningitis coupled wiethe
      cerebral vasculitis, the Investigators will describe epidemiology, bacteriology, evolution
      and corticosteroid treatment in this patients.
