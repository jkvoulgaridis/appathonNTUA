  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to determine the potential of utilizing Short Message Service (SMS)
      messaging to improve health outcomes for patients with uncontrolled hypertension receiving
      care from the Outpatient Internal Medicine Clinic at Wake Forest Baptist Hospital.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pilot will evaluate the feasibility of implementing a Short Message Service (SMS) system
      and Home Blood Pressure Measurements (HBPM) in the Outpatient Internal Medicine (OPD) clinic
      at Wake Forest Baptist Hospital. Implementing a new short text messaging service will improve
      the health delivery system in three ways. 1) Increasing patient engagement: SMS and HBPM
      require an active commitment by the patients themselves in their medical care and results in
      a marked improvement in the adherence to medication. High adherence to home blood pressure
      (BP) measurements has also been reported to improve BP control. 2) Supporting patients
      outside of the office visits by identifying and resolving barriers to medication adherence
      earlier on (i.e. if patients are unable to get their prescriptions or are having significant
      side effects). 3) Adopting clinical guidelines to improve BP control in a vulnerable
      population.
