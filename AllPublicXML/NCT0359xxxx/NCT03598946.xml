  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a population-based, prospective, multicenter and open-label study. 12,500 female
      non-respondents to the uterine cervix smear from 30 to 65 years of age in the context of the
      organized cervical cancer screening of the uterus, in the 4 Breton departments, will be
      proposed after stratification by age and socio-economic level at the revival of the cervical
      cancer of the uterus screening by the structure of management of Rennes, an invitation to the
      Human Papilloma Virus urine test thanks to the sampling kit sent to the home. It is planned a
      revival by simple mail after 4 months in one woman out of two who did not respond to this
      invitation to assess the impact of a recovery. This group represents about 5% of the eligible
      population in Brittany. The specimen will be sent by post with the signed consent and a
      questionnaire to the Hospital of Brest in virology laboratory for the detection of Human
      Papilloma Virus DNA (QPCR) in the urine (HPU test) and typing (LipA). In the case of a
      positive Human Papilloma Virus test, the woman being tested has a strong incentive to do the
      cervical cancer of the uterus with her doctor or midwife. In the case of abnormal smear,
      follow-up continues according to national recommendations to a gynecologist. All the data is
      collected on a software from the LINKS company, with the networking of the 4 Breton centers,
      the virology laboratory, and the Anatomy-Cytology-Pathology laboratories in Brittany; this
      collection will allow after extraction, a statistical analysis of the data. The analysis of
      the participation rate in this new screening, for each level of the socio-economic level,
      will allow a comparison with the participation in smear's revival of organized screening,
      between women's groups according to the socio-economic level of their residential place.

      The project will take place over 24 months in 3 phases:

        1. D0-M6: Pre-inclusion phase with implementation of the protocol (regulatory procedures,
           production of newsletters, consent, questionnaire, preparation of urine collection kits,
           postal validation).

        2. M6-M18: Inclusion phase with start of the study, sending invitations and inclusion,
           Human Papillomavirus Urinary testing and uterine cervix smear monitoring.

        3. M18-M24: Post-inclusion phase with assessment of the inclusions on the 4 Breton
           departments, verification and analysis of the data according to the socio-economic
           level, recovery of the uterine cervix smear stimulus data, realization of the
           statistical analyzes and budget impact analysis, communications and publications.
