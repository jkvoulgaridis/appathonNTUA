  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Angular measurement of deviation is an essential element in the clinical evaluation of
      strabic patients. It is performed by orthoptic methods. However, studies show that the same
      patient presents a great variability of his angular measurement between 2 consultations, and
      between 2 observers.

      Automated angle measurement is a recent concept that aims to overcome the defects of
      subjective angle measurement by alternate occlusion test and prismatic bar.

      Improvements made by these devices would provide reliable, objective and reproducible
      measurements of the angle of deviation by increasing the accuracy of strabal angle
      assessment, improving decision making and surgical follow-up, decreasing inter-examiner
      variability and variability over time, and facilitating data comparison to improve scientific
      publication possibilities.

      The Gazelab® device is a video-oculograph combined with a laser projection system and an
      infrared camera. It allows an objective angular evaluation, in non-dissociating physiological
      conditions, possible even in the absence of binocular vision and allows an analysis of the
      deviation in all positions.

      There is extremely little data in the literature on automated measuring devices. The Gazelab
      tool is still little known in the strabology discipline and seems to have a number of
      advantages over other devices. The interest of this examination towards this pathology led
      the ophthalmology department to use it in the current practice, and since recently it is an
      act nomenclaturé.

      The objective of this work is to evaluate the reliability and reproducibility of the
      automated angular measurement by the Gazelab® (ES12/13127) apparatus, compared to the
      standard gold which is the angular measurement by alternate occlusion test and prismatic bar,
      in horizontal strabisms (converging and diverging). Indeed in our daily practice the 2
      examinations are carried out. To compare with the standard gold which denotes a strong
      inter-observer variability, the investigator will compare the results of the Gazelab to the
      alternate occlusion by prism bar (standard gold) 2 times with 2 trained examiners

        Strabismus is a pathology that affects 2 to 4% of the French population. The Ophthalmology
        Department sees 200 adult patients with strabismus per month. In 6 months it will be easy
        to include in 30 months 30 patients of convergent strabismus and 30 of divergent
        strabismus. For patients with eye strain who do not have eye refractive errors the
        Department of Ophthalmology sees 2000 patients per month, to include these 30 patients in 6
        months.

        Since this study is a prospective non-interventional research study, the patient may be
        part of a biomedical research study.
