  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to look at the brain's efficiency and ability to make
      up for deficits in the front of the brain to see if people living with HIV (PLWH) are still
      able to perform well on various cognitive tasks even though there are other underlying
      processes at work, like inflammation, that affect the brain in a negative way. Results of
      this study may provide insight into the pathophysiology of disease and may reveal arenas for
      future possible interventions in PLWH who have impaired neuropsychological performance.

      This proposal systematically characterizes brain efficiency and recruitment in virologically
      suppressed persons living with HIV (PLWH) and demographically similar HIV uninfected (HIV-)
      controls. This proposal collects advanced functional neuroimaging that provide critical
      information about cerebral blood flow (CBF) and brain connectivity (functional connectivity
      strength; FCS); quantitative measures of immune dysfunction in the blood and cerebrospinal
      fluid (CSF) (immune activation and immune exhaustion); and neuropsychological performance
      testing. This overall goal of this proposal is to delineate the interplay between dysfunction
      in frontal networks and recruitment of compensatory networks that underlie the
      neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in PLWH.

    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will compare the recruitment of compensatory networks between the PLWH and HIV- controls using multiple linear regression. In exploratory analyses the investigators will compare the brain efficiency between PLWH and HIV-, using similar multiple regression models, controlling for confounders. Among PLWH, the investigators will study the association of brain efficiency with neuropsychological performance testing using multiple regression models.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effects of Aging - Determine the effects of aging on brain efficiency and recruitment in virologically suppressed PLWH.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will compare the recruitment (response) between the four HIV age groups (HIV- &lt;50 year old, HIV- ≥50 years old, HIV+ &lt;50 years old, and HIV+ ≥50 years old) using a multiple regression (ANCOVA) model, adjusting for potential confounders (age, sex, education, past substance use, and CVD). The pairwise comparisons of primary interest is between the HIV- &lt;50 years old and the HIV- ≥50 years old groups. Among the PLWH only, the investigators will compare the brain efficiency r (response) between the younger and older group using multiple regression, adjusting for potential confounders. Secondly, a mediation analysis will examine the role of immune dysfunction (activation and exhaustion) markers as mediators of this relationship.</description>

      Blood (plasma and cellular) and CSF will be obtained for assessment of immune dysfunction
      (immune activation and exhaustion). Blood and CSF will be stored on ice until centrifuged
      (within 30 minutes of collection). EDTA-coagulated blood will be used to isolate PBMCs using
      the standard Ficoll separation method. PBMCs will be frozen at -80C in 90% FBS 10% RPMI for
      flow cytometry phenotypic analyses. Plasma, CSF and PBMCs will be aliquoted into vials and
      frozen (-80C) until at least 60 participants have completed their visit, at which time
      samples will be sent and batch-analyzed by Dr. Burdo.
