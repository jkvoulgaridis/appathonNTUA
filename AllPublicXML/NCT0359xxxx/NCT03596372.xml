  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1, first-in-human, dose escalation and expansion study designed
      to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and tumor response
      profile of the anti-Carcinoembryonic-antigen-related-cell-adhesion-molecule-6 (CEACAM6)
      antibody BAY1834942 in patients with advanced solid tumors known to have a prevalence for
      CEACAM6 expression.

      The study consists of dose escalation and a tumor type-specific expansion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate and characterize the tolerability and
      safety profile of repeated doses of BAY1834942, and to characterize the pharmacokinetics of
      BAY1834942 after single dose.

      Secondary objectives are to evaluate the tumor response profile, pharmacodynamics,
      pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity after multiple doses of the drug.
