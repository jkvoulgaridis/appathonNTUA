    <textblock>
      A multi-institutional, single arm phase II study of nivolumab, cabiralizumab and stereotactic
      body radiotherapy (SBRT) in patients with LAUPC. The purpose of this study is to determine
      the safety and tolerability of combined cabiralizumab, nivolumab and radiotherapy in the
      treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Investigators will also estimate the
      surgical resection rate following treatment with combined cabiralizumab, nivolumab and
      radiotherapy in subjects with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer.
