  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of intense dosing for a limited period in
      patients who demonstrate refractory disease on monthly IAI. Patients will be followed for 52
      weeks

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of biologic therapy targeting VEGF has been revolutionary and has lowered the
      rate of functional blindness in many developed countries. Modalities to treat nvAMD have been
      based on monthly dosing. For many patients, this modality is adequate and they can achieve a
      dry macula. A subset of patients can even have their treatment intervals extended. There is,
      however, a subset of patients with recalcitrant neovascularization for whom IAI fails to
      produce a dry macula even with q4w dosing. An intense dosing schedule for a short period of
      time could decrease fluid activity in these patients.
