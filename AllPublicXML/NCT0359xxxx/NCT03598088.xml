      The purpose of this clinical trial is to assess the ability of Ovaprene™ to prevent sperm
      from penetrating midcycle cervical mucus. In addition, safety, release of ingredients,
      acceptability and fit will be assessed.

         19. Nugent score greater than or equal to 7

         20. Systemic use in the last two weeks or anticipated use during the study of antibiotics
