  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most adolescents who receive human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine are vaccinated in pediatric
      practices, yet missed opportunities (MOs) for HPV vaccination occur often and lead to low HPV
      vaccination rates. This cluster randomized clinical trial (RCT) will test the effectiveness
      (and cost-effectiveness) of the addition of prompts (period 3) to performance feedback
      (period 2, continued through period 3) and training providers previously received on HPV
      vaccine communication (period 1) to reduce MOs and increase HPV vaccination rates.

      This intervention will incorporate prompts via electronic health record (EHR) (e.g. alerts in
      electronic charts indicating patient is due for vaccination) and study practice staff prompts
      (reminders from study staff that a patient is due for vaccination, e.g. placing Vaccine
      Information Statements (VISs) on desk) to study practitioners that encourage HPV vaccination
      at all visits. An initial learning module on practitioner prompts will highlight how study
      practices can consistently implement both EHR and staff HPV vaccination prompts at all
      visits. Throughout the intervention, text message mini-lessons will remind participants how
      to best use prompts via EHR and/or office staff to improve HPV vaccination rates. This trial
      focuses on study period 3 where study periods are as follows:

      Period 1: Arm-1 intervention study practices receive communication skills training; Arm-2
      comparison study practices provide standard of care. Period 2: Arm-1 intervention study
      practices add performance feedback, building upon their prior training in communication
      skills; Arm-2 comparison study practices continue delivering standard of care. Period 3:
      Arm-1 intervention study practices add prompts, building upon prior communication skills and
      performance feedback; Arm-2 comparison study practices continue with standard of care.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Practice Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The practice provides HPV vaccination services to adolescents.

          -  The practice is part of Physician's Computer Company (PCC), Office Practicum (OP) or
             (a) yet-to-be selected health system(s).

          -  The practice has had the same EHR system in place for a year or more (with special
             consideration on a case by case basis if they are close to but not do not reach a
             year).

          -  The practice agrees to not participate in other HPV-related QI projects or research
             interventions during the study period (with special consideration on a case by case
             basis).

        Practice Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The practice plans to change EHR systems in the next three years.

          -  The practice participated in the last year, is currently engaged in, or plans to
             participate in an office-based HPV-related quality improvement (QI) project or
             research intervention during the study period (with special consideration on a case by
             case basis).

          -  Estimated 20% or more of adolescents at the practice receive HPV vaccinations at
             schools or health department clinics (given standard practice and published data, the
             investigators expect that few to no practices will need to be excluded based on this
             restriction).

        Patient inclusion criteria:

        -All patients of participating practices (intervention and comparison) aged 11-17 years who
        have at least 1 visit to the practice within the past two years.

        Patient exclusion criteria:

        -None apart from age of patients (above).
