    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of AUTO4 a CAR T cell treatment
      targeting TRBC1 in patients with relapsed or refractory TRBC1 positive selected T-Non-Hodgkin
      Lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 2 phases, a Phase I/dose escalation phase and a Phase II/expansion
      phase. Patients with relapsed or refractory TRBC1 positive selected T-NHL will be enrolled in
      both phases of the study. Eligible patients will undergo leukapheresis to harvest T cells,
      the starting material for the manufacture of the autologous CAR-T product AUTO4. Following
      preconditioning by a chemotherapeutic regimen, the patient will receive AUTO4 intravenously
      as a single dose following which they will then enter a 24-month follow-up period
