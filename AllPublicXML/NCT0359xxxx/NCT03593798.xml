      Lifestyle intervention and physical capacity in patients with morbid Obesity (LEICO)
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is still uncertainty about which is the most effective lifestyle treatment to reducing
      body weight and increased quality of life. Increased physical capacity and muscle mass lead
      to increased energy expenditure, thus explaining parts of the difference in weight loss
      achieved after lifestyle treatment. However, literature in this area is limited and need
      better documentation of how, and to what extent increased physical capacity can affect the
      effect of lifestyle treatment offered to patients in the health service.

    <description>Can physical capacity before start of a routine medical care have a impact on weight loss at 1-year follow-up.
Body weight was measured with patients wearing light clothing and no shoes on Scanvaegt DS-530 (Århus, Denmark) at baseline and after 1-year follow up.

    <time_frame>Changes from baseline physical capacity at 12-weeks follow up.</time_frame>
    <description>Can the mean twelve-week change in physical capacity be associated with weight loss.
The maximal oxygen uptake test was performed as an incremental treadmill test on Woodway ELG 55 (Waukesha, Germany) or, for patients with walking restrictions, on an incremental bicycle test (Lode Corival V3, Lode BV, Groningen, Netherlands). Oxygen uptake was registered using the Jaeger oxycon pro ergospirometry test system (Jaeger Oxycon Pro JLAB 5.x, Hoechberg, Germany).
