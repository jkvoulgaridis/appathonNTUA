    <description>LenoDiar Pediatric acts thanks to Actitan-F, a plant-based molecular complex resulting from Aboca research which reduces attacks of diarrhoea and normalises the consistency of stools, helping to rapidly restore a balanced intestinal function.
Actitan-F counteracts the inflammation of the intestinal mucous membrane, always present in the case of diarrhoea, through two action mechanisms:
a protective action, achieved by forming a barrier-effect film to limit contact with microorganisms and irritants;
an antioxidant action on the free radicals which counteracts the irritation of the mucous membrane.</description>

             and 14 days prior to screening visit) or chronic (onset &gt;14 days prior to screening
             visit) diarrhea.

               -  Acute/Prolonged Diarrhea is defined as at least 3 evacuations of loose or watery
                  stools (stools type 6-7 of Bristol scale) occurring in the 24 hours preceding the
                  screening visit.

               -  Chronic Diarrhea (&gt;14 days duration), defined by passage of loose or watery
                  stools (Bristol score 6 or 7) with or without an increase in frequency of bowel
                  movements;

          3. Evidence of mild to moderate dehydration, defined as a score 1-4 in the Clinical

          6. For acute/prolonged diarrhea only, patients who have received any of the following
             treatments within the 2 weeks before the screening/baseline visit:

               -  Drugs with adsorbing properties, e.g. kaolin, pectin, bismuth subsalicylate;

               -  Drugs that modify intestinal secretions, e.g. racecadotril;

               -  Drugs that modify intestinal motility, e.g. opiates such as loperamide, atropine
                  and other anti-cholinergic agents);

               -  Laxatives

               -  Antibiotics

          7. History of seizures due to known or unknown causes;

          8. Parents/legal guardians' refusal or inability to give written informed consent to

             the electronic patient diary;

         10. Patients who may not be possible to come for the scheduled visits;

         11. Patients who have participated in any other clinical trial in the last 3 months prior
