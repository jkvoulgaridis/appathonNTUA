    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators evaluated for the first time the diagnostic efficacy of
      abioSCOPE® versus Phadia Laboratory System as an aid in the diagnosis of allergic diseases.
      Investigators targetted the agreement between test results obtained in abioSCOPE® and a
      laboratory reference method (Phadia Laboratory System, ThermoFisher Scientific, Uppsala,
      Sweden), considered as a quasi-gold standard in IgE (immunoglobulin E) antibody assays.
      Investigators also reported the medical decision taken by a panel of allergy experts who had
      access to patient history, skin tests and IgE antibody assay, but blinded to the method used,
      i,e, the reference method or the abioSCOPE® .

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects examined at ambulatory medicine medicine center CHUV / PMU and for wich serum
             sample is required for the research of specific IgE (allergic patients, allergic
             group) or for any other reason (immunological) (non-allergic control patients, control
             group)

          -  Subjects for which it is expected (allergic group subjects) or who will be asked
             (non-allergic control group) to perform a panel of standard prick tests as basic
             allergological investigation, including pollen birch, grasses, mites (D pter, D far),
             cat dander.

          -  Obtain informed consent from each subject before any study procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of positive HIV-1 viremia by the ultra-sensitive method in the 12 months
             preceding the study.

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine)

          -  Chronic administration (more than 14 days) of immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory
             drugs in the 6 months preceding the study for corticosteroids. This means a dose of
             Prednisone or equivalent substance greater than or equal to 0.5 mg per kg / day.
             Inhaled topical steroids are allowed.

          -  Administration of any immunoglobulin, any immunotherapy or administration of some
             blood products in the 3 months preceding the study, or planned during the study
             period.

          -  Any health condition or patient history, in the opinion of the investigator, could
             interfere with the evaluation of the study's objectives.

          -  Participation in another experimental protocol during the period of the study.

          -  Demonstration, confirmation or suspicion of a condition of immunosuppression or
             immunodeficiency (including HIV infection) based on medical history and physical
             examination (no laboratory test).

          -  A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.

          -  Subjects taking any of the following medications: antihistamines in the week preceding
             the consultation, systemic steroids (inhaled or nasal steroids are allowed),
             anti-cytokines or cytokines, systemic interferon (injection local interferon α for the
             treatment of HPV is allowed) or treated with systemic chemotherapy.
