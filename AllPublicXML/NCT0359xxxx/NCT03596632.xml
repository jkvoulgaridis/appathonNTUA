          -  Healthy male subjects, between 18 and 60 years of age, inclusive

          -  Within body mass index range 18 to 32 kg/m2, inclusive

          -  In good health, determined by no clinically significant findings from medical history,
             12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs, and physical examination

          -  For males who are sterile: agreement to use a condom with a fertile or pregnant female
             partner from Day -1 until 90 days following Study Completion; for males who are
             fertile: agreement to use a condom with spermicide with a fertile or pregnant female
             partner from Day -1 until 90 days following Study Completion

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or symptoms of any significant disease

          -  History of significant hypersensitivity, intolerance, or allergy to any drug compound,
             food, or other substance, unless approved by the Investigator

             follow-up

          -  Participation in any other investigational study drug trial in which receipt of an
             investigational study drug occurred within 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is
             longer, prior to Day -1

          -  Exposure to significant diagnostic or therapeutic radiation or current employment in a
