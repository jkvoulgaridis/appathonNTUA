  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis vulgaris is a common inflammatory condition of the skin that results in
      well-demarcated, scaly, erythematous, itchy plaques. In the United States, psoriasis remains
      a common, immune-mediated disease, affecting 7.4 million adults. Often topical prescription
      medications are used as first line treatment for moderate psoriasis. Some topical medications
      have side effects and risk with long time use, thus not ideal for extensive and indefinite
      amount of time. Conversely, over- the-counter emollient treatments are readily available,
      safe and potentially efficacious. This study is design to test the safety and efficacy of
      topical application of the Metaderm product cream. The Metaderm cream is non-prescription,
      natural product.

    <intervention_model_description>15 eligible patients will be enrolled. Patient will be treated for 12 weeks. There will be a total of five visits: screening, baseline, w4, w8 and w12. Metaderm cream will be applied topically twice a day to all active lesions. The metaderm scalp spray will be applied daily to the affected areas on the scalp. Patients will be provided with metaderm cleanser, can be use daily. For the subgroup for scalp psoriasis, patient will use the shampoo Head &amp; Shoulders formula with 1% Pyrithione Zinc as the active ingredient</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy as measured by the mean percentage change in the product of sPGA (static physician global assessment) and BSA (body surface area).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is primary efficacy measurement for treatment of plaque psoriasis. The PASI combines assessments of the extent of body-surface involvement in 4 anatomical regions (head and neck, trunk, arms, and legs) and the severity of scaling, redness, and plaque induration/infiltration (thickness) in each region, yielding an overall score of 0 for no plaque psoriasis and 72 for the most severe disease.
The sPGA is the physician's global assessment of the subjects plaque psoriasis at a given time point. Plaques are assessed for induration, erythema, and scaling and an overall rating of plaque psoriasis severity is gen using the anchors of clear (0), minimal (1), mild (2), moderate (3), severe (4), or very severe (5).
These assessments will be combined by multiplying the numerical outcomes of the SPGA and BSA assessments to form a product. The mean change in this product will then be reported as the efficacy outcome.</description>

    <measure>Efficacy as measured by the percentage improvement in the DLQI. (Dermatology quality of life index).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The dermatology quality of life index (DLQI) is a simple, subject administered, 10 question validated, quality of life questionnaire that cover 6 domains including symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work, and school, personal relationships, and treatment. Response categories include &quot;not at all&quot;, &quot;a lot&quot;, and &quot;very much&quot;, with corresponding score of 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and unanswered (&quot;not relevant&quot;) responses scored as &quot;0.&quot; The recall period is &quot;over the last week,&quot; totals range from 0 to 30 (less to more impairment), and a 5-point change from baseline is considered clinically relevant.</description>
