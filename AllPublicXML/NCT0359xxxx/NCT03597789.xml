  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to better understand how to best help parents of young children with problem
      behavior. Problem behaviors vary between and within children, but can include
      inattention/hyperactivity, tantrums, and/or noncompliance.

    <textblock>
      If eligible and choose to participate, this study includes:

      A baseline assessment which will include asking a series of questions about parent, child and
      family, as well as parent-child observations.

      If eligible for treatment, sessions occur once per week for approximately 8 to 12 weeks.
      Sessions include new information and lots of practice and discussion about how to make the
      skills work best for specific families.

      After finishing treatment a post-assessment (similar to BL) conducted.

      All of the assessments (i.e., video-and audio-recorded), as well as the sessions with a
      therapist will be recorded (i.e., video recorded).

    <measure>Change in Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through study completion, an average of 11 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ECBI is a 36 item parent-report scale. For each item, parents rate the intensity of the behavior (0 = never to 7 = always) and whether they consider each behavior to be a problem (0 = no; 1 = yes). Clinically significant symptoms are defined by scores more than 2 standard deviations above the normed mean for the Intensity Subscale (clinical cutoff = 127) and/or Problem Subscale (clinical cutoff = 11) Scales.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Difficulties with Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through study completion, an average of 11 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) will be used as the measure of caregiver's emotion dysregulation. The 36-item DERS yields a composite total score as well as scores for the following subscales: 1) Nonacceptance Subscale, non-acceptance of negative emotions; 2) Goal Subscale, difficulties in engaging in goal-directed behaviors when experiencing negative emotions, 3) Impulse Subscale, impulse control difficulties; 4) Strategies Subscale, limited access to emotion regulation strategies; 5) Awareness Subscale, lack of emotional awareness; and 6) Clarity Subscale, lack of emotional clarity. The DERS has high internal consistency, good test-retest reliability, adequate construct and predictive validity and is sensitive to change over time .</description>
