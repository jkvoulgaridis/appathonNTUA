  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of a novel food ingredient
      produced from rape seeds supplied as a snack-bar in a 4-week controlled intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An 4-week randomized, double-blind, controlled, parallel-group intervention for assessment of
      safety and tolerability of a novel rape seed ingredient (RI) followed by a 2-week follow-up
      period. Baseline measures for digestive symptom frequency questionnaire (DSFQ), blood safety
      tests and body mass index (BMI) will be collected at screening visit. At the randomization
      visit, participants' eligibility will be confirmed, and they will be randomly allocated into
      2 parallel groups consuming either 20 g (test group) or 0 g (control group) of RI within 2
      daily snack bars. During the intervention and follow-up periods participants will bi-weekly
      respond to a GI symptom questionnaire including DSFQ, stool frequency and stool consistency,
      and palatability items. At the end of the intervention period (week 4) a clinic visit
      including BMI and AE recording and blood safety tests will be held.
