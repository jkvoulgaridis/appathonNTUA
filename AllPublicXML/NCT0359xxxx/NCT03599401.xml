  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim and objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of low dose aspirin
      vs omega 3 fatty acids as adjuvants to non-surgical periodontal therapy and also to evaluate
      the levels of pentraxin 3 and glycosylated haemoglobin in diabetic patients with chronic
      periodontitis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an established bi-directional relationship between diabetes mellitus and
      periodontitis. Periodontitis causes systemic inflammation by the entry of oral pathogens and
      their virulence factors that adversely affect diabetic control in terms of elevated HbA1c
      levels.

      Host modulatory therapy (HMT) is a strategy prescribed as an adjunct to conventional
      periodontal treatment by downregulating inflammation and promoting protective or regenerative
      responses. Different drugs have been evaluated as HMT including NSAIDS, Doxycycline,
      Bisphosphonates.

      Aspirin has the unique position as HMT drug. It inhibits prostanoid production and induces
      15- epi- lipoxins which are bioactive than native lipoxins.

      Omega 3 fatty acids including Docosahexaenoic acid and Eicosapentaenoic acid due to their
      anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, hypolipidemia and vasodilator effect, reduce the
      inflammatory mediators to levels of healthy tissues.

      Pentraxins(PTX3) are classic acute phase proteins. They are a superfamily of evolutionarily
      conserved proteins considered to be the markers of acute phase inflammation. PTX3 is also
      known as TNF stimulated gene. It is produced abundantly in periodontal tissue by neutrophils,
      fibroblasts, monocytes and epithelial cells. The plasma levels of PTX3 is raised in
      inflammatory conditions. Hence it is taken as a biomarker.

    <intervention_model_description>A total of 42 subjects participated in the study. All the subjects underwent scaling and root planning and were divided into 3 groups Group 1 - low dose aspirin ( 75 mg) once daily Group 2 - omega 3 fatty acids (500 mg) twice daily Group 3 - placebo once daily</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Blood samples were collected by venepuncture of anti-cubital vein. 1ml of blood was collected. 1ml blood was subjected to centrifugation at 3000rpm for 10 min. The supernatant straw colored fluid (plasma) was separated into storage vial for plasma pentraxin 3</description>

    <measure>Change in Gingival Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Base line and 3 months after scaling and root planning</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of gingivitis was scored on all surfaces of selected teeth with Williams periodontal probe.Index teeth- 16, 12, 24, 36, 32, 44 .
CALCULATION:
Score around each tooth was totaled and divided by 4- score of tooth Index score- total of all scores per tooth/no. of teeth examined Inference 0.1-1.0- mild gingivitis 1.1-2.0- moderate gingivitis 2.1- 3.0- severe gingivitis</description>
