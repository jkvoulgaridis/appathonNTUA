      1. Aged ≥18；

        2. Locally advanced/metastatic non-small lung cancer (IIIb/IV) confirmed by pathology with
           measurable lesions；

        3. Patients with wild type EGFR/ALK must received two kinds of systemic chemotherapy
           before；Patients with EGFR mutation positive had experienced treatment failure with TKI
           in first line and Chemotherapy in second line ；

        4. ECOG：0-4；

        5. The subjects were treated with other drugs has been restored (NCI CTCAE version 4.0
           class 1 or less), which accept nitroso urea or mitomycin interval 6 weeks or more;
           Accept other cytotoxic drugs, bevacizumab (Avastin) (except local palliative
           radiotherapy), radiotherapy or surgery four weeks or more. EGFR TKI ≥2 weeks; Main
           organs function is normal；

        6. Fertile woman must perform a pregnancy test (serum or urine) 7 days before screened, or
           voluntarily adopt proper methods of contraception during the observation period and 8
           week after the last given apatinib. For man, surgical sterilization should be performed,
           or voluntarily adopt proper methods of contraception during the observation period and 8
           week after the last given apatinib；

        7. Patients voluntarily entered the study and signed informed consent form (ICF).
