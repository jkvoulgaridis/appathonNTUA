  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to investigate why some individuals exercise more than others by focusing on
      feelings related to exercise. This two part study first examines whether regular exercisers
      (n=30) and non-exercisers (n=30) differ in how a 30-minute moderate-intensity exercise bout
      makes them feel. All participants will walk on a treadmill for 30 minutes on two separate
      occasions and will be asked to report on how they feel before, during, and after exercise,
      how they anticipate that exercise will make them feel, and how they remembered feeling during
      exercise. In addition, after exercise session #2, non-exercisers will be randomized to: 1) a
      brief intervention focused on providing general information about the physical activity
      guidelines, or 2) a brief intervention which provides general information about physical
      activity guidelines, but also focuses on affective responses to physical activity.
      Non-exercisers will complete an identical, third exercise session approximately 1-week
      following this intervention. Further, all participants will receive a 12-week,
      Internet-delivered weight loss program following all exercise visits and physical activity
      will be assessed before and after the weight loss program.

    <description>The focus of this intervention is to help the participant to become more aware of their positive feelings and experiences related to exercise. They will learn about typical affective responses to exercise, view their own affective responses to exercise, and they will be taught cognitive strategies for altering affective responses to exercise. Participants will also receive general information about exercise safety, physical activity guidelines, and exercise intensity.</description>
