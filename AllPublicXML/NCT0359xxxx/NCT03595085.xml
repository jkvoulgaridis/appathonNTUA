      Evaluating the safety and outcomes of catheter directed thrombolysis following catheter
      fragmentation in acute high risk pulmonary embolism
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute pulmonary embolism is common, but its presentation highly varies ranging from
      asymptomatic to massive pulmonary embolism. Massive pulmonary embolism is a common
      life-threatening condition and represents the most serious manifestation among venous
      thromboembolic disease.

      Acute pulmonary embolism is considered the third most common cause of death among
      hospitalized patients . The mortality rate can exceed 58% in patients with acute pulmonary
      embolism presenting with haemodynamic instability , mostly occur within 1 hour of
      presentation.

      In patients with high risk pulmonary embolism , the main aim of therapy is to rapidly
      recanalize the affected pulmonary arteries with thrombolysis or embolectomy; to decrease
      right ventricular afterload and reverse right ventricular failure and shock, prevent chronic
      thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension , and decrease the recurrence risk.

      The first-line treatment in patients with acute high risk pulmonary embolism presenting with
      persistent hypotension and/or cardiogenic shock is intravenous thrombolytic therapy. However
      a significant proportion of patients may not be a candidate for Intravenous thrombolysis
      because of major contraindications. An alternative option in patients with absolute
      contraindications or has failed intravenous thrombolysis is surgical embolectomy , but the
      number of experienced tertiary care centers that can do emergency surgical embolectomy are
      limited.

      Percutaneous catheter mechanical fragmentation of proximal pulmonary arterial clots followed
      by local thrombolytic therapy is accepted as an alternative to intravenous thrombolytic
      therapy and surgical embolectomy because of their ability to rapidly recanalize occluded
      pulmonary blood flow. Several reports have shown that catheter-directed therapy is a safe and
      effective treatment for acute PE to restore pulmonary flow and decreasing Pulmonary artery
      systolic pressure , However, current knowledge on efficacy and safety of catheter-directed
      therapy in management of intermediate high risk pulmonary embolism is limited.

    <description>A(6)F multipurpose catheter will be advanced over a guide wire under fluoroscopic guidance and used to measure right heart and pulmonary artery pressures, then mechanical catheter fragmentation will be done using a pigtail catheter. The catheter will be quickly spun manually so as to fragment the central thrombus and establish initial flow into pulmonary artery. After ensuring initial flow, Initial bolus dose of streptokinase (250.000 international unit) will be given over 10 min followed by continuous infusion of (100.000 international unit per hour)for 24 hours</description>
