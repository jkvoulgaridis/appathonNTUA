      The primary objective of this phase 1 study is to determine the RP2D of HQP1351 in patients
      with GIST or other solid tumors. The secondary objective is to assess the safety,
      tolerability, PK and preliminary anti-tumor activities of HQP1351 in Patients With GIST or
      Other Solid Tumors.

             resistance (PDGFRA D842V mutation or NF1 mutation) or failed to previous treatment
             with imatinib or imatinib and at least one other TKI.

          3. ECOG≤ 2.

          4. Estimated survival at least 3 months.

          5. Adequate hematologic and bone marrow functions.

          6. Adequate renal and liver function.

               -  Troponin(I/T) ≤ Upper Limit of Normal;

               -  Ejection fraction &gt;40%;

               -  QTc interval ≤ 450 ms in male or ≤ 470 ms in female.

             and/or DBP &gt; 90 mmHg).

          8. Concurrent use any medication led to prolong QT interval.

          9. Pulmonary mean arterial pressure&gt;35 mmHg by ECHO.

         10. Significant severe cardiovascular conditions during previous TKI treatment.

         11. Uncontrollable hypertriglyceridemia.

         12. Performed major surgery (except for intravenous catheterization or bone marrow biopsy)
             within 14 days of first dose of HQP1351.

         13. Arterial thrombosis or embolism events such as cerebrovascular accident (including
             transient ischemic attack, TIA), or venous thrombosis events or pulmonary embolism
             within 6 months before the first dose of HQP1351 or deep vein thrombosis within 3

             being cured for 5 years or more, or complete removal of non-melanoma skin cancer or
             successful treatment of carcinoma in situ, or the controlled prostate cancer).

         16. Had active, symptomatic infections (including known infections of HIV, viral hepatitis
             (A, B, or C)). If there is no history of infection, screening is not required.
