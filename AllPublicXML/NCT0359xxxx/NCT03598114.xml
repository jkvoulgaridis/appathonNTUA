  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to empirically develop, test, and disseminate sustainability
      training to improve the institutionalization of evidence-based state tobacco control (TC)
      programs, and thus, tobacco-related health outcomes.

    <textblock>
      This study defines program sustainability as the ability to maintain programming and its
      benefits over time.

      The project builds upon the empirically-developed Program Sustainability Action Planning
      Model and Training Curricula. The training will incorporate experiential learning methods and
      includes: action planning workshops, development of action plans with measurable objectives
      to foster institutional changes, and technical assistance. The goal is to demonstrate change
      in sustainability outcomes in states who receive the Program Sustainability Action Planning
      Training compared to states that do not. After conclusion of the study, the sustainability
      training curriculum will be disseminated to all participating state TC programs.
      Additionally, the curriculum will be adapted for the use by any public health program in need
      of building sustainability capacity.

    <measure>Change in Program Sustainability Assessment Tool (PSAT) sustainability scores</measure>
    <time_frame>0 months,12 months, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PSAT is a questionnaire developed to measure the long-term feasibility of public health program, i.e., a program's degree of institutionalization. It consists of 40 self-report questions in eight domains, with five questions in each domain. Each question asks the participant to rate their agreement with a statement on a 1-7 Likert scale. PSAT questions address resource and staffing aspects in the following domains: 1) Environmental Support, 2) Funding Stability, 3) Partnerships, 4) Organizational Capacity, 5) Program Evaluation, 6) Program Adaptation, 7) Communications, 8) Strategic Planning. It is completed electronically at http://www.sustaintool.org.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the program being anchored in law, regulation or other organizational rules</measure>
    <time_frame>0 months, 12 months, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>This measure is defined as whether a state's tobacco control program is established or continued through state statute or regulation and/or if the program is stated in organizational doctrine as a permanent component of the auspice organization. This is a direct measure of formal institutionalization of tobacco control programs and will be measured as a simple binary quantity, zero for &quot;not present in law, regulation, or rule&quot; and one for &quot;present in law, regulation, or rule.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the program being included as part of regular budget</measure>
    <time_frame>0 months, 12 months, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as whether a state's tobacco control program is a regular (annual, quarterly, or otherwise) item of the budget of its auspice organization. It directly indicated formal institutionalization and will take one of two possible values, zero for &quot;not included in budget&quot; and one for &quot;included in budget.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in percentage of organizational budget allotted to tobacco control program</measure>
    <time_frame>0 months, 12 months, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the percentage of the state health department budget garnered by its tobacco control program. The measure will be continuous and theoretically range from 0% (no funding) to 100% (entire health department budget). This quantity measures institutionalization of a program both individually and relative to other state health programs.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in percentage of CDC-recommended tobacco control funding level actually spent</measure>
    <time_frame>0 months, 12 months, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the amount of program funding as a percentage of the amount recommended by the CDC. This quantity measures institutionalization of a program relative to an objective level of funding computed uniformly from state characteristics by the CDC. The measure ranges from 0% (no funding) to over 100% (above CDC-recommended level).</description>

    <description>Selected publicly funded tobacco control programs receive the intervention in the form of custom training curricula designed to identify and enable sustainable tobacco control programming at a state-organizational level. Sustainability is assessed at t=12 months and 1=24 months to capture potential impact of the training and curricula.
The intervention group will receive a follow-up survey inviting them to evaluate the training and their progress on executing their sustainability plan. The intervention group will also receive a follow-up survey inviting them to evaluate the technical assistance they have received from the research team. Responses on neither follow-up survey impact participants standing in the study</description>

    <description>In this condition, publicly funded tobacco control programs do not receive the designated program sustainability training and proceed with standard operations. Sustainability is assessed at t=12 months and t=24 months to compare against tobacco control programs receiving sustainability training
The control group will receive a follow-up survey inviting them to evaluate their progress on creating their sustainability plan. Responses on the follow-up survey do not impact participants' standing in the study</description>

    <intervention_name>Program Sustainability Action Planning Model and Training Curricula</intervention_name>
    <description>The Program Sustainability Action Planning Model and Training Curricula's conceptual model is driven by the theory of change and incorporates aspects of Kolb's experiential learning theory to produce a six step process: defining the program, assessing the program, developing an action plan, executing the action plan, evaluating sustainability, and reassessing and modifying. The study team will deliver in-person, hand-on workshops incorporating each of these aspects of the conceptual model. Following the workshop, intervention states will partake in technical assistance activities with the study team to track progress and troubleshooting challenges.</description>
