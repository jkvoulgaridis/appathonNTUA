  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder and is characterized by
      functional impairment in social communication, restricted interests, and repetitive
      behaviors.The children with ASD has been shown different drug responses from the normal
      population of children. The children with ASD maybe more prone to elevate anxiety and the
      difficult of sedation during MRI scanning.The purpose of this investigation was to compare
      the effectiveness of dexmedetomidine sedation in children with and without ASD undergoing MRI
      scanning.

    <textblock>
      The use of medications in adolescents and young adults with ASD is extremely common. However,
      few data address the effectiveness and harms of medications for procedural sedation in this
      population. It's advisable to be used as a first line medication with alpha-2 agonists for
      procedure sedation. The primary goal of this study was to compare the effectiveness of
      dexmedetomidine sedation, also determine the 50% and 95% effective doses in children with and
      without ASD undergoing MRI scanning.

    <measure>The 50% and 95% effective doses of intranasal dexmedetomidine</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 hours after MRI scanning</time_frame>
    <description>Children were randomly allocated to receive sedation with 1 of 4 doses (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 ug/kg) of dexmedetomidine. Sedation status was evaluated by a attending anesthesiologists every 5-10 min with a 6-point sedation scale, which was modified from the Modified Observer Assessment of Alertness and Sedation Scale (MOAA/S).Successful sedation was defined as an MOAA/S of between 0 and 3. Probit analysis (linear regression plot of log concentration vs percentage response) was used to estimate the 50% and 95% effective concentration values of dexmedetomidine.
MOAA/S scale:
0 Does not respond to a noxious stimulus
Does not respond to mild prodding or shaking
Responds only after mild prodding or shaking
Responds only after name is called loudly or repeatedly
Lethargic response to name spoken in normal tone
Appears asleep, but responds readily to name spoken in normal tone
Appears alert and awake, responds readily to name spoken in normal tone</description>

    <measure>sedation induction time</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 45 min after drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Successful sedation was defined as an MOAA/S of between 0 and 3, and sedation induction time was defined as the time from midazolam and dexmedetomidine administration to the onset of satisfactory sedation</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wake -up time</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 4 hours after drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Children were classified as awake if the MOAA/S was between 4 and 6. Wake -up time was defined as the time from successful sedation until the time that the child awoke</description>
