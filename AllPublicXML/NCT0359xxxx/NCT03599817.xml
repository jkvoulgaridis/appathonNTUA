  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity has become an epidemic worldwide and is considered one of the main causes related to
      type 2 diabetes. The World Health Organization reported that in 2016, 39% of adults were
      overweight, while the percentage of obesity was 13%, together 1900 million people were
      overweight/obese. While in 2014 it was reported that 8.5% of the population in the world
      suffered from type 2 diabetes. On the other hand, in the national context, the last report of
      2016 that 72.5% of the Mexican population suffers from overweight/obesity. In addition, in
      2006, 14.4% of Mexicans suffered from type 2 diabetes.

      Obesity is a complex chronic state that is developed by an imbalance between the energy
      ingested and the energy expended. In addition, obesity is considered a chronic inflammatory
      state of low degree of cause of the immune response generated, as a consequence of the
      increase of adipose tissue; what explains the imbalance in the markers of inflammation. This
      inflammation condition has been related to the generation of insulin resistance, the increase
      in glucose levels and the appearance of various pathologies such as type 2 diabetes and other
      risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.

      The Yaqui ethnic group is located in the center-south zone of the state of Sonora,
      distributed in 8 traditional villages. A recent study conducted in the Yaqui community
      reported a prevalence of overweight and obesity of 25% and 43% respectively. In 2008, a
      prevalence of type 2 diabetes of 18.3% was reported in its inhabitants.

      On the other hand, there are successful programs in reducing body weight through
      interventions aimed at modifying lifestyles such as eating habits and physical function
      called Lifestyle Modification Programs. These programs have been supported through controlled
      and randomized clinical trials. Such is the case of the Diabetes Prevention Program. Which
      has achieved weight reduction and increased physical activity in the subjects treated. The
      Diabetes Prevention Program has been recognized and adapted for the Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention and has been dubbed the &quot;National Diabetes Prevention Program&quot;.

      The present study is a translational research clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of
      a program to promote the parameters of obesity and diabetes in the cardiovascular communities
      in the Yaqui community of the state of Sonora.

      The study focuses on knowing if the program of promotion of healthy lifestyle can reduce the
      risk of developing type 2 diabetes in adults of the Yaqui ethnic group with overweight /
      obesity and with risk of diabetes of the state of Sonora, through the loss of body weight and
      the promotion of physical activity, in this way to improve obesity parameters and
      cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors.

      The primary hypothesis is that the implementation of a program promoting the healthy
      lifestyle aimed at adults of the Yaqui ethnic group of Sonora with a diagnosis of overweight
      or obesity and a Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC) ≥12 will significantly improve in the
      medium term (12 months) the body weight, triglycerides, fasting glucose and interleukin-6
      (IL-6).

      The secondary hypotheses will be as follows: the implementation of a program to promote a
      healthy lifestyle aimed at adults of the Yaqui ethnic group of Sonora with a diagnosis of
      overweight or obesity, and FINDRISC score ≥12 will improve significantly in the short term (6
      months) obesity parameters, blood glucose levels, insulin, lipid profile, blood pressure and
      physical activity.

      The implementation of a healthy lifestyle promotion program aimed at adults of the Sonoran
      Yaqui ethnic group with a diagnosis of overweight or obesity and a FINDRISC score ≥12 will
      significantly improve medium-term (12 months) obesity parameters, blood levels of insulin,
      lipid profile, inflammation markers, blood pressure and physical activity.

      The implementation of a healthy lifestyle promotion program aimed at adults of the Sonoran
      Yaqui ethnic group with a diagnosis of overweight or obesity and a FINDRISC score ≥12 will
      significantly improve long-term (18 months) obesity parameters, blood levels, lipid profile,
      blood pressure and physical activity.

    <description>Before implementing the healthy lifestyle program, it will be adapted according to the characteristics of the Yaqui community, their type of food and the activities they carry out, so that the intervention program is culturally accepted by the community. The intervention will consist of two stages, an intensive phase and a maintenance phase. In the intensive phase, 16 weekly group sessions will be given with the aim of achieving a 5% body weight loss and ensuring that the participants do at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week. In the maintenance phase, 6 monthly group sessions will be given in order to maintain the results achieved in the first stage. In the same maintenance phase, but from 12 to 18 months, the lifestyle trainers will make home visits to the participants. Lifestile trainers will record body weight, physical activity and food consumption. In this period there will be no sessions, only monthly visits.</description>
