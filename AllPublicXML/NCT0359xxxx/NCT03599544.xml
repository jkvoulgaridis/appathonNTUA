  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of robot-assisted therapy for adults more than 6 months
      after stroke on upper limb functioning. Half of the participants will receive robot-assisted
      therapy for the arm affected by stroke, and the other half will receive robot-assisted
      therapy plus training in how to use the weaker arm during every day activities.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that robot-assisted therapy can help people regain control of simple
      reaching or grasping movements, but these improvements don't generalize well to use of the
      weaker limb during everyday tasks.

      This study aims to refine and test a protocol named the Active Learning Program for Stroke
      (ALPS), which teaches people to use active problem solving strategies and a home program to
      improve function. Therapist-delivered ALPS instruction may incorporate use of strategies
      (e.g. STOP, THINK, DO, CHECK) modeled after the Cognitive Orientation for daily Occupational
      Performance (CO-OP) approach to improve real-world use of the paretic upper limb. We will
      evaluate whether the combination of robot-assisted therapy and ALPS training leads to better
      satisfaction and functional use of the weaker arm in persons with motor impairments more than
      6 months after stroke, as compared to robot-assisted therapy alone.

    <measure>Change from Baseline Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) at 6 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) will examine changes in motor function in the paretic upper extremity (UE) during basic reaching and grasping motions. All items are rated by a 3-point ordinal scale (0=cannot perform; 2=performs fully) with a total possible score of 60 points (reflex items will not be administered). Higher scores indicate better performance.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Motor Activity Log (MAL) is a self-report measure in which the person is asked to rate their use of the paretic arm and hand during 28 daily activities. Two scales are used for scoring: Amount of Use (AOU) and Quality of Movement (QOM). Scores range from 0 to 5 (0=not used at all, 5=as well as before stroke) and the average score for each scale is used to assess upper limb function. Higher scores indicate better performance.</description>

    <description>The Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) measures velocity-dependent resistance or spasticity during passive range of motion of nine upper limb movements of the weaker arm, using an ordinal scale that ranges from 0 to 4 (0=no increase in muscle tone, 4=affected part rigid in flexion or extension).

    <measure>Change from Baseline Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) Time at 6 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) quantifies motor ability in the paretic arm and hand during functionally based upper limb tasks. It consists of 3 parts that are scored separately: timed performance, strength, and an ordinal Functional Ability Scale (FAS). The FAS is scored by the evaluator post testing on a 6-point ordinal scale from 0 (does not attempt with the involved arm) to 5 (arm does participate; movement appears normal) and timed tasks have a maximum allotted time of 120 seconds. Higher FAS scores, greater grip strength (measured in kg) and faster time to accomplish tasks indicate better performance.</description>

    <description>The Confidence in Arm and Hand Movement (CAHM) Scale is a self-report measure of upper limb functional use during a variety of functional tasks (e.g. cutting food with knife and fork at restaurant, using potholders to remove a hot casserole from the oven). Participants rate how confident/certain they are that they can successfully complete each task (n=20) on a scale from 0 (very uncertain) to 100 (very certain). Item scores are averaged to provide a total confidence score (Max score = 100 points).</description>
