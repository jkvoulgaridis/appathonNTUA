  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well savolitinib works in treating patients with MET
      amplified colorectal cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) or
      cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). Savolitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To estimate the objective response rate (ORR) of savolitinib in patients with MET
      amplified metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the clinical activity (duration of response, progression free survival [PFS])
      of savolitinib in patients with MET amplified metastatic CRC.

      II. To describe the toxicities of savolitinib in patients with MET amplified metastatic CRC.

      III. To explore the effect of RAS mutation status on response to savolitinib. IV. To explore
      any correlation between tissue and blood based biomarkers and clinical outcomes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive savolitinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 12
      weeks thereafter for up to 2 years.
