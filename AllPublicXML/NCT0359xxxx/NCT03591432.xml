  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Induction of general anaesthesia in patients undergoing emergency surgery can be challenging,
      because of the often suboptimal circumstances under which anaesthesia has to be delivered, as
      well as potential physiological derangements caused by their underlying illness, especially
      in elderly patients. Pre-oxygenation is usually achieved using oxygen delivered via a
      facemask before induction of anaesthesia. In patients undergoing elective surgery, the lungs
      are normally ventilated with a bag/facemask technique after induction. However, these options
      for oxygenation are limited. Facemask ventilation has a perceived risk of gastric
      insufflation of gas, leading to increased intragastric pressure and raised risk of pulmonary
      aspiration of stomach contents. Nasal cannulae have been recommended as an alternative method
      of delivering continuous oxygen during induction of anaesthesia. The Aim of this study is to
      compare the effect of transnasal humidified rapid insufflation ventilatory exchange (THRIVE)
      oxygenation with facemask oxygenation on extended apnoeic period and postoperative
      respiratory complications in elderly patients undergoing induction of anaesthesia.

    <description>Transnasal humidified rapid insufflation ventilatory exchange (THRIVE) is a new technique that is available for use in critically ill patients and in patients with difficult airways. The technique combines the benefits of apneic oxygenation and CPAP with a reduction in CO2 levels through gaseous mixing and flushing of the dead space. THRIVE is administered through a standard, commercially available, nasal, high-flow oxygen delivery system. Insufflation of O2 up to 70 L/min via a purpose-made nasal cannula is used initially to provide preoxygenation, which can be continued during intravenous induction until a definitive airway is secured. The THRIVE technique has been demonstrated to appreciably prolong the safe duration of apnea while avoiding increase in CO2.</description>

    <description>Nowadays pre-oxygenation is usually achieved using oxygen delivered via a facemask before induction of anaesthesia; this potentially extends the time available for securing the airway before hypoxaemia to 6 min. In patients undergoing elective surgery, the lungs are normally ventilated with a bag/facemask technique after induction, and this can be repeated if attempts at intubating the trachea are prolonged.</description>
