  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to compare the effects of semaglutide (Ozempic®) with the
      effects of other treatments for type 2 diabetes in a normal practice setting. The participant
      will be assigned by chance (like flipping a coin) to one of the following treatment groups:
      Group 1: semaglutide (Ozempic®) (by injection into skin) Group 2: standard of care
      antidiabetic medication (oral or injectable). The participant has an equal chance of being in
      either of the treatment groups. Neither the participant nor the study doctor or study staff
      will be able to pick which group the participant is in, but the participant will know which
      study drug the participant has been assigned to. The study doctor will provide the
      participant with a prescription for the study diabetes medication based on the treatment
      group the participant is assigned. The participation will last about 2 years.

    <measure>Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire, change version (DTSQc), Total treatment satisfaction score</measure>
    <time_frame>At year 1</time_frame>
    <description>The DTSQc provides a measure of how satisfied patients are with their current diabetes treatment compared with previous treatment. It consists of 8 questions, which are to be answered on a Likert scale from -3 to +3 (-3 = much less satisfied now to +3 = much more satisfied now), with 0 (midpoint), representing no change. Six questions are summed to produce a Total treatment satisfaction score. The remaining two questions concern perceived frequency of hyperglycemia and perceived frequency of hypoglycemia, respectively. The DTSQc Total treatment satisfaction score ranges from -18 to +18, with higher scores associated with greater treatment satisfaction.</description>

    <description>The SF-12 v2 is a 12-item generic health-related quality of life measure that assesses physical and mental functioning. The items will be scored using the scoring software. It contains two summary scores: Physical summary component (PCS) Score and Mental summary component (MCS) Score. The scores are norm-scored such that the scores range from 0-100 with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. A higher score is associated with better quality of life and a lower score, poorer quality of life.</description>
