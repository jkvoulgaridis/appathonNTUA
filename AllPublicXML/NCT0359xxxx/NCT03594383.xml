      The specific objectives focus on using a train-the-trainer model to educate CHWs in Pakistan
      on performing and interpreting pediatric lung POCUS. In the first phase, the POCUS experts
      from Toronto will rigorously train the first generation of local lung POCUS users who are
      Pakistani health care providers to become local lung POCUS trainers. These first generation
      trainers will subsequently collaborate with the POCUS experts from Toronto to develop a
      two-day training program for lung POCUS image interpretation and acquisition that is tailored
      to novice users (CHWs) in low-resource settings. In the second phase, the first generation
      local lung POCUS trainers will deliver and evaluate the new training program to the second
      generation of users - a group of CHWs in Karachi. In the third phase, we will establish the
      reliability of CHWs to perform lung POCUS on pediatric patients with respiratory symptoms,
      upon completion of the training program developed by local trainers.

      POCUS is an example of technologies that are moving out of hospitals and to the
      point-of-care. The true potential of these novel diagnostics to improve global pediatric
      pneumonia outcomes will only be realized if they can be employed by CHWs in community
      settings in LMICs. No work has yet focused on the performance of POCUS by
      non-medically-trained CHWs in LMICs. Demonstrating that accurate POCUS performance and
      interpretation can be achieved by non-medically-trained CHWs after focused and succinct
      training is the first step towards developing a novel pediatric pneumonia diagnosis and
      management algorithm for LMICs. Feedback from these ultrasound-na√Øve users about their lung
      POCUS learning experience is also needed to clarify which POCUS findings would be best suited
      to this algorithm.

      The research team in AKUH will recruit and consent interested CHWs from AKU field sites in
      Karachi. The target is to recruit a convenience sample of 3 CHWs, who will be as
      representative as possible of the experience and skill sets as the average CHW in a
      government program. Study participants will be identified and approached by clinical team
      members in the AKUH emergency department, outpatient clinic and pediatric ward.

      Triaging children with ARI into accurate treatment categories will lead to increased
      paediatric pneumonia survival, improved antibiotic stewardship, and more appropriate resource
      use, all of which are clinically and programmatically significant in highest disease burden
      settings. This project also lays the foundation for future projects that harness the
      trans-formative potential of POCUS for global child health.

    <measure>primary outcome of interest will be the inter-rater reliability of lung POCUS findings (on a cohort of patients at AKUH with ARI) between the newly trained CHWs and a local lung POCUS trainer.</measure>

    <description>Proportion of CHWs undergoing training in lung POCUS with a passing score 80% in a computer-based test (consisting of 60 lung POCUS video clips) with questions to determine their image interpretation skills as a reflection of technical performance. On completion of training program, they will perform lung POCUS on pediatric patients presenting to Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) with respiratory symptoms.
For primary outcome of inter-rater reliability, the Cohen's kappa statistic will be calculated using standardized formulas. in the end will be describing the kappa statistic between final interpretations (overall and for each lung zone) of each scan by the CHWs as compared to the POCUS expert.</description>

    <description>the assessment of the first generation local lung trainers will include:
a computer-based test with 60 questions as an indication of general knowledge pertaining to lung POCUS
OSATS as indication of their technical performance
5 mentored scans observed by POCUS experts
20 lung scans with quality assurance performed by POCUS experts
Upon completion of the Train the trainer phase, the first generation users will be deemed qualified local lung POCUS trainers. Subsequently, these new trainers will collaborate with the POCUS experts from Toronto to develop training program B, which will be modified to target novice non-physician users.</description>

POCUS recordings (with no patient identifiers) will be made for each patient scan performed by the CHWs. These clips will be captured via the Lumify device and uploaded to a computer and then to an online server, from which a blinded pediatric lung POCUS expert in Toronto can download and perform the quality assurance check.
