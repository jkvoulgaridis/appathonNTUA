  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The shortage of organs has always been a problem in pediatric liver transplants due to the
      lack of donors with an adequate size. Different techniques of hepatic reduction have been
      described that allow to use larger organs in the pediatric population. However, in these
      techniques the maximum reduction achieved by segments 2 and 3 is excessive for low-weight
      children. Since 1997 the liver transplantation group at Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires has
      developed and practiced a technique called hepatic hyper-reduction, which consists in
      reducing the lateral segment of a living donor, adapting the shape and size of the graft to
      the needs of the recipient. The investigators have performed approximately 50 pediatric liver
      transplants with live donors in low weight children in whom the hyper-reduction technique has
      been applied. The aim of the present study is to describe postoperative morbidity and
      mortality and analyze overall and graft survival.
