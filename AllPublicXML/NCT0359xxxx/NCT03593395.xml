  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center study will compare the effectiveness of adding virtual peer mentoring (PM)
      to a structured education-based (STE) transition program for emerging adults with sickle cell
      disease to determine its effect on decreasing the number of acute care visits per year,
      improving patient-reported outcomes, and reducing healthcare utilization among emerging
      adults with sickle cell disease (EA-SCD)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, cluster randomized study comparing the effectiveness of adding
      virtual peer mentoring (PM) to a structured education-based (STE) transition program based on
      the 6 core elements of transition in improving acute care reliance, quality of life and
      satisfaction with transition process in emerging adults with sickle cell disease (EA-SCD).
      The study will involve a total of 14 large (&gt;80 EA-SCD currently in pediatric care) and
      small-scale (â‰¤80 EA-SCD currently in pediatric care) clinical sites, with a 1:1 randomization
      at the site level. The study will involve approximately 700 subjects, 120 peer mentors, and
      25 advisors. The primary endpoint of this study will be the average number of acute care
      visits per year over a minimum of 24 months. Secondary objectives are to compare the
      effectiveness of STE+PM versus STE alone at improving patient-reported outcomes and reducing
      healthcare utilization among EA-SCD. Enrollment is anticipated to occur over 18-24 months
