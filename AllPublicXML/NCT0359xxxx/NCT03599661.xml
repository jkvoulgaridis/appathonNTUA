  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this project is to adapt and validate an eHealth fertility preservation
      decision-making support tool (Fertilit-e) for young adults with cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal is to utilize innovations in eHealth technology to address fertility
      preservation knowledge deficits and decision-making options for young adults with cancer ages
      18-39 years of age. Every year, approximately 70,000 young adults (ages 18-39) are diagnosed
      with cancer, which can significantly affect their health-related quality of life in multiple
      areas, including the potential for infertility or other reproductive challenges. Despite
      this, very few young adults diagnosed with cancer are actually provided fertility
      preservation information let alone effective strategies or tools for how to best navigate
      their fertility preservation options. It is critical to provide decision-making information
      and support about infertility risk and existing interventions to maintain reproductive
      potential in a delivery mode that is most congruent with this population's health
      communication style, such as eHealth applications.

      The goal is to adapt and optimize fertility preservation content in a tailored mHealth tool
      for fertility preservation decision-making. More specifically, the team will adapt
      fertility-preservation content for tailored, rapid, and clear dissemination of information in
      an engaging, cross-platform, patient-friendly mHealth format. The study team will alpha-test
      this tool with an ethnically diverse sample of cross-cultural end users to collect
      qualitative data and evaluate usability and comprehensibility to refine content and design.
      No formal hypothesis testing will be done.
