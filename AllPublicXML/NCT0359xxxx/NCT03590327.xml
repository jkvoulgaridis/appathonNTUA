  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apathy, a profound loss of initiative and motivation, is often seen in older Veterans with
      memory problems. Apathy leads to serious health problems, increases dependency, and caregiver
      burden. If untreated, apathy hastens the progression to frank dementia. In a pilot study, the
      investigators found that apathy, working memory, and function can be restored using magnetic
      stimulation in some but not all older Veterans. The reason for this variation is unknown. The
      investigators propose a three-phase study in 125 older Veterans with mild memory problems.
      Their motivation, memory, and function will be measured periodically. Veterans with apathy
      that are eligible for treatment will receive either real or sham magnetic stimulation to the
      front part of their brain over 20 sessions. Genetic testing and biomarkers will be used to
      differentiate those who respond to magnetic stimulation from those who do not. Impact on
      function, quality of life, and rates of progression to dementia will also be studied.

      measured periodically. Veterans with apathy that are eligible for treatment will receive
      either real or sham magnetic stimulation to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex over 20 daily
      sessions on consecutive week days. Genetic testing and biomarkers will be used to
      differentiate those who respond to magnetic stimulation from those who do not. Impact on
      function, quality of life, and rates of progression to dementia will also be studied.
