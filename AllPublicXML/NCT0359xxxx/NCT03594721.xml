        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Volunteers can be male or female, 18 to 65 years of age with no known medical

          -  Volunteers must fall within Fitzpatrick Skin Type I-V.

          -  Volunteers must be willing to avoid sun exposure to the study treatment area (lower
             back) for the duration of the study.

          -  Volunteers must commit to meeting all study requirements, including 11 days of
             sequential office visits for product application, HEV exposure, biopsy and suture
             removal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Volunteers who are pregnant, breast feeding or planning a pregnancy during the study

             consecutive days (e.g. steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, insulin,
             antihistamines, antihypertensive, antibiotics-e.g quinolone, tetracycline, thiazides,
             fluoroquinolones), or any medication known to cause abnormal responses to HEV light
             exposure (e.g. vitamin A derivatives, psoralen, aminolevulinic acid derivatives,
             etc.), or having planned to use these medications during the study.

          -  Volunteers who have damaged skin in close proximity to test sites (e.g. sunburn,
             uneven skin tones, tattoos, scars or other disfigurations)

          -  Volunteers who have used a prescription hydroquinone, non-hydroquinone skin lightening
             or brightening agent, or like product in the test area, within the past 3 months.

          -  Volunteers who have used a non-prescription cosmetic anti-aging or skin lightening
             product known to affect dyschromia or hyperpigmentation, in the test area, within the
             past 4 weeks.

          -  Volunteers who have a history of scarring, hypertrophic scarring or keloid formation
             anywhere on their body.

             visit window for any reason(s).

          -  Volunteers with any disorder that may prevent compliance, such as history of chronic
             alcohol or drug abuse, significant mental or nervous disorder or other illness that
             would, in the evaluator's opinion, interfere with the study.

          -  Have participated, or are participating in, another study within the past 4 weeks.

          -  Any dermatologic disorder which, in the investigator's opinion, may interfere with the
             accurate evaluation of the study treatment area (lower back), but not limited to
             melasma, any active inflammatory skin condition (i.e. post inflammatory
             hyperpigmentation), severe acne vulgaris, acne conglobata, acne fulminans, seborrheic
             dermatitis, and lupus erythematosus.

          -  Volunteers who have demonstrated a previous hypersensitivity reaction to any of the
