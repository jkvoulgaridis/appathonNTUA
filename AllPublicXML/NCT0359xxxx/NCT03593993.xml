  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a surgical biospecimen collection study. The purpose of this study is to understand
      how much of two drugs (dabrafenib and trametinib) are able to penetrate brain tumors and turn
      off the RAF signaling pathway. This is important because these drugs are currently FDA
      approved for other tumors and may have efficacy in brain tumors with the BRAF V600E mutation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to establish concentrations of dabrafenib and trametinib in
      enhancing brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid from people with BRAF-V600E mutant recurrent
      gliomas who undergo tumor resection. The exploratory goals are to measure the amount of ERK
      signaling pathway activity, to identify mechanisms of resistance to these drugs, and evaluate
      feasibility of measuring tumor DNA in cerebrospinal fluid.

      People (adults or children) with brain tumors who are already taking dabrafenib and / or
      trametinib and are in need of a surgical resection are potentially eligible. On the day of
      surgery, blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and tumor tissue will be collected for research
      purposes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have a history of primary brain tumor (including but not limited to
             glioblastoma (GBM), anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), anaplastic ganglioglioma (AG), and
             anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA)).

          -  Subjects must have a BRAF-V600 mutation identified in previous tissue analysis (may be
             IHC or PCR based). Allowable mutations include V600E, V600K, V600R, and V600D.

          -  Subjects must be taking dabrafenib at a dose of at least 50mg twice daily (adults
             only) and / or trametinib at a dose of at least 1mg daily (adults only) for at least 7
             days prior to surgery as prescribed by their treating physician. Note: Pediatric
             patients may be taking any dose of dabrafenib and / or trametinib as prescribed by
             their treating physician for at least 7 days prior to surgery.

          -  Subjects must be undergoing surgery for clinical purposes.

          -  Written informed consent - a signed informed consent and/or assent (as age
             appropriate) for study participation will be obtained according to institutional
             guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are receiving any other investigational agents or chemotherapeutic
             agents.

          -  Subjects for whom collection of blood, spinal fluid, or tissue samples is unsafe or
             clinically inadvisable.
