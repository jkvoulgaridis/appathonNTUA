    <textblock>
      This trial studies image-guided biopsies work in identifying mechanisms of resistance in
      participants with castration resistant prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the
      body and who are undergoing radioligand therapy (RLT). Tissue sample collected from a biopsy
      may help determine why response to RLT varies among patients, and this may help researchers
      to find better treatments for advanced prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Proportion of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients with
      altered signaling pathways after radioligand therapy assessed by phospho-proteomics of biopsy
      samples.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Generation of patient derived xenograft (PDX) models to determine if tumor levels of
      activity for individual adaptive pathways are related to the best prostate specific antigen
      (PSA) response.

      II. Sequencing to identify frequently mutated genes such as TP53 and ATM.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo image-guided biopsy over 45 minutes prior to first RLT course and 1-2
      days after the third RLT course.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Volunteer patient

          -  Histologically confirmed prostate cancer

          -  Enrolled in Lu-PSMA-617 treatment trial (Institutional Review Board [IRB]# 17-000330)

          -  Based on positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) images: evidence
             of lymph node or soft tissue metastatic disease amenable to image-guided biopsy

          -  Platelets &gt; 75,000/ul within 14 days prior to biopsy

          -  Prothrombin time (PT) or international normalized ratio (INR) and a partial
             thromboplastin time (PTT) &lt; 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Patients on warfarin, aspirin, or other anti-coagulants are eligible provided they are
             deemed able to tolerate discontinuation of anti-coagulation for one week prior to the
             biopsy. Conversion to low molecular weight heparin prior to biopsy is permitted per
             local standard operating procedures, provided there is agreement regarding the
             procedure between the treating physician, the interventional radiologist and the
             principal investigator (PI)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with significant congenital or acquired bleeding disorders (e.g. von
             Wildebrand's disease, acquired bleeding factor inhibitors) are not eligible
