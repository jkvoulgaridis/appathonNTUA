      This trial studies how well rectal administration of opioids using the Macy catheter works in
      reducing pain in patients with cancer that has spread to other anatomic sites or is no longer
      responding to treatment. Rectal administration of opioids using the Macy catheter may help to
      reduce the cost of care, resolve the issue of medication availability currently faced in the
      form of parenteral opioid shortage throughout the country, and provide adequate comfort and
      symptom relief for patients with smoother transition out of hospital.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the feasibility of using the device 'Macy catheter' for rectal administration of
      opioids for comfort in cancer patients on palliative care.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the ease of use, level of satisfaction and overall perception of
      effectiveness of 'Macy catheter' for rectal administration of opioids for pain control in
      advanced cancer patients, by the hospital bedside nursing staff.

      II. To assess patients' (or primary care-giver's) experience of using the 'Macy catheter' 48
      hours after discharge from the hospital.

      III. To assess the hospice staff (or primary care-giver's) experience of using the 'Macy
      catheter' after patient's death.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo placement of rectal catheter and receive opioids through the Macy catheter.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of using the device 'Macy catheter' for rectal administration of opioids for comfort in cancer patients on palliative care as defined by number of doses administered and patient satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed by the number of doses that a patient finishes (at least 4 out of 6 doses administered) and by asking patients' about their level of satisfaction and overall perception of effectiveness of using the device, collected by question 10 and 11 in the survey, respectively. The association between patients' demographics and clinical characteristics and patients' satisfaction and perception of effectiveness will be evaluated by Wilcoxon rank sum test and chi-square (or Fisher's exact) test for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. In order to address the primary objective, the feasibility rate will be estimated and reported along with a 95% Clopper-Pearson exact confidence interval.</description>
