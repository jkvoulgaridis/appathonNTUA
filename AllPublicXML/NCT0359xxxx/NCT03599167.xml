  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The indications that motivated the decision to transfuse (or not) were analyzed to verify
      compliance with HAS recommendations. Medical records from 57 premature infants &lt; 32 weeks
      hospitalized between 2016 -2017 were retrospectively analysed, especially all the events
      related to monitoring of hemoglobin level and RBC transfusions during the first month of
      life. The criteria (postnatal age, rate of haemoglobin, type of breathing assistance, oxygen
      needing, medullary regeneration) on which rely the decision process in the HAS algorithm for
      the RBC transfusion were also considered, as well as the final decision actually adopted for
      each case (transfused/ not transfused). All this made it possible to determine the kappa
      coefficient for evaluation of agreement with HAS new guidelines in the investigator's medical
      staff.
