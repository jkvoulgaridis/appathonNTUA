  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by swelling, pain,
      and synovial damage. Effective methods lack in the treatment of RA. A traditional
      prescription in use for thousands of years in China, Huang Qi Gui Zhi Wu Wu
      Tang(HQGZWWT)granule is still chosen to relive pain and prevent joint malformation in RA
      patients. However, no evidence-based medical research has been organized to assess the
      effectiveness and safety of HQGZWWT granules for RA.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will conduct a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      clinical trial to determine whether HQGZWWT granules can relieve pain and protect joints.
      Investigators will randomly divide 120 patients with active arthritis for 3 months. Main
      measurements include ratio of 50 of ACR (American College of Rheumatology), change of DAS
      (28) from baseline to 3 months, and SHARP scores of van der Heijde from baseline to 12
      months. SecondarymeasurementsincludeACR20, ACR70, Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability
      Index (HAQ-DI), arthritis pain score, and Patient Global Assessment of Arthritis. The time
      points are set as baseline, 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months. In
      addition, the rate of change (score) in the ACR50 and DAS28 from the baseline to 2-week,
      1-month, 2-month, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up are also the secondary outcome measures.

    <description>ACR (American College of Rheumatology) 50 is a standard to describe RA symptoms. ACR 50 is met when the number of tender joints reduces by ≥50%, the number of swollen joints by ≥50%, and at least 3 of the following 5 indexes improves by ≥50%:
Patient's assessment on arthritis pain using a visual analogue scale (VAS) of 0-100 mm, Patient global assessment on disease activity using VAS scale (0-10), Patient's assessment on physical function and disability (Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI)), Acute phase reactant value, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive Protein (CRP) level</description>

    <description>The DAS28 is an index calculating the number of painful and swollen joints (28 joints, i.e. shoulders, elbows, wrists, metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints, and knees), erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the score of global assessment. The formula of DAS 28 is 0.56×√(28 painful joint count) + 0.28×√(28 swollen joint count) + 0.70× (ln ESR) + 0.014 ×GH. ESR refers to erythrocyte sedimentation rate.
