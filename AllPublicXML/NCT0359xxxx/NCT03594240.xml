  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Homocysteine levels have been found elevated in T1DM patients with Diabetic nephropathy (DN)
      due to several causes, including dietary deficiencies. Hyperhomocysteinemia induces renal
      injury and is associated with increasing urinary albumin excretion(UAE). Therefore, the
      investigators performed a randomized-controlled trial of oral supplementation with vitamin B
      complex as an adjuvant therapy for nephropathy in pediatric patients with T1DM and assessed
      its relation to homocysteine levels, glycemic control, microalbuminuria and cystatin C as a
      marker of nephropathy.

      This trial included 80 vitamin B12-deficient T1DM patients with nephropathy, despite oral
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors . Enrolled patients aged 12-18 years with at least 5
      years disease duration and HbA1c ≤8.5%. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups;
      intervention group who received vitamin B complex once daily orally . The other group did not
      receive any supplementation and served as a control group. Both groups were followed-up for
      12 weeks with assessment of plasma homocysteine, HbA1c, cystatin C and UAE.
