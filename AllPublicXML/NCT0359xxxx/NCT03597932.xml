  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Implementation of a standardized handover checklist for intraoperative anesthesia care
      transition attenuates burnout among anesthesiologists and improves postoperative outcomes of
      patients undergoing major surgery , both of which benefit the quality of patient care and the
      development of anesthesiology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many retrospective studies have demonstrated that among adults undergoing major surgery,
      complete handover of intraoperative anesthesia care compared with no handover was associated
      with a higher risk of adverse postoperative outcomes. Anesthesiologists keeping on working
      without handovers may experience symptoms of burnout which do not only pose a threat to the
      mental and physical health of the anesthesiologist, but also result in sub-optimal safety
      care of patients. Poor-quality handover without standardized processes can lead to diagnostic
      and therapeutic delays and precipitate adverse events. An improved system of anesthesia
      standardized handovers using a checklist would improve transfer of information and
      professional responsibility and therefore lead to the improvement of patient safety as well
      as burnout among anesthesiologists. Thus it is urgent to develop a standardized handover
      checklist for intraoperative anesthesia care to improve postoperative outcome of patients.

    <description>Following a review of relevant literatures and guidelines, a checklist consisting of the various key items necessary for giving continuing and safe intraoperative patient care was designed and validated by anesthesia residents and staff. Following 2-week to 1-month baseline data collection, each anesthesiologists and anesthesia residents in participating hospitals were asked to implement the safe-anesthesia checklist to improve practice over another 2-week to 1-month period. The checklist consists of an oral confirmation and closed-loop communication between the primary anesthesiologist and the replacement anesthesiologist. Evaluation of the effect of implementation of a standardized checklist during anesthesia care handover on patient safety during follow-up.</description>
