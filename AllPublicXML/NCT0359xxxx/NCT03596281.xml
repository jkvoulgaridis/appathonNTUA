  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      French multicenter, open-label, phase 1b, evaluating via the mTPI design the paired treatment
      of pembrolizumab and PLD (cohort A), pembrolizumab and bevacizumab (cohort B) and finally the
      combination treatment of the three drugs PLD plus bevacizumab and pembrolizumab (cohort C).
      Thanks to an expansion cohort C+ the ORR will be evaluated in a total of 19 patients at the
      RP2 D using an exact binomial one-step Fleming-type design.

      Cohort A and B will be opened for inclusions at the same time. Once safety of the dual
      combinations confirmed in cohorts A and B,cohort C will be opened for inclusions.
