      Aim 1: Establish the feasibility of screening for hearing loss in the ED Aim 2: Determine the
      acceptability of the screening procedure (among the ED population) Aim 3: Derive a
      preliminary estimate of the effect size of primary outcomes Aim 4: Identify the evidence that
      decision makers in VAMCs, ED and Audiology Services need to commit to this approach

      The goal of this study is to test whether providing hearing assistance devices to older age
      hearing impaired patients in the ED setting will improve in-ED understanding and preparation
      for discharge. The proposed intervention, the Hearing Impairment, Strategies and Outcomes in
      VA Emergency Departments (HearVA-ED) will be conducted in the Emergency Departments of the
      Manhattan and Brooklyn VAs of the New York Harbor Healthcare System and will recruit hearing
      impaired ED patients who are 60 years and older and have been admitted to the ED with a low
      acuity triage score indicating a high likelihood of discharge home. The investigators will
      identify hearing impairment by using the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly survey
      (HHIE-S). The investigators will randomize consenting patients who fail the screening to
      either receipt of a simple hearing assistance device (a &quot;PockeTalkerTM&quot;) during their ED stay
      or usual care. The investigators will test whether the provision of a PockeTalkerTM is
      feasible in this environment (by measuring the amount of device use), whether providing the
      device improves self-reported quality of hearing and understanding during the ED stay, and
      whether use of the device improves the quality of preparation for post-discharge care. If
      this randomized controlled trial demonstrates beneficial effects for in-ED use of a simple
      hearing assistance device for hearing impaired patients, this strategy can be disseminated
      throughout the VA healthcare system.

    <intervention_model_description>Consenting participants will be randomly assigned to the control or intervention arm of the study. Participants in the intervention arm will receive PockeTalkers (hearing assistance devices) for the duration of their time in the emergency department. Participants in the control group will not receive hearing assistance devices during their time in the emergency department.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Use of hearing assistance device during ED stay</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of ED stay, average of 1-2 days</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will observe and survey participants to determine whether or not they use the hearing assistance device while they are in the ED. This will be measured on a yes/no basis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Communication with providers during ED stay</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of ED stay, average of 1-2 days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will self-rate their quality of hearing, understanding, and communication using a six item questionnaire. Scored on a 10-point Likert scale (1 = do not agree at all; 10 = completely agree) the questions will be: When I talked to the doctors and nurses today ... (1) their voices were very clear; (2) I was able to hear the sounds that I wanted to hear; (3) noises did not cause a problem for my hearing; and (4) listening did not make me tired. Two additional statements will explicitly capture understanding: (5) I was able to understand what they said; and (6) I was able to understand without making an effort. Higher scores will indicate better communication and understanding with providers.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Discharge preparation (survey)</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of discharge from ED, average 1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-rated quality of post-discharge care using a three-item subset of the Care Transition Measure (CTM). The questions are scored on a 1-4 scale (1= strongly disagree; 4 = strongly agree): (1) The ED staff considered my preferences and those of my family or caregiver in deciding what my healthcare needs were for discharge; (2) Leaving the ED, I have a good understanding of the things I am responsible for in managing my health; (3) Leaving the ED, I clearly understand the purpose for each of my medications. Higher scores will indicate better discharge preparation.</description>

    <measure>Barriers/facilitators to hearing assistance device use in the ED</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of discharge from ED, average 1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The interviews will obtain a more detailed understanding of patients' ED experience, barriers and facilitators of hearing assistance device (HAD) use, and anticipated future use of a hearing device in medical and other settings. Brief semi-structured interviews with ED nurses and physicians (providers) around the time of patient discharge will be used to assess providers' experiences interacting with hearing-impaired patients with and without HADs to evaluate, from the provider's view, the benefits and feasibility of use of the PockeTalker in the ED.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Demographic and health data</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of ED stay, average of 1-2 days</time_frame>
    <description>Using administrative and CPRS data, we will abstract demographic data, the presenting complaint, all diagnoses (including cognitive diagnoses) prior to and during the ED stay, medications at ED admission and discharge, and discharge diagnoses and plans. Included in Veteran surveys, we will inquire about primary spoken language, prior non-VA ED experience, years of education, mood (using the Patient Heath Questionaire-2).</description>

    <measure>Hospital readmission</measure>
    <time_frame>3-30 days after initial ED stay</time_frame>
