      This study evaluates the efficacy of Oral azacitidine versus single-agent Investigator's
      Choice Therapy in patients with Relapsed or Refractory Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compared to B-cell Non-Hodgin Lymphoma (NHL), Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma (AITL) is
      more resistant to conventional chemotherapy and is generally associated with an inferior
      outcome. In case of relapsed of refractory disease, survival durations are in the range of
      only a few months.

      Several agents have been evaluated in this setting in recent years: romidepsin, bendamustine
      or belinostat. The response rate with these agents rarely exceeds 30% and responses are
      usually of limited duration.

      Azacitidine is a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with
      various myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) subtypes. In this case, azacitidine significantly
      increase the survival time compared to standard of care option. This response to azacitidine
      could be correlated to the existence of recurrent mutations and those mutations have also
      been described in AITL.

      The present protocol will use Azacitidine according to the same schedule than in MDS that is
      continuous treatment until progression or unacceptable toxicity.

             requirements

          4. Patient had local diagnosed peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) with T-follicular helper
             (TFH) phenotype according to the criteria of the latest World Health Organization
             (WHO) classification based on a surgical lymph node biopsy including any one of

               -  Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL)

               -  Follicular T cell lymphoma

               -  Nodal peripheral T-cell lymphoma with TFH phenotype There should be a documented
                  expression of minimum two TFH markers among this panel of markers : CD10, CXCL13,

                  relapse or progression is not mandatory, but highly encouraged on a surgical or
                  needle core biopsy, and diagnostic tissue should be available for central
                  pathology review and for ancillary molecular studies.

             Local pathology report should be reviewed by the sponsor's medical monitor prior to
             enrollment.

          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 3

          6. Relapsed (after partial or complete response) or refractory AITL after at least one
             line of systemic therapy (there is no mandatory resting period after the previous
             treatment as long as the biochemistry and hematology labs meet the inclusion criteria
             as below.)

          7. Meet the following lab criteria:

               -  Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥ 1,5 x 109/L (≥ 1 x 109/L if bone marrow (BM)
                  involvement by lymphoma)

               -  Platelet ≥ 75 x 109/L (≥ 50 x 109/L if BM involvement by lymphoma)

          9. At least one measurable lesion on CT that is greater than 1.5 cm in the longest
             diameter for nodal lesions and greater than 1.0 cm in the longest diameter for
             extranodal lesions. The lesion must be measurable in two perpendicular dimensions.
             Patients with only cutaneous disease will be excluded.

         10. Female patient of childbearing potential (FCBP) may participate, providing she meets
             the following conditions:

             Have two negative pregnancy tests as verified by the investigator prior to starting
             study treatment: serum pregnancy test at Screening and negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test (investigator's discretion) within 72 hours prior to starting treatment
             with study treatment (Cycle 1 Day 1). She must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing
             during the study (before beginning each subsequent cycle of treatment), and 28 days
             after the last study drug administration. This applies even if the patient practices
             complete abstinence from heterosexual contact.

             Agrees to practice true abstinence (which must be reviewed monthly and source
             documented) or agrees to the use of highly effective methods of contraception from 28
             days prior to starting study treatment, and must agree to continue using such
             precautions during study treatment (including dose interruptions) and for up to 90
             days after the last study drug administration. True abstinence is acceptable when this
             is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence
             (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptom-thermal, post ovulation methods) and withdrawal are
             not acceptable methods of contraception. Cessation of contraception after this point
             should be discussed with a responsible physician.

             Agrees to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation and for at least 90
             days after the last study drug administration.

             A female of childbearing potential (FCBP) is a female who: 1) has achieved menarche at
             some point, 2) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 3) has
             not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule
             out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses
             at any time during the preceding 24 consecutive months).

         11. Male patient must either practice true abstinence from heterosexual contact (which
             must be reviewed on a monthly basis and source documented) or agrees to avoid
             fathering a child, to use highly effective methods of contraception, male condom plus
             spermicide during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing
             potential (even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy), from starting dose of
             drug (cycle 1 Day 1), including dose interruptions through 90 days after receipt of
             the last study drug administration. Furthermore, male patient must agree to not give
             semen or sperm during study drug therapy and for a period of 1 year after end of study
             drug therapy.

         12. For EU countries, patient covered by a social security system

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Presence of any of the following will exclude a patient from enrollment:

          1. Clinical evidence of central nervous system involvement by lymphoma. Patients with
             suspicion of central nervous system (CNS) involvement must undergo neurologic
             evaluation and CT/MRI of head and lumbar puncture to exclude CNS disease.

          2. Any significant medical conditions, laboratory abnormality or psychiatric illness
