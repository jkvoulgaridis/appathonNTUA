  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Third Ward Wellness Study aims to pilot test a wellness program for families with toddler
      age children. Participants will be recruited from the Third Ward neighborhood in Houston, TX
      and then randomly assigned to one of two wellness programs. The goal of both programs is to
      enable and inspire parents to help their toddler age children develop healthy habits that
      will stay with them through life. Participating families will complete an assessment batter
      before and after the program. Both programs will meet once per week for 10 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dietary and activity habits begin to develop in early childhood. Parents have the most
      influence on children's health behaviors at this age. Many parents, particularly those from
      lower income and underserved areas may benefit from programs to inspire and enable them to
      raise their toddler age children with good health habits. The experimental group was
      developed to help parents instill healthy habits in their children through a healthy home
      environment. This study will pilot test the experimental group among parent-toddler dyads
      residing in Greater Third Ward neighborhoods, where &gt; 80% of the residents are AA or Hispanic
      and 35%-54% have annual household incomes &lt;$25,000. The aims are to ascertain 1) recruitment
      and retention barriers and facilitators, 2) treatment success barriers and facilitators, and
      3) the estimated effect sizes of outcomes to inform a fully powered RCT. The exploratory
      hypotheses are that compared to those in the control group, parents in the experimental group
      will have greater increases in positive parenting skills (Comprehensive General Parenting
      Questionnaire), and toddlers will have greater increases in indicators of a healthy home
      environments, diets and activity habits (MVPA, sedentary activity, and sleep).

    <description>Based on Self-Determination Theory, the FUNPALs Playgroup will enable and inspire parents to encourage their children to improve their diet and activity behaviors through general authoritative parenting, structured feeding practices, and a healthy home environment. Parents and toddlers will participate in the FUNPALs Playgroup together where they will be led through a series of open but structured activities including free play, exercise, snack preparation, discussion, singing, and yoga stretches.</description>

    <description>The goal of the Healthy Toddlers Parent Group is to deliver the same nutrition and activity messages to parents as those delivered in the FUNPALs Playgroup. In the Healthy Toddlers Parent Group, parents (without children) will meet in groups to receive information on nutrition and activity as it relates to their toddlers and they will engage in a discussion around how they do or can implement these behaviors. No experiential learning, children, play, or parenting instruction will be included in this control condition.</description>
