      Stage 1 (phase I tolerance study) : 12 patients were enrolled in the dose-climbing
      study:According to the principle of dose-climbing test,todetermine the subjects' MTD, with
      the following three dose levels:

        -  Capecitabine: 1000 mg/m2 bid d1-14 q3w, oxaliplatin: 130 mg/m2 d1 q3w) + apatinib 250
           mg, qd x180d; ②. Capecitabine: 1000 mg/m2 bid d1-14 q3w, oxaliplatin: 130 mg/m2 d1 q3w)
           + apatinib 375 mg, qd x180d; ③. Capecitabine: 1000 mg/m2 bid d1-14 q3w, oxaliplatin: 130
           mg/m2 d1 q3w) + apatinib 500 mg, qd x180d;

      Stage 2 (phase II exploratory study) :

      ①.Test group: subjects received 8 cycles of postoperative XELOX regimen (capecitabine: 1000
      mg/m2 bid d1-14 q3w, oxaliplatin: 130 mg/m2 d1 q3w) + apatinib maximum tolerated dose

      ②.Control group: Subjects received 8 cycles of XELOX regimen after surgery (capecitabine:
      1000 mg/m2 bid d1-14 q3w, oxaliplatin: 130 mg/m2 d1 q3w).

      Eligible patients will receive 8 cycles of postoperative adjuvant therapy and will be
      followed up to death
