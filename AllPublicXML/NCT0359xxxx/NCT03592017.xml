  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fundus autofluorescence imaging has become an important diagnostic tool in ophthalmology,
      guiding diagnosis and assessment of progression of retinal diseases. This study investigates
      the performance of optimized long-wavelength autofluorescence imaging. To achieve this goal,
      the investigators will determine an optimal long wavelength excitation light and investigate
      the autofluorescence signal intensity in normals and patients with different retinal
      diseases. The diagnostic performance of the long-wavelength autofluorescence will be
      evaluated by assessing sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing a variety of degenerative
      retinal diseases and by comparing it to conventional autofluorescence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fundus autofluorescence (AF) imaging of the retina with confocal scanning laser
      ophthalmoscopy has been established as a non-invasive imaging modality for the diagnosis of
      retinal and macular diseases. Long-wavelength near-infrared autofluorescence (excitation: 787
      nm, LW-AF) is a new, innovative alternative to the classic autofluorescence imaging using 488
      nm blue excitation light. Excitation of the fluorophores at the ocular fundus using a longer
      wavelength has several advantages. However, with the current imaging technique the
      autofluorescence signal and thus image quality is considerably lower compared to conventional
      short-wavelength autofluorescence (SW-AF). This may be the main reason for the currently
      limited application and scarce scientific publications on this technique.

      Therefore, the objective of this study is to assess the performance of an optimized setup of
      long-wavelength autofluorescence imaging in clinical routine applications. For this purpose,
      additional laser sources will be integrated into a scanning laser ophthalmoscope and the
      performance with regards to image quality will be investigated systematically using different
      excitation wavelengths and filter combinations in healthy controls.

      In a next step, the signal intensity will be quantified using an integrated fluorescent
      reference. First, factors affecting measurements will be identified, followed by generation
      of a normative database. Subjects with various retinal diseases will then be investigated and
      compared to the normative database.

      Finally, the diagnostic performance of long-wavelength autofluorescence imaging to detect
      retinal degenerative diseases will be investigated and compared to conventional imaging
      techniques.

    <description>Long-wavelength autofluorescence imaging will be performed with a prototype confocal scanning laser (cSLO) ophthalmoscope which will be equipped with additional laser sources and a reference for quantification of the signal. The experimental long-wavelength laser sources will be integrated into a custom-modified Spectralis HRA cSLO from Heidelberg Engineering. The additional laser sources will operate with long wavelength which are less energetic compared to the conventional short-wavelength lasers used currently for routine autofluorescence imaging. All safety standards have been considered and the light exposure for all imaging modes is well below the exposure limits for Class 1 and Class1M laser products as defined in the standard IEC 60825-1, edition 3.0, 2014-5.</description>
