      The objective of this clinical study would be to verify if manual therapy is effective in the
      treatment to reduce pain in women suffering from primary dysmenorrhea.

      Material and methods In this experimental study, women diagnosed with primary dysmenorrhea
      will be included, which will be divided randomly into two groups: an intervention group and a
      control group.

      The study will last two months (2 menstrual cycles). Patients in the intervention group will
      receive 4 treatment sessions, 2 times the week before the first menstrual cycle, and 2 times
      a week during the second menstrual cycle, The evaluation will include pain, the quality of
      life, the global impression of change, personal body satisfaction and global self-perception
      and the pain perception.

      Introduction The prevalence of primary dysmenorrhoea is high and has an impact on quality of
      life, pain and disability. The cause is due to the increase of postaglandins that can be
      influenced by the lowering of progesterone. In short, there is a complex relationship between
      hormones and the immune system.

      Manual therapy increases the mobility of the sacrum and tissues of the pelvis, increasing the
      blood supply and the uterus that has parasympathetic innervation through the sacrum improves
      mobility, motility and irrigation.

      The ligaments, fasciae and tissue of the pelvis improve their irrigation through fascial,
      mobility and visceral techniques, which would improve uterine mobility by anatomical
      connections with these structures. With better mobility the uterus, and therefore the smooth
      muscle, would have more irrigation and less pain and hypercontractivility.

      The adjacent tissues, perineum, triangular ligament, innervated by the vagus nerve, improve

      The main objective is the improvement of quality of life, personal body satisfaction and
      overall self-perception and pain reduction in women with dysmenorrhea after treatment with
      manual therapy and provide information and advice on self-care and menstrual awareness.

      Methods

      Sample. The sample is formed by women with dysmenorrhoea aged between 18 and 45 years, with
      no other abdominopelvic problems.

      Design. The sample will be divided into 2 groups: Group 1. Manual therapy protocol and
      self-care advice and body awareness. Three sessions of manual therapy will be applied, one
      every 15 days; Group 2 control. Advice on self-care and body awareness.

      Evaluations:

        -  Clinical interview with anthropometric data and characteristics of the pathology (age,
           weight, height, pain characteristics) There will be 3 evaluations: Evaluation at the
           beginning, at the end of the treatment and a follow-up of one month.

        -  SF-36 quality of life scale.

        -  Visual Analog Scale (EVA).

        -  Feeling of change after treatment with the Patient Global Impression of Change Scale.

        -  Personal Body Satisfaction and Global Self-Perception.

        -  McGill pain perception questionnaire.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale of Pain.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The participants are asked to mark the intensity of pain from 1 to 10, with 1 being almost non-existent and 10 being the worst pain imaginable.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SF-36 quality of life scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of 36 items with the following scales: Physical function (items 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e, 3f, 3g, 3h, 3i, 3j), Physical role (items 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d), Corporal pain ( items 7, 8), General Health (items 1, 11a, 11b, 11c, 11d), Vitality (items 9a, 9e, 9g, 9i), Social function (items 6, 10), Emotional role (items 5a, 5b, 5c) and Mental Health (items 9b, 9c, 9d, 9f, 9h). Includes an item on the change in the general health status with respect to the previous year (item 2). To calculate the score, we must first homogenize the address of the answers by re-coding the items that require it, so that &quot;the higher the score, the better the health condition&quot;, then the calculation of the sum of the items of each scale and, finally, the linear transformation of raw scores on a scale of 0 (worst health status for that dimension) to 100 (the best health status).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Impression Change Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the change perceived after the treatment, patients are asked to rate their perception of change in the Global Impression Change Scale of the patient, and a questionnaire with a question and 7 alternatives, being 1 &quot;maximum change&quot; and 7 &quot;Nothing of change&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body Satisfaction and global self-perception Questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It contains 10 positive and 10 negative adjectives about the participant's body sensation with alternative answers ranging from 1 = Excellent to 5 = Poor. Each question is scored independently.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>McGill pain perception questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire assesses quantitative and qualitative aspects of pain, such as location, quality, temporal properties and intensity.
We use the short version, which consists of several clearly differentiated parts: Quality of pain that define the one with 66 words grouped into several categories that in turn form four large groups, pain assessment index (PRI): total and for each of the four areas (PRI), sensory, emotional PRI, valued PRI and miscellaneous PRI). The score is calculated adding that of each group of words that make up each category; b) Number of words chosen (NWC): sum of the number of pain characteristics selected by the patient; c) Pain intensity index (PPI): selected response of the item that explores this aspect.</description>
