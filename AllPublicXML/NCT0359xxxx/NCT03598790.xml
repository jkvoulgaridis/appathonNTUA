    <description>The number of TEAEs adjusted by duration of exposure to study treatment is scaled such that it provides an incidence rate per 100 patient-years. If a subject has multiple events, the time of exposure is calculated to the first occurrence of the Adverse Event (AE) being considered. If a subject has no events, the total time at risk is used.</description>

    <description>The Investigator will assess the overall severity of psoriasis using the following 5-point scale (five-point IGA):
0 = Clear (no signs of psoriasis; post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation may be present)
= Almost clear (no thickening; normal to pink coloration; no to minimal focal scaling)
= Mild (just detectable to mild thickening; pink to light red coloration; predominately fine scaling)
= Moderate (clearly distinguishable to moderate thickening; dull to bright red coloration; moderate scaling)
= Severe (Severe thickening with hard edges; bright to deep dark red coloration; severe/coarse scaling covering almost all or all lesions)</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is considered reliable and capable of adhering to the protocol (eg, able to
             understand and complete diaries), visit schedule, and medication intake according to
             the judgment of the Investigator

          -  Subject completes the feeder study (PS0008 [NCT03412747], PS0009 [NCT03370133], PS0013
             [NCT03410992]) without meeting any withdrawal criteria

          -  Female subjects must be:

               1. Postmenopausal: Menopause is defined as 12 consecutive months of amenorrhea, for
                  which there is no other obvious pathological or physiological cause

               2. Permanently sterilized (eg, tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral
                  salpingectomy)

               3. Or, if of childbearing potential (and engaged in sexual activity that could
                  result in procreation), must be willing to use a highly effective method of
                  contraception throughout the duration of the study until 20 weeks after last
                  administration of investigational medicinal product (IMP), and have a negative
                  pregnancy test at the feeder study in final visit/Baseline visit in PS0014

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has previously participated in this study

          -  Female subjects who plan to become pregnant during the study or within 20 weeks
             following last dose of study medication

          -  Subject has any medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, could jeopardize or would compromise the subject's ability to
             participate in this study. Note: For any subject with an ongoing Serious Adverse Event
             (SAE), or a history of serious infections in the feeder study, the Medical Monitor
             must be consulted prior to the subject's entry into PS0014, although the decision on
             whether to enroll the subject remains with the Investigator

          -  Subject has a positive or indeterminate interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) in a
             feeder study, unless appropriately evaluated and treated

          -  Subject may not participate in another study of a medicinal product or device under
             investigation other than the substudy

          -  Subject has a history of chronic alcohol or drug abuse within 6 months prior to
             Baseline as assessed by medical history, site interview, and/or results of the
             specified urine drug screen

    <ipd_description>Data from this trial may be requested by qualified researchers six months after product approval in the US and/or Europe, or global development is discontinued, and 18 months after trial completion. Investigators may request access to anonymized individual patient-level data and redacted trial documents which may include: analysis-ready datasets, study protocol, annotated case report form, statistical analysis plan, dataset specifications, and clinical study report. Prior to use of the data, proposals need to be approved by an independent review panel at www.Vivli.org and a signed data sharing agreement will need to be executed. All documents are available in English only, for a prespecified time, typically 12 months, on a password protected portal. This plan may change if the risk of re-identifying trial participants is determined to be too high after the trial is completed; in this case and to protect participants, individual patient-level data would not be made available.</ipd_description>
