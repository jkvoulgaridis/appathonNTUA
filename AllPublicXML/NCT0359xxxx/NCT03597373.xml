  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease that is characterized by muscle weakness and
      fatigue. The role of the thymus in MG has been suggested by the evidence that 10% to 15% of
      patients present with a thymoma and at least 60% with thymus hyperplasia or
      dysplasia.Beneficial effects of thymectomy in patients with MG have been described in 40% to
      90%.Few studies have looked at the incidence of reintubation (not just within 24 hours after
      extubation), the factors associated with reintubation, and patient outcome.

      Premature extubation may lead to hypercarbia, hypoxemia, pulmonary hypertension, right heart
      failure, and myocardial ischemia. Additionally, it subjects the patient to the physical risks
      of reintubation, including esophageal intubation, laryngeal trauma, and pulmonary aspiration.
      The purpose of the present study was to determine the incidence of reintubation, the
      variables associated with reintubation, and patient outcome

      Inclusion was based on the availability of all the following possible predictive
      pre-operative variables: age, gender, weight, height, body mass index, diabetes, creatinine,
      duration of MG, severity of MG (based on Osserman's classification), pathological type of MG,
      history of myasthenic crisis, dose of pyridostigmine, use of a steroid hormone, and use of an
      immunosuppressant.operative variables: postoperative pulmonary infection, total duration of
      hospital stay, duration of ICU stay, and duration of postoperative hospital stay. Variables
      were collected by research assistants and maintained in a computer database.
