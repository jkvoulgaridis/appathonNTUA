  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is stated that the affected cognitive functions in Multiple Sclerosis are learning,
      memory, attention, speed of information processing, visuospatial skills, and executive
      functions. The speed of information processing, visual learning and memory are the most
      frequently affected components in MS. For this reason, approaches to increase cognitive
      functions by activating neuroprotective mechanisms such as exercise in patients with MS are
      needed.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of combined exercise training on cognitive
      functions in patients with MS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed as a randomized, controlled, single-blind trial. This study will
      include patients with MS who 0-5.5 according to the Extended Disability Status Scale (EDSS)
      and between 18-65 years. The patient will be randomized into a combined training group and a
      control group. The patients in the control group will not apply an exercise training. The
      combined exercise training group will be given combined exercise training, consisting of
      Pilates and aerobic exercise, three times during 8 weeks. Both groups will be reevaluated 8
      weeks after the initial assessment.

      Statistical analyses will be performed using the SPSS software version 15 (SPSS Inc. Chicago,
      IL, USA). The pre-training and post-training measurements of groups will be compared with the
      Wilcoxon Test. The significance level was set at p&lt; 0.05.

    <measure>Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>five minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue impact scale will be used to asses fatigue. There are 40 items, each of which is scored 0 (no problem) to 4 (extreme problem), providing a continuous scale of 0-160. It is composed of three subscales that describe how fatigue impacts upon cognitive (10 items), physical (10 items) and psychosocial functioning (10 items). Cognitive functioning concerns concentration, memory, thinking and organization of thoughts. Physical functioning reflects motivation, effort, stamina and coordination. Psychosocial functioning describes the impact of fatigue upon isolation, emotions, workload and coping.A higher score indicates a higher fatigue impact.</description>

    <measure>Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54</measure>
    <time_frame>ten minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire consists of 54 questions with 12 sub-sections; physical function, health perceptions, energy/fatigue, role limitations-physical, pain, sexual function, social function, health distress, the overall quality of life, emotional well-being, role limitations-emotional, cognitive function. The summary scores are the physical health composite summary and the mental health composite summary. There is no single overall score for the MSQOL-54. Two summary scores - physical health and mental health - can be derived from a weighted combination of scale scores. In this scale, the scoring of each question is different from each other and a higher score indicates a lower quality of life.</description>
