  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is common side effect of Cushing Syndrome (CS): in patients with endogenous CS
      and those treated with glucocorticosteroids (GCs). The impact of the intravenous GCs therapy
      on blood pressure (BP) remains unclear. According to the European Group On Graves'
      Orbitopathy (EUGOGO), patients with active, severely symptomatic and sight-threatening
      Graves' orbitopathy (GO) should be treated with high dose intravenous methylprednisolone
      (IVMP) pulses. There are, however, reports of fatal side effects that may be associated with
      this therapy (e.g.: pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, severe cerebrovascular events,
      acute liver damage and sudden death). For this reason, the cumulative dose of IVMP should not
      exceed 8 g within each treatment course, and pulses should not be given on consecutive or
      alternate days, except for the case of dysthyroid optic neuropathy. A consensus on the
      monitoring of patients during and after IVMP pulse administration is not yet established.
      What is more, there is lack of paper regarding pattern of blood pressure at various time
      points during and after ivGCs administration. Thus, the investigators decided to evaluate
      acute changes of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) as a marker of
      hemodynamic stress and to monitor BP before, during and after IVMP pulse administration. All
      of patients were treated routinely according to EUGOGO recommendations with standard doses of
      methylprednisolone with standard recommended schedule. Inclusion criterion for the therapy
      was according to EUGOGO guidelines active, moderate-to-severe and active GO (12 pulses of
      IVMP 6x0.5g followed by 6x0.25g every week).

      Laboratory tests such as NT-proBNP, troponin I (TnI) and high - sensitivity C - reactive
      protein (hs-CRP) were performed before, 24 h and 48 h after IVMP during the following pulses:
      1st, 6th and 12th. Patients underwent echocardiographic examination before 1st and after 12th
      pulse. 48-hours ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) (for 24 hours before and 24 hours
      after IVMP) was done during the following pulses: 1st, 6th and 12th.

      All assays were performed in sera obtained from venous blood samples and analysed immediately
      after blood sampling in The Central Laboratory in the hospital. NT-proBNP was measured using
      a Flex® Reagent Cartridge and Dimension®EXLTM integrated chemistry system with a LOCI® Module
      (Siemens HealthCare Diagnostics Ltd., Camberley, UK). The cutoff value of NT - proBNP typical
      for hemodynamic stress in the left ventricle was defined as ≥125 pg/ml. Measurements of TnI
      and hs-CRP were made. Analysis of TnI was performed on Siemens Dimension System (ExL LOCI TnI
      assay). TnI values ≥ 0.056 ng/mL as above the 99th percentile were reported as positive.
      Measurement of hs-CRP was performed in serum using an immunoturbidimetric method on Cobas
      6000 Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics).
