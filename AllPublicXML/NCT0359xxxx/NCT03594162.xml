  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol for compassionate use combines 2 different ways of fighting disease: antibodies
      and T cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers, and
      both have shown promise, but neither alone has been sufficient to cure most patients. This
      protocol combines both T cells and antibodies to create a more effective treatment. The
      investigational treatment is called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells
      targeted against the CD19 antigen (ATLCAR.CD19) administration.

      Prior studies have shown that a new gene can be put into T cells and will increase their
      ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. The new gene that is put in the T cells in this
      study makes a piece of an antibody called anti-CD19. This antibody sticks to leukemia cells
      because they have a substance on the outside of the cells called CD19. For this protocol, the
      anti-CD19 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood part of it
      is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called
      a chimeric receptor. These CD19 chimeric (combination) receptor-activated T cells seem to
      kill some of the tumor, but they do not last very long in the body and so their chances of
      fighting the cancer are unknown.

      Preliminary results have shown that many subjects receiving this treatment have experienced
      unwanted side effects including cytokine release syndrome. In this protocol, to help reduce
      cytokine release syndrome symptoms, the ATLCAR.CD19 cells have a safety switch that when
      active, can cause the cells to become dormant. These modified ATLCAR.CD19 cells with the
      safety switch are referred to as iC9-CAR19 cells. If the patient experiences moderate to
      severe cytokine release syndrome as a result of being given iC9-CAR19 cells, the patient can
      be given a dose of a second study drug, AP1903, if standard interventions fail to alleviate
      the symptoms of cytokine release syndrome. AP1903 activates the iC9-CAR19 safety switch,
      reducing the number of the iC9-CAR19 cells in the blood.

      The primary purpose of this protocol is to treat a single patient with a second dose of
      iC9-CAR19 T cells.

      Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy:

      The patient will receive a lymphodepleting regimen of fludarabine 25 mg/m2/day administered
      IV over 30 min for three consecutive days and a single IV dose of cyclophosphamide 900 mg/m2
      administered over 1 hr on the fourth day.

      Administration of iC9-CAR19 T cells:

      Post lymphodepletion, if the patient meets eligibility criteria for cellular therapy, then
      will receive iC9-CAR19 T cells within 2-14 days after completing the pre-conditioning
      chemotherapy regimen. We will administer iC9-CAR19 post lymphodepletion at one of the
      following doses based on the percentage of circulating lymphoblasts prior to lymphodepletion:
      (1) dose of 5 x 10^5 transduced cells/kg or (2) dose of 1 x 10^5 transduced cells/kg.

      Duration of Therapy:

      Therapy under this compassionate use protocol involves 1 infusion of iC9-CAR19 cells.

      Duration of Follow-up:

      The patient will be followed for up to 15 years for replication-competent retrovirus
      evaluation or until death, whichever occurs first.

             mercaptopurine ≤100 mg/m2/day and vincristine ≤ 2 mg/28 days. For patients who receive
             chemotherapy, including intrathecal chemotherapy, that does not fit this definition of
             maintenance chemotherapy, a two week washout between the last dose of standard of care
