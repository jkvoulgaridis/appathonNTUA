    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common non-skin malignancy and the third leading cause of
      cancer death in North American men. The accurately mapped metastatic state is a necessary
      prerequisite to guiding treatment in practice and in clinical trials. Imaging biomarkers
      (BMs) can provide information on disease volume and distribution, prognosis, changes in
      biologic behavior, therapy-induced changes (both responders and non-responders), durations of
      response, emergence of treatment resistance, and the host reaction to the therapies.

      Of particular relevance to metastatic prostate cancer is the emergence of a promising imaging
      technique involving new prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission
      tomography (PET) tracers. This approach has demonstrated higher sensitivity in detecting
      metastases, prior to and during therapy, than current imaging standard of care (CT and bone
      scan), and is not widely clinically available outside of the research realm in North America.

      Positron emission tomography / computer tomography (PET/CT) is a nuclear medicine diagnostic
      imaging procedure based on the measurement of positron emission from radiolabeled tracer
      molecules in vivo. PSMA is a homodimeric type II membrane metalloenzyme that functions as a
      glutamate carboxypeptidase/folate hydrolase and is overexpressed in PCa. PSMA is expressed in
      the vast majority of PCa tissue specimens and its degree of expression correlates with a
      number of important metrics of PCa tumor aggressiveness including Gleason score, propensity
      to metastasize and the development of castration resistance.

      [18F]DCFPyL is a promising high-sensitivity second generation PSMA-targeted urea-based PET
      probe. Studies employing second-generation PSMA PET/CT imaging in men with biochemical
      progression after definitive therapy suggest detection of metastases in over 60% of men
      imaged.

      Deep learning is defined as a variant of artificial neural networks, using multiple layers of
      'neurons'. Deep learning has been investigated in medical imaging in numerous applications
      across organ systems. In oncology, basic artificial neural networks to support
      decision-making have previously been developed retrospectively in breast cancer and prostate
      cancer, but have not been validated or integrated prospectively. Novel data-driven methods
      are needed to predict outcomes as early as possible in order to guide the duration and the
      aggressiveness of a particular therapy. They are also needed for optimal patient selection
      based on the patient's response to a given therapy.

      Here the investigators hypothesize that the combination of a highly performing prostate
      cancer imaging technique combined with machine learning has high potential. The main
      objective of this study is to acquire PSMA-PET data in patients with prostate cancer who
      receive treatment and follow-up in order to enable the discovery of predictive imaging
      biomarkers through deep learning techniques.
