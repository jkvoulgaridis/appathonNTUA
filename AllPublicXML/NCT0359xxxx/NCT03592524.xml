      Very limited data in the literature about how to apply Ramadan fasting in the post liver
      transplant setting. The timing of Ramadan is changeable according to the lunar year and
      according to time of down and sunset in each country. In Egypt, for example, Ramadan fasting
      this year started 17th of May and finished 14th June with average fasting hours of 15-16
      hours The study aimed to assess the possibility of Ramadan fasting and to start protocol of
      adapting immunosupression regiment and scheduled follow up for patients wishing to fast after
      LT.This prospective study included 45 recipients who underwent LT at Ain Shams Center for
      Organ Transplant (ASCOT), Cairo, Egypt.
