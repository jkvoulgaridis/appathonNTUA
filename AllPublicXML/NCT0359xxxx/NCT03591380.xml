  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether kidney transplant recipients who
      receive belimumab (Benlysta®), combined with the standard of care medications for kidney
      transplant recipients, is safe and effective in helping prevent new donor specific antibodies
      (DSA) after transplantation. The presence of DSA increases the risk that the kidney
      transplant recipient's body will reject the new kidney. The investigators are doing this
      research because it is estimated that greater than 50% of kidney transplant failures are
      attributed to antibodies produced in the body, that attack the transplanted organ as a
      foreign object. DSA produced in the body after a kidney transplant, is thought to occur in
      20-50% of patients and is associated with a low likelihood that the organ recipient's body
      will accept the new kidney. A major unmet need in the kidney transplant area are safe and
      effective therapies to prevent DSA after transplantation.

      Accrual Objective: Kidney transplant recipients (n=5) will receive standard of care (SOC)
      therapy consisting of alemtuzumab and steroid induction with mycophenolic acid and tacrolimus
      maintenance immunosuppression, plus induction and treatment for 6 months with belimumab.

      Study Design: This is an open-label pilot-study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      belimumab plus standard of care in the prevention of de novo donor specific antibody in adult
      subjects after kidney transplantation.

      The investigators will enroll 5 adult, deceased or living donor kidney transplant recipients
      who are sensitized, evidenced by: Positive sum Donor Specific Antibody (DSA)&lt;1000 MFI and/or
      Panel of Reactive Antibodies (PRA)&gt;0%. The primary endpoint of this study is de novo DSA
      production. There are two main reasons for selecting this patient population for the proposed
      study. 1) Sensitized patients are known to have higher rates of de novo DSA production and 2)
      Patients with low levels of DSA (sum DSA&lt;1000 MFI) will enable more fidelity in determining
      the DSA that is produced de novo.

      Kidney transplant recipients will receive the standard of care (alemtuzumab and steroid
      induction with mycophenolic acid and tacrolimus maintenance immunosuppression), plus six
      months of therapy with belimumab. Belimumab 10 mg/kg will be administered IV for 6 months at
      the following intervals: Day of transplant (Day 0), and then at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20
      post-transplant.

      Study Duration: Subjects will be treated for 6 months with belimumab and followed for DSA
      production for 1 year.

      Primary Study Objectives: In this proposal the investigators plan to determine (a) whether
      the addition of belimumab to the standard of care (SOC: alemtuzumab and steroid induction
      with mycophenolic acid and tacrolimus maintenance immunosuppression) is safe and effective in
      preventing de novo DSA production at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-transplant.

      Secondary efficacy endpoints will be 1) graft survival and function as determined by serum
      creatinine/eGFR and urine protein at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months 2) rates of acute cellular and
      antibody mediated rejection, at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.

      Primary Outcomes: To determine whether the addition of belimumab to the standard of care
      (SOC: alemtuzumab and steroid induction with mycophenolic acid and tacrolimus maintenance
      immunosuppression) is safe and effective in preventing de novo DSA production 1, 3, 6, 9, and
      12 months.

      Secondary Outcomes: Secondary endpoints will be 1) graft survival and function as determined
      by serum creatinine/eGFR and urine protein at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months 2) rates of acute
      cellular and antibody mediated rejection at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months and 3) the nature,
      frequency, and severity of serious and non-serious adverse events ≥Grade 2 per Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects 18-60 years of age

          -  Planned to receive a deceased or living donor kidney transplant

          -  Sensitized patients: Positive sum DSA &lt;1000, and/or PRA&gt;0%.

          -  Subjects must be capable of understanding the purpose and risks of the study and must
             sign a statement of informed consent.

          -  Female subjects must be post-menopausal, surgically sterilized, or she and/or sexual
             partner must be willing to use an acceptable method of birth control with a &lt;1%
             failure rate as stated in the product label from time of study consent, during study
             participation, and for 16 weeks after the last dose of the study agent (i.e.,
             contraceptive subdermal implant of levonorgestrel or etonogestrel, intrauterine device
             or intrauterine system, combined estrogen and progestogen oral contraceptive,
             Injectable progestogen, contraceptive vaginal ring, percutaneous contraceptive
             patches, or abstinence) for the duration of the study. Male partner sterilization with
             documentation of azoospermia prior to the female subject's entry into the study, and
             this male is the sole partner for that subject. The documentation of male sterility
             can come from the site personnel's: review of subject's medical records, medical
             examination and/or semen analysis, or medical history interview provided by her or her
             partner. Note: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) affects the metabolism of oral
             contraceptives and may reduce their effectiveness. As such, women receiving MMF who
             are using oral contraceptives for birth control should employ an additional method
             (e.g., barrier method). Mycophenolate can cause fetal harm when administered to a
             pregnant female. Use of mycophenolate during pregnancy is associated with an increased
             risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and an increased risk of congenital
             malformations. Mycophenolate affects the metabolism of oral contraceptives and may
             reduce their effectiveness. As such, women receiving MMF who are using oral
             contraceptives for birth control should employ an additional method (e.g., barrier
             method) resulting in two reliable forms of contraception being used simultaneously
             before starting study treatments, during therapy, and for 6 weeks after stopping
             therapy; unless abstinence is the chosen method of contraception

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             within 48 hours of transplant. Must be willing to use contraceptives from the time of
             study consent, during study participation, and for 16 weeks after the last dose of
             study agent. For sexually active men, condoms should be used during, and for at least
             90 days after cessation of mycophenolate treatment. No sperm donation should be made
             during this period of time. For female partners of male subjects, it is recommended to
             use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 90 days after the last
             dose of mycophenolate

          -  No blood donation should be made by the study subjects during mycophenolate treatment
             and for at least 6 weeks after stopping mycophenolate treatment

          -  If stricter female or male contraception requirements are specified in the
             country-specific label for any study related therapies, they must be followed.

          -  Male subjects must agree to use an acceptable method for contraception for the
             duration of the study.

        Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within
        48 hours of transplant. Must be willing to use contraceptives from the time of study
        consent, during study participation, and for 16 weeks after the last dose of study agent.
        Reproductive Status: Definition of Women of Child-Bearing Potential (WOCBP). WOCBP
        comprises women who have experienced menarche and who have not undergone successful
        surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy)
        or who are not post-menopausal (see definition below).

        Post-menopause is defined as:

          -  Women who have had amenorrhea for greater than or equal to 12 consecutive months
             (without another cause) and who have a documented serum follicle-stimulating hormone
             (FSH) level &gt; 35 mIU/mL.

          -  Women who have irregular menstrual periods and a documented serum FSH level &gt; 35
             mIU/mL.

          -  Women who are taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT).

        The following women are WOCBP:

          -  Women using the following methods to prevent pregnancy: Oral contraceptives, other
             hormonal contraceptives (vaginal products, skin patches, or implanted or injectable
             products), or mechanical products such as intrauterine devices or barrier methods
             (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides).

          -  Women who are practicing abstinence from intercourse from 2 weeks prior to
             administration of the 1st dose of study agent until 16 weeks after the last dose of
             study agent (Sexual inactivity by abstinence must be consistent with the preferred and
             usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation,
             symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
             contraception)

          -  Women who have a partner who is sterile (e.g., due to vasectomy). WOCBP must be using
             an acceptable method of contraception to avoid pregnancy from the time of consent with
             &lt;1% failure rate as stated in the product label throughout study participation, and
             for 16 weeks after the last dose of study drug in such a manner that the risk of
             pregnancy is minimized. Acceptable methods of contraception include: complete
             abstinence, any form of intra-uterine devices (without hormones), tubal sterilization
             or your partner has had a vasectomy.

        Other acceptable forms of birth control include choosing one hormonal and one barrier
        method or double-barrier methods. Barrier methods include Essure®, male or female condom,
        diaphragm with spermicide, shield, cap with spermicide, contraceptive sponge, and
        spermicidals. Hormonal methods include oral contraceptive pills, transdermal patches,
        vaginal rings, progesterone-only, and injections. Periodic abstinence (for example,
        calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not
        acceptable methods of contraception.

          -  These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently,
             correctly and in accordance with the product label. The investigator is responsible
             for ensuring subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception.

          -  WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test result (minimum sensitivity
             25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 48 hours prior to transplant (and the first
             dose of study drug intraoperatively).Women must not be breast-feeding
