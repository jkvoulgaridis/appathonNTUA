  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to see if the amount of an enzyme in blood (called serum mast
      cell tryptase) changes before and after surgery. The investigators would like to see if these
      amounts are related to knee stiffness and pain in subjects that undergo a total knee
      replacement.
