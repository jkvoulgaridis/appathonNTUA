  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) often affect psychological, family, social and professional
      dimensions of patients' life, leading to disability which is essential to quantify as part of
      Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) newly included in the therapeutic targets to reach in IBD
      patients. Up to now, the IBD-Disability Index (IBD-DI) was the only validated tool to assess
      functional status, but it is not appropriate for use in clinical practice. The IBD Disk was
      then developed, a shortened and self-administered tool, adapted from the IBD-DI, in order to
      give immediate representation of patient-reported disability. However, the IBD Disk has not
      been validated yet in clinical practice. The aims of the VALIDate study is to validate this
      tool in a large population of French IBD patients and to compare it to the already validated
      IBD-DI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The IBD-Disk has not been evaluated in clinical practice and has not yet been validated. but
      the interest of rapid assessment of the disease led the physicians in University Hospital of
      Nantes' department, some of whom had participated in the construction of this tool, to use it
      in routine practice for consultations of patients with IBD, joined by many
      gastroenterologists from other hospitals including the University Hospitals of Rennes and
      Angers.

      The objective of this study is to validate this tool and prove its effectiveness by comparing
      it to the gold standard represented by the IBD-DI, in the same way that the PsoDisk has been
      validated prospectively compared to other tools for evaluating the quality of life and
      activity of psoriatic disease.

        This study will be conducted in 3 university hospitals (Nantes, Rennes, Angers) which use
        the IBD-Disk in their current practice.

        Investigators will offer patients with chronic inflammatory disease intestinal tract and
        seen in gastroenterological consultation during a control visit of their pathology to enter
        the study, regardless of previous or current treatments, with a goal to include 400
        patients
