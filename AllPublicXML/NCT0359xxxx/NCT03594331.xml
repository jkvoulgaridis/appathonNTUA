  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single blind, dose escalating, placebo-controlled, crossover study of
      gluten-degrading drug PvP001 administered to healthy volunteers (age 18-64 years). Subjects
      will be randomized to one of three groups representing different levels of gluten exposure -
      low, medium, or high - in a single meal. Within each gluten exposure group, increasing doses
      of PvP001 (or placebo) will be administered.

    <description>Side effects are assessed by the PI using a 5-scale, 9-question Gastrointestinal Symptoms Questionnaire (GSQ) to be self-administered by the subject at 16 time-points throughout the five-visit (including screening) study. Each of the 9 questions will be given a numerical score (0-4 where 0 is none and 4 is very severe) and compared to baseline score and placebo scores any increase of &gt;1 point over the average baseline and placebo score will be considered an AE and graded based on the severity reported.</description>
