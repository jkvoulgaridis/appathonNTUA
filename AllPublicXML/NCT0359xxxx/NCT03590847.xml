  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this pilot study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of time restricted
      feeding in an older adult population.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For this 4-week pilot study, the study team will recruit 10 overweight, older adults who are
      at risk for, or have, mobility impairment, as measured by slow gait speed and self-reported
      mobility difficulty and self-reported sedentary lifestyle. All participants will receive the
      time restricted feeding intervention, which will consist of limiting the time in which food
      is consumed to 8 hours per day and fasting for 16 hours per day. The study will also assess
      the variance of inflammatory markers, walking speed, physical and cognitive function, grip
      strength, body measurements, perceived fatigability, health related quality of life and
      activity level. This allows the refinement of the design, recruitment yields, target
      population, adherence, retention, and tolerability of a larger scale study.

    <measure>Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability]</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>At each follow-up contact (either by phone or in person), participants are asked about any changes to their health or physical function since the previous contact. The changes are documented on the adverse event log.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence to the study intervention is measured using food intake time diary. Participants are considered compliant to the study intervention if he/she fasts between 14 - 18 hours per day for the duration of the 4 week study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Retention</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Retention is measured by drop-out rate. Participants are considered &quot;completed&quot; if the Week 4 clinic visit is completed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Recruitment yields</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Recruitment yields is measured by the number of individuals who do not meet the eligibility criteria at the phone interview and/or in-person visit.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>6 Minute Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The 6 Minute Walk test measures the amount of distance the participant can complete on a standard walking course in six minutes without running or overexerting themselves. Contraindications for test administration and stopping rules based on American Thoracic Society will be followed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Grip Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Isometric hand grip strength is a commonly used measure of upper body skeletal muscle function and has been widely used as a general indicator of functional status.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Montreal Cognitive Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment is a 30-point assessment of mild cognitive impairment, which assesses the domains of attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. Different versions of the test are given at the two time points to avoid learning effects between repeated administrations of the test.</description>

    <measure>Fatigability Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>A self-administered, 26-item questionnaire to measure perceived mental and physical fatigability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body Weight</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Body weight will be measured following the removal of excess clothing and shoes with calibrated scales.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Waist Circumference</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Waist circumference is taken at the mid-point between the participant's lowest rib and the top of his/her hip bone.</description>
