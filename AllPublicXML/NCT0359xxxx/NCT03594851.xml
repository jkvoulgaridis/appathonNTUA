  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disorder is often a complaint from the older people. Prevalence of sleep disorder
      increases with aging and reaches between 20 to 45% of the people of 65 years old and more.
      Sleep physiologically changes with aging. Sleep can also be disturbed by other factors such
      as intercurrent or related chronic pathologies, environmental change (institutionalized,
      death of a spouse…), or some medical treatments. Regardless of interindividual variabilities,
      normative criteria have been defined by a meta-analysis: insomnia can be diagnosed if night
      wakings are more than 60min and/or if sleep latency is more than 30 minutes.

      Various studies have proved the major role of sleep on health and wellbeing. Sleep disorders
      have an impact on the quality of perception of health and on the quality of life of people
      and their spouse. According to the French High Health Authority recommendations, sleep diary
      and validated scales are the tools to use to investigate sleep disorders.

      Results from previous studies brought us to consider sleep complaint more specifically and
      adjust to the heterogeneous population of the investigator's hospital with a subjective
      approach. This work intends to offer a program of individualized advice to older patients
      with no cognitive impairment, or with a mild or moderate cognitive impairment, who complain
      about their sleep quality. Patients with a moderate cognitive impairment who have a caregiver
      at home can also join the study. The main objective of the study is to evaluate the impact of
      individualized care for sleep disorders on quality of sleep using the Pittsburgh Sleep
      Quality Index which validity was demonstrated among the elderly.

    <description>Evolution of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory score. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory uses a structured, caregiver-based interview format to assess 10 behavioral domains (Delusions, Hallucinations, Agitation, Dysphoria, Anxiety, Apathy, Irritability, Euphoria, Disinhibition, and Aberrant motor behavior). Two additional domains (Nighttime behavioral disturbance, and Appetite/weight changes) are often added. The presence of problematic behaviors in each domain is assessed by asking an informant a screening question followed by a series of yes/no questions. The caregiver or surrogate reporter is then asked to rate the frequency of occurrence of that domain of behaviors. The same behaviors are then rated on level of severity (1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). The domain total score is the product of the frequency score multiplied by the severity score for that behavioral domain. A Neuropsychiatric Inventory total score is obtained by summing all the individual domain total scores.</description>

    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-report questionnaire that assesses sleep quality over a 1-month time interval. The measure consists of 19 individual items, creating 7 components that produce one global score, and takes 5-10 minutes to complete. Developed by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh, the PSQI is intended to be a standardized sleep questionnaire for clinicians and researchers to use with ease and is used for multiple populations. The questionnaire has been used in many settings, including research and clinical activities, and has been used in the diagnosis of sleep disorders. Clinical studies have found the PSQI to be reliable and valid in the assessment of sleep problems to some degree, but more so with self-reported sleep problems and depression-related symptoms than actigraphic measures.</description>

    <intervention_name>Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living</intervention_name>
    <description>Lawton's Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale was developed to assess more complex activities (termed &quot;instrumental activities of daily living&quot;) necessary for functioning in community settings (e.g., shopping, cooking, managing finances). The capacity to handle these complex functions normally is lost before basic &quot;activities of daily living&quot; which are measured by Activities of Daily Living scales. Therefore, assessing Instrumental Activities of Daily Living may identify incipient decline in older adults who are otherwise capable and healthy.The Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale takes approximately 10 to 15 minutes to administer. It contains 8 items that are rated with a summary score from 0 (low functioning) to 8 (high functioning). This scale can be administered through an interview or by a written questionnaire. The patient or a caregiver who is familiar with the patient can provide the answers.</description>

    <description>Neuropsychiatric Inventory is submitted to the caregiver, if the patient has a Mini Mental State Examination score between 10 and 20.
The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was developed by Cummings et al. (1994) to assess dementia-related behavioral symptoms which they felt other measures did not sufficiently address. The NPI originally examined 10 sub-domains of behavioral functioning: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, dysphoria, anxiety, euphoria, apathy, disinhibition, irritability/lability, and aberrant motor activity. Two more sub-domains have been added since its development: night-time behavioral disturbances and appetite and eating abnormalities (Cummings, 1997). This wide variety of domains means that, unlike other dementia measures, the NPI is able to screen for multiple types of dementia, not just Alzheimer's Disease.</description>

It was developed for individuals with dementia, based on patient, caregiver, and expert input, to maximize construct validity, and to ensure that the measure focuses on quality of life domains thought to be important in cognitively impaired older adults. It uses simple and straightforward language and responses &amp; includes assessments of the individual's relationships with friends and family, concerns about finances, physical condition, mood, and an overall assessment of life quality</description>
