  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is clear evidence that regular exercise improves wellbeing and reduces the risk of
      diabetes related complications in people with type 1 diabetes. However, many people with type
      1 diabetes do not exercise regularly. The primary reason for this is fear of hypoglycaemia
      and loss of glycaemic control associated with exercise. This loss of glycaemic control is
      associated with traditional moderate intensity continous aerobic exercise advocated in the
      guidelines for exercise in people with type 1 diabetes. Recent work (unpublished) from our
      lab suggests high intensity interval training (HIT) may reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia in
      people with type 1 diabetes, however stronger evidence is needed before firm conclusions can
      be drawn.

      Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the effects of HIT on glycaemic control in
      people with type 1 diabetes compared to no exercise and traditional moderate intensity
      continous exercise.

      24 people with type 1 diabetes will be recruited to complete a randomised counterbalanced
      cross over study comparing 3x 2-week interventions periods. During these intervention periods
      participant will maintain their habitual lifestyle but complete either no exercise (control),
      traditional moderate intensity continous exercise or high intensity interval training.
      Throughout the intervention periods participants glycaemic control will be monitored using a
      flash glucose monitor.
