      Prospective, multi-center, single-arm, non-significant risk study designed to evaluate the
      Cala TWO device. Subjects will be screened for eligibility and fitted with a Cala TWO device.
      Subjects will wear the device at home for a period of 3 months, during which they will be
      asked to stimulate their dominant hand twice a day. The stimulation amplitude will be based
      on each subject's stimulation threshold. Subjects will have in clinic assessments at
      enrollment, month 1 and 3.

    <measure>TRG (Tremor Research Group) Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale (TETRAS) subset score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3-months</time_frame>
    <description>TETRAS subset score relevant to the stimulated upper limb. The subset score is the sum of 6 rated tasks. Each task is rated 0 to 4, where a higher score indicates more severe tremor. Minimum subset score = 0; Maximum subset score = 24.</description>

    <measure>Bain &amp; Findley Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale subset score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3-months</time_frame>
    <description>Bain &amp; Findley ADL subset score relevant to the stimulated upper limb. The subset score is the sum of 8 rated tasks. Each task is rated 1 to 4, where a higher score indicates more severe tremor. Minimum subset score = 8; Maximum subset score = 32.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kinematic measurements, as collected with the device during postural holds, change from pre-stimulation to post-stimulation across sessions</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-stimulation and post-stimulation across sessions during 3-month study participation</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be prompted to perform a postural hold task before and after each stimulation session. During this task, the device will record kinematic data using on-board motion sensors to objectively assess if there are any changes in tremor level.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must be â‰¥22 years of age

          -  Competent and willing to provide written, informed consent to participate in the study

          -  A diagnosis of essential tremor as confirmed from clinical history and examination by
             a movement disorder neurologist

          -  A tremor severity score of 2 or above in the dominant hand/arm as measured by any one
             of the TETRAS upper limb items and a minimum subset score of 6 across all upper limb
             items

          -  Significant disability due to essential tremor (Bain &amp; Findley score of 3 or above in
             any one of the upper limb items and a minimum subset score of 8 across all upper limb
             items)

          -  Stable dose of tremor medications, if applicable, for 30 days prior to study entry

          -  Stable dose of antidepressant medications, if applicable, for 90 days prior to study
             entry

          -  Willing to comply with study protocol requirements including:

               -  remaining on a stable dosage of tremor and antidepressant medications, if
                  applicable, during the duration of the study

               -  no significant alcohol or caffeine consumption within 8 hours prior to study
                  visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Moderate to severe ethanol dependence as defined by the criteria outlined in the DSM-5
             (score of 4 or higher)

          -  Implanted electrical medical device, such as a pacemaker, defibrillator, or deep brain
             stimulator, or implanted metal in the wrist to be stimulated

          -  Previous thalamotomy procedure, including stereotactic thalamotomy, gamma knife
             radiosurgical thalamotomy, and focused ultrasound for the treatment of tremor

          -  Suspected or diagnosed epilepsy or other seizure disorder

             suspected on neurological examination. These include: multisystem atrophy, progressive
             supranuclear palsy, dementia with Lewy bodies, and Alzheimer's disease.

          -  Anyone suspected to have the diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). This
             includes excluding anyone with the presence of parkinsonian features including
             bradykinesia rigidity, or postural instability. Subjects who exhibit only mild resting
             tremor but no other symptoms or signs of PD may be included.

          -  Are participating or have participated in another interventional clinical trial in the
             last 30 days which may confound the results of this study, unless approved by the
             Sponsor

          -  Significant alcohol or caffeine consumption within 8 hours prior to study enrollment,
             which may confound the results of the study, where significant caffeine is considered
             more than 95 mg (equivalent to a cup of coffee), and significant alcohol is considered
             more than 14 g (equivalent to 5 oz of wine, 12 oz of beer, or 1.5 oz of distilled
             spirits).

          -  Subjects unable to communicate with the investigator and staff

          -  Any health condition that in the investigator's opinion should preclude participation
