          -  Lactose dehydrogenase (LD) ≥2 times the upper limit of normal

          -  Screening Ferritin ≥ normal and Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC) &lt; LLN based on
             central lab reference ranges. If a subject is receiving iron supplements at screening,

             enrolment and must be maintained throughout the study

          -  Platelet count of &gt;30,000/mm3 at the screening visit

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;500/ mm3 at the screening visit

          -  Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative pregnancy test at
             screening and must agree to use protocol defined methods of contraception for the

             evidence exists that subjects are non-responders to vaccination as evidenced by titers
             or display titer levels within acceptable local limits

          -  Willing and able to give informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior eculizumab (Soliris®) treatment

             immunosuppressive therapy for SAA including but not limited to cyclosporin A,
             tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil or anti-thymocyte globulin

          -  Participation in any other investigational drug trial or exposure to another
             investigational agent, device or procedure within 30 days
