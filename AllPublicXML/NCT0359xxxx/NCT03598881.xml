  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to compare the effect on oral mucosal desquamation of a non-SLS toothpaste and
      an SLS-containing toothpaste..

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will use a wash out toothpaste for at least 10 days prior to each leg of the
      crossover design. Clinical assessment of oral mucosa status will be performed by a trained
      examiner before supervised product application, 30 minutes after product application and
      again after 4 days of twice daily brushing with product. Supervised product application
      consists of cap splint application of allocated toothpaste to maxillary arch followed by
      brushing whole mouth with toothpaste and swishing with resultant slurry around the mouth.

      For visual sloughing evaluation, the oral mucosa will be divided into 12 assessment areas and
      each area evaluated for severity of sloughing on a 0 to 5 scale.

      The following outcomes will be generated from the sloughing data:

        1. Whole mouth data per subject: each non-zero severity score will be treated as one lesion
           count, giving a maximum score of 12;

        2. Subject level mucosal severity sloughing score: severity score averaged over the 12
           areas assessed.
