  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Summit is developing ridinilazole as a novel antimicrobial for Clostridium difficile
      Infection (CDI) with the goal of achieving comparable cure rates to standard of care, but
      reducing rates of recurrent disease.

      A phase 2 proof of concept study, with vancomycin as comparator, demonstrated these
      attributes with a comparable safety profile. A high fecal concentration of ridinilazole and
      little systemic exposure were noted.

      The rationale for this phase 3 study is to confirm the improvement in sustained clinical
      response of CDI over vancomycin and to compare the safety and tolerability of ridinilazole to
      that of vancomycin.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. At least 18 years of age, at the time of signing the informed consent.

          2. Signs and symptoms of CDI including diarrhea such that in the Investigator's opinion
             CDI antimicrobial therapy is required. Diarrhea is defined as a change in bowel
             habits, with ≥3 Unformed Bowel Movements (UBMs) (5, 6 or 7 on the Bristol Stool Chart)
             in the 24 h prior to randomization.

          3. The presence of either toxin A and/or B of C. difficile in the stool determined by a
             positive free toxin test, produced within 72 hours prior to randomization.

          4. Male or Female

               -  Male must agree to use contraception as detailed in the protocol during the
                  treatment period and for at least 5 days after study treatment and refrain from
                  donating sperm during this period.

               -  Female patient is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant, not
                  breastfeeding, and either:

             Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP). A WOCBP who agrees to follow the
             contraceptive guidance per protocol during the treatment period and for at least 5
             days after study treatment.

          5. Documented signed informed consent and any authorizations required by local law (e.g.
             Protected Health Information [PHI]).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. More than one prior episode of CDI in the previous 3 months or more than 3 episodes in
             the past 12 months.

          2. A history of chronic diarrheal disease including inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's
             disease or ulcerative colitis).

             of randomization (except appendectomy). Presence of a colostomy or ileostomy or likely
             requirement of an ostomy during the study.

          5. Life threatening or fulminant CDI with evidence of hypotension, septic shock,
             peritoneal signs or absence of bowel sounds, or toxic megacolon.

          6. Current history of significantly compromised immune system e.g.:

               2. Severe neutropenia with neutrophil count &lt; 500 cells/mL.

               3. Concurrent immunosuppressive therapy for recent (within previous 6 months) or

          9. Unable to discontinue products used to affect bowel movement or disease progression.

             1 month or five half-lives (whichever is longer) or within 3 months if the IMP was for
             CDI.

         11. Received an investigational vaccine against C.difficile.

         12. Patients that the Investigator feels are inappropriate for the study for any other
             reason e.g. have any conditions that would make the patient unsuitable for inclusion,
             patients not likely to complete the study for whatever reason, known hypersensitivity
             or intolerance to study IMPs, patients unwilling or unable to comply with protocol
             requirements
