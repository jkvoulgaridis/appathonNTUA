  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed work is based on the finding that one-third of the world is infected with the
      bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and only 10% of these individuals develop TB. The
      study aims to identify factors that drive progression to disease and study signals (markers
      of the immune response) that detect who will progress to active TB and why this happens.
      Armed with these markers, the study will address how malnutrition and worms alter this signal
      profile to cause active TB. The work will be conducted in India, where there are 2.8 million
      TB cases each year - more than any other country - and where the government has committed to
      eliminating TB by 2035. Data suggest that malnutrition and parasites increase risk of TB
      disease so the investigators will feed malnourished household contacts and have those with
      parasites receive medication to treat these. Using this infrastructure, the investigators
      will evaluate the immunologic impact of feeding on TB pathogenesis. An additional aim is to
      understand the role of parasitic worms with the goal of determining the utility of low-cost
      ($.02 per dose) worm treatment as part of TB control efforts. Risk of developing TB will be
      evaluated for 120 household contacts of TB patients in the setting of their malnutrition and
      parasites. There are four study arms comprised of thirty participants each -- malnourished
      with parasite infection, malnourished with no parasite infection, well-nourished with
      parasite infection, and well-nourished with no parasite infection. Correlates of risk of
      disease will be assessed using blood mRNA/miRNA sequencing and T cell immune markers. The TB
      LION study will confirm that malnutrition and worms increase the risk of active TB and will
      provide the basis for effective interventions that could change the face of the TB pandemic
      and have a profound impact on the health of people worldwide. Participants in this study will
      be household contacts of tuberculosis index cases. The index cases in this study do not
      participate in the study once a household contact is established. All interventions and
      follow up are only being conducted within the household contact cohort. All intervention
      supplies, treatments, and biologics will be purchased internationally.

    <description>Interferon Gamma -PBMC from malnourished and well-nourished HHC will be labeled with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) and then stimulated with ESAT-6 and CFP-10 peptide libraries. After 72 hours, supernatants will be harvested and the cells analyzed by flow cytometry to monitor proliferating cells. As CFSE concentrations in a cell are halved with every cell division, each generation of cells appears as a distinct peak on the flow cytometry histogram providing a proliferative index.
