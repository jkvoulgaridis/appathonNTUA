  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given that morbid obesity has been strongly associated with obstetric, neonatal and
      anesthetic complications, and that scarce reports have evaluated anesthetic and obstetric
      outcomes after cesarean delivery in morbidly obese patients; This study retrospectively
      analyzed anesthetic, obstetric and neonatal outcomes in morbidly obese pregnant patients who
      underwent cesarean delivery at Augusta University Medical Center, during a 2-year period
      (2015-2016).

      This study compared non-obese, obese and morbidly obese patients with respect to maternal,
      perinatal and anesthetic outcomes. Obstetric aspects included emergent procedure, estimated
      blood loss, obstetric complications, maternal disposition, length of stay and in-hospital
      mortality. Neonatal aspects included Apgar scores. Anesthetic aspects included anesthetic
      technique, intraoperative hemodynamic instability, failed regional anesthesia and anesthetic
      complications.
