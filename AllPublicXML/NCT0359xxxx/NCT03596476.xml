  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is defined as the reflux of gastric content into the
      esophagus that causes troublesome symptoms or complications. Nine to 30% of the population
      suffers from GERD-suggestive symptoms (heartburn, regurgitation, chest pain, chronic couch,
      sore throat). In the absence of warning signs, proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are prescribed as
      first-line treatment. However, 20 to 60% of patients are unsatisfied because of persistent
      symptoms when taking PPI. Causes of persistent symptoms are: erroneous diagnosis of GERD (up
      to 50% of PPI non-responders), rumination syndrome, excessive weakly acid reflux on PPI due
      to defective esophago-gastric junction or an excessive number of transient lower esophageal
      sphincter relaxations (main mechanism of GERD), poor acid secretion inhibition on PPI, and
      non-compliance to therapy. Complementary examinations are indicated to explain persistent
      GERD symptoms. Upper gastro-intestinal endoscopy is performed first to rule out an esophageal
      tumor and to identify erosive esophagitis, a specific sign of GERD. However, it is normal in
      up to 70% of symptomatic GERD patients. Direct detection of reflux episodes is then requested
      to confirm GERD. The gold standard for reflux detection is the ambulatory measurement of
      esophageal pH for 24 to 96 hours using a catheter (catheter-based pH-monitoring) or a capsule
      clipped into the esophagus (wireless pH-monitoring). Reflux episodes are defined as an
      esophageal pH &lt; 4. Another method of reflux detection is based on liquid and gas detection in
      the esophagus using pH-impedance monitoring. Recently the combination of impedance and
      esophageal pressure monitoring, called esophageal high resolution impedance manometry (HRIM)
      was introduced to simultaneously identify reflux episodes and their mechanisms. It has
      several advantages over esophageal pH measurement: shorter recording duration (1 or 2 hours
      post prandial) and identification of reflux mechanisms that might guide the choice of the
      best therapeutic option.

      Hypothesis: The 1-hour post prandial esophageal HRIM might be useful to diagnose GERD.

    <description>The diagnostic performance of the number of reflux episodes measured by 1-hour post prandial HRIM will be evaluated by estimating the Area Under the ROC Curve and its 95% confidence interval. The gold standard to define GERD will be based on esophageal pH measurements with capsule (GERD is defined as acid exposure time (AET; percentage of total time with esophageal pH &lt; 4) greater than 6% for at least one day on wireless pH monitoring).</description>

    <description>The diagnosis of GERD based on pH-monitoring. The diagnosis of GERD is positive if acid exposure time (AET; percentage of total time with esophageal pH &lt; 4) is greater than 6% for at least one day on wireless pH monitoring. The diagnosis of GERD is negative (ie absence of GERD) if the AET is below 4% during the 4 days of wireless monitoring. In the other instance , the diagnosis of GERD is uncertain.</description>
