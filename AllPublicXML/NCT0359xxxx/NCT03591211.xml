  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression and chronic medical conditions are common in older adults. Qigong is increasingly
      documented to have anti-depressive effects for older adults. Nevertheless, the scientific
      concepts behind qigong remain a mystery. To fill the knowledge gap, the neurobiological
      mechanism of the effects of qigong was explored. In addition, the benefits of qigong on
      subjective well-being, functional independence, sleep quality, mobility, and muscle strength
      were also tested. After random assignment, intervention group (n = 14) went through
      individual qigong exercise twice a week and for 12 weeks,whereas control group (n = 16) was
      involved in cognitive training activities with mobilization elements. The psychosocial,
      physical, and neurobiological outcomes of the two groups were compared.

    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>the change from baseline to the completion of intervention (12 weeks later)</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is used to assess the experience of depressive symptoms. The frequency of each symptom was indicated based on a 4-point scale (0 = never; 3 = almost every day). A total score ranged from 0 to 27 can be derived, with higher score indicating severer depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Salivary Cortisol Level</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 12 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>measured with saliva sample obtained 5 times (07:00, 10:30, 13:00, 14:30, and 18:00) at two consecutive days at baseline and 12 weeks after baseline</description>

    <measure>Serotonin 5-HT Level</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 12 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>measured with serum extracted from blood samples. Around 2-3 ml of serum is harvested per 5 ml of blood.</description>

    <measure>Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks after baseline, and 16 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) is a 21-item scale to measure symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress with 7 items for each. Each item is measured with 4-point from 0 (never) to 3 (almost always). The scores of depression, anxiety, and stress are the sum of all subscale items, and it can range from 0 to 21. Higher score shows more severity of depression, anxiety, and stress.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Personal Well-Being Index (PWI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks after baseline, and 16 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>It is measured by the 8-item scale of Personal Well-Being Index (PWI). Each item was rated according to an 11-point scale ranging from '0' (extremely dissatisfied) to '10' (extremely satisfied). An overall score of PWI score was the sum of all items. The overall score ranges from 0 to 110, with higher score indicating higher subjective well-being.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Independence Measure (FIM)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks after baseline, and 16 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>It is measured by the 18-item scale of Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Based on a 7-point scale for rating (1
= totally unable; 7 = totally independent), a total score of FIM ranges from 18 to 126 was generated. Higher total score indicates less disability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks after baseline, and 16 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>It is measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). It has 19 items measuring 7 components of sleep quality, and a total score is calculated as the sum of all the component scores. The total score ranges from 0 to 21, with lower score showing better sleep quality.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed up and Go Test (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks after baseline, and 16 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Timed up and Go Test (TUG) is used to measure mobility. During the test, participants were sitting on a chair, and then they were required to stand up, walk to a mark which is 3 meters away from the chair, go back to the chair from the mark, and sit down again. The time each participant spent to complete the above series of actions was recorded.
Participants performed the test for three times, and their final scores were the average of the three. And lower score indicates better mobility.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Handgrip Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks after baseline, and 16 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>It is measured with a Jamar handheld dynamometer. Participants performed three trials of left hand and right hand grip strength, and the final outcome of each hand was calculated as the mean performance of the three trials. Higher score indicates stronger handgrip strength.</description>
