  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if an investigational combination drug called Lovaza
      (made with fish oils)+Curcumin C3 Complex (made from a root called curcumin) can help reduce
      the size of lung nodules. Researchers also want to find out if the combination of
      Lovaza+Curcumin C3 Complex is safe and tolerable.
