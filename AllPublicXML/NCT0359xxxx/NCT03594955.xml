      Primary Objective:

        -  Dose escalation: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SAR440234 administered
           as a single agent in patients with R/R AML (relapsed or refractory acute myeloid
           leukemia), HR-MDS (high risk myelodysplastic syndrome), or B-ALL (B-cell acute
           lymphoblastic leukemia), and determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the
           subsequent Expansion part.

        -  Expansion part: To assess the activity of single agent SAR440234 at the RP2D in patients
           with R/R AML or HR-MDS.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To characterize the safety profile including cumulative adverse drug reactions.

        -  To evaluate the potential immunogenicity of SAR440234.

        -  To assess any preliminary evidence of hematologic response in the Dose Escalation Part.

      The duration of the study for the patients will include a period for screening of up to 14
      days. The cycle duration is 42 days. Patients will continue study treatment as long as
      clinical benefit is possible or until disease progression, unacceptable adverse reaction,
      patient's decision to stop treatment, or other reason of discontinuation. After study
      treatment discontinuation patients will return to the study site 30 days after the last
      administration of SAR440234 for end of treatment assessments. Patients without documented
      disease progression at the end of a treatment visit who have not yet started treatment with
      another anti-cancer therapy will proceed with monthly follow-up visits until initiation of
      another anti-cancer therapy, disease progression, or study cut-off date, whichever comes
      first.
