      This project is funded by a Provost Award for Dr. Sannisha Dale from the University of Miami.
      An open pilot trial and a pilot randomized control trial of a brief two-session counseling
      intervention to increase PrEP uptake among Black women at risk for HIV utilizing Motivational
      Interviewing will be conducted. Outcomes include knowledge of and motivation to use PrEP,
      PrEP uptake, and perceived barriers to PrEP usage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compared to women of other racial/ethnic groups Black women in the U.S. bear a
      disproportionate burden of the HIV epidemic in terms of numbers of new diagnoses and
      morbidity/mortality once infected. However, the advent of PrEP (Pre-exposure prophylaxis) may
      help curb the epidemic in all communities including those most impacted. PrEP is an
      antiretroviral pill (e.g. Truvada) that if taken once per day by an HIV negative individual
      protects that person from acquiring HIV from an HIV positive sexual partner. However, the
      uptake among Black women at risk for HIV remains low. Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a
      counseling style with a strong evidence base showing success in brief interventions with
      diverse samples to increase intention to quit among tobacco users, decrease alcohol
      consumption among drinkers, and increase medication adherence among individuals with chronic
      illnesses. This study will develop and pilot a brief two-session counseling intervention
      (MI-PrEP) that combines psychoeducation on PrEP, MI techniques, and case management (e.g.
      helping with access to insurance or medication programs for low-income patients) in a
      culturally-informed manner to promote PrEP uptake among Black women at high risk for HIV.

      An open pilot trial (n=10) will be conducted to examine the feasibility of all study
      procedures and participant acceptability of the resulting intervention. A two-arm pilot
      randomized control trial (RCT) (n=40) will compare an intervention group (n=20) to a control
      group (n=20) based on motivation to use PrEP and PrEP uptake (primary outcomes) and knowledge
      of PrEP and perceived barriers to PrEP uptake/usage (secondary outcomes). Participants' study
      visits will last for 6 weeks (baseline [consent and self-report measures], 2 weekly sessions,
      and 6 week follow up [self-report measures]).
