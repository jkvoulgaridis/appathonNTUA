  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of abexinostat and how well it
      works with given together with pembrolizumab in treating participants with microsatellite
      instability (MSI) solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body. Abexinostat may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells
      to grow and spread. Giving abexinostat and pembrolizumab may work better in treating
      participants with solid tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximally tolerated and recommended phase 2 dose of abexinostat in
      combination with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor (CPI). (Dose escalation)

      II. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria in patients treated with abexinostat in combination with CPI in
      patients with prior primary (cohort A) or acquired (cohort B) resistance to prior CPI
      treatment. (Dose expansion)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the objective response rate and median duration of response (DoR) by immune
      modified (i)RECIST criteria.

      II. To determine the median progression-free survival (PFS).

      III. To further characterize the safety profile of the treatment combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of abexinostat.

      Participants receive abexinostat orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21 and pembrolizumab
      intravenously (IV) on over 30 minutes day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 90 days.
