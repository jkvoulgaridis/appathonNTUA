  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depression disorder (MDD) has high estimated lifetime prevalence rates of 16.6%.
      Currently, the diagnosis for the MDD mainly depends on patients' reports of symptoms,
      observed behaviors and disease course. Establishment of clinically useful biomarkers for the
      MDD diagnosis would enhance patient management and treatment effect, and lead to the
      therapies adjusted to the individual. However, no such biomarkers have been established up to
      now. Therefore, the development of objective and feasible biomarkers is of special
      significance and a great challenge for accurate and early diagnosis and treatment of
      depression, in order to overcome the limitations of relying on clinical interviews alone.The
      ability to correctly recognize emotional states from faces is instrumental for interpersonal
      engagement and social functioning. Impairments processing of facial emotional expressions and
      biased facial emotion detection are frequently found in the MDD patients. To date, the
      studies on neural mechanism of the facial emotion recognition of the MDD patients were mainly
      based on the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Functional near-infrared
      spectroscopy (fNIRS) has not been applied for the facial emotion recognition for the
      depression patients up to now. To bridge the important gap in the literature, we used the
      fNIRS methodology to investigate the neural mechanisms of facial emotion recognition for the
      patients with depression. We hypothesize the physiological feature of the hemodynamic
      responses in prefrontal cortex measured by fNIRS under the task of face emotion recognition,
      including the difference of the median, the Mayer wave power, the mean cross wavelet
      coefficient, and the mean wavelet coherence coefficient, combined with the behavior
      measurement (behavior accuracy and response time), could provide a reliable and feasible
      diagnosis approach to differentiate patients with the MDD from healthy control (HC) subjects
      with acceptable sensitivity and specificity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The fMRI technique for functional imaging were limited by the fact that the individuals need
      to be placed in an uncomfortable or unnatural setting and foreign, noisy, dark, or
      claustrophobic environment (e.g., lying in a supine position in a narrow gantry with the head
      restrained during the entire examination), for accurate measurement during the procedure,
      with relatively lower temporal resolution. In contrast, a multi-channel fNIRS machine
      provides a completely non-invasive, quiet and mobile measurement of brain function in
      ordinary clinical settings and allows patients to be comfortably seated in a normal posture
      in a well-lit room, with higher temporal resolution making it possible to obtain a recording
      of the actual time course of a hemodynamic epoch in response to a specific cognitive task
      (e.g., facial emotion recognition task in our study) in a single trial. Additionally, due to
      the small operating and maintenance costs associated with NIRS, it is possible to run fNIRS
      study with a large sample of participants.

        This study was performed in Xijing Hospital and Xi'an Jiaotong University in China. 100
        right-handed subjects meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depression were recruited by
        advertisement to participate in the study, and were matched with a control group of 100
        comparison subjects of university staff members, university students and members of the
        general population.
