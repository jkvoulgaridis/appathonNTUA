  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multicenter, randomized, multiple-dose, laboratory-blinded, open-label, 2-arm,
      parallel-arm study in subjects with moderate acne vulgaris.

      Approximately 62 subjects will be randomized, stratified by age (Adult subjects: 17 years or
      older; Pediatric subjects: 9 years to 16 years 11 months for the Test product and 12 years to
      16 years 11 months for the Reference product). The study will be conducted in two parts, Part
      A and Part B in a sequential manner. Based on full PK profiles generated for adult subjects
      in Part A, the sparse PK sampling design in pediatric population has been established in Part
      B.
