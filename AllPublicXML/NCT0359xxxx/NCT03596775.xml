  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emergence agitation (EA) is a dissociated state of consciousness in which the child is
      inconsolable, irritable, uncooperative, typically thrashing, crying, moaning, or incoherent.
      Although usually transient, it is not only an extremely distressing event for children,
      parents, and staff, but may also result in self-injury or the need for restraint. The
      prevalence in children appears to be between 10% and 80% depending upon the definition and
      measurement tools used and is more frequently observed in the pre-school age-group. A clear
      correlation has been found between EA and negative postoperative behavioral changes,
      including anxiety, eating and sleeping disorders, enuresis, fear of darkness, that may
      persist for an extended period of time affecting emotional and cognitive
      development.Currently, numerous interventions have been studied to manage EA after surgery.
      Among them, dexmedetomidine (DEX) as a kind of highly selective α2 adrenergic receptor
      agonist has been done to reduce EA in children. Unfortunately, no studies examined
      posthospitalization negative behaviour changes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The high incidence of EA and postoperative behavioural changes has encouraged paediatric
      anaesthetists and researchers to study methods to improve the perioperative care of children.
      Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha-2 receptor agonist with properties that make it
      attractive to pediatric use. It provides sedation and anxiolysis acting on these receptors in
      the locus ceruleus of the pons. It also exerts dose-dependent moderate primary analgesic
      effects through activation of alpha-2 adrenoreceptors in the dorsal spinal horn causing a
      subsequent decrease in substance P release. The study aims to explore whether a single
      low-dose dexmedetomidine in the perioperative period has a preventive effect on EA in
      children, and through short-term and long-term follow-up, to investigate the effect on
      post-hospitalization behavioural changes.

    <description>Use the Post Hospitalisation Behaviour Questionnaire (PHBQ) scale to record the incidence of Post-hospitalization negative behaviour changes.This consists of 27 items describing six subscales: general anxiety, separation anxiety, sleep anxiety, eating disturbances, aggression against authority and apathy/withdrawal.The possible answers were provided on a scale from 1 to 5 ('much less', 'less', 'unchanged', 'more' or 'much more' than before hospitalisation).A score of 0 was awarded if no negative behaviour was reported either before or after surgery.Total score was calculated by adding up all responses.</description>
