  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ashwagandha (Withania Somnifera) is a widely used herb in Ayurvedic medicine for vitality and
      rejuvenation. This study investigates the effects of both acute and short-term oral
      supplementation of Shoden (Ashwagandha extract) intake on performance and rate of perceived
      exertion in high-intensity aerobic and anaerobic exercise.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Only a few clinical trials have looked at the effects of Ashwagandha in exercise and
      training. The studies had a dosage of 2 x 300 mg &amp; 2 x 500 mg per day for 8 weeks and found
      to stimulate effects of strength training on muscle strength and muscle mass (Wankhede et
      al., 2015) and small increments in time to exhaustion and VO2max (Shenoy et al., 2012).
      However, the training intervention in both the studies were not adequately controlled and did
      not make a distinction between the acute and short-term effects of Ashwagandha intake.

      Moreover, a lot of herbal supplements are commercially available containing majority of
      alkaloids and small amount of withaferine. European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has
      categorized anaferine, anahygrine, withanine, sominiferine, somnine, tropine etc as toxic and
      harmful. Apart from alkaloids, withaferine A has also been categorized as cytotoxic lactones
      by EFSA. The Ashwagandha extract developed by Arjuna Natural Ltd is free from these alkaloids
      and is standardized to contain about 35% glycowithanolides.

      This study will be a randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled, two treatment, crossover
      study and will be conducted in 2 phases ( acute &amp; short term) with a total of 5 identical
      test sessions. Each test session involves a maximal incremental cycling test followed by a
      90-sec maximal cycling performance test (day 1), and a 30-min simulated time-triaI on a
      cycling ergometer (day 2). Day 1 and day 2 are separated by a 24hr rest interval and for each
      subject it will be consistently scheduled on the same time of the day in order to eliminate a
      potential impact of diurnal variation in the results.
