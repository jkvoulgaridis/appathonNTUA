  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate how quickly and to what extent ACT-246475 is
      absorbed, distributed, metabolized (broken down) and eliminated from the body. ACT-246475
      will be labeled with 14‑Carbon (14C) and, in this way can be traced in blood, urine, and
      feces. This study will also investigate how safe is ACT-246475 and how well it is tolerated
      when administered to healthy male volunteers.

        Main Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent in the local language prior to any studymandated procedure,

          -  Healthy male subjects aged between 45 and 65 years (inclusive) at screening,

          -  No clinically significant findings on the physical examination at screening,

          -  Body mass index of 18.0-28.0 kg/m2 (inclusive) at screening,

          -  Systolic blood pressure (BP) 100-140 mmHg, diastolic BP 50-90 mmHg, and pulse rate
             45-90 bpm (inclusive), measured on either arm, after 5 min in the supine position at
             screening,

          -  12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) without clinically relevant abnormalities, measured
             after 5 min in the supine position at screening,

          -  Values of closure time tested with the Platelet Function Analyzer equipment, for both
             cartridges of collagen/epinephrine and collagen/adenosine diphosphate below the upper
             limit of normal range at screening.

        Main Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known hypersensitivity to ACT-246475 or drugs of the same class, or any excipients of
             the ACT-246475 formulation,

          -  History or clinical evidence of any disease and/or existence of any surgical or
             medical condition, which might interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism
             or excretion of the study treatment (appendectomy and herniotomy allowed,
             cholecystectomy not allowed),

          -  Family or personal history of prolonged bleeding (e.g., after surgical intervention)
             or bleeding disorders (e.g., thrombocytopenia, clotting disturbances), intracranial
             vascular diseases, stroke, reasonable suspicion of vascular malformations, or peptic
             ulcers,

          -  Platelet count &lt; 120 x10^9 L-1 at screening,

          -  Previous exposure to ACT-246475,

          -  Participation in another study with a radiation burden of &gt; 0.1 mSv and ≤ 1.0 mSv in a
             period of 1 year prior to screening; a radiation burden of &gt; 1 mSv and ≤ 2.0 mSv in a
             period of 2 years prior to screening, etc. (add 1 year per 1 mSv),

          -  Exposure to radiation for diagnostic reasons (except dental X-rays and plain X-rays of
             thorax and bony skeleton [excluding spinal column]), during work or during
             participation in a clinical study, in the period of 1 year prior to screening,

          -  Any circumstances or conditions, which, in the opinion of the investigator, may affect
             full participation in the study or compliance with the protocol.
