  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antihypertensive therapy has been used in pregnant patients antepartum to improve blood
      pressure (BP) elevation in cases of chronic hypertension, and postpartum for persistent
      hypertension after delivery in cases of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, as well as
      for management of chronic hypertension.

      There is limited evidence regarding the precise BP level at which antihypertensive therapy is
      indicated during pregnancy for chronic hypertension. Treatment has been suggested in pregnant
      patients when systolic BP is ≥ 160 mmHg and at a lower diastolic BP threshold of 105 mm Hg,
      however some providers may initiate therapy at systolic BPs ≥ 150 mmHg.

      Nifedipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator and an ideal first line antihypertensive
      agent due to its low maternal side-effect profile. It has been proven to be safe in
      pregnancy. Conventional nifedipine can be started at 10 mg twice daily with a maximum dose of
      120 mg/d, but frequently extended release tablets are preferred due to steady blood pressure
      control with once daily administration.

      It is frequently used however as a twice daily dosing as many providers have noticed an
      increase in the BPs 12-24h from administration. Twice daily dosing might produce overlapping
      profiles that prevent elevation of BP at the time of the next administration and breakthrough
      elevations throughout the day in pregnant women.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the mean plasma levels and standard deviations of
      Procardia at 24h after Procardia XL is administered as a 60 mg daily dose and the mean plasma
      levels after it is given as a 30 mg twice-daily dose. This will be a pilot study for a future
      randomized control trial that will allow the researchers to determine whether 60 mg daily of
      Procardia XL is equivalent to 30 mg twice daily. Secondary outcome will be effective control
      of BP throughout the day (0h, 4h, 8h, 12h, 16h, 20h and 24h) defined as BPs below 160/105 as
      well as side effects of nifedipine as reported by patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is limited evidence regarding the precise BP level at which antihypertensive therapy is
      indicated during pregnancy for chronic hypertension. Given the limitations of data as well as
      higher likelihood of outpatient therapy with less frequent blood pressure monitoring,
      treatment has been suggested in pregnant patients when systolic BP is ≥ 160 mmHg and at a
      lower diastolic BP threshold of 105 mm Hg , however some providers may initiate therapy at
      systolic BPs ≥ 150 mmHg.

      Antihypertensive therapy has not been shown to improve fetal condition or to prevent
      preeclampsia. However, such therapy controls acceleration of BP, reduces antepartum
      hospitalization due to severe hypertension and should help prevent maternal complications
      from uncontrolled hypertension such as cardiovascular (congestive heart failure and
      myocardial ischemia), renal (renal injury or failure), or cerebrovascular (ischemic or
      hemorrhagic stroke) damage.

      Drugs such as methyldopa, labetalol, and nifedipine in many occasions are used as first line
      agents for control of hypertension in pregnancy.

      Calcium channel blockers are a class of drugs that have not been extensively studied in
      pregnant women with chronic hypertension, however they are still considered standard of care
      for treatment of elevated BPs during pregnancy and after delivery. Small amounts have been
      shown to cross the placenta, however to date no known association with birth defects have
      been found with reassuring long term follow-up of babies up to 1.5 years. It is not
      associated with adverse perinatal outcomes and furthermore, nifedipine does not appear to
      adversely affect uterine or umbilical blood flow.

      Nifedipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator and an ideal first line antihypertensive
      agent due to its low maternal side-effect profile. Conventional nifedipine can be started at
      10 mg twice daily with a maximum dose of 120 mg/d, but frequently extended release tablets
      are preferred due to steady blood pressure control with once daily administration. The
      extended release tablet consists of a semipermeable membrane surrounding an osmotically
      active drug core and has been designed to provide nifedipine an approximately constant rate
      over 24h.

    <intervention_model_description>Depending on the group the person gets randomized into they will receive 60 mg of nifedipine at 0h vs 30 mg of nifedipine at 0h followed by 30 mg extra at 12h, These medications will be administered by a nurse or physician on the floor.
After 12h and at the end of the 24h (plus or minus 30 min) a blood sample (2cc) with be obtained and sent to Mount Sinai Hospital to determine serum Procardia levels. This blood samples will be stored until this research study is finished and will be disposed after. A total of 20cc of blood will be obtained from each patient.
Also the patient will take a survey of side effects of the BP medication. BPs will be measured Q 4h and documented at 0h, 4h, 8h, 12h, 16h, 20h and 24h (plus or minus 30 min)</intervention_model_description>
