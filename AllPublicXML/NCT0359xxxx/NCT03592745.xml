  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if multiple therapy sessions of Transcutaneous Vagus
      Nerve Stimulation (tVNS) combined with robotic arm therapy lead to a greater functional
      recovery in upper limb mobility after stroke than that provided by robotic arm therapy in a
      sham stimulation condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Promising new animal research suggests that vagus nerve stimulation paired with motor
      intervention induces movement-specific plasticity in the motor cortex and improves limb
      function after stroke. These results were recently extended to the first clinical trial, in
      which patients with stroke demonstrated significant improvements in upper limb function
      following rehabilitation paired with implanted VNS. Currently, vagus nerve stimulation is
      being used clinically to treat a number of human diseases including migraine headaches,
      epilepsy, and depression, and these investigations are expanding to deliver stimulation via a
      transcutaneous route to potentially improve intervention efficacy and decrease side effects.
      This pilot study will combine non-invasive transcutaneous stimulation of the vagus nerve with
      upper limb robotic therapy to investigate the potential of tVNS to augment improvements
      gained with robotic therapy in patients with chronic hemiparesis after stroke.
