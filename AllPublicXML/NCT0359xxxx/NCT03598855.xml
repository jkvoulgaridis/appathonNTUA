  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the impact of 7 days of daily ischemic preconditioning
      (IPC) on vascular function and insulin sensitivity in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Occlusion (cuff inflation to a pressure that reduces blood flow) using a blood pressure cuff
      on the upper arm for 5 mins followed by recovery (cuff deflation so blood flows normally
      gain), is known as ischemic preconditioning (IPC). An intervention consisting of 4 cycles of
      5 min arm occlusion followed by 5 min periods of recovery on a daily basis can improve blood
      vessel function. This is a simple and easily applicable intervention that immediately
      improves the blood vessels capacity to deliver blood to an organ (e.g. heart or the muscle).
      However, it is currently unknown if a daily IPC can improve blood vessel function in patients
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and if it will aid in improving blood glucose control.
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate if daily IPC for 7 days can improve
      blood vessel function and blood glucose control in T2DM.

      This randomised control trial consists of 3 visits to Liverpool John Moores University;
      before intervention, immediately following intervention, and 8 days following the end of the
      intervention. Participants will be trained to apply the IPC device and then perform it at
      home daily for 7 days.
