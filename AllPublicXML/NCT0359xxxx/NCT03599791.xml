      This study is a phase III clinical study to assess the efficacy and safety of Dymista® Nasal
      Spray in comparison to Azep® nasal spray and Flixonase® nasal spray in Chinese patients aged
      ≥ 12 years with moderate-to-severe allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis.

      This is a multicentre, randomized, active controlled prospective clinical trial in adult and
      adolescent patients with AR (seasonal and/or perennial), who have moderate-to-severe symptoms
      (rhinitis/ rhinoconjunctivitis), based on the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma
      (ARIA) 2008 Guidelines. The study consists of a 3 to 7-day Lead-in Period during which
      patients must meet a minimum symptom severity score to be eligible for the Treatment Period.
      All patients will start the Lead-in Period straight after Screening Visit as soon as
      in/exclusion criteria are fulfilled. The Lead-in Period will be followed by a 14-day
      double-blind Treatment Period. At some time point during the study, patients will receive
      Placebo and Dymista® nasal spray or Azep® nasal spray or Flixonase® nasal spray, 1 spray per
      nostril twice daily according to randomization. On the first day of the Lead-in Period
      patients must meet study inclusion/exclusion criteria and have a sufficient AR symptom score
      to qualify for entry. Qualified patients will be requested to keep a Diary of nasal and
      ocular symptoms throughout the study period. Additionally, patients will be requested to
      complete the Adult Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) and EuroQoL 5D
      questionnaire (EQ-5D) on Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15. Both Questionnaires will be completed by
      adult patients only.

    <description>Total nasal symptom score (TNSSS) is a sum of 4 individual nasal symptom scores: nasal itching, runny nose, congestion and sneezing. Each nasal symptom will be assessed according to a 4-ponit scale (0 = no, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe symptom); thus, each TNSS will be in the range from 0 (no symptoms at all) to 12 (all 4 symptoms are severe) and the combined 12-hour reflective TNSS (morning + evening) will be in the range of 0 to 24 accordingly</description>

             with either intranasal antihistamine or glucocorticoid is not considered sufficient at
             the discretion of the Investigator and/or designee.

          6. Willing and able to comply with the study requirements.

          7. At least a 2-year history of AR (seasonal and/or perennial) during the same time of

             randomization).

          9. General good health and free of any disease or concomitant treatment that could
             interfere with the interpretation of the study results as determined by the
             Investigator or the sponsor's medical officer. When in doubt, the Investigator should
             confer with the sponsor's medical monitor or designee to determine eligibility for the
             study.

         10. Patient agrees to avoid prohibited medication and alcohol and use effective methods of
             contraception during the study.

          8. Nasal disease(s) likely to affect deposition of intranasal medication, such as
             sinusitis, rhinitis medicamentosa, clinically significant polyposis, or nasal
