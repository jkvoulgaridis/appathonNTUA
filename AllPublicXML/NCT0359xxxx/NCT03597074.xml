      Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess the ability of early discrimination between
      transient and persistent Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) using the color Doppler Ultrasound derived
      Renal Resistive Index (RI) and semi-quantitative evaluation of intra-renal vascularization in
      septic patients in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

      Methods: Prospective observational cohort study with unselected, with 32 adult consecutive
      septic patients. Patients were divided into 3 groups: Group 1: patients without progression
      to AKI, Group 2: transient AKI, Group 3: persistent AKI.

      Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess the ability of early discrimination between
      transient and persistent AKI using the color Doppler Ultrasound derived Renal Resistive Index
      (RI) and semi-quantitative evaluation of intra-renal vascularization in septic patients in an
      Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Additionally, the investigators aimed to identify whether these
      indexes are early predictors of the prognosis of renal function in this group of patients.
      And compare the diagnostic accuracy of those and other renal indexes for the identification
      of AKI reversibility.

      Methods: This was a prospective observational cohort study with unselected, consecutive
      septic patients included. Thirty-two adult septic patients hospitalized in a general ICU were
      studied. After the determination of sepsis, patients were divided into 3 groups: Group 1
      included patients without progression to AKI, Group 2 included patients with transient AKI
      and Group 3 patients with persistent AKI.

        Subjects were included if they developed sepsis plus AKI during their hospitalization in
        the ICU, regardless of the underlying cause. The presence of Acute Kidney Injury was
        determined according to the KDIGO guidelines, i.e. at least stage 1 AKI. The categorization
        of AKI as transient or persistent was determined by the normalization of the kidney
        function after the administration of appropriate therapy and support in the ICU environment
        and after 3 days of hospitalization. All consecutive patients with sepsis were included,
        with the exception of those surviving less than three days, to determine whether they had
        AKI
