  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Tolcapone crosses from the blood stream
      into the fluid around the brain and stabilizes the protein that makes leptomeningeal amyloid.
      Tolcapone is a commercially available generic drug that treats Parkinson's disease.

      The Investigator plans to evaluate Tolcapone as a treatment for ATTR (Transthyretin
      Amyloidosis), a rare genetic disease often causing death within 5-15 years after diagnosis.
      ATTR is characterized by deposition of misfolded protein known as amyloid, in one or more
      organ systems (including the peripheral and autonomic nervous systems, the heart, the brain
      and the eyes). The age at which symptoms begin to develop varies widely ranging between 20 to
      70 years old. ATTR is progressive, and some variants can have a fatal outcome within a few
      years of presentation. Treatment options include supportive and symptomatic care that may
      slow or stop progressive decline in functional state but do not alter the pathological
      process. Liver transplant can be performed in selected patients but is limited by organ
      supply, requires lifelong immunosuppression, and may be complicated by progressive heart and
      nerve amyloid deposition. Importantly, liver transplant does not alter the natural course of
      central nervous system amyloid disease. To date, no treatment for ATTR penetrates the CNS.

      At present there is no FDA approved treatment for ATTR amyloidosis in the US. In Europe,
      Tafamidis has been approved for treatment of stage 1 ATTR-polyneuropathy since 2012.
      Tafamidis and Tolcapone bind to the thyroxine binding site of TTR (with different
      drug-transthyretin interactions) and in so doing stabilizes the tetrameric form of TTR,
      preventing dissociation and amyloid fibril formation The preclinical and clinical data from a
      variety of experimental systems support the therapeutic activity of TOLCAPONE in TTR mediated
      disease.

      This study is designed as a clinical proof-of-concept evaluating whether TOLCAPONE is capable
      of stabilizing tetrameric TTR (Transthyretin) in the plasma and CSF of symptomatic or
      asymptomatic patients with leptomeningeal ATTR. Additionally the study will determine the
      plasma and CSF concentrations of TOLCAPONE needed to induce maximal stabilization of TTR
      across different TTR variants (TTR mutations).

      The study will be carried out in two different populations of subjects, defined by the TTR
      variant expressed:

        -  Mutant TTR (up to 10 subjects): symptomatic leptomeningeal TTR patient with any
           documented leptomeningeal mutations in the TTR gene.

        -  Mutant TTR (remaining subjects up to 10): asymptomatic leptomeningeal TTR patient with
           any documented leptomeningeal mutation in the TTR gene.

      TTR tetramers stability in plasma and CSF samples will be determined by urea-induced
      denaturation methodology.

    <description>Tolcapone will be administered to assess the short-term (4 weeks) effects on plasma and CSF TTR tetramer stability in subjects with TTR CNS Amyloidosis. Tolcapone is currently licensed for the treatment of Parkinson's disease in combination with levodopa/carbidopa. It is an immediate release product and is currently used at either 100 mg or 200 mg three times a day during waking hours. During this trial, participants will be taking 100mg for 14 days, and then 200mg for 14 days.</description>
