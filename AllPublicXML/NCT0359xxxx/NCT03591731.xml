  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine tumors of the lung include the small cell carcinoma (SCLC), and large cell
      neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) and represent 20% of lung cancer. One of the only studies
      reported to date is reporting on a progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)
      of 5.2 months and 7.7 months, respectively.

      Poorly differentiated gastroentero-pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas (GEP-NEC) represent a
      small sub-group of digestive NENs, according to the studies, 7 to 21% of patients. However,
      their prognosis is more negative, with the 5-year survival at less than 20%.

      Many Phase III trials showed superiority in terms of efficacy and tolerance of
      nivolumab+/-ipilimumab versus standard chemotherapy in second-line treatment in metastatic
      solid tumors. Neuroendocrine tumors are considered as rare disease without therapeutic
      guidelines in this setting. The French academic oncology groups (IFCT, FFCD and GERCOR) have
      the opportunity to recruit a sufficient number of patients, in a reasonable period of time,
      to provide a proof-of-concept of the safety and efficacy of nivolumab+/-ipilimumab in this
      population.
