  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Globally, cataract is the major cause of blindness accounting for 51% of total blindness and
      there are regional variations in it. Today, cataract surgery is a highly successful and
      cost-effective procedure, which enhances both the vision and quality of life of patients.

      Visual acuity alone should not be used as a criterion for planning cataract surgery, since
      visual acuity and function do not necessarily correlate. Therefore, there is a need to review
      our criteria for management.

      Based on recent studies, at least 90% of the patients undergoing cataract surgery obtain a
      postoperative visual acuity of 6/12 or better in the absence of coexisting ocular pathology.

      A number of previous studies have looked at the effect of risk factors on visual outcomes
      following cataract surgery. Risk factors commonly associated with worse visual outcomes
      include: age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, corneal opacity/pathology,
      older age, female sex, previous vitrectomy, previous retinal detachment surgery,
      alpha-blockers, complex surgery, intraoperative complications and refractive surprise.

        All patients for cataract surgery received a comprehensive ophthalmic examination. The
        standard pre-operative examination included a detailed history, measurements of presenting
        visual acuity
