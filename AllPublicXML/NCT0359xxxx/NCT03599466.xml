  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to compare the bioavailability of a generic product of
      lisinopril with that of a reference product when administered to healthy volunteers under
      fasting condition. The test product is BF-Lisinopril Tablet 20mg (HK-63564) manufactured by
      Bright Future Pharmaceuticals Factory O/B Bright Future Pharmaceutical Laboratories Limited,
      and the reference product is Zestril Tab 20mg (HK-30515). The bioequivalence or
      bioinequivalence of the test and reference formulations will be assessed and concluded based
      on the plasma pharmacokinetic data of lisinopril, as well as WHO guidelines on registration
      requirements to establish interchangeability.

      It is planned to enroll 16 to 30 healthy subjects, with an aim to obtain at least 12
      evaluable subjects. The study design is a single-dose, two-treatment, two-period,
      two-sequence crossover with a washout period of one to two weeks. During each study session,
      the subjects will be administered a single dose of 20mg lisinopril (one BF-Lisinopril tablets
      20mg or one Zestril Tab 20mg) after an overnight fast of approximately 10 hours. Venous blood
      samples will be collected at pre-dose (0h) and at 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,24 and 48 hours
      post-dose (13 time points). The plasma concentrations of lisinopril will be determined by a
      validated assay. The non-compartmental method will be used to analyze the plasma
      concentration-time data and calculate the main pharmacokinetic parameters such as Cmax, Tmax,
      AUC0-last, AUC0-inf, and T1/2. ANOVA will be calculated on logarithmically transformed Cmax,
      AUC0-last and AUC0-inf. The two one sided tests will be used to calculate the 90% confidence
      intervals for the mean difference in AUC0-last, AUC0-inf and Cmax and to assess the
      bioequivalence of the two products.
