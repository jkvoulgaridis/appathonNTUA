      Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) aiming at assessing the efficacy of an interdisciplinary
      multi-component and personalized multi-factorial intervention for reducing falls at one year
      post-enrolment in comparison to the usual care in a sample of community dwelling elderly (age
      ≥65 years), with or without Parkinson's Disease and/or previous Stroke.

      BACKGROUND: Current literature on fall prevention for community-dwelling elderly who are at
      risk of falling suggests that: 1) either single, multicomponent or multifactorial
      interventions are effective at preventing falls; 2) elderly at risk of falling with
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) and previous Stroke, although having an even greater risk of
      falling, are often excluded by these interventions; 3) often, present screening methods for
      risk of falling do not allow the early identification of subjects at risk before the first
      fall.

      AIMS

        -  To compare the efficacy of an interdisciplinary multicomponent and personalized
           multifactorial intervention aiming at reducing falls in comparison to the usual care, in
           a sample of community dwelling elderly, with or without Parkinson's Disease and/or
           previous Stroke, within the context of an RCT.

        -  To improve the accuracy of screening tests for risk of falling by using wearable
           inertial sensors.

        -  To develop a reduced set of clinical and instrumental indicators, to be utilized as a
           quick and reliable screening tests in outpatients clinics.

      METHODS: multicenter, randomized controller trial, with blind assessments on pretest, postest
      and on one-year follow-up.

      POPULATION: community-dwelling elderly (aged ≥65 years) with age-related or neurological
      condition-related (Parkinson's Disease and/or Stroke) risk of falling.

      INTERVENTION: interdisciplinary multi-component (group-based exercise; home-based exercise;
      increasing knowledge/education; home safety interventions) and personalized multi-factorial
      interventions (assessment and treatment of individual fall risk factors) CONTROL: structured
      information about participant's own personal risk factors given to the family doctor.

      OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint is the fall rate at one year in both groups. The secondary
      endpoint is the fall risk at one year.

      EXPECTED RESULTS: in the intervention group, a significant reduction in the number of total
      fall is expected, together with decreases indicators of utilization of acute health services
      because of falls. At three months, it is expected a significant improvement of functioning
      (motor functions, activity and participation) and health quality indicators.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Community-dwelling elderly (aged ≥65 years)

          2. Moderate to high fall risk, either associated to aging or to neurological diseases as
             Parkinson's Disease and stroke.

          3. Ability to walk 10 meters without assistance (walking aid permitted)

          4. Informed consent to participation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Whatever concurrent medical condition which may constitutes a contraindication to
             physical exercise

          2. Known cognitive decline or an established diagnosis of dementia (mini mental score
             &gt;24) or an evident cognitive decline on pre-enrolment which would be likely to impair
             the ability of comprehension of simple instructions and / or of collaborating

          3. Severe hearing impairment, so that a subject will not understand less than 80% of
             ordinary conversation with/or without hearing aids.

          4. Severe hypovision, not counteracted by lenses, which will limit the patient in
             executing at least one activity of daily living (for instance, necessity of assistance
             for walking because of visual deficit).

          5. Severe aphasia or visuo-spatial deficits, to the extent that these impairments will
             limit significantly the ability to comprehend (orally or visually) simple
             instructions.

          6. Acute vertigo or dizziness lasting less than 3 months

          7. Regular participation to other exercise program that it is likely to challenge
