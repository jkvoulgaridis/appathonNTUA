    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of
      teduglutide in Japanese participants with PN/IV (parenteral nutrition/intravenous)-dependent
      SBS (short bowel syndrome) who completed SHP633-306 or who were in the extension phase of the
      TED-C14-004 (NCT02340819) study.
