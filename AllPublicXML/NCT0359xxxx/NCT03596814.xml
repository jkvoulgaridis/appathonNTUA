    <textblock>
      MOTHIF II is a non-interventional, multicenter, retrospective, observational data collection
      in seven French Haemophilia Treatment Centers of the BERHLINGO network. In the context of the
      arrival of new extended half-life products, the MOTHIF II study aims to describe the changes
      in therapeutic management of patients with hemophilia A &amp; B, following the provision of FVIII
      and FIX extended half-life factors in France; it will also permit to carry out a budget
      impact analysis to quantify the economic significance of this new era.

      Treatment regimens for haemophiliacs patients treated with clotting factors will be analysed
      globally for the patients of the two periods, by subgroup:

        -  type of hemophilia: A or B

        -  severity: severe, moderate, mild

        -  history of inhibitors

      and then for each subgroup:

        -  by regimen: 1) Prophylaxis 2) On demand 3) ITI

        -  by type of clotting factors: FVIII or FIX or by-passing agents, plasma-derived or
           recombinant, standard or extended half-life clotting factors, INN

      Will also be included in the analyse:

        -  demographic data: age (years)

        -  clinical data: weight (kgs) if available

        -  treatment data: regimen, consumptions (number of UI of clotting factors consumed on the
           period) and costs of clotting factors (€).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients hemophiliac A or B, with or without inhibitors, included in the Nhemo (7
             centres) and the Behrlingo database, treated with factor 8 or factor 9 products or
