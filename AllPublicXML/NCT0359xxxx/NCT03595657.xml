  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single-arm, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      CS1001 monotherapy for Relapsed or Refractory Extranodal Natural Killer/ T Cell Lymphoma
      (NKTL)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects with rr-NKTL after prior asparaginase-based chemotherapy or chemo
      radiotherapy are planned to receive CS1001 1200 mg intravenous infusion every three weeks
      until progression of disease, intolerable toxicity, consent withdrawn, death. The primary
      endpoint of this trial is objective response rate (ORR), as assessed by independent
      radiological review committee (IRRC) based on Criteria for Response Assessment of Lymphoma:
      Lugano 2014 Classification.
