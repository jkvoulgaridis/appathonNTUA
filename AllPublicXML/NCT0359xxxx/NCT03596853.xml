  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immobilization and bed rest of patients in intensive care units (ICU) increases their risk
      for muscle dysfunction and prolonged mechanical ventilation, leading to physical
      deconditioning and loss of functionality. Active mobilization is a therapeutic strategy that
      typically involves exercises in which the patient uses his or her own strength and muscular
      control, is a feasible, safe, and low-cost intervention to improve muscle dysfunction and
      disability in patients at the ICU. Despite scientific advances, the current description and
      prescriptions of exercises at the ICU remain incomplete with respect to the control and the
      description of the variables of training load (volume and intensity), programming, and
      progression.

      This prospective double-blind (patient and evaluator). This study will be conducted in
      accordance with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials recommendations. The trial will be
      performed at the University Hospital Professor Edgard Santos in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. This
      study was approved by the institutional hospital ethics committee (approval reference number
      2.371.933). Before enrollment, written informed consent will be obtained from participants or
      their legal guardians.

    <description>Health-Related Quality of Life will be measured by a questionnaire 36-item Short Form Health Survey. The SF-36 is a widely used generic instrument for evaluating HRQoL, consisting of eight subscales evaluating specific health status domains and two summary scales, a Physical Component Summary and a Mental Component Summary. Scores on the SF-36 range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health status.</description>

    <description>Will be applied once a day, 5x/ week, performed into 4 levels: N1 (bridge and rolling for both sides); N2 (transfer training from lying down to sitting on both sides); N3 (sit and stand up from a chair); N4 (running training). According to their functional level, patients will perform, once a day, 8 sets of each movement, alternating 20 seconds of execution with 10 seconds of rest. Patients will be stimulated constantly to perform the movements with the highest possible speed.
If the patient performs adequately within of your level functional level, can will progress in level, if can not progress, there will be an increase in training volume within the level itself. Adequate performance within the functional level means that the patient is able to complete more than eight sets of exercise and does not present increased sensation of pain, present sensation of perceived exertion within the safety limit of the protocol (Borg ≤ 6).</description>
