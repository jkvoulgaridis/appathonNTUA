  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle weakness, which is one of the most common symptoms in patients with MS, limits the
      activities of daily life activities of patients by causing balance and gait disturbance.
      Lower extremity muscle strengths of MS patients are reported to be weaker than healthy
      individuals. Broekmans et al. showed that the weakness of the knee flexor and extensor
      muscles in patients with MS caused a decrease in walking distance and they are important
      determinants of walking capacity.

      The effects of the endurance and strength of core muscles, as well as the extremity muscles,
      are important on physical performance. The weakness of the extremities and core muscles in MS
      patients also affects the sit-to-stand performance negatively as well as a decrease in
      walking speed and capacity.

      In this study, it was aimed to investigate the effects of extremity and core muscle strength
      on walking and sitting-up performance of MS patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with MS between 0-5,5 score according to the Extended Disability Status Scale (EDSS)
      and healthy individuals of similar age and sex to patients will be included in the study. The
      strength of the extremity and core muscles, walking capacity, and sit-to-stand performance
      will be evaluated once.

      Investigators will use descriptive statistics and t-tests to compare variables between
      groups. Investigators will examine the correlations between variables using Pearson bivariate
      correlations. The significance level is set at p&lt;0,05

    <measure>Side Bridge Test (core muscles endurance)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects were asked to lay on their left or right sides and to extend their legs fully. Then The subjects are asked to create a straight line with their body by lifting their hip from the floor.The measurements are recorded with a chronometer as seconds. The tests end when the subjects break the test positions.</description>

    <measure>Modified Biering-Sorensen test (core muscles endurance)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>In this test, the subjects are asked to lie down on a workout bench, aligning their anterior superior iliac spine with the edge of the bench, which allowed the upper body to be planked out over the edge. The subjects are asked to fold their arms on their chest and to put their hands on their shoulders. The measurements are recorded with a chronometer as seconds. The tests end when the subjects break the test positions.</description>

    <measure>Trunk Flexion Test (core muscles endurance)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This test is initiated when the subjects are in a sit-up position with their back resting against a wedge that was angled 55° from the floor. The measurements are recorded with a chronometer as seconds. The tests end when the subjects break the test positions.</description>

    <description>In this test, the subjects put their elbows on the ground as the starting position and open their feet about the width of their hips while keeping their body straight as they are required not to arch or bow. The measurements are recorded with a chronometer as seconds. The tests end when the subjects break the test positions.</description>
