  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today's children have become increasingly inactive and unfit, with &gt;50% of children not
      meeting the recommended 60 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Previous research
      has suggested that acute aerobic exercise of moderate intensity was associated with improved
      cognition manifested by improved performance and increased P3 amplitude, a neuroelectric
      indicator that reflects the amount of attentional allocation, in tasks requiring cognitive
      control. While minimal evidence exists to support potential mechanisms underlying the
      transient effects of exercise on brain and cognition, research suggests that phasic changes
      in the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) (as measured by salivary alpha amylase (sAA))
      system are a potential mechanism for explaining the acute effect of exercise on brain and
      cognition. Accordingly, the aim of this study is to examine the mechanisms linking acute
      aerobic exercise to improved cognitive control as well as the underlying neuroelectrical
      activities in children, using electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials
      (ERPs). We hope to gain a better understanding of the role of acute exercise and cognitive
      and brain health. The results from this study will help identify mechanisms linking acute
      exercise to enhanced cognitive performance in children.

      Our hypothesis is that exercise-induced phasic increases in sympathetic nervous system
      activity will mediate the effect of a single bout of exercise on brain function, cognition,
      and standardized achievement test performance.
