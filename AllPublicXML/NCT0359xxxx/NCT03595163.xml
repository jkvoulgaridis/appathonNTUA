      This study is a prospective single center, cross-reference clinical application study.This
      study plan to enroll 40 children with cochlear implant surgery. Children were selected
      randomly and divided into 2 groups.Each group has 20 patients. All children undergo
      orotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation will given by anaesthetic machine (U.S. Ohmeda
      advance cs2 ) to maintain oxygen saturation above 95%, hemodynamics and other vital signs
      were monitored with the anesthesia monitor.In the operation room,2-3ml arterial blood will be
      taken.And the levels of homocysteine and folic acid will be measured at week 1.

    <description>Children aged 1 month to 3 years who were scheduled to undergo cochlear implant surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled in this study.Children were treated with an infusion bolus of 2.0mg/kg propofol during anesthesia induction and maintained with 2.0-2.5vol% sevoflurane, with the dosage adjusted to achieve loss of consciousness.The bispectral index of EEG was maintained between 50 and 60 in all groups.The homocysteine and folic acid concentrations were measured after anesthesia induction and at the end of surgery separately .</description>
