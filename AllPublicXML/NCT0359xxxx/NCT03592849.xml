    <description>After history taking, physical examination, ultrasound examination and hysteroscopy examination，infertile women diagnosed with thin endometrium or endometrial scarring will be included in the clinical trial. A collagen scaffold loaded with UC-MSCs will be transplanted into the uterine cavity during hysteroscopy, and participants will receive hormone replacement therapy before and after the treatment. Postoperative observations including ultrasound examination once a month for 3 times and hysteroscopy in the third month after first UC-MSCs therapy. Those whose endometrium is suitable for pregnancy will be recommended attempting conception actively. The next round of cell therapy will be conducted 3 cycles after the first month if the endometrial growth is unsatisfactory.</description>
