    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study to understand how environmental and genetic factors may be
      involved in lung function. Study participants will undergo a 1-day screening that includes a
      blood draw and breathing testing, return for a two-day series of testing to include blood
      draw, and brief breathing test before and after an inhaled challenge with either filtered air
      (FA) or ozone (O3). Participants return the next day for a brief breathing test, a blood draw
      and a procedure called bronchoscopy to evaluate the lung after the challenge. Participants
      then return 18 - 20 days later to repeat the two-day series of testing to be challenged with
      the exposure not received on the first series, (FA or O3). Each visit will take about 3 - 3.5
      hours. Follow-up phone calls from the study team will occur at 24 hours after each 2-day test
      series. Total study duration is about one to one-and a half months.

    <measure>Change in Ozone (O3) induced epithelial permeability, as measured by the level of clara cell secretory protein (ng/mL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 21 days</time_frame>
    <description>This measure is defined by the comparing each individuals baseline (following filtered air challenge) to the ozone response. The investigators will perform two tests on this response as a means of confirmation. The individual will have blood drawn to obtain serum and a bronchoscopy to obtain bronchoalveolar lavage. The serum will be used to determine the level of clara cell secretory protein. This is measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The value is reported as ng/mL. Each value will be compared to the individuals filtered air control and reported as a fold change from baseline. These are independent values but are both accepted in the literature as measures of epithelial permeability.</description>

    <description>This measure is defined by the comparing each individuals baseline (following filtered air challenge) to the ozone response. The investigators will perform two tests on this response as a means of confirmation. The individual will have blood drawn to obtain serum and a bronchoscopy to obtain bronchoalveolar lavage. The bronchoalveolar lavage will be similarly used to define the albumin level. Albumin is also measured by ELISA. The value is reported at ug/mL. Each value will be compared to the individuals filtered air control and reported as a fold change from baseline. These are independent values but are both accepted in the literature as measures of epithelial permeability.</description>
