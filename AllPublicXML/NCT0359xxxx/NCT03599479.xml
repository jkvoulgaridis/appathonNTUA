      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of virtual reality experiences on acute
      pain and distress caused by fluoroscopic pain intervention in chronic pain patient.

      The investigators perform lots of interventions for patients. But unfortunately, patients
      cannot help being exposed to the acute pain and fear during the interventions. &quot;Virtual
      Reality(VR)&quot; is a state-of-art advanced technology, which is now being extended to various
      medical fields such as pain management, dental treatment, body rehabilitation and cancer
      pain. There is no study that have conjugated the virtual reality experience for patients'
      acute pain and anxiety which occurs during the pain interventions. So the investigators like
      to evaluate the effects of virtual reality experience on acute pain and anxiety precipitated
      by the pain interventions.

    <description>After experiencing the VR machine in the transfer bed for 5 minutes, the subject moves to the operating room.
After the subject moves to the surgical bed, he/she takes the appropriate position for the fluoroscopic pain intervention, and wears the virtual reality device (headset, headphone, smartphone).
After the subject starts the VR program, the practitioner starts the fluoroscopic pain intervention.
Lidocaine skin infiltration and description of the practitioner during the intervention are performed with the intervention when necessary.</description>
