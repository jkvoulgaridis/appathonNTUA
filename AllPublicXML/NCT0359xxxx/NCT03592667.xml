  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of arterial hypertension has remained the same in the last 5 years, however,
      almost 50% of the population continues without an adequate adjustment according to the
      National Health Survey of the Midway 2016.

      It has been shown that the variability of blood pressure (VBP) during 24 h and visit-visit is
      associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) over the effect of blood pressure (BP) itself.
      On the other hand, arterial stiffness is well known as an independent factor of CVD risk and
      for its evaluation the ambulatory arterial stiffness index (AASI) has been proposed. AASI and
      the VPA obtained through an evaluation by ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) individual of 24 h.

      Dapagliflozin is an inhibitor of the sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 (iSGLT2) for the
      treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) that promotes natriuresis and osmotic diuresis,
      which produces a decrease in plasma volume and a decrease in BP.

      The aim of ths study is to evaluate the effect of dapagliflozin on VBP and AASI in
      individuals with stage I hypertension whitout DM2.

      The investigators hypothesis is that the administration of dapagliflozin decreases the VBP
      and AASI in individuals with stage I hypertension whitout DM2.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 20 patients with a diagnosis
      of stage I hypertension without DM2.

      They will be assigned randomly two groups of 10 patients each to receive 10 mg of
      Dapagliflozin (Forxiga, Astra Zeneca) or placebo, one per day before breakfast during 12
      weeks.

      There will be calculated indices of VBP: 24 h, daytime and night-time standard deviation
      (SD), coefficient of variation (CV), 24 h weighted SD, Day-to-nigth BP changes and average
      real variability (AVR). On the other hand, AASI will be calculated with a linear regression.

      This protocol it's already approved by the local ethics committee and written informed
      consent it's going to be obtained from all volunteers.

      Statistical analysis will be presented through measures of central tendency and dispersion,
      average and deviation standard for quantitative variables; frequencies and percentages for
      variable qualitative. Qualitative variables will be analyzed by X2 o exact fisher test, will
      be used for differences inter-group. Mann-Whitney U Test and Wilcoxon Test for the
      within-groups differences. It will be considered statistical significance p ≤0.05.
