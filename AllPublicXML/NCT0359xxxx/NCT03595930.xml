  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, PMS study to observe the safety and effectiveness of
      ARNUITY administered in asthma subjects in a real world setting. This PMS shall observe how a
      broad range of subjects use the drug in the early stages after obtaining the approval. The
      objective of this PMS is to collect safety and effectiveness data on ARNUITY's approved label
      in a real world setting. Total of 600 subjects shall be recruited throughout the PMS period;
      01 Sep, 2018 to 30 June 2020. ARNUITY is the registered trademark of GSK group of companies.

    <time_frame>Up to 22 months</time_frame>
    <description>A SAE refers to any one of the following adverse events, which: results in death or is life-threatening; results in or prolongs hospitalization; results in persistent or serious disability or incapacity; results in a birth defect or anomaly; or is an important medical event. SADR is defined a SAE whose causal relationship with the product cannot be ruled out.</description>

        This PMS will be conducted with subjects who were administered ARNUITY in accordance with
        the approved label. The safety analysis population shall consist of subjects who have
        administered at least one dose of ARNUITY and have received at least one safety assessment.
        The effectiveness analysis population shall consist of subjects who have completed the
        physician's effectiveness assessment (i.e., improved, unchanged, exacerbated, or
        un-assessable) based on the results of the pulmonary function test or asthma symptom
        control after administering ARNUITY for 24 weeks (or longer).
