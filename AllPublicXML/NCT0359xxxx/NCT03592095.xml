  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry needling (DN) is a treatment technique widely used in patients with various
      musculoskeletal health problems due to myofascial trigger points (MTrP). DN has shown to have
      positive effect on pain and function in patients with mechanical neck pain. These positive
      results are thought to be the consequence of specific neurophysiological and mechanical
      processes. Research has shown that DN induces 1) end plate inhibition, 2) reduction of
      inflammatory substances, 3) increase of blood flow and oxygen and 4) a reduction of
      nociceptive afferent activity. However, the exact working mechanisms underlying DN effects is
      still a topic of debate. This trial addresses one of the major methodological issues in
      needle testing,the effects of proper blinding. DN is a specific technique that is not easily
      be replaced by another comparable intervention. A sham needle with a blunt tip was created
      that simulates penetration into the skin without actually doing so. Research about a valid
      method for the control in needling studies is for this reason of particular relevance. A
      proper blinding technique is of importance to further the field of DN.

      The objectives of this study are to analysize short-term effects on pain intensity and
      pressure pain sensitivity according to previous experience (blinding) in subjects with
      mechanical neck pain receiving real or sham-DN and to determine the success in masking DN
      versus sham DN in patients with mechanical neck pain based on prior experience with this
      technique.

This needle has a blunt tip and retractable handle that created the illusion of a needle penetrating the skin. When this needle touches the skin, a pricking sensation will be created. However, when pressure will be increased, the shaft of the needle disappears into the handle creating a sensation on the patient.</description>
