  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the safety and preliminary efficacy of a dendritic cell
      DKK1 vaccine against myeloma. Dendritic cells are immune cells that are collected from the
      blood of the patient at Case Western Reserve Medical Center and then brought into contact
      with DKK1, a molecule that is present of myeloma cells but not to a significant amount on
      other cells except for the prostate and the placenta. It is an investigational (experimental)
      vaccine that based on studies in the laboratory and in mice is expected to work by
      presentation of DKK1 to anticancer immune cells via dendritic cells leading to an immune
      attack on myeloma cells. It is experimental because it is not approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA).

      The overall objective of this pilot study is to determine the safety and preliminary efficacy
      of a dendritic cell DKK1 vaccine in view of possible future use as a strategy to prevent
      progression of asymptomatic plasma cell disorders, maintain disease control, and ultimately
      contribute to eradication of multiple myeloma, light and heavy chain amyloidosis,
      immunoglobulin deposition disease, and other malignant and non-malignant diseases related to
      transformed plasma cells.

      Primary Objective Confirm the safety of dendritic cell DKK1 vaccine given every two weeks for
      three doses in patients with monoclonal gammopathy, stable or smoldering myeloma.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. Assess response according to international response criteria (&gt; partial response, PR)
           and clinical benefit response (&gt;minor response, MR, according to adapted EBMT criteria)

        2. Determine time to progression

        3. Describe progression-free and overall survival

      Correlative Objectives

        1. Explore correlation between myeloma DKK1 and PDL-1 expression and response

        2. Determine cellular immune response

        3. Assess serologic anti-DKK1 antibody response

      Study design including dose escalation / cohorts Pilot study with 3 patient safety run-in,
      possible dose level -1 (DL-1) if dose limiting toxicity occurs in one or more patients at the
      target dose level, and, at the first dose level where no dose limiting toxicity occurs,
      extension by 12 patients.

      DLT will be defined as any vaccine related toxicity &gt; grade 3 that does not resolve to grade
      &lt; 2 within 7 days. If any DLT occurs at DL-1 enrollment will be stopped and an amendment will
      be discussed.

             cyclophosphamide at &gt; 50mg per day must have been discontinued at least 28 days prior
             to study entry. At least 180 days must have passed since high dose chemotherapy used
             in the context of autologous stem cell transplantation. Prior radiation must have been
             completed at least 14 days prior to enrollment.

          -  Subjects must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Concurrent use of any plasma cell directed therapy including corticosteroids (use of
             bisphosphonates is allowed).

          -  Subjects who have previously received an allogeneic stem cell transplant.

          -  Subjects with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing
             or active infection (including active HIV or hepatitis), symptomatic congestive heart
             failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Women with childbearing potential (last menstrual period within less than 24 months
             unless hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy has been performed since) as well as
             pregnant women are excluded from this study because DKK1 is expressed in placental
             tissue and a DKK1 immune response could harm the child. Breastfeeding women are
             excluded from this study because antibodies made in response to the dendritic cell
             DKK1 vaccine could enter milk and affect the health of the breastfed child.
