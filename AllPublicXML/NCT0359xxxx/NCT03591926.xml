    <textblock>
      SM04646-IPF-03 is a Phase 2a, multi-center, open-label study evaluating the safety and
      efficacy of a single inhaled, nebulized dose of SM04646 solution over a 12-week treatment
      regimen in subjects with mild to moderate IPF. A total of approximately 24 subjects will be
      enrolled in the study (approximately 12 subjects into the &quot;non-bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL]&quot;
      arm and approximately 12 subjects into the &quot;BAL&quot; arm). Subjects that currently do not
      require, have failed to tolerate, or have opted not to have treatment with pirfenidone or
      nintedanib will have the option of participation in the &quot;BAL&quot; arm or participation in the
      &quot;non-BAL&quot; arm. Subjects currently receiving treatment with pirfenidone or nintedanib must be
      on stable treatment for a minimum of 12 weeks prior to the Screening Visit. Subjects
      currently on treatment with pirfenidone or nintedanib may participate in the &quot;non-BAL&quot; arm
      only.

      Eligible subjects will participate in a treatment period of 12 weeks and a follow-up period
      of 12 weeks. The treatment dosing pattern will follow a 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off regimen,
      wherein subjects will dose 5 consecutive days of each 7 day &quot;on&quot; week.
