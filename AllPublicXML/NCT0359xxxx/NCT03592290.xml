      To monitor the changes in central and peripheral monitors/waveforms during gradual
      hypovolemia induced by lower body negative pressure in healthy volunteers.

    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this research is to identify the most robust site for monitoring
      hypovolemia as well as assess changes in peripheral waveforms monitored by the pulse oximeter
      collected from different sites (finger, ear, forehead, and nose), blood pressure, cerebral
      oximetry and peripheral venous pressure during gradual hypovolemia induced by lower body
      negative pressure (LBNP) in healthy volunteers.
