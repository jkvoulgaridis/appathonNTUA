  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease. The World Health
      Organization has reported that 170 million people are chronically infected with HCV globally.
      The highest prevalence of HCV infection worldwide exists in Egypt (15%); 90% of infection
      among Egyptian patients is due to genotype 4

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic HCV infection will be diagnosed based on positive testing for serum HCV RNA
             and anti-HCV Ab.

          -  Diagnosis of type 2 DM will depend on fasting level of serum glucose more than 126
             mg/dl and/or serum level of HbA1c more than 6.5 % on oral hypoglycemic therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic hepatitis due to causes other than HCV infection

          -  Coinfection with HBV infection
