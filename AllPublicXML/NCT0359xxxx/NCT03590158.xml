  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore the effects of eight weeks of time-restricted feeding (TRF) on body
      weight and composition, glycaemic control, 24-hour glucose profiles, glucoregulatory
      hormones, and cardiovascular risk in men at high risk of type 2 diabetes. The investigators
      hypothesise that 8 weeks of TRF will reduce body weight, improve body composition, improve
      glycaemic control and blood lipid profiles. The potential mechanism will be explored in terms
      of the changes in gene expression patterns and multi-omics level (e.g., adipose tissue
      transcriptome, blood proteome).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following a 2 week baseline monitoring phase (food intake by smartphone APP, activity by
      accelerometer, glucose by continuous glucose monitor), participants will attend the metabolic
      clinic for testing (visit 0). Body weight, body composition (by DEXA), and blood pressure
      will be assessed. Blood and adipose tissue samples will be collected over 24-hour period for
      assessment of glucose, insulin, glucoregulatory hormones, blood lipids and adipose tissue
      transcriptome. Glucose and insulin responses to a standardised breakfast will be measured.
      All food will be provided for 3 days prior to the metabolic visit. Following visit 0,
      participants will be instructed to eat only within a 10-hour time frame each day for 8 weeks.
      Participants may self-select the precise window that best suits their lifestyles, however any
      food and drink must be consumed at least 3 hours prior to their usual bedtime. 24-hour
      glucose profiles, activity and food intake will be measured again at week 6-8. At the end of
      the 8 weeks, participants will return for a follow-up metabolic visit, identical to that at
      visit 0, except foods are provided with the 10h time frame.
