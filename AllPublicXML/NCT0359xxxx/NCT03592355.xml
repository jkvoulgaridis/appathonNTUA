  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinicians slated for virtual visit rollout will be randomized (stratified by department) to
      either receive immediate virtual visit on-boarding (intervention arm) or delayed (3-months
      later) virtual visit on-boarding (control arm). The investigators plan to enroll no more than
      200 clinicians.

      Any clinician in a department selected by the Brigham Health Virtual Care team for access to
      virtual visits is eligible, unless s/he saw less than 20 patients monthly over the last 6
      months.

      The Brigham Health Virtual Care team will onboard all clinicians and provide virtual visit
      support as per their usual protocol. The primary study endpoint is third-available
      appointment, a well-adopted measure of access. Other secondary endpoints revolve around
      continuity, efficiency, utilization, safety, cost, and patient experience.

      If enrolled in the intervention arm, the following steps will occur:

        -  The clinician will receive the intervention arm follow-up email (&quot;Follow-up Email -
           Intervention&quot; in the Appendix).

        -  The Brigham Health Virtual Care team will work with the clinician toward immediate
           on-boarding (software training, hardware setup, technical support) as per their usual
           process.

        -  The clinician will schedule virtual visits as s/he and/or her/his department see fit.
           Virtual visits occur on an already-in-use Partners- and Brigham-approved video platform
           (attached).

      If enrolled in the control arm, the following steps will occur:

        -  The clinician will receive the control arm follow-up email (&quot;Follow-up Email - Control&quot;
           in the Appendix).

        -  Three months from the time of the follow-up email, the Brigham Health Virtual Care team
           will work with the clinician toward immediate on-boarding (software training, hardware
           setup, technical support) as per their usual process.

        -  The clinician will schedule virtual visits as s/he and/or her/his department see fit.
           Virtual visits occur on an already-in-use Partners- and Brigham-approved video platform
           (attached).

      The investigators plan to follow patients of both clinician cohorts for a total of 6-months.
      The investigators will perform retrospective review of patient electronic health records and
      patients will receive a redcap survey (attached), an evaluation mechanism already employed by
      the Virtual Care team.

      Again, aside from the initial randomization and retrospective data collection and analysis,
      all of the above would have occurred irrespective of this research protocol.
