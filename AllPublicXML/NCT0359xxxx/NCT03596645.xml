  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy of golimumab in inducing clinical remission
      as assessed by the Mayo score, in pediatric participants with moderately to severely active
      ulcerative colitis (UC). In addition, the safety profile of golimumab, in pediatric
      participants with moderately to severely active UC will be assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter study in pediatric participants aged 2 to 17 years with moderately to
      severely active UC, defined as a baseline Mayo score of 6 through 12, inclusive, with an
      endoscopy subscore of greater than or equal to (&gt;=)2. This 54-week study will consist of a
      6-week short-term phase and a 48-week long-term phase followed by a study extension (Week 54
      to end of study). At Week 58, participants who are eligible will continue receiving golimumab
      in the study extension. The primary hypothesis is that golimumab is an effective therapy in
      pediatric UC relative to historical placebo control as assessed by clinical remission based
      on Mayo score. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Clinical Remission at Week 6 as Assessed by the Mayo Score</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission is defined as a Mayo score less than or equal to (&lt;=) 2 points, with no individual sub score greater than (&gt;) 1. The Mayo score consists of 4 sub scores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy findings, and physician's global assessment), each of which is rated on a scale from 0 to 3, indicating normal to severe activity. The total score is calculated as the sum of the 4 sub scores and values range from 0 to 12. A score of 3 to 5 points indicates mildly active disease; a score of 6 to 10 indicates moderately active disease; and a score of 11 to 12 indicates severe disease.</description>

    <time_frame>At Week 54</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission is defined as a Mayo score &lt;=2 points, with no individual subscore &gt;1 (based on Mayo endoscopy subscore assigned by the local endoscopist). The Mayo score consists of 4 sub scores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy findings, and physician's global assessment), each of which is rated on a scale from 0 to 3, indicating normal to severe activity. The total score is calculated as the sum of the 4 sub scores and values range from 0 to 12. A score of 3 to 5 points indicates mildly active disease; a score of 6 to 10 indicates moderately active disease; and a score of 11 to 12 indicates severe disease.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Remission at Week 54 as Assessed by the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index Score (PUCAI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 54</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission is defined as a PUCAI score less than (&lt;)10. The PUCAI is a noninvasive measure of UC disease activity. It comprises 6 scales and total score ranges between 0 and 85 points. The scales are: abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, stool consistency, number of stools, nocturnal bowel movement, and activity level. The PUCAI total score is calculated as the sum of the 6 subscores. Higher scores indicate a more severe disease.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Response at Week 6 as Assessed by the Mayo Score</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response is defined as a decrease from baseline in the Mayo score of greater than or equal to (&gt;=)30 percent (%) and &gt;=3 points, with either a decrease from baseline in the rectal bleeding subscore of &gt;=1 or a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1. The Mayo score consists of 4 sub scores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy findings, and physician's global assessment), each of which is rated on a scale from 0 to 3, indicating normal to severe activity. The total score is calculated as the sum of the 4 sub scores and values range from 0 to 12. A score of 3 to 5 points indicates mildly active disease; a score of 6 to 10 indicates moderately active disease; and a score of 11 to 12 indicates severe disease.</description>
