  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several previous studies have shown that repeatedly ingesting carbohydrate supplements during
      exercise training sessions, over a period of days and weeks, can gradually increase
      carbohydrate oxidation and reduce gut discomfort during exercise. However, repeatedly
      ingesting large amounts of carbohydrate during training sessions can be burdensome and can
      cause gut distress. Thus, it would be advantageous if the same long-term benefits could be
      realized from consuming these carbohydrate supplements at rest instead of specifically during
      training sessions. Therefore, the goal of this study is to examine whether repeatedly
      ingesting a carbohydrate-rich beverage at rest over a 5-day period alters metabolism and gut
      symptoms while ingesting carbohydrate during exercise.
