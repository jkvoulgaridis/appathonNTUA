    <textblock>
      This Phase 2, multicenter, randomized study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      efficacy of ATI-501 for the treatment of AA, AU, or AT in adult subjects. Subjects will be
      required to have a clinical diagnosis of stable AA, AU, or AT. A total of approximately 80
      subjects will be randomized.

    <measure>The primary efficacy variable will be the mean change from Baseline in the Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score at end of study.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage hair growth will be calculated as the mean change from baseline compared to end-of-treatment. The SALT score is a global severity score that captures percentage hair loss. The SALT score is calculated by adding the percentage hair loss in the various areas (i.e. top, back, each side) of the scalp.</description>

          9. Sexually active male subjects whose partner is a WOCBP must agree to use a barrier
             method of contraception from the first dose of study medication to at least 30 days
             after the last dose of study medication.
