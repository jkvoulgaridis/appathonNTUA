  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Experimental study will determine the efficacy of nursing intervention named Maternal support
      to become first-time mothers based on the theory of Ramona Mercer. Sequential explanatory
      design will be used. It is a mixed design with approach quantitative and qualitative in order
      to obtain a better approach of the phenomen. The approach quantitative will be randomized
      controlled clinical trial. The qualitative analysis of the content will be done according to
      Bardin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Taking into account the scientific literature related to studies in first-time mothers with
      healthy newborns, it can be concluded that the limited success of interventions that have
      been made suggests that the main areas of becoming a mother have not been addressed, either
      as part of the content or process of the interventions. This study will be conducted in 24
      months. The sample size calculated will be 74 first-time mothers in total, which are
      allocated in two groups, intervention and control. Each group with 37 mothers.

    <measure>Scale name unabbreviated: &quot;La escala de Adopción del Rol Materno (ARM) de la Doctora María del Carmen Garrido Hidalgo y la Doctora Marleny Marchán Coronado&quot;.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Construct: This scale measures the process of maternal role adoption or &quot;becoming mother&quot; process; such process and this scale was created based in Ramona Mercer's theory. Conformation: It consists of 56 items distributed in 10 dimensions: 1)Interaction with the couple with respect to the baby, 2)baby acceptance, 3 Contact with the role of mother, 4)Stimulation of the baby, 5)Interaction with the family of origin regarding to the baby, 6 Baby care, 7)Maternal expressions of affection for the baby, 8)Well-being of the baby, 9)Concern and protection of the baby, 10)Knowledge and culture related to the baby. Scale Scores and Ranges: The instrument has a Likert scale (from 1 to 4). 1 = totally disagree and 4 = total agreement. The score are from 56 to 224. The classification score ranges are: low 56-180 points, medium 181-202 and high 203-224 points. The higher score across the scale indicate better adoption of the maternal role. The outcome of this scale is the sum of each linker-item.</description>

    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>_this scale measures Perceived Maternal Parenting Self-Efficacy.Conformation: This instrument was created by two psychologists from the University of Wolverhampton, Ireland. It has validity and reliability studies in Ireland and Brazil. It consists of 20 items distributed in 4 dimensions_ 1. Care tasks, 2. Behaviors raised, 3. Reading of behaviors or signals, 4. Situational beliefs. Scale Scores and Ranges_ the instrument has a Likert scale that goes from 1 to 4. There are 1 in totally disagree and 4 in total agreement. The instrument has a minimum score of 20 and a maximum score of 80. The higher the scores indicate greater (better) self-efficacy_</description>

    <measure>&quot;Perinatal Infant Care Social Support Scale&quot; (PICSS) by Dr. Patricia Leahy-Warren: Construct: measures social support and has been widely applied in first-time mothers.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Conformation: This instrument was created by a nurse from the University of College Cork, Ireland. It has validity and reliability tests in Ireland. Consisting of two subscales, the Structural Social Support subscale measures structural social support and the Functional Social Support subscale that measures functional social support. The latter is the one that is consistent with Ramona Mercer's nursing theory. The subscale Functional Social Support consists of 16 items distributed in 4 dimensions: 1) Informative Support, 2) Instrumental Support (Physical), 3) Emotional Support, 4)Valuation Support. Dimensions: Informative support (Minimum score of 7, maximum score of 28). Instrumental support (score range 7-28). Emotional support (score range 4- 16). Valuation support (score range from 4-16). The instrument has a Likert scale from 1 to 4; 1 for totally disagree and 4 for total agreement. Score range: 22-88. As higher the score, greater (better) Structural Social Support.</description>

    <measure>Assessing the experience of motherhood: The Being a Mother Scale (BaM-13) - Spanish adaptation (by Drs. Lucy Marcela Vesga Gualdrón and Maria Mercedes Durán de Villalobos)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>This instrument in its original English version was created by the psychologist Stephen Matthey and subsequently, based on this scale, with prior authorization, the nurses Dr. Vesga and Dr. Durán validated the Spanish scale. It is a self-report scale of 13 items. Cut point recommended is 9, which allows the classification of mothers according to the score obtained: greater than 9 is a risk of stress due to the maternal role and less than 9 is without risk of stress due to the maternal role.</description>

    <measure>Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) of Doctors J.L. Cox; JM Holden and R. Sagovsky (Spanish)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Construct: measures postpartum depression. This instrument was created by three doctors from the University of Keele, United Kingdom. It has been widely used in several countries and has validity and reliability tests also in Colombia. It is made up of items 10. The categories of the answers are given points of 0, 1, 2 and 3 according to the increase in the severity of the symptom. The points for questions 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 are noted in reverse order (for example, 3, 2, 1, 0). All points are added to give the total score. Score and range: Score range from 0 to 10. A score of 10+ shows the probability of a depression, but not its severity. Any number that is chosen other than &quot;0&quot; for question number 10, means that it is necessary to do additional evaluations immediately. The EPDS score is designed to assist clinical judgment, do not replace the complete clinical evaluation.</description>
