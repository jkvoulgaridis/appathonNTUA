  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Qigong exercise is beneficial for older adults with co-occurring chronic physical illness and
      depression in terms of psychological and physical outcomes. However, the effects on
      functional independence, sleep quality, and mobility of depressive older adults remain
      unclear. It is also important to replicate its benefits for subjective well-being and muscle
      strength. A randomized clinical trial was conducted among older adults who were aged 60 or
      above and with chronic medical conditions for one year. After random assignment, intervention
      group (n = 25) went through qigong exercise twice a week and for 12 weeks,whereas control
      group (n = 22) was involved in cognitive training activities with mobilization elements. The
      psychosocial and physical outcomes of the two groups were compared.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Personal Well-Being Index (PWI)</measure>
    <time_frame>the change from baseline to the completion of intervention (12 weeks later)</time_frame>
    <description>It is measured by the 8-item scale of Personal Well-Being Index (PWI). Each item was rated according to an 11-point scale ranging from '0' (extremely dissatisfied) to '10' (extremely satisfied). An overall score of PWI score was the sum of all items. The overall score ranges from 0 to 110, with higher score indicating higher subjective well-being.</description>

    <measure>Functional Independence Measure (FIM)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks after baseline, and 16 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>It is measured by the 18-item scale of Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Based on a 7-point scale for rating (1 = totally unable; 7 = totally independent), a total score of FIM ranges from 18 to 126 was generated. Higher total score indicates less disability.</description>

    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks after baseline, and 16 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>It is measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). It has 19 items measuring 7 components of sleep quality, and a total score is calculated as the sum of all the component scores. The total score ranges from 0 to 21, with lower score showing better sleep quality.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed up and Go Test (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks after baseline, and 16 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Timed up and Go Test (TUG) is used to measure mobility. During the test, participants were sitting on a chair, and then they were required to stand up, walk to a mark which is 3 meters away from the chair, go back to the chair from the mark, and sit down again. The time each participant spent to complete the above series of actions was recorded. Participants performed the test for three times, and their final scores were the average of the three. And lower score indicates better mobility.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Handgrip Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks after baseline, and 16 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>It is measured with a Jamar handheld dynamometer. Participants performed three trials of left hand and right hand grip strength, and the final outcome of each hand was calculated as the mean performance of the three trials. Higher score indicates stronger handgrip strength.</description>
