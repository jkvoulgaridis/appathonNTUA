      This study will evaluate if AGI-134 given alone is safe and tolerate in treating patients
      with unresectable/metastatic solid tumours.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unresectable solid tumour is a tumour that cannot be removed completely through surgery,
      radiation therapy, drug treatment or any combination of them.

      AGI-134 (alpha-Gal) is a synthetic molecule that by intratumoural injection trigger a
      systemic anti-tumour response.

      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of AGI-134 given alone in
      treating patients with unresectable metastatic solid tumours.

      This study is divided to 2 parts:

      Part 1 will assess on a small group of subjects the safety and tolerability of increasing
      doses of AGI-134 injected intra-tumourally (IT) and will determine the maximum AGI-134 dose
      that can be tolerated.

      Part 2 will assess the safety, tolerability and clinical effect of the dose selected in part
      1 in a group of subjects who will receive AGI-134 alone injected intra-tumourally.

Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study treatment, is also an AE.
