  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Local intra-articular injection of anesthetics (LIA) is increasingly used during knee
      arthroscopy for pain relief. The LIA can only be performed at the end of surgery as the knee
      joint is continuously flushed during the arthroscopy. As a consequence, an optimal analgesic
      effect is only obtained one hour after surgery and opiates are typically used as pain relief
      in the immediate postoperative period. Since these opiates have a number of side effects such
      as nausea, vomiting and drowsiness, other analgetic methods are desirable.

      Intravenous administration of lidocaine, a safe, inexpensive analgesic, is already used in
      major (abdominal) surgeries and might also be a promising method for pain relief in the first
      hour after knee arthroscopy, in anticipation of the onset of the analgesic effect of the LIA.

      The aim of this study is to verify if systemic administration of lidocaine has a beneficial
      effect on the pain immediately after knee arthroscopy. In addition, the effect of systemic
      lidocaine administration on postoperative nausea, vomiting and general patient comfort will
      be evaluated.

      2X30 patients which are planned for elective knee arthroscopy are randomised: Lidocaine-group
      and Placebo-group.

      All patients receive standardised multimodal intravenous analgesia. After standardised
      induction of anesthesia, patient positioning and administration of basic analgetics
      paracetamol &amp; diclofenac, the patient is administered either linisol 2% (1.5 mg/kg) or
      placebo NaCl 0.9% (0.075 ml/kg = equivalent volume). At the end of the procedure, linisol or
      placebo is readministered at the same dose. The surgeon and anesthesiologist are blinded for
      patient allocation.

      Postoperative analgesic consumption, nausea and vomiting (PONV), general comfort and pain
      scores are recorded. Visual Analogue scores (VAS) for knee pain are assessed before surgery,
      1-15 minutes after awakening, at the moment of discharge from the post-anesthesia care unit
      (PACU) and at hospital discharge.
