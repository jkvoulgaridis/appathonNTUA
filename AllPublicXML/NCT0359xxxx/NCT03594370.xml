      Here the investigators proposed this study to collect cases of different etiologies of ocular
      surface diseases. With at least one of these four non-invasive examination modalities, the
      investigators aim to analyze and compare the detecting results. The investigators especially
      focus on the possibility of using OCT to predict the condition of limbal epithelial stem
      cells, aiming to use this patient-friendly tool to detect the patient's limbal conditions.

      In vivo confocal microscopy, anterior segment optical coherence tomography, keratograph and
      impression cytology are noninvasive, rapid and easily repeatable technique to investigate
      ocular surface disorders. In vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) enables morphological and
      quantitative analysis of ocular surface microstructure. Optical coherence tomography (OCT)
      allows for imaging of the morphology of biological tissue with micrometer scale resolution at
      imaging depths of 1 to 2mm below the tissue surface. [1,2] Anterior segment OCT (ASOCT) has
      been developed to evaluate corneal diseases[3-8] in different layers. Keratography includes
      noninvasive meibography and tear interferometry. The former demonstrates the morphology of
      meibomian glands whereas the later observes quality and quantity of the lipid layer of the
      tear film. Impression cytology shows the morphology of the corneal and conjunctival
      epithelial cells, their staining behavior, and nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio could be observed in
      detail.

      Here the investigators proposed this clinical trial to collect cases of different etiologies
      of ocular surface diseases. With at least one of these four non-invasive examination
      modalities, the investigators aim to analyze and compare the detecting results. The
      investigators especially focus on the possibility of using ASOCT to predict the condition of
      limbal epithelial stem cells, aiming to use this patient-friendly tool to detect the
      patient's limbal conditions.

      Impression cytology(IC) is a technique which permits the retrieval of the outermost layer of
      ocular surface cells via the use of various types of filters. It is a minimally invasive
      method of evaluating human conjunctival epithelial cell morphology. IC may also be utilized
      in the diagnosis of other ocular diseases, such as ocular surface squamous neoplasia, ocular
      surface infections, keratoconus and thyroid orbitopathy. IC improves our understanding of the
      pathophysiology of ocular surface disease, and provide biomarkers to be used as outcome
      measures in clinical trials.
