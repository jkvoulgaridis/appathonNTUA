  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a frequent complication of sickle cell disease (SCD), with varying levels of
      central nervous system (CNS) involvement. The summation of several ischemic events, even when
      silent, can lead to devastating consequences, from reduced academic performance to physical
      dependence. Despite knowledge that brain flow velocities evaluated by Doppler ultrasound
      identify pediatric SCD patients at a greater stroke risk (Adams et al, NEJM 1998; 339:5-11),
      this method is not able to predict the occurrence of strokes in adults. There is also no
      consensus on the management of adult patients in relation to primary and secondary
      prevention. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of the administration of
      Simvastatin on CNS structural and functional vascular changes in 30 adult patients with SCD
      (SS and Sβ), above 35 years of age, observed through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The
      data on the effect of simvastatin on disease manifestations is quite scarce, however this
      drug reportedly significantly reduces plasma concentrations of adhesion molecules and
      inflammatory markers, such as E-selectin, VEGF, CRP and IL-6 (Hoppe et al, BJH 2011;
      153:655-663; Hoppe et al, BJH 2017;177:620-629). Thus, in addition to the search for early
      diagnostic markers and risk stratification for primary or recurrent stroke, we will also
      compare CNS images before and 12 months after the administration of Simvastatin. The drug
      alter stroke recurrence rates in the general adult population, but their effects on vascular
      changes in patients with SCD have not yet been adequately elucidated. This is particularly
      important because these are low cost drugs which present good tolerability, and could be part
      of the therapeutic arsenal of SCD, even in low income settings. Concomitantly with the CNS
      evaluation, this study also intends to investigate molecular pathways that may be affected by
      the drugs. We will evaluate microvesicle release patterns, as well as the content of
      microRNAs possibly involved in the occurrence of stroke, in addition to metabolomic studies
      and plasma cytokine profile.
