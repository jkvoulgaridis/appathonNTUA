  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to examine whether messages conveying the harms and
      addictiveness of waterpipe (i.e., hookah) tobacco delivered by mobile phone multimedia
      messaging (MMS) are effective for promoting hookah tobacco cessation among young adults ages
      18 to 30 years.

      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of messages communicating the risks (i.e.,
      health harms, addictiveness) of hookah tobacco delivered via mobile multimedia messaging for
      promoting hookah tobacco cessation. The study will also compare two messaging approaches, a
      standard untailored approach where all participants receive the same message content, and a
      tailored messaging approach where message content is personalized to baseline measures of
      hookah tobacco use behavior and beliefs and interactively to exchanges that occur via mobile
      messaging sent and received during the exposure period. The study includes young adults ages
      18 to 30 who are current hookah tobacco smokers. Eligible participants are young adults ages
      18 to 30 years who have smoked hookah tobacco at least once in the past month, smoke hookah
      tobacco on at least a monthly basis, and have access to the internet and a personal mobile
      phone to complete study procedures. Study participants will complete a baseline survey
      online, and all participants will receive standard information about the risks of hookah
      tobacco. Then participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: control group,
      untailored message group, tailored message group. Participants in the untailored and tailored
      message group will receive messages sent to their mobile phones communicating the risks of
      hookah tobacco for a 6 week period. All participants will complete follow-up surveys online 6
      weeks after baseline, 3 months later, and 6 months later.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomized trial with 3 groups: 1) Control group that receives no study messages; 2) Untailored message group that receives general messages about the risks of hookah tobacco; 3) Tailored message group that receives messages about the risks of hookah tobacco that are personalized to their hookah tobacco use behavior and beliefs.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Harm</measure>
    <time_frame>6-months</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived harm of hookah tobacco is measured using 2 valid self-report questionnaire items (Mays, Tercyak, &amp; Lipkus 2016). The items assess perceptions of how harmful hookah tobacco use is (score range 1 much less harmful than cigarettes to 5 much more harmful than cigarettes) and how likely harms are to occur (response range 1 no chance to 7 certain to happen). Greater perceived harm and perceived likelihood of harm are considered better outcomes. The items are administered immediately post intervention, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Addictiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>6-months</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived addictiveness of hookah tobacco is measured using 2 valid self-report questionnaire items (Mays, Tercyak, &amp; Lipkus 2016). The items assess perceptions of how addictive hookah tobacco smoking is (1 = much less addictive than cigarettes, 5 = much more addictive than cigarettes) and how likely one is to become addicted to hookah tobacco (1 = no chance, 7 = certain to happen). Greater perceived addictiveness and perceived likelihood of addictiveness are considered better outcomes. The items are administered immediately post-intervention, 3-month follow-up, and 6 month follow-up</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Worry about Harm</measure>
    <time_frame>6-months</time_frame>
    <description>Worry about the harms of hookah tobacco is measured using a single valid self-report questionnaire item (Mays, Tercyak, &amp; Lipkus 2016). The item assesses how much participants worry about the risks of hookah tobacco (1 = Not at all, 7 = Very much). Greater worry about harm is considered a better outcome. The item is administered immediately post-intervention, 3-month follow-up, and 6 month follow-up</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Worry about Addictiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Worry about the addictiveness of hookah tobacco is measured using a single valid self-report questionnaire item (Mays, Tercyak, &amp; Lipkus 2016). The item assesses how much participants worry about becoming addicted to hookah tobacco (1 = Not at all, 7 = very much). Greater perceived addictiveness is considered a better outcome. The item is administered immediately post-intervention, 3 month follow-up, and 6 month-follow-up</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Motivation to Quit</measure>
    <time_frame>6-months</time_frame>
    <description>Motivation to quit is measured using a single valid self-report questionnaire item (Mays, Tercyak, &amp; Lipkus 2016). The item assesses how much participants want to quit smoking hookah tobacco right now (1 = Not at all, 7 = Very). Greater motivation to quit is considered a better outcome. The item is administered immediately post-intervention, 3 month follow-up, and 6 month follow-up</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hookah Tobacco Use Frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Hookah tobacco use frequency is measured using a single self-report questionnaire item (Mays, Tercyak, &amp; Lipkus 2016) assessing how often participants have smoked hookah tobacco in the past 30 days. The item measures the number of days in the past month participants have smoked hookah tobacco. Less frequent hookah tobacco use is considered a better outcome. The item is administered immediately post-intervention, 3 month follow-up, and 6 month follow-up</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hookah Tobacco Cessation</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Hookah tobacco cessation is measured using a single valid self-report questionnaire item adapted from the national Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) survey assessing if participants have stopped smoking hookah tobacco completely. The item asks if participants have completely stopped smoking hookah tobacco based on a yes/no response. Quitting hookah tobacco use (i.e., responses of &quot;yes&quot;) is considered a better outcome. The item is administered immediately post intervention, 3 month follow-up, and 6 month follow-up</description>
