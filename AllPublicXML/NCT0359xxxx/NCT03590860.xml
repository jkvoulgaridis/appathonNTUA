    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety of the study drug known as LY3322207.
      Participants must be healthy or must have hypertension (high blood pressure). Participants
      with hypertension may already be taking a common drug to reduce blood pressure called an
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).
