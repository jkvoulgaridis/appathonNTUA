  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eventration corresponds to the dehiscence of the abdominal wall, with passage of peritoneum
      and / or intra-abdominal viscera, through an acquired orifice of the abdominal wall. It is
      secondary to an old incision and occurs in 10 to 20% of cases after a laparotomy. At present,
      if there is no debate on the type of prosthesis to implant in case of clean surgery: it is a
      synthetic prosthesis. But in the case of contaminated surgery (modified Ventral Hernia
      Working Group grade 3), there is no consensus.

      Since the 1990s, biological prostheses have been recommended, but they represent significant
      expenses for health facilities. They are very numerous, and their prices vary between 3 000 €
      and 12 000 €. The choice is therefore difficult for the surgeon.

      In 2016 the Strasbourg University Hospital general surgery team made the choice to use
      biosynthetic prostheses. This attitude does not seem consensual and is not based on any
      recommendations at present, either in France or internationally. The homogenization of
      practices requires the availability of clinical and medico-economic data, particularly in
      view of the price differences that exist between different types of prostheses.

      The main objective of this study will be to compare the use of biosynthetic prostheses with
      biological prostheses in the treatment of curative surgical treatment of mVHWG grade 3
      incisional hernias in terms of cost and serious complications at 6 months.

      The secondary objective of the study will be to estimate the number of early recurrences at 6
      months avoided, thanks to the use of biosynthetic prostheses compared to biological
      prostheses.
