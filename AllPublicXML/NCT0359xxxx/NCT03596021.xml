  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In clinics, many scales have been developed to examine daily living activities and function
      in children with idiopatic toe walking. &quot;The Idiopatic Toe Walking (ITW)&quot; was developed in
      2010 by Cylie M.Williams, contains 21 items which measure medical, birth &amp; developmental
      history and assessment. The aim of the investigator's study was to investigate translating
      the ITW scale and using it in clinics reliably and valiably with a Turkish version of ITW in
      children with idiopatic toe walking.

      Demographic information was recorded which are included gender, age, using orthosis,
      botox/surgical history, use and duration of walkers/child-runner (WCR). The scale was
      translated into Turkish with the following translation steps. Thirty four children with
      idiopatic toe walking were included in the study. Internal structure consistency and
      test-retest reliability were measured for reliability analyses. For each item on the scale,
      Cronbach's alpha coefficient and item-total score correlations were calculated. The scale was
      administered for test-retest reliability at baseline and one week later by one rater.
      Test-retest reliability was assessed by Pearson's correlation test with observational gait
      analysis and 'co-validity' was investigated, statistically.
