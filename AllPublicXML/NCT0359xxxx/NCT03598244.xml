      This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effect of volitinib in treating
      participants with primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors that have come or does not
      respond to treatment. Volitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommend a phase II dose of volitinib
      (savolitinib) administered orally daily in children with refractory, progressive or recurrent
      primary CNS tumors.

      II. To define and describe the toxicities of savolitinib in children with refractory,
      progressive or recurrent primary CNS tumors.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of savolitinib in children with refractory,
      progressive or recurrent primary CNS tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of savolitinib within the confines of a
      phase I study.

      II. To perform a genomic analysis within the confines of a phase I study to investigate
      correlation between response to treatment (as measured by objective response or progression
      free survival [PFS]) and the presence of specific genomic alterations (e.g. MET
      amplification, chromosome 7q aneuploidy, MET mutation, or HGF amplification) and/or specific
      subgroups of disease.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Participants receive volitinib orally (PO) once daily (QD). Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for up to 39 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days, then
      periodically for up to 2 years.
