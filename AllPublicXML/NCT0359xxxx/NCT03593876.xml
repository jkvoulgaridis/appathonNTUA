  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One-third to one-half of acute strokes result in newly acquired cognitive impairments.
      Approximately 30 to 40% of people in the acute phase of stroke also sustain communication
      impairments. Stroke-related cognitive impairments are associated with significant functional
      disability, as indicated by the inability to regain independence in daily activities. The
      overall aim of this study is to examine the feasibility of an adapted form of strategy
      training for people with communication impairments who are admitted to inpatient
      rehabilitation. These analyses will address a critical gap in current rehabilitation
      research, namely the exclusion of people with communication impairments in acute stroke
      rehabilitation clinical trials, and provide pilot data to inform the design of future
      inclusive clinical trials seeking to reduce disability after stroke.

      This pilot study will use a descriptive case series design with repeated measures to assess
      the feasibility of an adapted form of strategy training for people with communication
      impairments after acute stroke. The investigators will recruit people with aphasia due to
      stroke admitted to the inpatient rehabilitation units and administer the adapted form of
      strategy training one session per day 5 days per week for 10-15 sessions. The investigators
      will assess the feasibility of the intervention based on feedback from participants and
      therapists. These data will serve as pilot data to inform the design of a future clinical
      trials for people with cognitive impairments after stroke, including people with
      communication impairments. These efforts will allow the investigators to test new models to
      support optimal interventions for individuals with stroke-related cognitive impairments,
      including people with communication impairments who are among those most vulnerable for
      long-term disability.

The FIM assesses 18 tasks in 6 functional domains (self-care, sphincter control, transfers, locomotion, communication and social cognition) using a scale of 1 (dependent) to 7 (independent).
