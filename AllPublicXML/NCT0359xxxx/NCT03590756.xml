      This study aims to investigate the effects on 16 weeks of mango intake on skin health in
      postmenopausal women. Half of the participants will receive 85g portions of mangoes while the
      other half receive 250g portions of mangos. Participants will be instructed to consume the
      specific portion 4 times a week, for a total duration of 16 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mangoes are rich in carotenoids, flavonoids, vitamins and other active phytochemicals such as
      resistant starches. Although a role of mangoes in skin health has long been advocated in
      traditional medicine, little scientific research has been conducted.

      We hypothesize that 85g (0.5 cups) of mango intake for 16 weeks will have minimal impact on
      skin health, while 250g (1.5 cups) of mango intake will produce significant benefits.
