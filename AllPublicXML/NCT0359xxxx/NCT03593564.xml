  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will test the effect of an online asynchronous psychoeducational
      intervention to improve relationship quality and prevent verbal-type elder mistreatment in
      caregiving dyads. The investigators will use a pre-post test design to test the feasibility
      and acceptability of this video-based intervention, and to determine the likelihood that
      participation in this program may improve caregiver relationship quality.

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators will evaluate the KINDER program using pre- and post-test analysis. Eligible and consented subjects enrolled on a rolling basis. After enrollment, all caregivers will complete a baseline assessment. Caregivers will receive the intervention (8 lessons, delivered once per week) and will be asked to complete a reassessment after 10 weeks. Two months later, participants will be asked to complete a second reassessment.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>This scale will measure frequency of verbal mistreatment using a measure based on the Conflict Tactics Scale (Straus et al., 1996), with additional questions from other items (Acierno et al., 2010; Beach et al., 2005; Conrad et al., 2011; Deliema et al., 2012)</description>

    <time_frame>This measure will be asked immediately before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and 2 months after the intervention is complete. The question asks participants about events in the previous 2 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are asked how much they agree with positive statements about their relationship with the care receiver on a 0 to 3 scale. This item comes from Sebern &amp; Whitlatch (2007)</description>

    <measure>Change in caregiver competence (Caregiving Competence Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>This measure will be asked immediately before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and 3 months after the intervention is complete. The question asks participants about events in the previous 3 months.</time_frame>

    <description>The intervention will be provided with a 8-part psychoeducational intervention delivered online on a weekly basis. Online modules will be comprised of a short (approximately 3 minute) videos followed by more specific text-based information and links to additional resources. At the end of the module, participants will complete a short quiz, followed by a reflection exercise to reinforce learning. Each model, participants will be asked to select a goal to complete a pleasurable activity and receive an option to set a text or email reminder to do so.</description>

    <description>KINDER is an online course for people assisting an older adult with dementia. It is intended to improve the quality of caregiver's relationship with the care recipient and reduce the chance of risky relationship behavior (e.g., yelling). Courses will cover topics including understanding cognitive impairments, navigating evolving roles, and dealing with frustration. During this course, participants will learn skills to deal with difficult situations caregivers frequently encounter in ways that support a healthy caregiving relationship. Videos will be story-based and represent different types of caregiving relationships and challenges encountered.</description>
