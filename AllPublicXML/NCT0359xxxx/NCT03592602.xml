  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the impact of arm abduction and adduction on the
      intravascular electrocardiograph during PICC placement and to find out how arm position
      influences the catheter tip location by taking postprocedural chest X-ray radiographs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PICC has been widely applied for therapeutic and nutritional use. In the routine procedure of
      PICC placement, for better exposure of the punctured vein and a wider aseptic area, the PICC
      set is investigated with the patient's arm abducted in a supine position. While in actual use
      of the PICC line, patients commonly prefer a more comfortable position with arm adducted.
      Considering the incorporation of the arm position when the catheter is placed and being used,
      the effectiveness and safety of the PICC line with the punctured arm adducted are of
      practical importance.

      This study aims to evaluate the impact of arm abduction and adduction on the intravascular
      electrocardiograph (ECG) during ECG-guided PICC placement and to explore how arm movement
      (from abduction to adduction) makes an influence on the catheter tip position.

      This study is expected to enroll 150 participants. All participants would undergo the
      procedure of ECG-guided PICC placement. ECG data will be recorded before the procedure (basal
      ECG) and during the procedure with the punctured arm abducted and adducted. After the
      procedure, participants will take a post chest X-ray confirmation with arms adducted and
      abducted in a supine position. The catheter tip position and influences of arm movements will
      be calculated by the distances from the catheter tip to the carina on radiographs.

    <description>All PICC lines will be placed under the guidance of intravascular ECG. Before the PICC placement procedure, basal ECG will be examed. During the procedure, intravascular ECG data will be collected with the punctured arm adduction and abduction while the catheter advances to the cavoatrial junction. After the procedure, chest X-ray radiographs will be taken with arms 90° abducted and adducted (i.e., 0°abducted) in a supine position.</description>
