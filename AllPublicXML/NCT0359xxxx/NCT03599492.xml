  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of portal hypertension on gastrointestinal motility, and how reversal or
      improvement in portal hypertension may alter gastrointestinal motility, remains unclear and
      further research is needed. Additionally, patients with cirrhosis have altered gut
      microflora, particularly rich in lactobacilli, including enterococci and bifidobacteria.
      Transjugular Intraheptic Portosystemic Shunting (TIPS) is a procedure performed by
      interventional radiologists, in which a connection is made between the portal and venous
      circulations, allowing high pressure portal blood to more easily enter the systemic
      circulation and bypass the liver; thus effectively decreased portal pressure.
