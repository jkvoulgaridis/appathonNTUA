  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, the objective is to compare single- and double-injection ultrasound-guided
      costoclavicular blocks. The rationale behind this idea is that a second local anesthetic
      injection, inside the costoclavicular space, may compensate for the dynamic cord dispersion
      seen with the single-injection technique. Thus the research hypothesis is that, compared to
      its single-injection counterpart, a double injection costoclavicular block will result in a
      shorter onset time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The costoclavicular block (CCB) constitutes a relatively novel technique for infraclavicular
      brachial plexus blockade, whereby local anesthetics (LAs) are injected inside the
      costoclavicular space. In this location, the 3 cords of the brachial plexus are very tightly
      clustered together; this topography would theoretically result in a very swift brachial
      plexus block Unfortunately, in two recent trials comparing CCB and conventional
      infraclavicular brachial plexus block, the authors were unable to detect differences in
      success rate, onset times and LA requirement between the 2 methods. It could be speculated
      that the explanation resides in dynamic cord dispersion. With CCB, the initial needle target
      lies in the middle of the 3 cords of the brachial plexus. However, with LA injection, the
      cords can quickly migrate away from each other. Thus, the anatomical benefits conveyed by the
      initial compact topography may be lost.
