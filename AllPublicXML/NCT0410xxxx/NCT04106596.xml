  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) are characterized by subacute onset of memory deficits, altered
      mental status or psychiatric symptoms, frequently associated with seizures, inflammatory
      cerebrospinal fluid and in cases with prominent limbic involvement, typical magnetic
      resonance imaging. Several autoantibodies (Ab) may be detected in AE, although its detection
      is not mandatory to establish a diagnosis. These Ab mainly recognize different synaptic and
      cell-surface proteins in the central nervous system, and are thought to be pathogenic as they
      alter the normal location or function of its antigens.

      The primary trigger of the immune response is unknown for most of AE. In addition to acquired
      susceptibility, genetic predisposition may also be important in the pathogenesis of AE. Human
      leukocyte antigen (HLA) is the genetic factor most frequently associated with autoimmune
      diseases, due to its genetic complexity and key role in the adaptive immune response. The aim
      of the study is to describe HLA profile in three groups of autoimmune encephalitis and
      related disorders: anti-LGI1, anti-CASPR2 and anti-GAD neurological diseases.

    <description>This is a non-interventional study involving biological samples (DNA). Samples are already stored in biobank repositories and collected as part of &quot;good clinical practice&quot; in the diagnostic process of patients with suspected autoimmune encephalitis, meaning that the standard diagnostic and therapeutic approaches will not be altered in the selected study population. Patients have already gave explicit written consent for biological specimens sampling and storage at the &quot;Centre de Ressources Biologiques des Hospices Civils de Lyon&quot; (CRB-HCL)/NeuroBioTec (including tissue, cells or biological fluids) and genetic analysis for research purposes (e.g. involving genes related to the disease for which the patient was followed). Additionally, patients will be informed about the present study.</description>
