      Transition from paediatric to adult health care is crucial for preventing deterioration of
      chronic diseases. At present, transitional care (TC) is not established for patients with the
      Hirschsprung disease (H) and Anorectal Malformations (ARM). To set up a program for TC and to
      treat persisting symptoms in adults, data on outcome in adult patients are needed. At present
      such data are very limited. Therefore, we want to investigate clinical and PROM in H and ARM
      adolescents and adults. A cross sectional study in all H and ARM patients operated in Norway
      from 1970-2000 and in all adolescents operated at Oslo University Hospital from 2002-2006
      will examine somatic, psychosocial and mental health, and quality of life (QoL). In children
      operated for H and ARM a large body of evidence shows that bowel problems, reduced QoL and
      impaired psychosocial and mental health are common. There are papers on sexual and urological
      impairment in these patients, but large studies on the topic is missing. It is a general
      assumption among paediatric surgeons that both somatic and mental health problems related to
      H and ARM improve during adolescence and adult life. Therefore, no standardized guidelines
      for TC in these patients have been established. Interestingly, very few studies have actually
      examined H and ARM patients beyond adolescence. Reports from patient organizations showing
      significant long-term sequels and inadequate understanding of the unique problems of H and
      ARM patients among health professionals treating adults. Hypothesis:H and ARM adults and
      adolescents have bowel, urinary and sexual difficulties and reduced QoL, psychosocial and
      mental health. H and ARM adults receive insufficient treatment of their chronic congenital
      disease. H and ARM patients with syndromes have particularly bad functional outcome. Anal
      dilatations and repeated rectal enemas have a negative impact on adolescent psychosocial and
      mental health. Main aim: Acquire knowledge about long-term bowel, urinary and sexual
      function, QoL and psychosocial and mental health in adult and adolescent H and ARM patients.
      Results: from this large study of H and ARM patients will have significant influence on
      treatment and follow-up, both nationally and internationally. Since very few countries except
      the Nordic countries have the possibility to follow patients with congenital malformations
      into adulthood, it is important that studies like this are done.
