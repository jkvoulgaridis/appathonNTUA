      Why is the research needed?

        -  This study reflects the complexity of the process that patients with diabetes are
           experiencing when staying at home away from the supervision of health professionals. In
           this context, there is a gap in the literature on home care of diabetes.

        -  The barriers, facilitators and the other perceptions that affect each diabetic's
           compliance with the disease-related recommendation are different. Nurses need to be
           aware of this.

        -  For this reason, according to the Health Belief Model, an original study was conducted
           to evaluate the nursing intervention program's results on patient care and
           cost-effectiveness in a home for supporting self-management of diabetic patients.

      Hypotheses of the Study Patients with diabetes undergoing home-based nursing interventions in
      line with the Health Belief Model.

      H1: have higher mean scores for the Health Belief Model Scale than the control group.

      H2: have higher mean scores for the Self-Efficacy Scale than the control group. H3: have
      lower HbA1c levels than the control group. H4: have lower blood glucose levels (BGL) than the
      control group. H5: have lower blood pressure levels than the control group. H6: have lower
      BMI levels than the control group. H7: have fewer hospital admissions due to an acute or
      chronic complication than the control group.

      H8: have a lower complication-related cost rate than the control group.

      Type of the study The study was conducted as an intervention (randomized controlled,
      single-blind) one.

      Location and Time of the Study The study was carried out between January 2015 and March 2017
      in three districts of İzmir, a province in the western part of Turkey.

      The study population and sample While the patients with diabetes living in districts
      comprised the study population, the sample was selected from patients with type II diabetes
      registered to Family Health Centers.

      According to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) recommended for
      randomized controlled studies, a randomization flow chart was established, and 2460 people
      with diabetes were assessed for compliance with diabetes. From the 1081 people with diabetes
      who met the inclusion criteria, the intervention, and control groups each to include 65
      individuals were constructed using the &quot;Research Randomizer&quot; computer program. The study was
      completed with 81 people with diabetes (42 in the intervention group and 39 in the control
      group). Post hoc power analysis was performed using the G-Power Data Analysis program and the
      power of the study was determined as 100% at the 95% confidence interval and p = .05
      significance level.

      The participants were not told to which group they were assigned. Thus, the study was
      conducted as a single-blind study.

      Training Booklet and Implementation Steps A booklet including information on nursing
      interventions for diabetes was prepared. The training booklet was based on the current
      literature and the results of the qualitative study conducted on the issue in the first step
      of the Ph.D. thesis. The booklet was revised in line with the opinions obtained from 5
      professors who were experts in the field. The International Standard Book Number
      (978-975-441-462-2 ISBN) for the booklet was obtained by the Presidency of Dokuz Eylül
      University and published in the Dokuz Eylül University Press.

      During the first home visit, the participants in the intervention group were applied the data
      collection tools, and then nursing interventions in accordance with the subscales of the
      Health Belief Model by taking into account the individual differences of the participants.
      The nursing interventions were performed within the scope of the basic dimensions of diabetes
      management such as nutrition, exercise, medication management, oral care, and foot care. In
      addition, the importance of annual monitoring of HBA1c, blood lipid, albumin/creatinine
      levels, fundus examination, blood pressure monitoring, sleep hygiene, avoidance of smoking
      and alcohol was also explained. Home visits were paid 3 times at 3-month intervals. After the
      home visits started, reminder messages supporting the home visit process were sent at
      two-week intervals.

      The participants in the control group were contacted 3 times at 3-month intervals through
      telephone calls and were applied the data collection tools. At the end of the study, the
      participants in the control group were given health training at the Dokuz Eylül University
      Faculty of Nursing and the training booklet was distributed to them.

      Analysis of the Data The study data were analyzed using numbers, percentages, the chi-square
      test, the test for the Signiﬁcance of the Difference Between Two Means, the Repeated Measures
      Multivariate Analysis of Variance, Bonferroni-adjusted t-test independent groups and multiple
      regression analysis in the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) (23.0) program.

    <measure>Health Belief Model Scale in Patients with Diabetes</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Belief Model Scale was developed in China, the validity and reliability study of the Turkish version of the scale was conducted in 2007 and the Cronbach's alpha value was 0.72 and 0.90 respectively. The subscales of the scale were as follows: perceived Susceptibility (5 items), Perceived Severity (3 items), Perceived Benefits (7 items), Perceived Barriers (11 items) and Recommended health-related activities (10 items).
The items of the scale are evaluated in a 5-point Likert scale, from 1 (I strongly disagree) to 5 (I strongly agree). Every subscale mean isdetermined by dividing the total points of all thesubscale items by the total number of items. The total scale score mean is calculated by dividing the totalpoints of all the items by the total number of items. A positive health belief of 4 points and above; a score below 4 is interpreted as a negative health belief.</description>

    <time_frame>6 month</time_frame>
    <description>Diabetes Management Self-Efficacy Scale was developed in 1999, the validity and reliability study of the Turkish version of the scale was conducted in 2001.

The tool has 20 items. The items are in a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (absolutely no) to 5 (absolutely yes).The lowest possible score from the scale is 20, the highest is 100.</description>
