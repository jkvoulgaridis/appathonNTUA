  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Orthodontic build-ups are made by composite/resin material bonded to the palatal or occlusal
      surfaces of teeth (usually molars or incisors). Their primary purpose is to prevent heavy
      contact of the upper teeth with lower fixed appliances in patients with overbite reduction to
      avoid brackets detachment. These appliances disarticulate the posterior teeth, deprogram the
      masticatory muscles and allow for eruption, extrusion, and uprighting of the posterior teeth.
      Build-ups are usually placed in the first months of the fixed orthodontic treatment and
      contribute to increasing the perception of pain. In the orthodontic daily practice, the pain
      is the most frequent symptom during treatment and is the one that most frightens/worries the
      patients. Literature shows that fear of pain is one of the primary reasons that patients fail
      to seek orthodontic care. Pain has a negative effect on patients' compliance, oral hygiene,
      and missed appointments. Its effects on patients' daily lives is a major reason for
      discontinuance of orthodontic treatment.

      In the literature the prevention of pain and management of orthodontic builds-ups is a poorly
      analyzed topic, despite being a daily problem in orthodontic clinical practice. So, the aim
      of the present study is to investigate and analyze the perception of pain and function
      impairment with different type of build-ups (anterior or posterior) to identify an efficient
      clinical management protocol and an effective pain and discomfort prevention strategy.

    <description>Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) were used to evaluate the level of pain. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is most commonly a straight 100-mm line, without demarcation, that has the words &quot;no pain&quot; at the left-most end and &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot; (or something similar) at the right-most end. Patients are instructed to place a mark on the line indicating the amount of pain that they feel at the time of the evaluation. The distance of this mark from the left end is then measured, and this number is used as a numeric representation of the severity of the patient's pain.</description>

    <measure>Oral Health Impact Profile after builds-up placement</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Instrument of data collection was OHIP-14 questionnaire, which comprises of 14 questions with two questions each under seven domains. The domains include; functional limitation, physical pain, psychological discomfort, physical disability, psychological disability, social disability and handicap. Responses to the questions are based on a Likert scale which ranged from 0- &quot;never&quot; to 4- &quot;very often&quot;. Variables also included in the questionnaire were: demographic variables and satisfaction ratings of teeth appearance and self- rating of tooth condition. The satisfaction ratings of tooth appearance assessed how satisfied the participants were with the appearance of their teeth with a response of &quot;satisfied or dissatisfied&quot;. The self- rating of tooth condition assessed oral condition as being &quot;good or poor&quot;. The satisfaction ratings and self-ratings of oral health were variables used to assess the construct validity of OHIP-14 in the respondents</description>
