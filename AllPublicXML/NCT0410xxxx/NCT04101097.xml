  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rate of adequate bowel preparation is one of important quality indicators of colonoscopy.
      Inadeqaute bowel preparation negatively affects the outcomes of colonoscopy. If patients with
      inadequate bowel preparation were identified before the procedure, enhanced strategy could be
      offerred to achieve better bowel cleasing. Currently, there were three predicting models of
      inadequate bowel preparation eatablished based on patient-related factors. It remains unclear
      which model perfroms better in predicting bowel preparation quality. Futhermore, althought
      those predicting models only composing of patients-related factors are useful for identifing
      high-risk patients, the preparation-related factors may also be valuable for prediciting
      inadeqaute bowel preparation before the procedure of colonoscopy.

      This study aimed: 1) to compare the values of three availlable models (based on
      patient-related factors) in predicting inadeqaute bowel preparation in a prospective,
      multicentered cohort of patients undergoing colonoscopy; 2) to investigate whether a new
      model based on preparation-related or a combined model based on patient-related and
      preparation-related factors is comparable to previous models based on patient-related
      factors.

    <description>All patients received oral and written instructions on the appointment day. All patients were instructed to have low-residue food for lunch and dinner on the day before colonoscopy. Patients were instructed to begin drinking the first 1.5L-2L PEG at 7:00-9:00 PM on the day before colonoscopy. On the day of the procedure, they took another 1.5L-2L 4-6 hours before colonoscopy. Patients were encouraged more to drink more clear liquids after purgatives for adequate hydration.</description>
