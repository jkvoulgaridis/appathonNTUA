  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multiple center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of brivoligide injection administered intrathecally before surgery in
      patients with high Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) scores undergoing mastectomy with
      immediate tissue expander or implant placement.

      Potential subjects will be prescreened for PCS score; pre-qualified patients will be invited
      to the investigative site for informed consent and full screening within 30 days of
      randomization. Patients providing informed consent and meeting all study eligibility criteria
      will be enrolled in the study on the day of surgery (Day 1).

      Subjects will receive study drug just prior to anesthesia induction. Study assessments will
      be entered by subjects in the electronic diary from Day 1 through Day 21. Follow-up visits
      will occur on Days 7 and 21 (± 2 days).

             able to comply with all study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior breast surgery in the index breast (either breast for bilateral surgery) in the

          -  Induction chemotherapy or plans for adjunctive chemotherapy or any radiotherapy within
             21 days of surgery

          -  Known spinal deformities or cutaneous infection in the lumbar area that would preclude
             intrathecal administration of study drug

          -  Planned use of liposomal formulated or long-acting local anesthetics, extended release
             opioid formulations (e.g., Oxycontin), long half-life opioids (e.g., methadone), or
             drugs with potential for adverse cognitive or memory effects (e.g., ketamine,
             scopolamine, or propranolol) preoperatively and/or at any time through the duration of
             the study

          -  Use of more than 40 mg per day (on average) of oral morphine or its equivalent within
             1 month prior to randomization

          -  Current neurologic disorder, which could confound the assessment of pain

          -  Unstable mental condition which would prevent the patient from understanding the
             nature and scope of the study and/or evidence of an uncooperative attitude in the

          -  Women who are pregnant or nursing

          -  Participation in a clinical trial with the last dose or intervention within 1 month of
