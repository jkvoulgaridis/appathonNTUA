  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scientific context: Students' quality of life reflects the general health of students, in
      connection with the studies themselves, but also with physical, biological, social, cultural,
      and psychological determinants. Indeed, students are young adults exposed to a complex period
      composed of transitions in different spheres of their life: housing, domestic tasks, social
      learning, lifestyle choices, etc. In addition to this, students in medical and health
      sciences have to face with stress due to a demanding training and exposure to the hospital
      world. According to the Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS), health professionals in activity or in
      training are identified as a &quot;population at risk historically identified.&quot;

      The studies on stress and psychological disorders, in medical students, are considerably
      documented on the international level and the incidence of various psychic problems
      (depressive state, suicidal ideas ...) and behavioural (food behaviours, addictive behaviours
      ...) has been shown to be predominant in this population. However, no studies have been
      conducted on aspects like self-esteem, self-efficacy and extracurricular activities. In this
      sense, it may be interesting to match quality of life of health students in Lyon compared to
      the results of the other studies carried out in France, and to have a global approach of the
      factors influencing quality of life, with identification of factors that are potentially
      harmful, but also beneficial to the global health. This study will also compare the results
      according to the different health sectors such as medicine, pharmacy, maieutic, odontology,
      and sciences of rehabilitation.

      Research hypothesis: the study hypothesis is that description of the quality of life and,
      self-efficacy, self-esteem, nutrition, anxiety, physical activity, sleep quality, and
      addiction parameters in health student will better characterize student's issues in order to
      propose an appropriate intervention to improve their global health.

      The study is an observational, cross sectional and monocentric study conducted among the
      population of students of the Lyon 1 University in the health science field on a 9 months
      period.

    <description>The quality of life will be evaluated by the WHOQOL BREF questionnaire (Caria et al, 1995, Baumann et al, 2010) consisting of 26 items exploring physical health (7 items), psychological health (6 items), social relations (3 items), environment (8 items) and the quality of life related to health attesting to the overall satisfaction (2 items). Subject responses are collected using a Likert scale, scored from 1 to 5, summed and converted to a scale of 0 (poor quality of life) to 100 (good quality of life).</description>

    <description>The cross-sectional study will be conducted in all students in health sciences in 3rd year enrolled at the University Claude Bernard Lyon 1 (UCBL) and participating at the required medical consultation at the college Health Department of UCBL, over a period of 9 months.
The self-questionnaires will be completed by the students during the mandatory medical preventive visit at the university health center.
All dimensions investigated by the questionnaire are usually questioned by the caregivers during the consultation as part of the usual follow-up of students.</description>
