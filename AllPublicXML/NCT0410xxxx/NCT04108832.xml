      This trial was a 8 weeks' randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study was
      approved by the Institutional Review Board of Chung Shan Medical University hospital, and
      signed informed consent was obtained from each patient. Eighty-one patients of osteoarthritis
      of knees or hips were enrolled in this study. Inclusion criteria were: age 20 to 80 years;
      primary osteoarthritis in at least 1 knee, verified radiologically and scored (as normal,
      minimal, moderate or marked) for joint-space narrowing and marginal osteophytes in the
      medial, lateral and patellofemoral compartments; at least moderate pain during the 2 weeks
      before random assignment to treatment, as identified with the Western Ontario and McMaster
      Universities (WOMAC) LK3.0 Osteoarthritis Index pain subscale.

      Primary outcome measures: WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities) osteoarthritis
      index at week 4.

      Secondary outcome measures: WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities) osteoarthritis
      index at week 2; Visual analogue scale (VAS), Quality of life by SF-36, patient global
      assessment (PGA), at week 2 and 4; The PGA was scored from 0 to 4 (0 representing very good);
      Biomarkers: Hs-CRP, ESR.
