  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood flow restriction (BFR) therapy is a brief and partial restriction of venous outflow of
      an extremity during low load resistance exercises. It is a safe and effective method of
      improving strength in healthy and active individuals, recovering from orthopedic pathologies
      and procedures. This prospective, randomized study will look at the implications this form of
      treatment has on the rehabilitation of Achilles injuries.

    <description>Blood flow restriction therapy is a blood pressure cuff placed around the desired limb with a handheld device that controls the pressure exerted by the cuff. The cuff is placed around the desired limb before a specific exercise, the physical therapist determines the appropriate pressure and time, and the patient completes the exercise as they normally would. The monitor determines the limb occlusion pressure and has an automatic timer that will deflate after the specified time has elapsed.</description>
