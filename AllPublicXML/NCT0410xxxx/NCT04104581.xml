  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to identify markers of daily whole grain oat and whole
      grain wheat intake in humans.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to identify compounds that are found in blood and urine and are
      derived from repeated daily consumption of whole grain oat or whole grain wheat intake so
      that epidemiological studies can be conducted to provide more accurate associations between
      whole grain intake and health.
