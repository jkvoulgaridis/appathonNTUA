  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a major public health concern. Worldwide, 1 in 3 women
      have experienced domestic abuse/ violence in their lifetime. In most cases, family lawyers,
      advocates are first contact before the police. If the children are involved, finding the
      legal options become the priority for women before leaving the abuser.

      The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of the HELP (Health, Education
      Legal Support Program) intervention among IPV survivors.
