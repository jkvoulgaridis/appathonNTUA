  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, investigator-initiated, non-interventional study evaluating the role
      of the intestinal microbiome and autoimmune panels as a predictor for developing ≥ Grade 2
      CTCAE v5.0 immune-related adverse event (irAE) and/or requiring systemic immunosuppression
      for irAEs in advanced solid tumor patients receiving immunooncology (IO) combinations at the
      Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. This is a minimal risk study involving the analysis of
      patient samples and does not involve therapeutic intervention.

      The study will involve a prospective cohort of up to 120 patients and it is anticipated that
      patient accrual will be completed within 18 months.

      Patients will receive IO combination as per their specific protocols from their other
      clinical trial or per their standard of care and samples will be collected at multiple
      time-points. No additional visits to the hospital will be needed for this study as safety
      assessments are already captured for all patients based on their participation in a clinical
      trial or per their standard of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Accumulating evidence supports that differential composition of fecal microbiome influences
      response to immunotherapy and development of colitis. Microbiome with different profiles are
      also associated with multiple diseases, including gastrointestinal (GI) or non-GI auto-immune
      pathologies. Little is known about the relationship between the microbiome composition or
      fecal calprotectin (fCal) and the development of non-colitis immune-related adverse events
      (irAEs) during treatment with IO combinations.

      Autoimmune conditions and irAEs from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) drugs both involve
      loss of tolerance to endogenous antigens and produce similar clinical presentations. ICI can
      increase humoral response. However, to date there is no evidence that autoimmune panels are
      correlated with the development of irAEs during IO combination therapy.

      These findings suggest that analyzing the microbiome and autoimmune panels of patients
      treated with IO combinations at multiple time-points may be feasible. In addition, baseline,
      early shift and changes in microbiome and autoimmune panels at time of a serious irAE may be
      correlated with the development of serious irAEs and may change with appropriate
      immunosuppressive regimens.

      We hypothesize that analysing the microbiome and autoimmune panels of patients treated with
      immunooncology (IO) combinations at multiple time-points is feasible. Additionally, we
      hypothesize that baseline, early shift and changes in microbiome and autoimmune panels at
      time of a serious immune-related adverse event (irAE) is correlated with the development of
      serious irAEs and will change with appropriate immunosuppressive regimens.
