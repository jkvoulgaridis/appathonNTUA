    <textblock>
      Knee Osteoarthritis in elder cause pain and decrease their functional activity. After
      conservative rehabilitation failure, they might receive total knee arthroplasty. The
      post-operation rehabilitation could improve range of motion and might help them to back
      activities of daily Living earlier. However, the pain and swelling after the operation of
      total knee arthroplasty cause the limitation of early mobilization, cause ROM limitation,
      muscle strength decrease, functional activity decrease, and impaired activity of daily life.
      In recent studies, the effect of whole body vibration included improving pain, swelling,
      muscle strength, balance, and functional activity, increasing metabolic rate and decreasing
      lactate accumulation. the investigators expect the early intervention of whole body vibration
      and traditional physical therapy on the post-TKA patient could improve ROM, decrease
      swelling, increased muscle strength, functional activity, and balance as compared with
      traditional physical therapy.

                procedures(summary)

             1. Written informed consent must be obtained before any study specific procedures are
                undertaken.

             2. The process of the experiment (brief describe)

             1. Randomized distribute participants into two groups, &quot;whole body
                vibration(experimental group)+ traditional physical therapy&quot; group and &quot;placebo
                group with traditional physical therapy+ whole body vibration (placebo without
                turn-on vibration)&quot;.

             2. Post-TKA day 1 (not op day) Pre-test (baselin data) include pain(VAS), leg
                circumference, knee ROM, knee extensor strength (JAMMAR), sit to stand average
                duration, 6 meters ambulatory test.

                Both groups receive traditional physical therapy and passive continuous passive
                motion (CPM).

             3. Post-TKA day 2 Both groups keep traditional physical therapy and CPM.

           (1) The experimental group perform pre-test before the treatment. After the pre-test,
           participants receive 10-15 minutes WBV exercise in standing position, amplitude 2mm,
           frequency 4-10Hz, with rest about 3-5minutes. After the treatment, perform
           post-treatment test 1.

           (2) The control group standing on the WBV machine without turn-on for 10-15 minutes and
           then post-treatment test 1.

           4. Post-TKA day 3

             1. The experimental group participants receive 10-15 minutes WBV exercise in standing
                position, amplitude 2mm, frequency 4-10 Hz, with rest about 3-5minutes. After the
                treatment, perform post-treatment test 2.

             2. The control group standing on the WBV machine without turn-on for 10-15 minutes and
                then post-treatment test 1.

                Statistical analysis 1. Statistical Method for Efficacy / Safety measurements:
                Demographic data were collected on age, pre-TKA Osteoarthritis X-ray
                Kellgren-Lawrence classification, sex, weight, height, side of involvement. The
                investigators use t-test, or chi-square test to confirm homogeneity.

                On the other side, measurement the circulation of the affected limb above knee 15
                cm, knee and below knee 5cm for swelling evaluation. Pain scale with Numeric Rating
                Scale; NRS) before intervention, post-test 1 and post-test 2. Muscle power of knee
                extensor by the duration with holding knee extension in sitting position before
                intervention, post-test 1 and post-test 2 Knee range of motion with goniometer in
                sitting (prone position) The duration of time up and go，6 meter ambulation test
                with walker usage. ADL evaluation with Barthel Index including transfer score,
                ambulation score, and up/down stairs score. Paired t-test is applied for
                statistical significance between these measurements.

                Discussion The investigator expected that post treatment, the patients in the
                vibration group got increases in knee extensor strength, improvement in calf
                swelling and functional performance when compared to the control group.
