  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study will evaluate the administration of a particle called macro-aggregated
      albumin (MAA) labelled with the radiotracer technetium 99m (Tc99m) as a proxy to estimate the
      anticipated dose of radiation to tumor and adjacent structures.

      Administration of this labeled MAA will not have a therapeutic benefit on the participant's
      cancer. Administration will help researchers determine if arterial administration of
      radiation may be feasible for lung cancer in the future.

    <textblock>
      This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining
      this study intervention.

      As mentioned above, standard of care treatment for Stage III lung cancer includes
      chemotherapy and stereotactic body radiation therapy. However, arterial administration of
      radiation to these tumors may represent an alternative method of radiotherapy, with dose
      directly administered to the tumor. The potential radiation dose to the tumor and adjacent
      structures is not known.

      This study aims to estimate the dose of radiation to tumor and adjacent structures in the
      chest via administration of a radiotracer called Tc99m-MAA. Tc99m-MAA is a particle that is
      used to assess blood flow distribution and has a similar size to the particles that are
      utilized for arterial delivery of radiation therapy, also called radioembolization. Tc99m-MAA
      is currently used to estimate radiation dosimetry prior to arterial radiotherapy
      administration for liver malignancies.

      If this study is successful, the results will allow doctors to use the distribution of
      Tc99m-MAA to estimate radiation dose to tumors and adjacent structures in the setting of
      intra-arterial radiation therapy. This will provide information to plan future therapy with
      intra-arterial radioembolization for lung malignancies.
