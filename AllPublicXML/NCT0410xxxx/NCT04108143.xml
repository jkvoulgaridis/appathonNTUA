  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MonitorMe is a telephone device intended for the non-critical monitoring of vital signs in a
      domestic environment with the ability to automatically transmit data to a remote location via
      basic telephone connectivity.

      MonitorMe's low-cost, call automation and simple to use technology (i.e. based on the
      principles of an ordinary plug-in telephone) make it appropriate for a wide number of care
      pathways. It eliminates the need for a modem or broadband and avoids the challenges of less
      reliable smart phone technology. Typical use scenarios include remote monitoring of
      individual or multiple chronic disease states such as COPD to improve patient outcomes
      including prevention of emergency admissions.

      There is growing interest in the use of home telemonitoring in COPD in order to facilitate
      the management of the increasing numbers of patients and pressures on the NHS. Despite the
      positive effects of telemonitoring in conditions such as heart failure, benefits remain
      unproven in COPD and further work is required before wide-scale use.

      Furthermore, until now the evaluation of telecare and telehealth developments has focused
      mainly on effectiveness and efficiency, whereas their social, and ethical implications in
      particular, have not been explored in depth. We will also explore ethical issues related to
      the use of telehealth systems, from both the patients' and the healthcare professionals'
      perspective.

      The current feasibility study is designed to assess the acceptability, usability and validity
      of MonitorMe within one of its intended purposes i.e. remote monitoring of individual or
      multiple chronic disease states such as COPD.

    <description>MonitorMe replaces the users existing telephone and for the majority of time is used as their ordinary telephone. At a known and set time of day for 4 weeks, participants will receive an automated MonitorMe telephone call. The participant answers a health and well-being automated script by pressing key pad numbers. At the same time vital signs data are collected. The responses and vital signs data, together with confidence values are then transmitted via telephone lines to an electronic patient record.</description>
