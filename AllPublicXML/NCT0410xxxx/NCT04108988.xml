  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate an innovative behavioral HIV prevention
      videogame intervention to bolster motivation and provide skill-building opportunities to
      improve Black adolescent girls' ability to negotiate around risk including advocating for
      partner HIV/STI testing, increasing their knowledge and awareness of HIV/STIs, and for
      reducing sexual risk-taking behaviors.

      This study will develop and evaluate a multiplayer videogame aimed at Black adolescent girls
      with the intent of teaching the ability to negotiate around risk including advocating for
      partner HIV/STI testing, increasing their knowledge and awareness of HIV/STIs, and for
      reducing sexual risk-taking behaviors.

      The intervention will be developed and delivered as a social, multiplayer videogame, a
      compelling context for Black adolescent girls who constantly interact and seek counsel from
      their peers. To this end, the Specific Aims, focusing on Black adolescent girls aged 14-18
      years, are to:

        1. (Phase 1) Translate the culturally and socially-tailored card game One Night Stan to a
           multiplayer videogame using game design and content experts and focus group input from
           30 Black adolescent girls.

        2. (Phase 2) Conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing the multiplayer
           videogame One Night Stan intervention vs. an attention/control non-health-related
           multiplayer videogame with 80 participants collecting assessment data at baseline, one,
           and four months to:

             1. Determine the intervention's acceptability and feasibility by collecting
                quantitative and qualitative data on Black adolescent girls' satisfaction and
                gameplay experience of the intervention.

             2. Determine the preliminary impact of the intervention on knowledge (information),
                intentions/attitudes (motivation), social norms, and behavioral skills as related
                to: i) HIV/STI testing and partner testing and ii) condom use, and iii) sexual risk
                behavior reduction, such as alcohol and drug use.

    <description>HIV/STI Testing- self will be used to test the hypothesis that individuals who play One Night Stan will report more HIV/STI testing and partner testing in comparison to the control condition. We will conduct a longitudinal analysis using a hierarchical linear mixed models approach to compare participants in the intervention group to participants in the control group on reported participant and partner HIV/STI testing from baseline across all follow-up assessments (i.e., baseline, one month and four months).</description>
