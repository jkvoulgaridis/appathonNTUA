    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antibody response to each of the four influenza
      vaccine strains included in the study vaccine, as measured by hemagglutination inhibition
      (HAI) at 4 weeks after the last dose of the study vaccine in young subjects aged between 3
      years old and 17 years old.

    <description>This was an open study to demonstrate the use of AdimFlu-S (QIS) (2016-2017 season) vaccine in young subjects aged between 3 years old to 17 years old. All subjects were divided into two subgroups. That were subjects aged 3 to 8 years old, who received 2 doses of 0.5 mL vaccine separated by 4 weeks, and subjects aged 9 to 17 years old, who received one dose of 0.5 mL vaccine.</description>

         11. Receipt of any inactivated vaccine within 2 weeks prior to study vaccination or
             expected to receive vaccination before the last blood sampling for immunogenicity
             evaluation;

         12. Receipt of any blood products, including immunoglobulin from 3 months before first
             vaccination to the last blood sampling for immunogenicity evaluation;

         13. Underlying condition in the investigators' opinion might interfere with evaluation of
             the vaccine.

        3. Treatment discontinuation

          1. Withdrawal criteria i. Subject/Subject's guardians decided to withdraw consent. ii.
             Lost to follow-up. iii. Administration of prohibited medication/treatment/vaccine. iv.
             Any pathological event, clinical adverse event, or any change in the subject's status
             giving indication to the pediatrician that further participation in the study might
             not be the best interests of the subject, according to investigator's discretion.

          2. Contraindications to second vaccination

        Subject with any of the following criteria might be contraindicated to take the second
        vaccination:
