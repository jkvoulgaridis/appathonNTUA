  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate the feasibility of a repetitive transcranial magnetic simulation
      (rTMS) protocol developed for managing pain and other related symptoms associated with
      oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy in cancer patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 60 cancer patients with oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OXAIPN) will be
      recruited. After randomization, the experimental group (n = 30) will receive high-frequency
      rTMS, while the control group (n = 30) will receive sham rTMS. The rTMS will be delivered
      over M1 (hand representation) of dual hemispheres with 10 trains of 10 Hz pulses for 10
      seconds, with a total of 1,000 pulses per hemisphere. The rTMS intensity will be set as 80%
      resting motor threshold and the interval between each train of pulses will be set as 50
      seconds. The rTMS will be delivered as daily session for five consecutive days, followed by
      two fortnightly maintenance sessions during the follow-up period after the completion of five
      daily sessions. The rTMS will be delivered by designated physical therapists using
      &quot;figure-of-8&quot; shaped coil connected to an electromagnetic stimulator in the rehabilitation
      therapy room of three hospitals in the Chinese mainland.

      The research outcomes are feasibility (recruitment, retention rate, guess of group
      allocation, and appropriateness of clinical outcome measures), acceptability (patients' and
      providers' satisfaction with rTMS, patients' actual use of rTMS, patients' willingness of
      using rTMS in the future, and patients perceived effectiveness of rTMS), safety, and trend of
      improvement in pain, other related symptoms, and quality of life by rTMS in cancer patients
      with OXAIPN. Evaluation of the study process will be performed with qualitative
      semi-structured interview.

    <description>In this study, affective attitude and perceived effectiveness will be measured by using the Chinese version of the Patients' Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale, a single-item 7-point numerical rating scale from 1 to 7 demonstrating participants' subjective perception of improvement and satisfaction after receiving the intervention (Hurst &amp; Bolton, 2004). The PGIC scale has been recommended by the rTMS research guideline for pain (Klein et al., 2015). The other domains of acceptability will be evaluated through a process evaluation using a qualitative approach.</description>

    <description>The Chinese version of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) will be used to assess pain associated with OXAIPN. This instrument was developed and validated by Wang et al. (2009) for measuring severity (four scales) and interference (seven scales) of pain in cancer patients, which demonstrated good internal consistencies of both domains (Cronbach's α were 0.894 and 0.915, respectively).</description>

    <description>Total Neuropathy Score-nurse© (TNSn©) is a validated instrument to evaluate symptoms and signs associated with OXAIPN based on both patient-reported and clinician-assessed data including three symptom questions (distribution areas of numbness, tingling/paresthesias, and neuropathic pain) and testing of vibration and pinprick; each of the symptoms and signs is scored from 0 to 4, with higher score indicating worse condition (Smith, Cohen, Pett &amp; Beck, 2010).</description>

    <description>The Chinese version of Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (C-ESAS) validated by Dong et al. (2015) will be used to explore whether the intervention would bring any change in the concurrently reported symptoms among cancer patients including pain, tiredness, nausea, depression, anxiety, drowsiness, appetite, sleep, well-being, shortness of breath, and potential miscellaneous symptoms that are not listed. Cronbach α of the C-ESAS was 0.72, indicating an acceptable internal consistency.</description>

    <description>Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General questionnaire (FACT‐G), a widely used self-reported questionnaire measuring health-related quality-of-life (QoL) in cancer patients, will be used in this study. Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group‐Neurotoxicity subscale (FACT/GOG‐Ntx) will be used to measure the participants' OXAIPN specific quality of life in this study. It is an 11-item tool added to the FACT measurement system for assessing cancer patients' symptoms and interference induced by neuropathy, which includes sensory, motor, and hearing problems, as well as dysfunctions associated with neuropathy. Good psychometrical properties of the FACT/GOG‐Ntx have been demonstrated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse Effects</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the safety of rTMS in this population, participants will be asked to report any adverse effect occur during the study. The adverse effects, including the type, occurrence, and duration, will be recorded using a standard form. According to the guidelines (Klein et al., 2015; Rossi et al., 2009), the potential adverse effects associated with rTMS are transient seizures, headaches, transient hearing changes, local pain, neck pain, toothache, and paresthesia. These potential adverse effects will be listed in the standard form, and will be filled out by the designated therapists based on their observation and the participants' self-report after each treatment session. If any adverse effect occurs but is not listed in the form, the therapist will record the condition in the &quot;Other&quot; column.</description>
