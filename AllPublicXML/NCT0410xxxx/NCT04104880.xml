  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the gold-standard treatment for obstructive
      sleep apnoea (OSA), the most common sleep-disordered breathing in the overall population.
      CPAP has shown to be effective in reducing apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) as well as other OSA
      polysomnographic outcomes. However, the effectiveness of this device on OSA daily functioning
      and mood disturbances outcomes still remains unclear. The ADIPOSA study is aimed at
      determining the effects of three-month CPAP use on anxiety-depression symptoms in patients
      with OSA. Participants will be adults previously diagnosed with OSA who will be allocated to
      a CPAP-treatment group. Outcomes will be measured at baseline and intervention end-point
      (three months) including daytime sleepiness, daily functioning and mood (anxiety and
      depression symptoms), AHI, other neurophysical and cardiorespiratory polysomnographic
      outcomes, and body weight. ADIPOSA may serve to establish the effectiveness of CPAP on
      daytime functioning and mood disturbances commonly found on patients with OSA and, in turn,
      on other OSA outcomes related to anxiety-depression symptoms.

    <description>Change in the difficulty in maintaining a desired level of wakefulness, measured by the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) from baseline to post-intervention. ESS is a 4-point scale (0 = no chance of dozing, 1 = slight chance of dozing, 2 = moderate chance of dozing, 3 = high chance of dozing) that measures the usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep while engaged in eight different activities. An ESS total score from 0 to 9 is considered to be normal while an ESS total score &gt; 9 indicates high daytime sleepiness.</description>
