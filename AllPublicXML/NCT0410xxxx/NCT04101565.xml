  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of Text4Father
      among first-time lower income fathers. Half of the participants will receive Text4Father - a
      text messaging educational program - from mid-pregnancy through 2 months of postnatal age,
      while the other half will receive usual care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Text4Father, a multi-modal text messaging program, is designed to increase first-time lower
      income fathers' knowledge, self-efficacy, and behavioral engagement on infant care and
      parenting. Text4Father consists of 48-weeks of twice weekly texts written at a 5th grade
      reading level. Texts include resource links and instructions to support behavior change
      (e.g., videos, infographics), starting mid-pregnancy and continuing through 2 months of
      postnatal age. Text content was developed using formative research and feedback from the
      target population, consensus building with experts, and an evidence-based review.

      Usual maternity care does not involve expectant fathers in education. Further, while father
      engagement is widely advocated, few public health and clinical approaches aim to engage
      expectant fathers during the prenatal period and first months after birth - a critical window
      of opportunity that has been insufficiently leveraged to promote father engagement when
      fathers describe being unsure of father role.

    <ipd_description>The final version of collected data will be made available within thirty (30) months after the end of the data collection. Data will be preserved and made accessible along with relevant documentation via the chosen repository (e.g., through open access (Open Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)) if possible). Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine will review the disclosure protection of the de-identified datasets. If they conclude that the risk of disclosure is too great for public access, then ICPSR's Traditional Restricted Data or Physical Data Enclave will be used for some or all of the data, with restricted access solely to approved researchers.</ipd_description>
