      This study evaluates serum level of Vitamin D in Interstitial Lung Diseases in patients with
      Interstitial Lung Diseases other than connective tissue diseases associated-Interstitial Lung
      Diseases and effects of its supplementation.

      All patients will receive the standard regimen of treatment (corticosteroids and
      immunosuppressive drugs)and will be randomly assigned to either Group 1:who will receive
      Vitamin D supplementation (Interventional group)or Group 2:who will not receive Vitamin D
      supplementation(Control group).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary fibrosis was due to chronic inflammation and disordered wound healing in response
      to damage induced by a variety of agents such as viral infection and radiotherapy or
      environmental toxins.it is characterized by accumulation of myofibroblasts and excessive
      deposition of the extracellular matrix.Epithelial cells undergoes epithelial mesenchymal
      transition (EMT).

      Supplementation with vitamin D or its analogs suppresses lung fibrosis via triggering
      anti-fibrotic effect through attenuation of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-B).vitamin D
      can reduce TGF-B expression and attenuate TGF-B induced epithelial mesenchymal transition in
      lung fibroblast and epithelial cells.
