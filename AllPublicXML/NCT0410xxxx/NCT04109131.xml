  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite some encouraging data, systemic treatment of CNS metastases from solid tumors remains
      experimental.

      Better knowledge on the evolving epidemiology and biology of BM are key elements for the
      development of new treatment strategies and identification of promising therapeutic targets
      for new compounds. Further biological findings may help to better understand the
      heterogeneity between the primary tumor and the CNS metastases and to identify new targets
      for therapy thus improving patients' outcome.

      In this context, the Oncodistinct network and the Jules Bordet institute propose to build a
      multidisciplinary Brain Metastases Clinical Research Platform called BrainStorm. The
      BrainStorm program will focus on patients with newly diagnosed non-CNS metastatic solid
      tumors with high risk of developing CNS metastases and will allow building a large clinico
      pathological database for CNS metastases including ctDNA analyzes from CSF samples.
      Substudies will be proposed at each time-period with the final objective to develop
      innovative treatment approaches and strategies.
