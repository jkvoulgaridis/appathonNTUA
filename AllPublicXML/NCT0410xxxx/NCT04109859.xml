  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased production of vasodilating substances such as NO plays an important role in the
      development of vasoplegic syndrome caused by obstructive jaundice.Methylene blue plays a role
      in raising blood pressure by inhibiting the vasodilator Nitric Oxide (NO)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The level of circulating hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in patients with obstructive jaundice is
      significantly increased. As a direct opener of KATP channels in vivo, H2S also has diastolic
      peripheral vasculature . H2S participates in the occurrence of vasoplegic syndrome in
      patients with obstructive jaundice by interacting with NO. However, it is unclear whether
      methylene blue can relieve vasoplegic syndrome in patients with obstructive jaundice by
      inhibiting the vasodilating effect of substances such as H2S and NO.

      Therefore, this clinical study intends to include patients with obstructive jaundice, using
      randomized, controlled, prospective study to explore the effect of methylene blue on the
      occurrence of vasoplegic syndrome, organ function and prognosis in patients with obstructive
      jaundice.
