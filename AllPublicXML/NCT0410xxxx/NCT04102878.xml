  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eyelid surgery is commonly performed under local anaesthesia. For many such procedures, the
      local anaesthetic injection may be given either transcutaneously (through the skin) or
      transconjunctivally (through the conjunctiva, i.e. from the inner surface of the eyelid after
      administration of topical anaesthetic drops). Both methods are commonly used, sometimes in
      combination. Currently, the choice of route is largely determined by surgeon preference, but
      it is not known whether one method is better or more comfortable than the other. Our study
      will compare the two methods of local anaesthetic administration, in terms of patient comfort
      during anaesthetic administration, efficacy (i.e. whether any additional anaesthetic is
      needed during surgery), and adverse effects (e.g. bruising, postoperative double vision).

      We will recruit adult patients who are due to undergo eyelid surgery on both sides under
      local anaesthesia, on Miss Siah's lists at Southampton General Hospital or Lymington
      Hospital. Patients will receive topical anaesthetic eye drops to both eyes, followed by an
      injection of local anaesthetic to each eyelid. One side will be administered
      transcutaneously, and the other side transconjunctivally. The order be randomised. After the
      injections, participants will be asked to rate their pain levels during each injection on a
      standardised numerical scale (1-10). A photograph will also be taken, so that an independent
      assessor can subsequently rate the extent of any bruising. The eyelid surgery will then be
      performed as normal, with any need for further anaesthetic during the surgery being recorded.
      Patients will attend for their normal follow-up appointment afterwards and any postoperative
      complications will be recorded, but the study will not require any extra hospital visits. The
      study is sponsored by University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, but does not have any
      external funding.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients undergoing bilateral oculoplastic procedures under local anaesthesia on
             selected lists at Southampton General Hospital or Lymington New Forest Hospital, UK

          -  able to give informed consent and adhere to the study protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients undergoing substantially different procedures on each eye

          -  patients undergoing procedures not amenable to the administration of anaesthetic via
             the transconjunctival route (e.g. brow lift)

          -  patients undergoing a first procedure on one eye and a 'redo' procedure on the fellow
             eye (as the presence of scar tissue on the previously operated eye is likely to affect
             results)

          -  patients having their procedure under general anaesthesia, or receiving intravenous
             sedation prior to the administration of local anaesthetic
