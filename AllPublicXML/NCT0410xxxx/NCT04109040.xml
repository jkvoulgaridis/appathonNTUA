      of life outcome of patients after LASIK surgery.

      The feeling of sight in human is usually taken as the most significant factor for fathoming
      and receiving data from environment and, thus, assumes a significant role in regulating most
      human exercises and practices. Accordingly, any harm to this sense may significantly
      influence an individual's adjustment with environment.1

      Refractive error can be explained as an eye condition in which incoming light rays are not
      focused on the photoreceptor layer of the fovea, resulting in blurred vision. Of the
      refractive errors, myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism are the 3 most common types. In myopia,
      the incoming light rays are focused in front of the fovea, whereas in hyperopia, they are
      focused beyond the fovea. Astigmatism is typically explained by irregularities in the cornea
      (corneal astigmatism) and crystalline lens (lenticular astigmatism), which results in
      differential focusing of parallel rays through different corneal and lenticular meridians.The
      refractive surgery has a very important role helping subjects to get rid of contact lenses
      and spectacules.2-3

      Laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) is the most popular refractive surgery
      performed to correct refractive errors of the eye, including myopia, hyperopia, and
      astigmatism. LASIK surgery has been reported to yield significantly improved patient reported
      visual outcomes.1 The result is the patient's independence from glasses and contact lenses.
      Many studies have reported that LASIK surgery can improve not only visual function,1 but also
      patients' quality of life (QOL).2,4-10

      Patient-reported outcomes also revealed that LASIK can maximize patient satisfaction and
      quality of life by minimizing the onset of visual and dry eye symptoms.11 Happiness or
      positive emotions are now regarded as a critical component of health.12 With the introduction
      of the discipline of positive psychology in the late 1990s, many scientific investigations of
      happiness have resulted in the development of the proposal that happiness or positive
      emotions are highly beneficial for physical and mental health.12-19
