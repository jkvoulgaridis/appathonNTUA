  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the cost-effectiveness of vocal rehabilitation with
      reinforced inter-tracheoesophageal voice prosthesis versus standard voice prosthesis in case
      of repeated intra-prosthetic leakage in total laryngectomy patients.

      This is a one year medico-economic study involving patients carrying a standard voice
      prosthesis implant and having undergone 2 successive prosthesis replacements within 3 months
      of interval and/or requiring at least 4 changes in the last 12 months, for intraprosthetic
      leakage.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized in 2 groups: reinforced prosthesis with silver coating
      and double valve (Dual Valve) or standard prosthesis (single unreinforced valve), of the same
      model as the prosthesis previously implanted in the patient.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prosthetic voice rehabilitation is a widespread practice that allows the patient to resume
      phonation quickly after total laryngectomy/total pharyngolaryngectomy/total circular
      pharyngolaryngectomy.

      When the longevity of the implant is abnormally short (less than 3 months), the
      multiplication of changes is likely to increase the risk of overall morbidity related to
      maintaining the functionality of the voice prosthesis and to alter the patient's quality of
      life.

      Reinforced innovative prostheses, currently not supported by the French Social Security,
      delay the occurrence of intraprosthetic leakage compared to standard prostheses.

      This study assesses the economic efficiency from a societal perspective and a one-year time
      horizon, from vocal rehabilitation with reinforced inter-tracheoesophageal prosthesis versus
      standard voice prosthesis in case of intra-tracheal leakage in total laryngectomy patients.

      Patients are randomized in 2 arms. Arm A usual care with reinforced prosthesis, or arm B
      usual care with standard prosthesis. Each patient is followed during 12 months.
