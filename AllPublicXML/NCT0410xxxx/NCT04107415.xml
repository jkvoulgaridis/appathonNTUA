  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While there are studies conducted with yoga on different patient groups in Turkey, no studies
      have been found on asthma patients specifically. For this reason, it was thought that studies
      are needed which will prove the effect of yoga practices in preventing and controlling
      symptoms of asthma patients and which will contribute to nursing literature.

    <measure>Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 week</time_frame>
    <description>Performed to determine the quality of life of asthma patients. Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire , which addresses both the physical and emotional aspects of the disease has 32 items and four sub-dimensions. These sub-dimensions are activity limitation (items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 19, 25, 28, 31, 32), symptoms (items 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 29, 30), emotional functions (items 7, 13, 15, 21, 27) and environmental stimulants (items 9, 17, 23, 26). The scale is a 7-Likert type scale with &quot;1&quot; having the lowest point and &quot;7&quot; the highest point. Weights for the points of the questions are equal. General quality of life is calculated with the averages of all questions, while sub-dimensions are calculated by adding the scores of the related fields. Total score of the scale differs between 32 and 224. Higher total score and sub-dimension score averages mean higher quality of life. diagnosis</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma Control Test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 week</time_frame>
    <description>The test consists of 5 questions. In this 5-Likert type scale, the scores of the answers are added up and the patient's state is evaluated. The maximum score one can get from this test is 25, while the minimum score is 5. While scoring Asthma Control Test, 25 points is accepted as &quot;full control&quot;, 20-24 points is accepted as &quot;good control&quot; and less than 19 points is accepted as &quot;no control&quot;. The highest score indicates the best control, while scores less than 19 indicate that the disease is not under control and that modifications should be made in the treatment to reach control.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Respiratory Function tests</measure>
    <time_frame>6 week</time_frame>
    <description>Respiratory Function tests is a physiological parameter. Respiratory Function tests are assessed to find out the degree of airway constriction with spirometer and also to find out whether the disease is reversible and to make asthma diagnosis. Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow rate (PEF) and FEV1/FVC measurements were used to evaluate airway constriction</description>
