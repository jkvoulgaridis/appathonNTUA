  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, axillary surgery for breast cancer is considered as staging procedure that does
      not seem to influence breast cancer mortality, since the risk of developing metastasis
      depends mainly on the biological behaviour of the primary (seed-and-soil model). Based on
      this, the postsurgical therapy should be considered on the basis of biologic tumor
      characteristics rather than nodal involvement.

      Improvements in systemic treatments for breast cancer have increased the rates of pathologic
      complete response (pCR) in patients receiving neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST), offering
      the opportunity to decrease, and perhaps eliminate, surgery in patients who have a pCR.

      The investigators designed a clinical trial in which only patients with the highest
      likelihood of having a pCR after NAST (triple-negative or HER2-positive breast cancer) will
      be included and type of surgery will be defined according to the response to NAST rather than
      on the classical T and N status at presentation. In the planned trial, axillary surgery will
      be eliminated completely (no axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy [SLNB]) for initially cN0
      patients with radiologic complete remission (rCR) and a breast pCR as determined in the
      lumpectomy specimen.

      The trial design is a multicenter single-arm study with a limited number of patients (N=267)
      which might give practice-changing results in a short period of time, sparing the time and
      the costs of a randomized comparison. Patients will be recruited in European countries
      (Austria, Germany, Italy, Spain and Sweden) over a period of 24 months.

      EUBREAST-01 is a prospective non-randomized, single-arm surgical trial. Included patients
      will be recruited for the experimental arm (no axillary SLNB in cases with breast pCR after
      NAST) exclusively. EUBREAST-01 is an international multicentric trial and designed by
      European Breast Cancer Research Association of Surgical Trialists (EUBREAST). The University
      Medicine Rostock (Germany) will overtake the sponsorship for the trial.

      Duration of recruitment is 2 years among 30 German, 10-15 Italian, 3 Spanish, 3 Swedish, and
      3 Austrian study centres. The total number of patients to be recruited into the trial will be
      267. All participating centres are experienced in conduction of clinical trials and stated at
      least a rate of 50 primary breast cancer diagnosis per year. At least 30% of all primary
      breast cancer are TNBC or HER2-positive tumors. The great majority of these cases will be
      diagnosed in tumor stage T1c-T3 (&gt;1cm). The NAST with chemotherapy (plus anti-HER2 therapy if
      HER2-positive) is standard for this cohort in Germany, Austria, Italy, Spain and Sweden. If
      each study center will recruit 3 cases per year, the planned recruitment of 267 patients
      (per-protocol analysis) will be reached in 2 years.

      Efficacy analyses will be conducted after a follow-up of 3 years for each patient regarding
      the primary outcome and after 5 years follow-up for the secondary outcomes. No interim
      analysis is planned. Patients will be assessed for disease recurrence according to standard
      national clinical practice over a period of at least 5 years. Longest follow-up is 7 years.
      History and physical examination will be performed every 6 months for the first 36 months and
      yearly thereafter. Annual mammography and sonography will be required; other testing will be
      based on symptoms and investigator preference.
