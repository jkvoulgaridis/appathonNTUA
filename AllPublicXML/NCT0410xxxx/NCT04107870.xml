  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia nervosa is defined in DSM V as a quantitative and qualitative dietary restriction
      resulting in significant weight loss, intense fear of weight gain, altered weight and body
      shape perception (body dysmorphic disorder) and low self-esteem influenced by weight or body
      shape. Body dysmorphic disorder is the most difficult symptom to manage in anorexia nervosa
      and its persistence is a factor associated with relapse.

      Virtual reality exposure therapy has proven its effectiveness in the management of
      post-traumatic stress disorder in the military and is a widely used therapy. The
      effectiveness of this treatment using new technologies has not yet been studied for the
      treatment of body dysmorphic disorder in anorexia nervosa and is not used routinely. It could
      represent an interesting alternative to the physical approach in psychomotor therapy,
      traditionally offered to patients suffering from anorexia nervosa. It is important to
      evaluate the effectiveness of virtual reality exposure therapy in the management of body
      dysmorphic disorder in patients with anorexia nervosa by comparing these two care techniques.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy in
      the management of body dysmorphic disorder in patients with anorexia nervosa, compared to the
      traditionally proposed body approach in psychomotor therapy.

The BSQ can be divided into 4 sub scores: &quot;avoidance and social shame of body exposure&quot;, &quot;body dissatisfaction with lower body parts&quot;, &quot;use of laxatives and vomiting to reduce body dissatisfaction&quot; and &quot;inappropriate cognitions and behaviours to control weight&quot;.</description>
