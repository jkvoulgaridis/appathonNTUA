    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate a combination of a novel Dual-task regime together with other
      already known tests in terms of defining when an athlete is ready to return to play after a
      concussion.

      In this prospective study, we will evaluate a combination of a novel facilitating agility
      Dual-task regime together with sport concussion assessment tool -5 (SCAT5),
      Vestibular/Ocular-Motor Screening for Concussion, Agility T-test, Joint repositions error
      test and Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) in terms of defining when an athlete is ready to
      return to play after a concussion. We will investigate if a novel facilitating agility
      Dual-task test together with already widely used tests, can identify more athletes that after
      a concussion still isn't ready to return to play, due to a physiological deficit. We will
      test as many athletes as possible each season and when an athlete suffer a concussion, we
      will follow them to see when they reach their baseline level. As previous studies show a over
      representation of new injuries in athletes returning to play after a concussion, we will also
      register injuries from all included subjects in terms of injuries each year, to evaluate if
      athletes following our recommendations have a lower injury rate after returning to play after
      a concussion. We also hope to be able to get more knowledge about how pain catastrophizing is
      related to duration of concussions symptoms.
