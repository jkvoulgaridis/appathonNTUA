  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label Phase 1a/1b study in patients who have advanced solid cancer tumours.
      Patients will receive MTL-CEBPA (an experimental drug) in combination with pembrolizumab (a
      drug which has been given approval for use for some tumour types).

      The Phase 1a dose escalation part of the study is designed to establish which doses of
      MTL-CEBPA are safe and well-tolerated when combined with the standard dose of pembrolizumab.
      Patients recruited to this part of the study will be those whose cancer progressed on
      standard treatment(s) or for whom no treatments are available.

      Phase 1b the dose expansion part of the study will further explore how safe and
      well-tolerated these two drugs are when combined and will assess if the combination of drugs
      could potentially reduce the size of tumours. Participants in this part of the study will
      receive the experimental drug (MTL-CEBPA) at a dose which is considered safe and
      well-tolerated based on data from the first part of the study (Phase 1a). Participants will
      remain in the study taking study drugs until either death, or they choose to withdraw from
      the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1a comprises three planned dose cohorts (ascending dose, 3+3 design, at the following
      dose levels: 70 mg/m2 QW, 98 mg/m2 QW, and 130 mg/m2 QW) of MTL-CEBPA combined with standard
      dose of pembrolizumab (given every 3 weeks). The aim is to assess the safety and tolerability
      of MTL-CEBPA in combination with pembrolizumab, recruiting patients whose disease progressed
      on standard of care therapy or for whom no therapy is available.

      In the first dose cohort the first participant enrolled will receive MTL-CEBPA treatment at
      the 70mg/m2 QW dose level. Pembrolizumab (200mg) will be administered on Day 2 of the first
      cycle and subsequently every 3 weeks whilst participant is on treatment. MTL-CEBPA and
      pembrolizumab will not be administered on the same day.

      Phase 1b of the study will further evaluate safety, tolerability, and assess the clinical
      activity of MTL-CEBPA and a PD-1 inhibitor (pembrolizumab) in combination.

      Participants will receive MTL-CEBPA at a dose considered most appropriate, with regards to
      safety, tolerability, and efficacy, for further development (based on data from Phase 1a of
      the study).

      Patients with the following (but not limited to) solid tumours will be specifically targeted:
      breast, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, gall bladder, HCC, neuroendocrine, and cholangiocarcinoma.

Phase 1b will aim to confirm the doses of the drugs obtained in Phase 1a in a larger population and if it has potential to reduce the size of the tumour and/or extend the life of participants.</intervention_model_description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of any solid tumour

          -  Patients with progressive disease, refractory to standard of care with no standard
             therapy available or patient refused standard therapy

          -  Patients who are naïve to PD-1 / PD-L1 inhibitors

          -  ECOG PS 0 - 1

          -  Life expectancy greater than 3 months at the time of recruitment

          -  At least one measurable tumour lesion with target lesion size ≥ 1.0 cm as measured by
             CT

          -  Negative blood pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential (within 10 days
             prior to first drug administration)

          -  For women who are of child-bearing potential (see definition below) agreement to
             remain abstinent or use single or combined contraceptive methods with a failure rate
             of &lt; 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least three months after the
             last dose of MTL-CEBPA or four months after the last dose of pembrolizumab, whichever
             is longer.

          -  Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include
             bilateral tubal occlusion, male sterilization, hormone implants, established/proper
             use of combined oral or injected hormonal contraceptives and certain intrauterine
             devices. Alternatively, two methods (e.g., two barrier methods such as a condom and a
             cervical cap) may be combined to achieve a failure rate &lt; 1% per year. Barrier methods
             must always be supplemented with the use of a spermicide.

          -  Male participants with partners of child-bearing potential are required to use barrier
             contraception plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a
             failure rate of &lt; 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least three
             months after the last dose of MTL-CEBPA or four months after the last dose of
             pembrolizumab, whichever is longer. Male participants will also be advised to abstain
             from sexual intercourse with pregnant or lactating women, or to use condoms.

          -  Abstinence is only acceptable if it is line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
             the participant. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
             post-ovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the duration of exposure to
             IMP, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

          -  Note: a woman is considered of child-bearing potential following menarche and until
             becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent methods of
             sterilization include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral
             oophorectomy. A post-menopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an
             alternative medical cause.

          -  Able to comply with all the requirements of the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who received investigational drug(s) including vaccines within the last 30

             detectable HCV RNA via qualitative nucleic acid testing)

          -  Patients with central nervous system (CNS) or peritoneal metastasis

          -  Patients presenting with a marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval defined as
             repeated demonstration of a QTc interval≥ 450ms (males) and ≥ 460ms (females) using
             Fridericia's correction formula.
