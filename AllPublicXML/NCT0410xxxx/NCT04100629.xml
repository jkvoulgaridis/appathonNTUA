      Brief Description of the Study: Text messages will be sent to participants and responses will
      be surveyed to ascertain if using a social, digital intervention can influence NLNs' (newly
      licensed nurses') stress, resiliency, perceived sense of social support, and/or the intention
      to stay at current jobs. Newly licensed nurses (within their first year of hire) will be
      asked to participate. A series of four text messages will be sent to all study participants
      (experimental and control groups) by the PI every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday (M,
      W, F, S) at 1pm for six weeks, for a total of 24 different texts for each group. Participants
      will fill out surveys before the study begins, at week 3 and at the end of the study (week
      6).The control group will receive medical facts. Texts sent to the experimental group will be
      based on SSBC nurturant support messages and are intended to decrease stress intention to
      leave (ITL), increase resilience, and perceived sense of support. The SSBC nurturant support
      texts are comprised of three themes of support: emotional, network, and esteem. The
      experimental group's supportive text messages were created by the PI and require content
      validation. A gatekeeper at your facility will be asked to send an email to &quot;Experts&quot; (MSN
      educators) and ask them to complete the validation survey using a Qualtrics Survey Platform
      then the PI will place ratings into a table and calculate the results. There are 3 other
      facilities enrolled in this study: University California, San Diego, El Centro Medical
      Center, and Pioneer Hospital (all located in southern California).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized control study (RCT) is to determine the impact of a 6-week
      digital support intervention (text messaging) on NLNs' levels of stress, resiliency,
      perceived social support, and ITL (intention to leave) their current jobs. The long-term
      objective is to examine if a 6-week digital support intervention impacts NLNs' (newly
      licensed nurses') ITL during the first year of hire. The central hypothesis is that a digital
      support intervention plays a critical role in NLNs' levels of stress, resilience, perceived
      sense of social support, and ITL their current jobs. In order to be included in this proposed
      study, participants must agree to not use their Smartphones while providing direct patient
      care but may access text messages while in designated break areas or when off duty.

      Research Questions: RQ1: What is the effect of a digital support intervention upon NLNs'
      stress? RQ2: What is the effect of a digital support intervention upon NLNs' resiliency? RQ3:
      What is the effect of a digital support intervention upon NLNs' perceived social support?
      RQ4: What is the effect of a digital support intervention upon NLNs' ITL their first jobs
      during their first year of hire?

      Design (Description of research plan, intervention(s) and time frame): A prospective, RCT
      design with an experimental and control group is proposed for this study to determine if a
      digital support intervention impacts NLNs' stress, resiliency, perceived sense of support,
      and Intention to Leave.

    <masking_description>participants' unique numeric identifiers will be separated into two groups by the random generator with the exception of male participants. To enhance similarity among the control and experimental groups, male participants will be evenly distributed between groups (every other male, in sequential order of data collection, will be placed into each group) and not randomized (Polit &amp; Beck, 2017).</masking_description>

    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) will be used to measure stress (Cohen, Kamarck, &amp; Mermelstein, 1983). Participant stress will measured prior to intervention, at 3 weeks, and 6 weeks. It is a 10-item, Likert-type scale with five points. Scores are obtained by using the item responses that range from 0 to 4 (0 = never, 1 = almost never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = fairly often, 4 = very often) with items 4, 5, 7, and 8 reversely scored. The summed scores of the PSS will be used for one of the dependent variables and will be discussed further as a key variable. Participants will be asked to think about their current work situation when answering survey questions. The possible range of scores, after adding all points, will range from 0 to 40, with higher scores signifying greater perceived stress.</description>

    <description>The Connor-Davidson Resiliency Scale (CD-RISC-25) will be used to measure resiliency (Connor &amp; Davidson, 2003). Participant resilience will measured prior to intervention, at 3 weeks, and 6 weeks. The CD-RISC-25 is a 25-item self-report scale that uses a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (not true at all) to 4 (true nearly all the time). Total scores, ranging from 0-100, assess resilience and a score of 100 denotes the highest level of resiliency; the tool takes 5-10 minutes to complete (CD RISC, 2011). The summed scores of the CD-RISC 25 will be used for one of the dependent variables and will be discussed further as a key variable.</description>

    <description>The Social Support Scale (SSS) will be used to measure perceived social support scores (Dolbier &amp; Steinhardt, 2000). Participant perceived social support will measured prior to intervention, at 3 weeks, and 6 weeks. Respondents answer 21 items on a 4-option Likert-type scale labeled between 0 (not true at all) to 3 (completely true) (Dolbier &amp; Steinhardt, 2000) and will take 20-25 minutes to complete (Versta, 2011). The summed scores of the SSS will be used for one of the dependent variables and will be discussed further as a key variable.</description>

    <description>In this study, the text messages are intended to be one-directional, from the PI to the participant. Participants are not expected to reply. If participants reply to any of the text messages, the PI will screen the content and only reply if it is a question regarding the study or a request to seek counseling. Additionally, participants will be instructed by the PI to access their Smartphones to read texts while on a break, after their shift, or when not at work; participants will be instructed to not use Smartphones to read texts while working. A series of four text messages will be sent to all study participants (experimental and control groups) by the PI every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday (M, W, F, S) at 1pm for six weeks, for a total of 24 different texts for each group.</description>
