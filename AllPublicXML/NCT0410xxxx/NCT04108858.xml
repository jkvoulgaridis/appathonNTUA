    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of copanlisib when given
      together with trastuzumab and pertuzumab and to see how well they work after induction
      treatment in treating patients with HER2 positive stage IV breast cancer with PIK3CA or PTEN
      mutation. Copanlisib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Trastuzumab is a form of &quot;targeted therapy&quot; because it works by
      attaching itself to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as
      HER2 receptors. When trastuzumab attaches to HER2 receptors, the signals that tell the cells
      to grow are blocked and the cancer cell may be marked for destruction by the body's immune
      system. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pertuzumab, may kill tumor cells that are left after
      chemotherapy. The addition of copanlisib to the usual treatment (trastuzumab and pertuzumab)
      could shrink the cancer or stabilize it for longer duration as compared to the usual
      treatment alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination of
      copanlisib, trastuzumab and pertuzumab in patients with metastatic epidermal growth factor
      receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. (Phase Ib) II. To assess the benefit of adding
      copanlisib to trastuzumab and pertuzumab in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients
      with PIK3CA mutations or PTEN mutation receiving maintenance therapy after induction
      treatment, as measured by progression free survival (PFS). (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the benefit of adding copanlisib to trastuzumab and pertuzumab in HER2-positive
      metastatic breast cancer patients with PIK3CA mutations or PTEN mutation receiving
      maintenance therapy after induction treatment, as measured by overall survival (OS). (Phase
      II) II. To evaluate the safety of copanlisib given at the RP2D in combination with
      trastuzumab and pertuzumab. (Phase II)

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate PFS and OS of the patients who receive the triplet combination with:

      Ia. The number of induction cycles. Ib. Hormone receptor status (estrogen receptor [ER] and
      progesterone receptor [PR]).

      Ic. PTEN loss. Id. PIK3CA mutations or PTEN mutations. (Phase Ib)

      II. To assess PTEN immunohistochemistry (IHC), Ki-67 IHC and cleaved caspase-3 IHC and to
      perform molecular profiling assays on malignant and normal tissues, including, but not
      limited to, whole exome sequencing (WES) and messenger ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing
      (RNAseq), in order to:

      IIa. Identify potential predictive and prognostic biomarkers associated with treatment
      outcomes (PFS and OS) with the addition of copanlisib to dual HER2-targeted treatment.

      IIb. Identify resistance mechanisms using genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)- and RNA-based
      assessment platforms.

      III. To contribute genetic analysis data from de-identified biospecimens to Genomic Data
      Commons (GDC), a well annotated cancer molecular and clinical data repository, for current
      and future research; specimens will be annotated with key clinical data, including
      presentation, diagnosis, staging, summary treatment, and if possible, outcome.

      IV. To bank formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, blood (for cell-free DNA
      analysis), and nucleic acids obtained from patients at the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical
      Trials Network (ETCTN) Biorepository at Nationwide Children's Hospital.

      OUTLINE:

      PHASE I: Patients receive copanlisib intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 8.
      Patients also receive trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes and pertuzumab IV over 30-60 minutes
      on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive copanlisib IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 8. Patients also receive
      trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes and pertuzumab IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Cycles
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes and pertuzumab IV over 30-60
      minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days and at 3 months.

             months before starting therapy

          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) with the following exceptions: alopecia
             (any grade is acceptable); neuropathy must have resolved to =&lt; grade 2. Congestive
             heart failure (CHF) due to prior anti-cancer therapy must have been =&lt; grade 1 in
             severity at the time of occurrence, and must have resolved completely

          -  Current uncontrolled hypertension (&gt;= 150/90)

          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer

          -  Has a known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial

          -  Patients with uncontrolled type I or II diabetes mellitus (DM); uncontrolled DM is
             defined as glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) &gt; 8.5% and a fasting blood glucose of &gt; 120
             mg/dL within 14 days prior to trial entry

          -  Immunosuppressive therapy is not allowed while on study

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Patients with leptomeningeal disease or active untreated brain metastases

          -  Prior exposure to any PI3K, AKT or mTOR inhibitors. History of allergic reactions
             attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to copanlisib,
             PI3K inhibitors, or HER2 inhibitors

          -  Copanlisib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Therefore, the concomitant use of
             strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin,
             ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir), and strong inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g.
             rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John's wort) are not permitted
             from 14 days prior to enrollment until the end of the study. Other medications that
             are prohibited while on copanlisib treatment:

               -  Herbal medications/preparations (except for vitamins)

               -  Anti-arrhythmic therapy other than beta blockers or digoxin

               -  Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to
                  regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference for a list of drugs to
                  avoid or minimize use of. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures,
                  the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and
                  what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is
                  considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product

          -  Systemic corticosteroid therapy at a daily dose higher than 15 mg prednisone or
             equivalent is not permitted while on study. Previous corticosteroid therapy must be
             stopped or reduced to the allowed dose at least 7 days prior to the computed
             tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) screening. If a patient is on chronic
             corticosteroid therapy, corticosteroids should be de-escalated to the maximum allowed
             dose before the screening. Patients may be using topical or inhaled corticosteroids

          -  Patients with non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because copanlisib is a PI3K inhibitor
             agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with copanlisib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with copanlisib. These potential risks may also apply to other
             agents used in this study

          -  Patients are eligible to receive standard of care therapy that would confer clinical
             benefit to the patient
