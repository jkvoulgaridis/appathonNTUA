  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the role of extracellular part of insulin regulated
      aminopeptidase (IRAPe), IL-34, Irisin, and Visfatin in the development of insulin resistance
      in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Methods: parallel study enrolled 60 non-diabetic control subjects and 60 newly-diagnosed type
      2 diabetics, matched for age, body mass index and sex ratio.

      Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the role of extracellular part of insulin regulated
      aminopeptidase (IRAPe), IL-34, Irisin, and Visfatin in the development of insulin resistance
      in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Methods: parallel study enrolled 60 non-diabetic control subjects and 60 newly-diagnosed type
      2 diabetics, matched for age, body mass index and sex ratio. Anthropometric parameters, blood
      glucose, fasting plasma insulin, insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), IL34, Irisin, IRAPe,
      Visfatin and glycated hemoglobin were assessed.

      Conclusion: IL-34 and Visfatin levels were significantly increased, while both Irisin and
      IRAPe levels were significantly decreased in patients with type 2 diabetes. Theses
      aforementioned parameters were significantly correlated with insulin resistance. These
      findings indicate that, IL-34, Irisin and IRAPe may play a vital role in T2DM and in diabetes
      associated insulin resistance. Additionally, the investigator's findings proposed that, IRAPe
      may be a useful and direct marker for detection of insulin resistance state.

        Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were diagnosed according to the criteria of the
        World Health Organization. All individuals included in this study were adult Middle-Eastern
        Egyptian citizens and were subjected to full medical history and physical examination by
        hospital physicians.
