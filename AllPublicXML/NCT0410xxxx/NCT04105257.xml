  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When a patient is received with the context of acute stroke, they undergo a fast neurological
      evaluation and obtain a basic appraisal composed of a non-contrast endovascular cerebral scan
      and an angiography scan of intracranial blood vessels and the neck. Once the structural
      lesion (hemorrhage, tumor, etc.) is absent, signs of early infracts and confirmed acute
      intracranial arterial occlusion, the possibility of a pseudo-stroke dwells in the
      differential diagnostic.

      Certain characteristics of history and clinical evaluation create sufficient doubt to evoke
      the possibility of a pseudo-stroke. In fact, this population is mostly female and the
      cardiovascular risk factors are less prevalent in this group than for the group of stroke
      victims. It is on average the youngest and presents a less severe deficit. For the rest,
      medical antecedents often help to evoke a diagnosis of pseudo-stroke.

      With this study, the investigators wish to evaluate the diagnostic value of two additional
      radiological examinations:

        1. Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging to evaluate blood flow in the brain;

        2. Imaging by magnetic resonance (MRI) of the brain to detect lesions from a cerebral
           vascular accident (stroke) not visible on standard imaging of the brain.

      The proposed additional examinations (CTP and MRI) are tests that are currently used at the
      CHUM. Those are not experimental tests. These tests are commonly used when doctors wants a
      further investigation to clarify the cause of the neurological symptoms. These tests are
      usually done in a semi-urgent or non-urgent situations. In the present study they will be
      done urgently. The investigators wish to determine if obtaining these additional tests in
      emergency will change the decision of whether to administer the drug (thrombolysis). The
      investigators want to determine whether one imaging test is sufficient or if both exams are
      needed to help clinical decision-making. Please note that urgent access to perfusion CT and
      brain MRI is not considered routine care, since the value of these additional tests has yet
      to be demonstrated.
