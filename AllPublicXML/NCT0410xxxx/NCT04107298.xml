Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. Each level corresponds to 1-digit number expressing the level selected for that dimension.

These responses are ranked on a scale of 0 to 4, (0=unable to do, 4=no difficulty). Subscale scores are determined by dividing the weighted answers by the maximum possible weighted score and multiplying by 100. Each score ranges from 0-100 with lower scores indicating lower performance. The overall score is the average of all 3 subscores.</description>

VascuQol is an instrument in which the participant is asked about their concerns, abilities, and activities. Overall values can range from 6 to 24, with a higher total sum representing better participant health.</description>

        Angiographic Inclusion Criteria

          -  The target lesion/vessel must meet all of the following angiographic criteria for the
             subject to participate in the trial:

          -  De novo lesion(s) or non-stented restenotic lesion

          -  Target lesion location starts at the P3 segment and terminates at 1cm above the ankle.
             Note: Isolated P3 lesion is not allowed. If a lesion starts in the P3 segment, it must
             continue into the infrapopliteal.

             crossing of target lesion. Successful crossing of the target lesion occurs when the
             tip of the guide wire is distal to the target lesion. Use of re-entry/crossing devices
             is not allowed. Crossing may be performed retrograde, but treatment must be performed
             antegrade.

             estimate. A maximum of two lesions may be treated. The two lesions may be in one
             infrapopliteal vessel or in two distinct infrapopliteal vessels. Note: Tandem lesions
             may be considered a single lesion if they are separated by ≤30 mm.

          -  After pre-dilatation, the target lesion has ≤70% residual stenosis, absence of a flow
             limiting dissection (Grade D or greater) and treatable with available device matrix.

          -  A patent inflow artery free from significant stenosis (≥50% stenosis) as confirmed by
             angiography.

          -  At least one patent native outflow artery to the ankle or foot distal to the lesion
             being treated, free from significant stenosis (≥50% stenosis) as confirmed by
             angiography.

          -  Significant stenosis (≥ 50%) in inflow lesion or occlusion in the ipsilateral iliac,
             SFA, popliteal arteries left untreated.

          -  Target lesion requires treatment with alternative therapy such as stenting, laser,
             atherectomy, cryoplasty, brachytherapy, or re-entry devices.

          -  Significant target vessel tortuosity or other parameters prohibiting access to the
             target lesion.

          -  Presence of thrombus in the target vessel.
