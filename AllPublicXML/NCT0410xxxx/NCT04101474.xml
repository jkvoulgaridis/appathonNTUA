  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we will assess the effect of Ketamine infusion on depressive symptoms and in
      particular its effect on Suicidal behavior, ideation and thoughts in patients with treatment-
      resistant MDD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A Twice repetition of IV infusion of 0.5 mg/kg of ketamine produces an antidepressant
      response in individuals with treatment-resistant MDD

      The work aims to:

        1. To assess the onset of action and degree of improvement and the duration of
           antidepressant effect of ketamine in a sample of patients with treatment -resistant
           major depressive disorder.

        2. To find out whether the onset of Ketamine antidepressant effect is associated with an
           improvement of suicidality in those patients.
