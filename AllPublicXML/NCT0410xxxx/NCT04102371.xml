      The objectives of this study are to compare the effectiveness and relative safety of NS
      versus LR for crystalloid resuscitation of children with septic shock in a multicenter
      Vanguard-phase pragmatic randomized trial.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 5,000 children die from septic shock each year in the United States (US);
      thousands more die worldwide. Most children admitted with sepsis receive initial
      resuscitation in an emergency department (ED), where septic shock remains one of the most
      critical of illnesses treated by ED clinicians. Sepsis is also the most expensive hospital
      condition in the US, and the most common cause of pediatric multiple organ dysfunction
      syndrome (MODS). While all crystalloid fluids help to reverse shock, the most effective and
      safest type of crystalloid fluid resuscitation is unknown.

      Crystalloid fluids can be categorized as non-buffered (most commonly 0.9% normal saline [NS])
      or buffered/balanced fluids (BF). In the US, the most common BF is lactated Ringer's (LR),
      but other examples include Hartmann's solution and PlasmaLyte. NS and LR are inexpensive,
      stable at room temperature, and nearly universally available with identical storage volumes
      and dosing strategies. Notably, both are also of proven clinical benefit in septic shock and
      have extensive clinical experience for use in fluid resuscitation of critically ill patients.
      However, despite data suggesting that LR resuscitation may have superior efficacy and safety,
      NS remains the most commonly used fluid largely based on historical precedent.

      To definitively test the comparative effectiveness of NS and LR, a well-powered randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) is necessary. A large pragmatic randomized trial embedded within
      everyday clinical practice provides a cost-efficient and generalizable approach to inform
      clinicians about best comparative effectiveness of common therapies. Data from a prior
      single-center feasibility study demonstrated that a pragmatic randomized clinical trial of NS
      versus LR for children with septic shock presenting to an emergency department is feasible
      and can be successfully carried out by embedding simple study procedures within routine
      clinical practice. These pilot data informed the current two-center Vanguard-phase study that
      will now test for differential clinical effects, as part of a definitive comparative
      effectiveness trial, of NS versus LR for crystalloid resuscitation of pediatric septic shock.

      This Vanguard phase trial will include enrollment and study procedures at two sites to ensure
      that key elements of the trial are perfected prior to enrollment at additional sites as part
      of a planned larger multicenter study planned through the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied
      Research Network (PECARN).
