        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects age 18 and older with a confirmed clinical diagnosis of

          -  Females of child bearing potential and male subjects who are engaging in sexual
             activity that could lead to pregnancy agree to follow the specified contraceptive
             guidance throughout the study

          -  Capable of giving informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of segmental vitiligo

          -  Subjects with concurrent conditions or history of other diseases (e.g., current or
             chronic history of liver disease) that could affect the safety of the subject or the
             implementation of this study

          -  Use of any prohibited medication within the indicated period before the first dose of
             study drug

          -  Pregnant or lactating females

          -  Ultraviolet (UV) light therapy or prolonged exposure to natural or artificial sources
             of UV radiation within 8 weeks prior to the Baseline visit and/or plans to have such
             exposures during the study which could potentially impact the subject's vitiligo

          -  The subject has received an investigational product within the following time period
             prior to the first dosing day: 4 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer).

          -  Evidence of significant hepatic, renal, respiratory, endocrine, hematologic,
             neurologic, psychiatric, or cardiovascular (CV) system abnormalities or laboratory
             test value abnormality that will affect the health of the subject or interfere with
             interpretation of the results

          -  History of sensitivity to the study drug, or components thereof or a history of drug
             or other allergy that contraindicates the subject's participation in the study;
