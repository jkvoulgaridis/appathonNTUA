      Infection is a catastrophic and one of the most dreaded complications in orthopaedic surgery.
      Several measures have been undertaken to reduce the risk of infection, one of which is the
      use of systemic prophylactic antibiotics.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of multiple instrumentation regarding
      bacterial contamination in transportal and transtibial techniques in ACL reconstruction .
      About Sixty consecutive patients having surgical indication for ACL-R will be included, the
      cases will be divided into two groups, about thirty cases will undergo for the transtibial
      technique and the other thirty cases will undergo for the transportal technique. After
      preparation, swabs will be obtained from subcutaneous tissue at antromedial portal track in
      transportal technique (femoral tunnel drilling) and in transtibial technique before and after
      the instrumentation and femoral screw insertion, a control sample will be taken at
      antrolateral track in both techniques, then samples will be sended to the lab to be studied.
