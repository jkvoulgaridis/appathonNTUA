    <textblock>
      Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is an important event in
      the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Compound sodium chlolate and
      aminophylline tablets are one of the most widely used drugs for the treatment of bronchial
      asthma and chronic bronchitis.

      Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is an unignorable event
      in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is crucial to seek for
      effective management strategy. Compound sodium chlolate and aminophylline tablets are one of
      the most widely used drugs for the treatment of bronchial asthma and chronic bronchitis.
      Compared with the local bronchodilator recommended by the guidelines, it has the advantages
      of convenient use and good patient compliance. For the purpose of optimize the management of
      acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and provide more convenient
      options, we compared the efficacy of combined compound sodium chlolate and aminophylline
      tablets with nebulized ipratropium bromide inhalation plus systemic glucocorticoids in the
      treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ranging from moderate degree to severe
      degree. We hope this research would benefit patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary,
      especially those in the grassroots.
