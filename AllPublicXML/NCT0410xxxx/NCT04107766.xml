      This is a multicenter, observational registry that follows patients for a total of 5 years
      from the date of the first liver ablation procedure with the NEUWAVE Microwave Ablation
      System. The data gathered from participating sites will be available to be analyzed to
      develop ablation parameter guidance for ablation approaches under varying patient liver
      tissue conditions and liver lesions.

      This is an &quot;umbrella registry,&quot; which was included as an optional component in other NEUWAVE
      studies; hence, data from consenting patients who are or will be enrolled in other NEUWAVE
      soft tissue liver lesion ablation studies will be included in this registry. All other
      patients will be enrolled and followed prospectively, enrolled retrospectively with
      prospective, longitudinal follow up, or enrolled retrospectively with all retrospective
      follow up.

      Enrollment for this study will include at least 1,500 patients throughout the world who
      underwent or are undergoing microwave ablation of one or more soft tissue liver lesions using
      the NEUWAVE Microwave Ablation System or the NEUWAVE Microwave Ablation System with Ablation
      Confirmation.
