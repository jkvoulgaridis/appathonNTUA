  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to help understand how well new combinations of immunosuppressive medications
      (medications that weaken your immune system to prevent your body from rejecting the
      transplanted liver) work compared to standard immunosuppressive medications after your liver
      transplant. Also the study will assess how safe the new combination of immunosuppressive
      medicines are and if there are any changes in how your kidneys work after taking these
      medicines.

      A single center, open label, randomized, prospective, pilot study of induction and
      maintenance immunosuppression in adult subjects &gt;18 years undergoing orthotopic liver
      transplantation (OLT) with Basiliximab, delayed dose tacrolimus plus mycophenolate mofetil
      and standard of care (SOC) corticosteroids (Group 1) versus basiliximab, delayed dose
      tacrolimus plus mycophenolate mofetil, SOC corticosteroids, with addition of delayed
      maintenance Everolimus at one month post OLT with subsequent mycophenolate mofetil
      minimization (Group 2) versus standard dose tacrolimus plus mycophenolate mofetil plus SOC
      corticosteroids (Group 3; control) with concomitant renal dysfunction prior to OLT.
