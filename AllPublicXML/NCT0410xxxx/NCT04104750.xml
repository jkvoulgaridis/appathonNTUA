  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present observational study is to evaluate and describe the evolution over
      time of the fatigue and the quality of life of patients with bone tumor, in Rizzoli
      Orthopedic Institute, Chemotherapy ward, during the chemotherapy treatment and in the first
      phase of follow-up and to identify possible prognostic factors. Such knowledge is a necessary
      precondition for identifying patients and the periods most at risk due to the onset of
      fatigue, so as to be able to hypothesize adequate containment strategies.

    <textblock>
      Fatigue syndrome It is a clinical condition, linked to the oncological pathology, extremely
      widespread and in patients undergoing chemotherapy and / or radiotherapy it is common in 80%
      of patients. Literature stress the need for systematic studies in cancer populations with
      different types of cancer and at different stages of the disease using patient-oriented
      fatigue assessment tools. The Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) is one of the scales used
      precisely in the evaluation of this syndrome and has proved to be a reliable and easy to use
      tool, also validated in Italian. Several authors have also shown that reduced physical
      activity and a worse quality of life are associated with fatigue, particularly in young
      patients.Several authors describe the experience of 11 new sarcoma patients undergoing
      chemotherapy treatment. Fatigue had been described as the prevalent symptom and was related
      to a worse quality of life.

    <description>the patient's Fatigue will be measured during the treatment period with antiblastic drugs and part of the followup period. To this end the BFI scale validated in Italian will be used (Mendoza et al 1999; Catania et al, 2013) which includes 9 items with a score for each of 0 to 10 and a consequent total score from 0 to 90. The measurement will take place in 4 times: the day of enrollment, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months after enrollment.the quality of life of patients measured by the EORTC QLQ C-30 scale (Aaronson et al, 1993) and the level of autonomy measured by the TESS scale (Davis et al, 1996) in 4 steps: the enrollment day , at 6 months, at 12 months and at 24 months from enrollment.</description>

        all patients belonging to the Chemotherapy ward will be recruited consecutively for a new
        antiblastic treatment protocol. The process of informing and collecting the participants'
        consent will take place during the first admission in which intravenous administration of
        the chemotherapy will be started
