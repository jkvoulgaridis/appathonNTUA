  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, with two parallel branches whose objective is
      to evaluate the efficacy of the product investigated on blood pressure and fat mass of
      subjects without pharmacotherapy.

    <textblock>
      The subjects that meet the selection criteria will make a total of five visits to the
      research laboratory and will carry out the pre-established tests in the protocol.
      Subsequently, a statistical analysis will be carried out with the variables measured in the
      study to obtain results.
