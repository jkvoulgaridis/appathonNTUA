      Substitution models, sensitivity analyses, subgroup analyses and multiple linear regression
      analyses will be conducted to specifically estimate the hazard ratios and 95% confidence
      intervals of mortality and MetS associated with egg and cholesterol consumption.

        The CHNS is a nationwide cohort survey in China, which was established as a joint project
        of the University of North Carolina at Chapel and the China Center for Disease Control and
        Prevention (CCDC).This national-wide survey adopted a novel measure from multiple
        dimensions, which helped to understand how the long-term social and economic changes
        affected nutrition and health-related outcomes of Chinese. Until now, 10 rounds of survey
        (1989, 1991, 1993, 1997, 2000, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2011 and 2015) have been conducted.
