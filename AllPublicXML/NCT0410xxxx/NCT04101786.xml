  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Groin injuries present a major problem in sports due to its high frequency, long-lasting
      symptoms and high risk of re-injury. The most common groin injury is the adductor strain
      (around two thirds of all groin injuries), while the biggest risk factors are previous injury
      and lower hip adductors strength. The purpose of this study is to present and biomechanically
      evaluate several new strengthening exercises targeting hip adductors. Exercises will be
      performed with the use of our novelty device, which enables eccentric strengthening of the
      hip adductors in different hip and knee positions. We hypothesize that performing modified
      hip adductors exercises using the novelty device could enable participants to perform hip
      adduction throughout larger ROM during eccentric contractions, while changing hip and/or knee
      angle will differently affect muscle activity and produced joint torques. The latter could be
      helpful for preventive or rehabilitative training for hip adductors strain injuries, in which
      therapists want to target specific hip adductor muscle.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following the general warm-up (light aerobic activity, dynamic stretching exercises and
      bodyweight strength exercises), the electromyographic (EMG) sensors and kinematic markers
      will be attached to the participant, who will then perform the maximal voluntary contractions
      for the purpose of EMG normalization. Then the participant will perform new hip adductor
      exercises using the novelty device, which enables hip adduction eccentric contractions in
      different hip and knee positions. The latter is important when trying to target specific hip
      adductor muscle, since different hip and/or knee angles differently affect individual muscle
      activity and joint torques. Exercises will be performed in randomized order, while the EMG
      and kinematic signals will be synchronously captured. EMG muscle activity and joint torques,
      produced during the exercises, will be analysed. Descriptive statistics will be calculated
      and reported as mean ± standard deviation. Shapiro-Wilk test will be used for testing of
      normality and Levene's test for equality of variances. Differences among corresponding
      variables will be obtained from different exercises and tested with the analysis of the
      variance for repeated measurements. For pair-wise comparisons, paired 2-tailed post-hoc
      t-tests with Bonferroni's correction will be used. The level of statistical significance will
      be set at p &lt; 0.05.
