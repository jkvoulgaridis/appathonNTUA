      This is a two phase study, The first phase (phase 1) will identify potential biomarkers among
      asbestos exposed individuals with pleural mesothelioma. The second phase (phase 2), is a
      double blinded case-matched controlled study to determine the predictive capability,
      sensitivity, and specificity of these biomarkers in detecting early stage pleural
      mesothelioma. Biomarkers in the form of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in exhaled breath
      samples from subjects with either pleural mesothelioma or pleural plaques, will be evaluated.
      A biomarker present in serum will also be concurrently evaluated in the same cohort. The
      soluble serum biomarker mesothelin related peptides (SMRP), which has been posited as a
      biomarker for mesothelioma, will be analyzed for its relationship to the breath VOC profile.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mesothelioma is a rare, aggressive and treatment-resistant disease and, in the United States,
      is caused almost exclusively by exposure to asbestos fibers. There is often a lengthy latency
      period of 40-50 years between exposure and disease onset. The median age of diagnosis is 65
      years while the median survival time after diagnosis of pleural mesothelioma without
      treatment is 9 months. Symptoms, where present, may be non-specific, which further
      contributes to delayed diagnosis.

      In this study, the volatile organic compound (VOC) profile of exhaled breath from subjects
      with histologically confirmed mesothelioma will be compared against case-matched control
      subjects with bilateral pleural plaques or bilateral pleural thickening. Putative markers
      will then be tested against a blinded cohort to test predictive value of the markers.

      This study seeks to identify markers for mesothelioma using a non-invasive technique which
      samples volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the breath of test subjects (Owlstone Medical
      Ltd, Cambridge, England).

      A comparison of the participant's VOC profile will be made with an FDA-approved, serum-based
      assay (Lumipulse MesomarkÂ®, Fujirebio Diagnostics Inc., Malvern, PA) of the participant's
      soluble mesothelin related peptides (SMRP) to discern parameters of efficacy..
