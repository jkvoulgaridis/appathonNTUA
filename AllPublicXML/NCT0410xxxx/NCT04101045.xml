      The purpose of this study is to quantitate hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) in youth with
      poorly-controlled type 1 diabetes (T1D) (HbA1c &gt;8.5%), youth with T1D who achieve targeted
      glycemic control (HbA1c &lt;7.5%) and lean controls. Hypothesis: Youth with poor glycemic
      control experience higher fractional hepatic DNL during the fasting and the postprandial
      states than youth who achieve targeted glycemic control and lean controls.

      What is not known, is whether hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) contributes to dyslipidemia
      in this in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The aim of the study is to test the
      hypothesis that an enhanced rate of DNL largely contributes to dyslipidemia occurring in
      youth with poorly-controlled T1D. According to this hypothesis, youth with poorly-regulated
      T1D experience a state of persistent insulin independent, highly variable fluctuations of
      glucose, and other sugars, through the glycolytic pathway that result in an enhancement of
      hepatic DNL and an increased production of triglycerides (TG). Newly-formed TG are packaged
      into large-VLDL that are secreted into the circulation contributing to an increase in plasma
      TG. When the TG concentration in the hepatocytes exceeds the ability of the liver to secrete
      TG, the latter start accumulating leading to hepatic steatosis.

    <description>Each participant consumes a dinner scaled to his/her energy needs which is prepared by the metabolic kitchen. Dinner will be provided beforehand if patient does this portion at home. The participant consumes the first of three doses of D2O. Two additional doses of D20 are given at on day 1 and on day 2. The total D2O given (3 ml per kg of body water) is designed to raise body deuterium levels to 0.3% and is administered as described above to maintain steady state until the end of the study. At the HRU, an IV catheter will be inserted in order to collect blood to assess DNL. Blood draws begin during the fasting state to assess basal rates of DNL and then for six hours after the consumption of a glucose/fructose beverage (75g glucose and 25g fructose ) to assess postprandial rates of DNL. Blood draws will be taken 15 minutes before ingestion of the sugar beverage, then for every half hour for 6 hours.</description>
