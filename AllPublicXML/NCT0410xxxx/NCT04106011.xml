  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-cohort, prospective, observational study evaluating the effects of
      gabapentin on cognition. The goal of the study is to determine whether there is a measurable
      change in cognitive function from baseline in patients who are prescribed gabapentin for the
      treatment of neuropathic pain.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone (BTACT)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 weeks after treatment initiation</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of cognitive functioning that assesses multiple dimensions central for effective functioning across adulthood: episodic memory, working memory, reasoning, verbal fluency, and executive functioning.
Scoring:
Word List Recall - Immediate &amp; Delayed Total number unique is total number of correct responses (range 0-15)
Backward Digit Span Score is highest number of digits reached (range 0, 2-8)
Category Fluency Total number unique is total number of correct responses
Red/Green Accuracy Normal baseline score is total number correct in normal baseline condition (range 0-20) Number Series Total number of items correct (range 0-5)
Backward Counting Last number reached Total number of errors Total number of digits produced is calculated as: 100 - (number reached + number errors)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain severity - BPI</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 weeks after treatment initiation</time_frame>
    <description>Medical questionnaire used to measure pain, developed by the Pain Research Group of the WHO Collaborating Center for Symptom Evaluation in Cancer Care 0-10 pain severity scale, 0=no pain, 10=pain as bad as you can imagine (scoring-a mean severity score) 0-10 pain relief scale, 0%=no relief, 100%=complete relief (only one question) 0-10 pain interference scale, 0=does not interfere, 10=completely interferes (scoring-mean of 7 items)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Depression and Anxiety - HADS</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 weeks after treatment initiation</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of anxiety and depression in a general population of patients. Popular for clinical practice and research.
Score- 8-10 mild, 11-14 moderate, 15-21 severe (separate scores for anxiety and depression)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sleep Problems - SLP9</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 weeks after treatment initiation</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire to evaluate problems with sleep. Scale: 1=all of the time, 2=most of the time, 3=a good bit of the time, 4=some of the time, 5=a little of the time, 6=none of the time
Final scores range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating more sleep problems. To score the SPI II, you must first transform the responses of each item into a new score. For item 1, responses of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are scored as 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100, respectively. For items 3 and 9, ratings of 1 through 6 are scored as 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100, respectively. All of the other items are reverse-scored (lower ratings indicate more sleep difficulties) and so ratings of 1 through 6 for these items are scored as 100, 80, 60, 40, 20, and 0, respectively. The final SPI II score is an average of the item scores responded to.</description>
