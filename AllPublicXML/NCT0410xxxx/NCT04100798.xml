  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is defined as loss of periodontal attachment due to microbial associated host
      mediated inflammation. This would lead to the apical migration of the junctional epithelium
      allowing the bacterial biofilm to undergo apical widespread along the root surfaces of teeth
      causing bone resorption (Tonetti, Greenwell, &amp; Kornman, 2018).

      The main objective of periodontal surgeries is directed at complete preservation of the
      interdental soft tissues to achieve primary closure over the intraosseous defected sites
      during the early phases of wound healing. Evidence shows that surgical techniques are highly
      predictable in the treatment of pockets associated with deep and shallow intrabony defects
      affected majorly by the selected flap design. The purpose of the flap design of minimally
      invasive periodontal surgery is to overcome the drawbacks of conventional periodontal
      surgeries decreasing the surgical trauma, improving the clot stability, reducing patient
      discomfort post operatively and minimizing the surgical chair time (Aslan, Buduneli, &amp;
      Cortellini, 2017b) Modified Minimally Invasive Surgical Technique (M-MIST) is considered one
      of the latest minimally invasive techniques that have been used in the treatment of
      intraosseous defects, this technique however entails an incision over the defect-associated
      interdental papilla that may jeopardize the volume and complex vascular integrity of the
      interdental tissues, lacking the special flap design that would emphasis clot stability for
      better wound healing. Where a new surgical technique turned entire papilla preservation has
      been developed for protection of the wound without affecting the vascularity of the area.
      (Pierpaolo Cortellini &amp; Tonetti, 2015) This randomized clinical trial compared the clinical
      and radiographic efficacy of entire papilla preservation surgical technique (EPP) to Modified
      minimally invasive surgical technique (M-MIST) in the treatment of periodontal intraosseous
      defects in stage III periodontitis patients.

    <description>Gingival bleeding score will be performed through gentle probing of the orifice of the gingival crevice from all four surfaces of all teeth using UNC Periodontal probe.
Recorded as (+) if bleeding is present or (-) if bleeding is absent.
If bleeding occurs within 10 seconds a positive finding is recorded and the number of positive sites is recorded and then expressed as a percentage of the number of sites examined</description>

    <measure>Post-surgical patient satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Three questionnaires will be asked to determine patients' satisfaction with the outcome of surgery
Considering this was an elective operation, how likely would you be to recommend it to others?
If you had to make the decision again, how likely would you be to undergo this surgery'?
Considering everything, how satisfied are you with the outcome of your surgery
These questions could all be answered by the patient using a 7-point response scale where: Very Satisfied = 7; Not At All Satisfied = 1. (H. A. Kiyak et al., 1984)</description>
