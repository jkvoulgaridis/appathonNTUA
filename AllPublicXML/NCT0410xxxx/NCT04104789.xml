    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the study is to compare the success rates of pulpal anesthesia (defined
      as ability to complete the intended dental procedure without the need for rescue anesthesia)
      between Kovanaze nasal mist and Articaine needle anesthesia.

    <textblock>
      In June 2016, an intranasal delivery system of local anesthesia called Kovanaze, gained FDA
      approval. Kovanaze is available as a 0.2 ml metered spray and is intended to achieve pulpal
      anesthesia of 5 maxillary teeth on either side of the face.

      With the ability to avoid the traditional painful injection Kovanaze offers promise in the
      field of maxillary anesthesia and this study intends to:

        1. Compare Kovanaze to conventional needle anesthetic in adults

        2. Evaluate patient anxiety, tolerance and acceptability of Kovanaze in patients undergoing
           dental procedures
