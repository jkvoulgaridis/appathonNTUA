  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many stroke survivors experience aphasia, a loss or impairment of language affecting the
      production or understanding of speech. One common type of aphasia is known as non-fluent
      aphasia. Patients with non-fluent aphasia have difficulty formulating grammatical sentences,
      often producing short word fragments despite having a good understanding of what others are
      trying to communicate to them. Speech language pathologists (SLPs) play a central role
      rehabilitating persons with aphasia and administer therapy in an attempt to improve
      communication skills. Despite standard therapy, approximately 50% of individuals who
      experience aphasia acutely continue to have language deficits more than 6 months post-stroke.

      In most people, Broca's area is dominant in the left side of the brain. Following a
      left-sided stroke, the right-sided homologue of Broca's area (the pars triangularis), may
      adopt language function. Unfortunately, reorganizing language to the right side of the brain
      seems to be less effective than restoring function to the left hemisphere. Repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a form of non-invasive brain stimulation, can be
      used to suppress activity of specific regions in the right side of the brain to promote
      recovery of function in the perilesional area. Despite preliminary success in existing
      studies using rTMS in post-stroke aphasia, there is much work to be done to better understand
      the mechanisms underlying recovery. Responses to rTMS have been positive, yet heterogenous,
      which may be related to timing of treatments following stroke.

    <description>Participants receive 3.5 hours of intensive speech therapy in small groups delivered by a blinded speech language pathologist and therapy assistant. The objective of M-MAT is to improve word production through shaping of responses (ie. Gradually increasing complexity of spoken targets towards eventual mastery) and social-mediated repetitive practice. Therapists use game-based interactive tasks and rich multi-modal cueing (gestures, written words, drawing, reading words) to improve spoken production and oral communication.</description>
