  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Theoretically all surgeries below mid-humerus can be done under infraclavicular (IC) blocks.
      Following the introduction of ultrasonography (USG) to the clinical anesthesia, plexus and
      nerve blocks under the guidance of USG have gained wide acceptance for the high rates of
      block success, and low risk of complications (1). In this study, we aimed to evaluate the
      single injection and triple injection techniques in IC blocks with USG-guided medial
      approach, in terms of block success and the need for supplementary blocks. Our secondary
      goals are to compare the complication rates, sensory block durations, and to discuss the
      possible reasons for the failure of the blocks.

      Theoretically all surgeries below mid-humerus can be done under infraclavicular (IC) blocks.
      Following the introduction of ultrasonography (USG) to the clinical anesthesia, plexus and
      nerve blocks under the guidance of USG have gained wide acceptance for the high rates of
      block success, and low risk of complications. At the same time, it was also shown that
      USG-guided IC blocks can shorten procedural times and accelerate the onset of the blocks.

      Several methods for IC blocks have been described. Based on the anatomical knowledge, we
      hypothesized that in medial approaches the need for supplementary blocks would be low with
      single injections as well as triple injections. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the
      single injection and triple injection techniques in IC blocks with USG-guided medial
      approach, in terms of block success and the need for supplementary blocks. Our secondary
      goals are to compare the complication rates, sensory block durations, and to discuss the
      possible reasons for the failure of the blocks.

      Medical records of 139 patients scheduled for elective or emergent hand, wrist, forearm,
      elbow, and distal arm surgery were analyzed. Patients older than 14-years with ASA physical
      status I-III, who underwent surgery between October 2017 and March 2019 were retrospectively
      evaluated. Exclusion criteria included non-cooperative patients, refusal of the regional
      anesthesia, known neuropathy that could prevent the evaluation of the efficacy of the block,
      different technique used for infraclavicular brachial plexus blocks (lateral sagittal,
      coracoid, …etc.), and known allergy to local anesthetic drugs.
