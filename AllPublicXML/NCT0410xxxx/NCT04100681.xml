  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to ensure the pro-active collection of information on quality, safety and
      performance of FlowOx™ after it is placed on the market. The study will be carried out in a
      patient population with peripheral artery disease (claudicatio intermittens) to confirm its
      usefulness and in particular gather information for further improvements of the device
      related to this patient population. The data collected from the use of the CE-marked FlowOX™
      device are change of walking distance, quality of life, and the patient's compliance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A multi-center, randomized, sham (placebo)-controlled, double-blind trial to assess the
      efficacy and safety of FlowOx. This is done by comparing the increase in pain free walking
      distance compared to sham (placebo) device in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD)
      and intermittent claudication.

      This study is conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of FlowOx™ compared to a sham
      FlowOx™ (placebo) device treatment. FlowOx™ can provide intermittent negative pressure (up to
      - 40 mmHg INP [intermittent negative pressure]) which is known to improve blood flow. The
      same device will also work as a sham (placebo) device by less negative pressure exerted by
      the device (in the range of -10 mmHg).

      Daily home use of FlowOx™ for 2 hours (divided into minimum two sessions of 1 hour) per day
      in PAD-patients with intermittent claudication (stage II acc.to EMA, equivalent to Fontaine
      stage IIb in Germany) relative to sham (placebo) will be provided over a period of 12 weeks.

      This efficacy study is evaluating the clinical effects of INP on patient with intermittent
      claudication with special focus on changes in pain free walking distance and quality of life.

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life from baseline to week 12: EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The 5-level EQ-5D (EuroQol- 5 Dimension) version (EQ-5D-5L) essentially consists of the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS).
EQ-5D-5L describes the health condition of adults in 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems). Patient indicate their health states by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the 5 dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.
The EQ-VAS score is read on a scale of 0-100 points (scale name: health condition), depending on where the patient has set his mark. 0 points mean the worst possible health condition, while 100 points is the best health possible.</description>

    <measure>Change in activity of daily living from baseline to week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the activity of daily living the standardized questionnaire VascuQoL-6 is used which comprises a set of 6 questions. Each question is scored 1-4. The sum of each individual question score is used to generate a &quot;Total&quot; Score. A higher value indicates better health status.</description>
