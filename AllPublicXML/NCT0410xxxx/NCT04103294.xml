  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current dietary assessment methods rely on self-report food intake such as food frequency
      questionnaires, 24-hr dietary recall, or diet diaries, and the prevalence of misreporting
      with these tools is estimated at 30-88%.A reliable and convenient way to measure the quantity
      of cowpea consumed by an individual. The hope is to identify a novel set of dietary
      biomarkers that will measure cowpea consumption, be free from participant recall bias, and
      serve to quantify legume intake. A total of 40 subjects, 20 children (9-21 months) and 20
      pregnant women (&gt;18 yr) will consume 3 distinct daily intake dosages of cooked cowpeas with
      the daily intake increased every 5 days. Urine samples will be collected 3 times during each
      5-day period and blood spots will be collected during a washout period and at the end of the
      final 5-day period. Urine samples will undergo metabolite detection via ultra-performance
      liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in positive and negative ion mode. Peaks are
      quantified using area-under-the-curve (AUC) and each metabolite is quantified in terms of its
      median-scaled relative abundance for the metabolite across the entire data set. A repeated
      measures 2-way ANOVA will be used to compare cowpea metabolite abundances over time and with
      respect to variation in an individual baseline levels.

    <description>The study will look at the levels of cowpea metabolite in urine after 20 days of consuming a diet with different cowpeas. Comparing the level of metabolites in urine at the end of study with the start after the participant consumes no cowpea for 5 days after enrollment.</description>
