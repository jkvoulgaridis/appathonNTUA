  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This retrospective study is to determine if the use of PCR for detection and identification
      of pathogens in UTI along with antimicrobial susceptibility information, affords more
      efficacious treatment of UTI, as compared to traditional urine culture for patients served by
      House Call Physicians.

      The objective of this study is to determine if retrospective data will show that use of PCR
      for detection and identification of pathogens in UTI, and antimicrobial susceptibility
      information, affords more efficacious treatment of UTI, thereby reducing UTI-related
      morbidity and costs in a patient population that is served by House Call Physicians. House
      call physicians attend elderly and other adults patients who are suffering from illness or
      chronic conditions in the safety, privacy, and comfort of their home or assisted living
      location. In making house calls, physicians ease the burden and difficulty of these chronic
      patients from traveling to the doctor's office.

    <description>Examine retrospective data of a House Call Patient population to determine if use of PCR, compared with conventional urine culture, leads to a reduction in UTI-related morbidity, as measured by the composite variable number of emergency room/urgent care clinic visits plus the number of admissions to hospital within 30 days of an initial presentation for UTI.</description>

    <time_frame>18 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Examine retrospective data to determine if use of PCR, compared with conventional urine culture, leads to a reduction in UTI-related morbidity:
As measured by the number of emergency room visits within 30 days of an initial presentation for UTI.
As measured by the number of urgent care clinic visits within 30 days of an initial presentation for UTI.
As measured by the number of cases escalated from an urgent care clinic to an emergency room within 30 days of an initial presentation for UTI.
As measured by the number of admissions to hospital within 30 days of initial presentation for UTI.
As measured by the total hospital length of stay resulting from hospital admission within 30 days of initial presentation for UTI.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Identify the frequency of observed polymicrobial infections</measure>
    <time_frame>18 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Identify the frequency of observed polymicrobial infections (defined as two or more simultaneous bacterial infections), as determined by PCR testing, will be estimated for the population of patients with panel-confirmed UTIs.
Identify and compare the range and frequency of bacteria species detected by PCR or Traditional Culture within the population of patients.
Determine if use of PCR and pooled sensitivity provides a different number of options for antibiotic treatment.
Determine if specific bacteria are more commonly associated with hospital admissions.
Determine if specific bacteria are more commonly associated with longer length of hospital stay.</description>
