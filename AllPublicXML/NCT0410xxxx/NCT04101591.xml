  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study offers evaluation and treatment for patients with corneal or retinal diseases,
      such as corneal opacities or diabetic retinopathy. The protocol is not designed to test new
      treatments; rather, patients will receive current standard of care treatments. The purpose of
      the study is twofold: 1) to allow ophthalmologist at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH) to
      increase their knowledge of altered microenvironment in the corneal or retinal disorders and
      identify new pathways of possible research in this area; and 2) to establish a list of
      patients who may be qualified for new research as they are recruited. (Participants in this
      protocol will not be required to join a new study; the decision is dependent on the patients
      themselves.) Participants will be followed at least 3 months. Follow-up visits are scheduled
      according to the standard of care for the individual patient's ocular problems. Visual acuity
      and intraocular pressure will be checked at each visit, and some of the screening tests
      described above may be repeated to follow the progress of disease and evaluate the response
      to treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the protocol is to accumulate a cohort of patients with corneal or
      retinal diseases for possible participation in new CGMH clinical trials and epidemiological
      protocols. Also, by providing long-term follow-up and treatment for a variety of corneal or
      retinal disorders, the relevant specialists and basic scientists at CGMH will be better able
      to identify research hypotheses about these diseases in addition to maintaining their
      clinical skills. The availability of cohorts of patients with a spectrum of corneal or
      retinal disorders will be valuable for the training of fellows in external eye or intraocular
      diseases, an important mission of the CGMH. The ability to provide long-term follow-up and
      care will also facilitate referral efforts for new CGMH protocols.

      The corneal or retinal specialists at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital will be free to choose
      those ocular disorders that interest them. However, the total number of patients that can be
      enrolled in the protocol will be restricted. This protocol is not designed to test any new
      treatments. Any evaluations or treatment under this protocol will be based on the current
      standard of care for each corneal or retinal diseases.

      Participants in this patient evaluation and treatment protocol will be evaluated for
      potential eligibility in any new CGMH clinical trials or epidemiologic protocols as they are
      developed. If eligible, patients may be asked to participate in the new protocol. However,
      they will not be required to enter any protocol and their decision to participate will be
      entirely voluntary. No more than 200 patients will be accepted in this &quot;Evaluation and
      Treatment Protocol.&quot;

      Separated from the systemic circulation by a blood-aqueous barrier, the aqueous humor is
      secreted by the ciliary process (epithelium) of the ciliary body, and fills up the anterior
      and posterior chambers, with a total volume of 0.15 mL ~ 0.3mL. The major constituent if
      water (98.7ï¼…), with minimal amount chlorides, proteins, ascorbic acid, urea, and inorganic
      salts. The aqueous humor presents mild alkaline with a pH value of 7.3 ~ 7.5, while its
      specific gravity falls between 1.002 and 1.012. The functions of aqueous humor includes 1) to
      preserve the shape and integrity of the globe and to maintain the intraocular pressure within
      normal ranges; 2) to nourish the cornea, lens, and vitreous; 3) and to provide cellular or
      humoral immunity in case of intraocular inflammation or infection.
