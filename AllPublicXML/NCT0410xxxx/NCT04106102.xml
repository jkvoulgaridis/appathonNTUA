  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The usual management of Obsessive Compulsive Disorders is based on cognitive-behavioural
      psychotherapy, as well as the use of serotonergic antidepressants. Nevertheless, a
      significant proportion of patients (40% to 60%) are non-responders to these conventional
      therapies, and remain severely handicapped.

      transcranial Direct current stimulation (tDCS) has already proven its effectiveness, in
      addition to drug approaches, in various clinical settings, such as depression or
      acoustic-verbal hallucinations. This technic appears to be an extremely interesting
      alternative This is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique (application of a low intensity
      direct current (1 to 2 mA) between two electrodes positioned on the scalp) that allows the
      neural activity of different brain areas to be modulated simultaneously. It is a simple and
      inexpensive technique with excellent tolerance.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Presenting an obsessive-compulsive disorder according to the criteria of Diagnostic
             and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5, evolving for at least two years

          -  Of significant clinical intensity: Yale-Brown's obsession-compulsion scale ≥ 16/40
             continuously over the last 6 months. This criteria of persistent severity over the
             last 6 months will be explored by an in-depth clinical interview at the inclusion
             visit (Baseline BL)

          -  Resistant despite treatment with: 2 serotonergic antidepressants, each received for at
             least 8 weeks, at the maximum recommended or tolerated dosage AND behavioural and
             cognitive therapy for at least 6 months

          -  Drug treatment unchanged for at least 12 weeks

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with psychotic disorder, bipolar mood disorder, substance abuse or dependence
             (excluding tobacco)

          -  Patient at risk of suicide (score ≥ 2 on item 10 of the Montgomery-Åsberg depression
             rating scale)

          -  Contraindications to the practice of transcranial direct stimulation : history of
             cerebral pathology, intracranial hypertension, neurosurgery, cephalic metal implant,
             pacemaker

          -  Unbalanced epilepsy

          -  Previous use of transcranial direct stimulation (problem of maintaining the integrity
             of the blind procedure)

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding in progress, woman in a state of procreation without
             effective contraception (a urine pregnancy test will be performed)

          -  Scalp skin pathology
