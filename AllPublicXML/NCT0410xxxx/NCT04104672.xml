  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and clinical activity of AB680 in combination with AB122,
      nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in participants with advanced pancreatic cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dose escalation of AB680 in combination with AB122, nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine will be
      assessed in participants with advanced pancreatic cancer. In this dose escalation combination
      study, participants will receive escalating doses of AB680 in combination with AB122 at the
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine at standard doses in
      participants with advanced pancreatic cancer. AB680, AB122, nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine
      are all administered via iv infusion.

      Overall duration of treatment will depend on how well the treatment is tolerated. Treatment
      may continue until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity or other reasons specified in
      the protocol.

         10. Prior surgery that required general anesthesia or other major surgery as defined by
             the Investigator must be completed at least 4 weeks before investigational product
             administration

             hepatitis C qualitative ribonucleic acid [RNA; qualitative]), and human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and HIV-2 antibody at screening

             4 weeks (28 days) of initiation of investigational product

          2. Underlying medical conditions that, in the Investigator's or Sponsor's opinion, will
             make the administration of investigational product hazardous (eg, interstitial lung
             disease, active infections requiring antibiotics, recent hospitalization with
             unresolved symptoms

          3. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial

          4. Any active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease or history
             of a syndrome that required systemic steroids or immunosuppressive medications, except
             for vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy. Participants with asthma who require
             intermittent use of bronchodilators (such as albuterol) will not be excluded from this
             study

          5. Prior malignancy active within the previous year except for locally curable cancers
             that have been apparently cured, such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer,
             superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix, breast, or prostate
