  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study to explore whether two different treatment approaches, myofascial trigger point
      release and core stabilization exercises, both with and without additional paced breathing
      training, can help patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) and whether one of the two
      treatments is superior.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of myofascial trigger point
      release therapy compared to core stabilization exercises, both with and without additional
      paced breathing training, on patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP). The main focus is on
      changes in pain severity, anxiety and depression, heart rate variability, and use of
      analgesic medication. Outcomes are measured at baseline (pre-intervention), after ten
      treatments (post-intervention), at three- and at six-month follow-up.
