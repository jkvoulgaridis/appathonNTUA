  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent sexual minority males (ASMM) continue to account for a disproportionate number of
      HIV infections in the United States. Racial and ethnic minority populations are particularly
      affected. Increased HIV rates reflect sexual risk behaviors during early sexual experiences.
      Research suggests that initial sexual risk-taking occurs during adolescence among sexual
      minority males. Therefore, it is important for HIV prevention interventions to target
      adolescent sexual minority males. Targeting sexual minority males during adolescence will
      help them learn and establish healthy sexual behaviors early in their psychosexual
      development, which will have both immediate and long-term health benefits.To promote
      adolescent sexual minority males' critical examination of online media and decrease their
      sexual risk-taking, this study proposes an exploratory clinical trial to pilot test an online
      sexual health media literacy intervention that was developed during formative research for
      feasibility and acceptability. Overall, the proposed research has the potential to reach a
      wide audience of sexual minority males early in their sexual development, ultimately
      decreasing their sexual risk-taking and reducing the number of new HIV infections in this
      population.
