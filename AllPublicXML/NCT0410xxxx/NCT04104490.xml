  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is fatal with right heart failure due to raised
      pulmonary vascular pressure. Gut dysbiosis was identified in animals with pulmonary
      hypertension. Deidentified human samples will be tested for gut dysbiosis in PAH, circulating
      bacterial metabolites and markers of inflammation and gut leakiness. The gut microbiome and
      circulating metabolites, markers of inflammation and gut leakiness of PAH patients and
      healthy subjects will be compared in deidentified fecal samples and blood.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stool samples will be collected from people with no, mild-moderate or severe pulmonary
      arterial hypertension. Bacterial DNA will be extracted from the feces and sequenced by whole
      genome sequencing (shotgun sequencing). The DNA sequences will be used to identify the
      bacteria present in the feces, and to model the functions of the gut microbial community in
      each of the three groups. This will test for gut dysbiosis in pulmonary arterial hypertensive
      patients compared to healthy subjects. Gut dysbiosis is a condition where the gut bacterial
      communities are unbalanced and has been implicated in disease processes.

      In subjects recruited in the USA, blood samples will be tested for markers of gut leakiness
      and inflammation as well as gut bacterial metabolites found in the circulation.

    <description>This cohort will consist of patients with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.
This is defined as mean pulmonary arterial pressure 25 mm Hg or greater and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure 15 mmHg or less measured by right cardiac catheterization and a clinical diagnosis of severe disease.
Participants will be without signs of left heart disease, lung disease and or hypoxia, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension or pulmonary hypertension of unclear multifactorial mechanisms.
This is an observational study with no interventions.</description>

This is defined as mean pulmonary arterial pressure 25 mm Hg or greater and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure 15 mmHg or less measured by right cardiac catheterization and a clinical diagnosis of mild-moderate disease.
Participants will be without signs of left heart disease, lung disease and or hypoxia, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension or pulmonary hypertension of unclear multifactorial mechanisms.
This is an observational study with no interventions.</description>
