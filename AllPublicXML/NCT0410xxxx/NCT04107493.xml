  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective randomized study with a cross-over design. Mobi™ is a relatively new POC in the
      market and thus it is valuable to collect data from COPD patients using supplemental oxygen,
      and their use on Mobi™. The purpose of the present study is to compare Mobi™ with a
      continuous flow oxygen cylinder, with SpO2 as the primary endpoint.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a prospective, randomized, cross-over study design with participants serving as their own controls. A within- participants, repeated-measures design is used during 6MWT. Eligible participants will complete two 6MWTs: one with their usual portable oxygen cylinder, and one with Mobi™. All participants entered into the study will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the following order of device use:
Control device (portable oxygen cylinder) first; or
Study device (Mobi™, POC) first.</intervention_model_description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Informed consent obtained before any study-related activities. Study-related
             activities are any procedures that are carried out as part of the study, including
             activities to determine suitability for the study.

          2. Male or female, age ≥ 18 years at the time of signing informed consent.

          3. Diagnosed with COPD and currently in a stable state (at least 4 weeks since last
             exacerbation episode22).

          4. Current prescription for long-term oxygen therapy.

          5. Participants meet the criteria for pulse-dose portable oxygen delivery, defined as
             being mobile within the home and the qualifying blood gas study was performed at rest/
             awake or during exercise.

          6. Participants who can read and comprehend English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinically unstable, in the investigator's opinion, which might jeopardize the
             participant's safety or compliance with the protocol.

          2. Current oxygen therapy prescription for &gt;5 L/min continuous flow.

          3. Known or suspected contraindication for pulse-dose oxygen.

          4. Unable to complete 6MWTs, e.g., unstable angina and myocardial infarction during the
             previous month

          5. Female who is pregnant, breast-feeding, or intends to become pregnant, or is of
             child-bearing potential and not using an adequate contraceptive method (adequate
             contraceptive measure as required by local regulation or practice).
