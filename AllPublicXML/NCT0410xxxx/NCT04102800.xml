  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory study, the focus of which is to understand the nature of asthma
      exacerbations that occur despite open label benralizumab therapy in severe eosinophilic
      asthma.

    <textblock>
      A phase IV, open-label, prospective, multi-centre cohort study in patients with severe
      eosinophilic asthma (Global Initiative for Asthma [GINA] steps 4 and 5 classification of
      asthma severity) who will be treated with benralizumab injections. The study is exploratory
      and will assess deteriorations in asthma control (exacerbations) to characterise the clinical
      severity of each exacerbation and the airway and systemic inflammatory phenotype associated
      with these events. Clinical assessment and management of each exacerbation will be in line
      with standard clinical guidelines. 150 participants will be recruited and receive treatment
      for either 56 or 80 weeks.

                  investigational agent, whichever is longer).

               3. Administration of live attenuated vaccine 30 days prior to Visit 1. Other types
                  of vaccines are allowed.

               4. Regular use of systemic (oral/IM) corticosteroids except for the indication of
                  asthma.

               5. Other ongoing immunosuppressive/ immunomodulating therapy [e.g. methotrexate,
                  ciclosporine, azathioprine] other than oral corticosteroids for asthma.

          -  Bronchial thermoplasty conducted within 6 months of Visit 1.

             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test

          -  Women of child bearing potential (WoCBP) who are not willing to use highly effective
             contraception during treatment with benralizumab and for 16 weeks after the last dose.

             each benralizumab injection.
