    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of
      sacubitril/valsartan compared with standard of care used for treating BP in patients that
      have been implanted with the Heart Mate 3 LVAD (events of special interest - all cause death,
      right ventricular failure, bleeding events, deterioration in renal function, hyperkalemia,
      symptomatic hypotension).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Freedom from all-cause death, deterioration in renal function (reaching end-stage renal disease (ESRD), renal death or 50% decline in eGFR), hyperkalemia or symptomatic hypotension</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>End-stage renal disease defined as one of the following:
Initiation of dialysis (e.g., hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or continuous venovenous hemodialysis), continuing for ≥ 20 days without known recovery of renal function
Initiation of dialysis with death before 30 days (excludes dialysis events associated with acute kidney injury with death before 30 days)
A drop in eGFR from baseline (randomization, i.e. Visit 101) to a value &lt;15 mL/min/1.73m2 on two consecutive measurements separated by≥ 20 days
Occurrence of kidney transplantation
50% sustained decline in eGFR: 50% decline from baseline (Randomization, Visit 101) as determined by 2 consecutive post-baseline measurements separated by ≥ 20 days
Hyperkalemia: serum potassium ≥6.0 mmol/L [mEq/L]) Hypotension: symptomatic reduction in blood pressure requiring withdrawal of study medication or any BP lowering medication</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed.

          2. ≥18 years of age, male or female

          3. Recently implanted HeartMate 3 LVAD recipients, in stable condition and deemed ready
             for discharge or chronic, stable, ambulatory HeartMate 3 LVAD carriers implanted
             within 1 year prior to enrolment

        1. Current acute decompensated HF (including right ventricular failure) requiring therapy
        with intravenous diuretics or vasodilators and/or inotropic drugs within the past 48 hours
        2. History of hypersensitivity to sacubitril/valsartan or to drugs of similar chemical
        classes, patients with a known history of angioedema 3. Patients with mean blood pressure
        ≤75 mmHg (systolic blood pressure i.e. Doppler opening blood pressure ≤90 mmHg in those
        pulsatile and measured by Doppler method) or symptomatic hypotension 4. eGFR &lt; 30
        mL/min/1.73m2 as calculated by the Modification in Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula at
        Visit 1 5. Patients with serum potassium &gt;5.4 mmol/L (mEq/L) at Visit 1 6. Hemodynamically
        unstable patients or those with ongoing MCS other than LVAD or those with planned
        biventricular support 7. Hemodynamically significant aortic insufficiency in the opinion of
        the investigator 8. Irreversible end-organ dysfunction 9. Previous sacubitril/valsartan use
        while on LVAD support 10. Acute coronary syndrome, stroke, transient ischemic attack,
