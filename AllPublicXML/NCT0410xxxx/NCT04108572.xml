  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Choosing Healthy Eating for Infant Health (CHErIsH) intervention is a complex infant
      feeding intervention delivered at infant vaccination visits, alongside a healthcare
      professional (HCP) level implementation strategy to support delivery. The primary aim of
      CHErIsH pilot feasibility study is to collect and examine data on the acceptability and
      feasibility of the delivery of the brief infant-feeding intervention by HCPs to parents at
      child vaccination visits, and the strategy to support the implementation of this intervention
      in primary care for HCPs. Furthermore, half of all potential participants will be invited to
      provide maternal and infant biomarkers and/or take part in SWAT (study within a trial) which
      includes questions about infant feeding that were put together as part of a Core Outcome Set.
      These questions are important as they give a better understanding about what works and what
      doesn't. This will facilitate the refinement of the intervention and its implementation
      strategy, and inform the next step of the CHErIsH study, such as a definitive trial.

    <textblock>
      The Choosing Healthy Eating for Infant Health (CHErIsH) intervention is a non-randomised
      feasibility study of an infant feeding intervention and implementation strategy, with
      embedded process evaluation and economic evaluation.

      The CHErIsH feasibility study will address the following research questions:

        1. Are the intervention content, delivery and implementation procedures acceptable to
           parents who will receive the intervention, and HCPs who will deliver the intervention?

        2. Are the data collection processes, including mode and duration of data collection and
           outcome measures used, acceptable to parents and HCPs?

        3. Is the intervention feasible to deliver in primary care practice, in terms fidelity of
           delivery and receipt of the intervention?

        4. Is the study feasible in terms of recruitment and retention procedures and data
           collection?

        5. What are the costs associated with the intervention and its implementation strategy?

    <description>The intervention will be delivered to parents by practice nurses and/or GPs in MPHC at each of the vaccination visits, prior to administration of the vaccination. These vaccination visits take place at 2, 4, 6, 12 and 13 months. This intervention consists of 1) verbally delivered pre-specified infant feeding messages, and 2) provision of additional infant-feeding resources including an information leaflet, a magnet, an infant bib and access to an informational website.</description>
