  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite primary surgical management of muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) with radical
      cystectomy and pelvic lymphnode dissection, up to 50% of patients will eventually develop
      tumours at distant sites, owing to pre-existing disseminated occult micrometastases. The
      first line treatment for relapse or metastatic MIBC is gemcitabine and cisplatin. After the
      failure of first line treatment, second line chemotherapy drugs can be chosen from
      doxorubicin, docetaxel, pemetrexed, etc. This non-randomized, prospective study aims to
      explore the efficacy and safety of PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin and PD-1 in second line
      treatment of MIBC.
