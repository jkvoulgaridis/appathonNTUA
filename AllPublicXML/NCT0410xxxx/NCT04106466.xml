  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Of the estimated 30 million Americans who suffer from Major Depressive Disorder,
      approximately 10% are considered treatment resistant. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) to a
      region of the brain called the subcallosal cingulate (SCC) is an emerging strategy for
      treatment resistant depression (TRD), which involves placement of electrodes in a specific
      region of the brain and stimulating that area with electricity. This is believed to reset the
      brain network responsible for symptoms and results in a significant antidepressant response.
      A series of open-label studies have demonstrated sustained, long-term antidepressant effects
      in 40-60% of patients who received this treatment. A challenge to the effective dissemination
      of this fledgling treatment is the absence of biomarkers (objective, measureable indications
      of the state of the body and brain) to guide device placement and select stimulation
      parameters during follow-up care.

      By using an experimental prototype DBS device called the Summit RC+S (Medtronic, Inc) which
      has the ability to both deliver stimulation to and record electrical signals directly from
      the brain, this study aims to identify changes in local field potentials (LFPs), specific
      electrical signals that are thought to represent how the brain communicates information from
      one region to another, to see how this relates to DBS parameter settings and patient
      depressive symptomatology. The goal of this study is to study LFPs before and during active
      DBS stimulation to identify changes that correlate with the antidepressant effects of SCC
      DBS.

      The study team will recruit 10 patients with TRD and implant them with the Summit RC+S
      system. Participants will be asked to complete short questionnaires and collect LFP data
      twice daily for the first year of the study, as well as have weekly in person research
      procedures and assessments with the study team for up to one year. These include meetings
      with the study psychiatrist, psychologist, symptom ratings, and periodic EEGs (scalp
      brainwave recordings). A brief discontinuation experiment will be conducted after 6 months of
      stimulation, in which the device will be turned off and patterns of LFP changes will be
      recorded. The entire study is expected to last about 10 years, which is the expected life of
      the battery that powers the device. All participants are required to live in the New York
      metropolitan area for the first two years of the study.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 25-70 years old.

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent.

          -  Lives within commuting distance to New York City and study location (Mount Sinai West
             Hospital)

          -  Primary psychiatric diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), either single
             episode or recurrent type, without psychotic features, currently experiencing a Major
             Depressive Episode (MDE), as diagnosed by Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV-TR
             (SCID). Two independent psychiatrists will confirm the diagnosis.

          -  Current depressive episode of at least two years duration OR a history of more than 3
             lifetime depressive episodes.

          -  Minimum score at study entry of 20 on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
             (HDRS-17)

          -  Average pre-operative HDRS-17 score of 20 or greater (averaged over four weekly
             pre-surgical evaluations during the four weeks prior to surgery) and an average
             pre-operative HDRS-17 score no more than 30% lower than the baseline screening HDRS-17
             score.

          -  A maximum Global Assessment of Functioning of 50 or less.

          -  Confirmed to have treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Treatment-resistance will be
             defined as:

               1. Failure to respond to a minimum of four different antidepressant treatments
                  (including at least three medications from at least three different drug
                  classes), evidence-based psychotherapy, or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)
                  administered at adequate doses and duration during the current episode. We will
                  require documentation (i.e., statement from the treating psychiatrist) that a
                  treatment trial has failed (either no response to maximum tolerable doses for a
                  minimum of 4 weeks, or side effects at sub-maximal doses) as coded by a revised
                  Antidepressant Treatment History Form (ATHF). The study investigators will
                  confirm each treatment via review of records from referring psychiatrists and/or
                  pharmacy records.

               2. Failure or intolerance of an adequate course of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)
                  during any episode (confirmed by medical records) or not receiving ECT due to a
                  reason considered valid by the study psychiatrist. Such reasons might include
                  lack of availability of ECT providers in the patient's location, concern
                  regarding the impact of cognitive side effects of ECT on current ability to work
                  or function, or inability to obtain third-party payment for ECT. Additionally, it
                  is recognized that the probability that a patient who has failed four medications
                  in the current episode will achieve a lasting response with ECT is about 18% (60%
                  probability of an acute response and 30% of maintaining response for at least 24
                  weeks); patients who have refused ECT because they feel the chance of benefit
                  does not outweigh the risks associated with ECT will be considered eligible.

          -  Able to undergo preoperative MRI

          -  Have a designated caregiver available to assist in compliance with study procedures

          -  Willing and able to comply with all study-related appointments and procedures

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Other Axis I comorbid conditions

          -  Active suicidal ideation with intent, suicide attempt within the last six months, more
             than three suicide attempts within the last two years, or serious suicide risk as
             determined by the study psychiatrists

          -  Other primary neurological disorders or unstable medical illness

          -  Conditions requiring anticoagulant therapy which cannot be discontinued for the
             perioperative period, as required

          -  Conditions requiring MRI scans or diathermy

          -  Pregnancy or plan to come pregnant during the study

          -  Contraindications for general anesthesia, neurosurgery, or an MRI scan

          -  Currently implanted with a cardiac pacemaker / defibrillator or other implanted
             electrical device which may interfere with DBS stimulator or the function of which may
             be impacted by its implantation.

          -  Patients who lack the capacity for proper device usage and maintenance, in the opinion
             of the research team
