  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunization is one of the most significant preventive health measures in reducing morbidity
      and mortality caused by infectious diseases. Studies have shown that Sucrose is recommended
      to reduce pain associated with vaccination in neonates. The main aim of the study was to
      determine the effectiveness of sucrose in reducing infant's pain outcomes during immunization
      among 10-24 month-old infants and toddlers.

    <measure>Substance P (SP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change SP level from the start of injection and up to 3 minutes after immunization</time_frame>
    <description>Change SP level as an indicator of pain and distress level. Saliva was collected from both intervention and placebo groups immediately after treatment in the same manner and similar time schedule. Saliva specimens was immediately cooled in ice and centrifuged at 10,000g at 4 C for 15 min to obtain the supernatant.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All healthy children who were attending immunization clinic to have their 10-24 month
             immunization were invited to this study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria included children: whose parents choose to breastfeed during
             immunization, who have received an analgesia in the previous 24 hours including
             Paracetamol (so as not to affect the response to painful stimuli during immunization),
             who cannot receive their immunization due to the presence of immunization risk factors
             as determined by the immunization nurse, who are not able to receive a sugar solution,
             and whose parents refuse to participate.
