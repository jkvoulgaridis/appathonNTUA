  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigates whether patients treated for neovascular (wet) age-related macular
      degeneration (AMD), with intravitreal injection with bevacizumab (Avastin) after two years
      need more injections with retained therapy response compared to patients being treated with
      intravitreal injection with aflibercept (Eylea).

      The study also aims to evaluate if there is a difference in best-corrected visual acuity,
      macular thickness, recurrence interval, durability, cost efficiency, as well as
      vision-related quality of life.

    <description>Quality-adjusted life years (QALY), cost-per-QALY is measured with the EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire.
EQ-5D consists of five subscales: mobility, self-care, usual activities, discomfort/pain and anxiety/depression. The subscales measure different aspects of health and well-being where the subject is asked to rank each subscale from 1 (no problems) to 3 (major problems). These answers are converted to a score between 0 (=death) to 1 (=full health). The subscales are converted to a weighted mean which ranges from 0 (death) to 1 (full health). Negative values may exists for conditions worse than death. The weighting differs between geographic areas; for Sweden, the UK weighting scale is used.</description>

    <description>National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire -25 (NEI VFQ-25) questionnaire is based on 25 questions (items) where the subject is asked questions on visual function, daily activities and social consequences of visual function. The questions have answers on a 5- or 6-grade scale which are converted to a scale from 0 (no function/worst consequence) to 100 (no problems). The 25 items are clustered into 12 subscales. Items within each subscale are averaged to create the subscale scores according to the NEI VFQ-25 scoring algorithm. In addition, a composite score for all 12 subscales are created as an average of these. Minimum score is 0 and maximum score is 100 for each item, subscale and the composite score.</description>
