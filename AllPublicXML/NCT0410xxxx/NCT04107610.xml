      The purpose of this study is to use a device called I-PortalÂ® Portable Assessment System
      (I-PAS) to record eye movements in response to a number of visual and auditory stimuli
      designed to evaluate neural brain pathways related to oculomotor, vestibular, reaction time
      and cognitive (OVRT-C) development. The goal of this research is to collect normative data
      for the OVRT-C tests from a healthy pediatric population.

    <description>Short questionnaire consisting of 6 questions to assess the look, feel and weight of the goggles. 5 questions are Yes/No (0/1) and one question is on a rating from 0 to 3. The total score from these questions represents an evaluation of goggle comfort. The score can be between 0-8, where a score of 0 is indicative of a very good comfort level and a score of 8 of a low comfort level.</description>
