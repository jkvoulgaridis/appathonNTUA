  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study experimentally investigates whether reducing highly processed foods
      (defined in this study as foods high in added sugars) leads to biological, psychological, and
      / or behavioral indicators of withdrawal. The following hypotheses are tested:

        1. To test the hypothesis that reducing highly processed food intake will result in higher
           daily reports of physical (e.g. physical), cognitive (e.g. difficulty concentrating),
           and affective (e.g., irritability) withdrawal symptoms.

        2. To test the hypothesis that reducing highly processed food intake will result in
           increased negative affect (negative mood) as indicated by biological (heart rate) and
           psychological (self - reported distress ratings; daily emotion / mood reports) measures.

        3. To test the hypothesis that reducing highly processed food intake will result in
           increased response to environmental cues for highly processed food as indicated by
           biological (neural response from fMRI scan; heart rate measures), psychological (self -
           report craving measures), and behavioral measures.

      Participants come to the University of Michigan Psychology department three times for in lab
      appointments. Several daily questionnaires are completed at home between in lab visits. The
      initial in lab visit is to confirms eligibility, sign consent, and get baseline measurements
      (questionnaires, in lab tasks, body composition measurements). After the initial visit,
      participants start an active assessment period (pre / post dietary change assessments) Pre -
      dietary change includes at home questionnaires while eating a typical diet and a lab visit.
      The Post dietary change lab assessment includes at home questionnaires while consuming 3 days
      of food portion lower in highly processed foods and an in lab assessment. The pre and post in
      lab assessments each include an fMRI scan, computer tasks, questionnaires, collecting heart
      rate data, and taking height and body composition measurements.

    <measure>Change as indicators of physical withdrawal symptoms using heart rate monitoring</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Physical symptoms are assessed using heart rate monitoring (using heart rate belt strapped around chest) during the pre / post in - lab assessments. Data are collected in a simulated fast food restaurant and while completing a stress task where they listen to a recording of a stressful event. Change in heart rate pre dietary change compared to post dietary change within subjects will be used for analyses.</description>

    <measure>Change as indicator of physical withdrawal symptoms using fMRI scan</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Physical symptoms are assessed using fMRI scans completed at the pre / post in lab assessments to assess reward response to highly processed food (chocolate milkshake). Participants are given small amounts of water and milkshake. Pictures of a glass of water or a milkshake are shown while participants are in the scanner. Participants are asked to anticipate what is in the picture. After seeing the picture and anticipating the taste the participant receives a small amount of the pictured liquid to drink. Change in brain response pre dietary change compared to post dietary change will be used for analyses.</description>

    <measure>Change as indicator of affective withdrawal symptom using subjective craving measure</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Affective withdrawal symptoms are measured by asking participants to self-report subjective cravings during the fMRI scan, simulated restaurant task, and stress task. Participants are asked to give a rate of current craving for food on a scale of 0 to 100. Participants are asked to complete this measures before and after each task during the pre and post dietary change lab assessments. Change in self - report responses of subjective craving at pre dietary change compared to post dietary change will be used for analyses.</description>

    <measure>Change as indicator of affective withdrawal symptom using subjective hunger measure</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Affective withdrawal symptoms are measured by asking participants to self-report subjective hunger during the fMRI scan, simulated restaurant task, and stress task. Participants are asked to give a rate of current hunger on a scale of 0 to 100. Participants are asked to complete these measures before and after each task during the pre and post dietary change lab assessments. Change in self - report responses of subjective hunger at pre dietary change compared to post dietary change will be used for analyses.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change as indicator of affective withdrawal symptom using Positive and Negative Affect Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Affective withdrawal symptoms are measured by asking participants to complete the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) which asked about current feeling / emotions. Response options are &quot;very slightly / not at all&quot; &quot;a little&quot; &quot;moderately&quot; &quot;quite a bit&quot; or &quot;extremely.&quot; Participants are asked to complete these measures before and after each task during the pre and post dietary change lab assessments. Change in self - report responses on the PANAS at pre dietary change compared to post dietary change will be used for analyses.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in food cue reactivity using heart rate monitoring</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are brought into a simulated fast food restaurant during the pre and post lab assessments. The restaurant is a cue - rich environment designed to simulate the experience of being in a fast food restaurant (i.e. smell of french fries, large monitors displaying menus, condiments counter, etc.) A tray of highly processed food items (e.g. french fries, burger, milkshake) will be available where the participant is seated, but the participant will not be allowed to eat the food. Participant's heart rate (using heart rate belt strapped around chest). Change in heart rate pre dietary change compared to post dietary change within subjects will be used for analyses.</description>

    <description>Participants do an in - lab screening to confirm eligibility and collect baseline data. Then the active assessment period (pre / post dietary change) begins. Pre - dietary change procedure is 3 days of standard high HP diet while completing daily electronic assessments of withdrawal (Highly Processed Food Withdrawal Scale) and then a laboratory assessment. Post - dietary change is 3 days of lower HP diet (food portions will be provided) while completing daily electronic assessments and then a laboratory assessment. The electronic daily assessments are assessements of affect, craving and withdrawal symptoms measured by the Highly Processed Food Withdrawal Scale (ProWS). The pre / post-dietary change lab assessments entail 1) fMRI protocol to assess reward-response to a HP food 2) cue reactivity task in a simulated fast food restaurant, 3) psychosocial stress task, and 4) body composition / BMI assessment.</description>

    <intervention_name>Dietary Change (low in highly processed foods)</intervention_name>
    <description>Food is provided to participant for 3 days. The University of Michigan's Nutrition Obesity Research Center (NORC)'s Metabolic Kitchen prepares the food. The low HP food diet is based on prior methods where participants are placed on an isocaloric diet composed of 5% or less of calories from added sugar and 10% or less of overall calories from total sugar. No foods that meet the criteria for a HP food based (defined by Kant and colleagues) that corresponds to: sweeteners (sugar, candy, etc); carbonated and non-carbonated beverages (fruit drinks, sweetened / diet beverages, etc. ); baked / dairy desserts (cookies, pies, ice cream, etc.); salted snacks (potato chips, etc.) and fast foods (pizza, cheeseburgers, French fries, etc.) are included in the diet portions. The overall macro nutrient composition of the diet will be approximately 20-25% of kcal from protein, 30-35% of kcal from fat, and 40-50% of kcal from carbohydrates.</description>
