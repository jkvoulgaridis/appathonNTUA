  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is testing a supportive psychosocial intervention for caregivers of people who
      have a type of malignant brain tumor (malignant glioma). This study was designed because
      caregivers of patients with malignant gliomas often experience physical and psychological
      burdens caring for their loved ones.

      The purpose of this study is to find out whether a program offering psychological support can
      help caregivers learn effective coping methods during their loved one's treatment and make
      the experience of being a caregiver more manageable.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective, randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of a
      caregiver-directed intervention designed to improve anxiety in caregivers of patients with
      malignant gliomas, in comparison with caregivers who receive usual care.

      The aim of this study is to test the efficacy of this intervention in reducing distress in
      caregivers of patients with malignant gliomas, in comparison with usual care. The study will
      be conducted in 120 caregivers.

The MOCS-A assesses caregivers' self-perceived status on coping skills targeted by the intervention. Total MOCS-A scores range from 0-52 with higher scores indicating better self-perceived coping skills.</description>

The CareGiver Oncology QoL questionnaire (CarGOQoL) is a 29-item, well-validated instrument specific to caregivers for patients with cancer, used to measure family caregiver QoL in multiple domains. Overall scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores corresponding to higher quality of life.</description>
