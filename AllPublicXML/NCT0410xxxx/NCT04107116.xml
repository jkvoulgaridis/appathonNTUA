  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Undertreated patient symptoms and resulting acute care use require approaches that improve
      symptom-burden. Previously a a lay health worker (LHW)-led symptom screening intervention was
      developed for patients with advanced cancer. This intervention will be expanded to all
      patients with cancer and the LHW will be trained to refer patients to palliative care and
      behavioral health. This intervention will evaluate the effect on symptom-burden, survival,
      healthcare use, and total costs.

      From 11/1/2016 - 9/30/2018, all newly diagnosed Medicare Advantage enrollees with solid or
      hematologic malignancies were enrolled in the intervention. Outcomes were compared outcomes
      to patients in the year prior (control arm). The primary outcome was change in symptoms using
      the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) and Personal Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) at
      baseline, 6- and 12-months post-enrollment. Secondary outcomes were between-group comparison
      of survival, 12-month healthcare use and costs.
