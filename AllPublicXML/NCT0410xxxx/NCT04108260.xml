  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pivotal clinical data support prolonged dosing intervals of up to 14 days for routine
      prophylaxis in hemophilia B patients. The majority of adult and pediatric patients using
      Idelvion for routine prophylaxis had a median annualized spontaneous bleeding rate (AsBR) of
      0.00. The majority (99%) of bleeding episodes were managed successfully with one or two
      infusions, and 94% of bleeds were controlled with only one infusion regardless of the cause
      or location.

      The rationale for this study is to collect the effectiveness and safety data of severe
      hemophilia B patients treated with Idelvion following institutional standard of care. It is
      the aim of this study to extend the results of the clinical trial program to a broader
      hemophilia B population, and to compare with current alternative factor IX treatments in
      Taiwan.
