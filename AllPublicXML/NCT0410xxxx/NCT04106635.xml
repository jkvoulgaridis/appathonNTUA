  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laryngeal mask airway is inserted into the oral cavity and seals the upper esophagus and the
      surrounding tissue, effectively securing airway. Laryngeal mask airway has been widely
      adopted in the clinical practice.

      On the other hand, cricoid pressure has been used to reduce the risk of pulmonary aspiration
      of gastric contents during induction of general anesthesia. However, cricoid pressure might
      impede placement of the laryngeal mask airway, thereby preventing effective ventilation.

      Recently, left paratracheal pressure was introduced as an alternative to cricoid pressure and
      reported to be more effective than cricoid pressure in the prevention of gastric air
      insufflation during positive-pressure ventilation by facemask. Since this method compresses
      low left paratracheal level, it may affect the successful insertion of laryngeal mask airway.

      In this study, the investigators aimed to evaluate the effect of paratracheal esophagus
      pressure on the insertion of laryngeal mask airway compare to conventional cricoid pressure.
