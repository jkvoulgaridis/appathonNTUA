  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This first-in-human (FIH) trial aims to establish a safe dose of BNT411 as a monotherapy and
      in combination with atezolizumab, carboplatin and etoposide. BNT411 is a TLR7 agonist which
      is expected to mount broad innate and adaptive immune reactions, especially in combination
      with cytotoxic therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors.
