  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to validate the ultrasound scores PsASon22 and PsASon13 in
      patients with active psoriatic arthritis undergoing a treatment with Apremilast.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicentre, phase IV trial assessing the value of the ultrasound
      scores PsASon22 and PsASon13 in differentiating between clinically active and inactive
      patients with psoriatic arthritis, following a treatment with Apremilast for up to 24 months.
      Additionally, convergent construct validity, inter/intra-reader reliability, sensitivity to
      change and differences in change in certain patients will be tested for the ultrasound
      scores.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The difference in the change-score of the PsASon22</measure>
    <time_frame>4-12-24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The main outcome is the difference in the change-score of the PsASon22 between patients achieving low disease activity or remission (DAPSA≤14) and patients not achieving this target under a treatment with Apremilast.
The Psoratic Arthritis Sonography Score 22, PsASon22 (range 0-260), is a sum score, including grey scale and power doppler measurements of 22 joints (6 MCPs, 4-H-PIPs, 2 MTPs, 4 H-DIPs, 2 F-DIPs, 4 large joints) and 4 entheses (lateral epicondyle and distal patella - bilateral), with a higher score presumably indicating higher disease activity.</description>

    <description>The main outcome is the difference in the change-score of the PsASon13 between patients achieving low disease activity or remission (DAPSA≤14) and patients not achieving this target under a treatment with Apremilast.
The Psoratic Arthritis Sonography Score 13, PsASon13 (range 0-134), is a sum score, including grey scale and power doppler measurements of 13 joints (2 MCPs, 3-H-PIPs, 1-F-PIP, 2 MTPs, 1 H-DIPs, 2 F-DIPs, 2 large joints) and 2 entheses (lateral epicondyle and distal patella - unilateral), with a higher score presumably indicating higher disease activity.</description>

    <measure>Convergent construct validity of PsAson22 and PsASon13</measure>
    <time_frame>4-12-24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Convergent construct validity will be assessed by correlating the ultrasound scores to clinical composite scores (f.e. DAPSA)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Sensitivity to Change of PsASon22 and PsASon13</measure>
    <time_frame>4-12-24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Sensitivity to change will be assessed by measuring the PsASon22 and PsASon 13 scores at four different time points (Baseline and after 4, 12 and 24 months)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Interrater reliability of PsASon22 and PsASon13</measure>
    <time_frame>4-12-24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Interrater reliability will be assessed by performing multiple ultrasound examinations for one patient by multiple examinators</description>
