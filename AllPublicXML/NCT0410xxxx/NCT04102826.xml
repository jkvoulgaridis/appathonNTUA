  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional electrical stimulation (FES) has been used to activate paralysed muscles and
      restore movement after spinal cord injury and stroke. This technology involves the
      application of low-level electrical currents to the nerves and muscles to cause muscle
      contraction where the user's ability to achieve that through voluntary means has been lost.

      Providing control of muscle contraction in a coordinated way can mean that users are able
      once again to produce functional movements in otherwise paralysed limbs.

      Routine clinical use is limited to the prevention of drop foot in the lower limb following
      stroke and occasional therapeutic use in the hand and shoulder. Systems providing functional
      reach and grasp, however, have not achieved clinical or commercial success. This project aims
      to develop methods for personalising assistive technology to restore arm function in people
      with high-level spinal cord injury. The investigators will use a combination of electrical
      stimulation to elicit forces in muscles no longer under voluntary control, and mobile arm
      supports to compensate for insufficient muscle force where necessary. The investigators will
      use computational models specific to an individual's functional limitations to produce
      patient-specific interventions. The project will be in three phases: building a model to
      predict the effects of electrical stimulation on a paralysed arm with arm support,
      development of methodologies using this model to optimise the arm support and stimulation
      system, and testing of stimulation controllers designed using this approach.

    <description>The COPM is a questionnaire based assessment of performance and satisfaction of functional tasks. The COPM measures an individuals self-perception of occupational performance over time. This is a 10 point scale, with 1 indicating poor performance and low satisfaction, and 10 indicating very good performance and high satisfaction. The scale is applied to up to 5 problems identified by an individual that affect their everyday life. An average score is then calculated.</description>
