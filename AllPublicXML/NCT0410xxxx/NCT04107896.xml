    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators had evaluated the effectiveness SILODOSIN (8 mg daily orally)
      in Benign prostatic Hyperplasia in comparison to Tamsulosin (0.4 mg daily orally) in a
      randomized controlled trial design. Study population would be patients attending Urology OPD
      of BSMMU Hospital, Dhaka. Target sample size will be 136 evaluable patients in each group
      (assuming dropout rate 20%), suffering from Benign prostatic Hyperplasia .Subjects would be
      observed for 1 week without any drug. At the end of 1 week, they would be randomly allocated
      to Silodosin or Tamsulosin and treatment continued for 12 weeks. Interim follow-up visits
      would be at 1,4 and 12 weeks. USG confirmation of BPH would be required for recruitment.
      Effectiveness of the drugs would be assessed by International Prostate Symptom score, a
      quality of life (QoL) assessment done by a 7-point scale. Prostate weight/volume
      determination by USG, Change in post voidal residual urine (PVR) by USG and Changes in peak
      urine flow rate by uroflowmetry. Safety would be assessed by following up vital signs,
      treatment emergent adverse events and routine laboratory tests for drug safety.

    <textblock>
      Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the most common cause of lower urinary tract symptoms
      in elderly men. Selective α1-adrenergic antagonists are now ﬁrst-line drugs in the medical
      management of BPH. This Hospital based randomized controlled clinical study designed to
      evaluate the efficacy of the new α1-blocker silodosin in the treatment of symptomatic benign
      prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).Ambulatory patients of age between 50 to 70 years, who were
      diagnosed as benign prostatic hyperplasia, were divided into two groups after fulfilling
      selection criteria. After informed consent &amp; random sampling by lottery, silodosin 8 mg was
      given to group A (study) &amp; tamsulosin 0.4 mg was given to group B (control). Total 149
      patients were enrolled in this study but 8 patients were lost during follow up. Hence 141
      patients completed the study, during the period of June 2017 to August 2018.

    <description>Effectiveness of silodosin in benign prostatic hyperplasia assessed by symptom relief as assessed by IPSS. The total score was taken as the sum of the seven individual symptom scores. Each individual scored 0-5 (0 = Minimum; 5 = Maximum as worse as can be), yielding a total between 0 and 35. The Storage sub score was taken as the sum of the three individual symptom scores (Range 0-15) &amp; the Voiding sub score was taken as the sum of the four individual symptom scores (Range 0-20). Quality of life (QoL) score assessment was done on a 7-point scale 0-6 (0= Delighted; 6= Terrible).</description>
