      1. Analyzing the effects of severe trauma using sonoclot analyzer (which depicts the entire
           hemostatic pathway) ,subsequently describing the convenient therapy .

        2. Assessing the correlations between sonoclot variables and conventional coagulation and
           platelet function tests

      Coagulopathy is a physiological response to massive bleeding that frequently occurs after
      severe trauma and is an independent predictive factor for mortality[2]. . There are two of
      the major causes of coagulopathy in trauma patients

        1. coagulopathy secondary to hemorrhagic shock due to massive bleeding and

        2. coagulopathy secondary to severe head injury[3] which results in release of tissue
           factor from damaged brain tissue.

      Therefore, it is very important to grasp the coagulation status of patients with severe
      trauma quickly and accurately with objective indicator in order to establish the therapeutic
      strategy .

      The importance of viscoelastic devices in understanding the disease condition of patients
      with traumatic coagulopathy has been widely recognized in Europe. Viscoelastic hemostatic
      assays devices have practical advantages as point-of-care devices for monitoring major
      hemorrhage including speed of results and a set of parameters that assesses a global
      coagulation profile .

      Also In the USA, Massive Transfusion in Trauma Guidelines proposed by the American College of
      Surgeons in 2013 presented the test results obtained by the viscoelastic devices, as the
      standard for transfusion or injection of blood plasma, cryoprecipitate, platelet concentrate,
      or anti-fibrinolytic agents in the treatment strategy for traumatic coagulopathy and
      hemorrhagic shock .

      However, some studies have reported limitations of these viscoelastic devices
