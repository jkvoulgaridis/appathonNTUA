  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is an open-label, single-centre, dose escalation, phase I study designed
      to investigate the safety and tolerability of Haploidentical / Allogeneic NKG2DL-targeting
      Chimeric Antigen Receptor-grafted Gamma Delta (γδ) T Cells (CTM-N2D) in Subjects with
      Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumour. The study objectives of this phase I study are to
      determine the safety, activity and the safe dose of haploidentical or allogeneic
      NKG2DL-targeting chimeric antigen receptor-grafted γδ T cells given four times weekly in
      patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors of different types.

      CTM-N2D-101 is a phase I dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety of CTM-N2D and the
      feasibility to produce CTM-N2D for three target dose levels between 3x10^8 - 3x10^9 per
      infusion will be tested. Four doses will be given at an interval of a week into subjects with
      relapsed or refractory solid tumors.

      A typical 3+3 design will be used to determine the safe regimen basing on the incidence of
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). The identified safe regimen will be used for further phase II
      studies for selected indications.

The first dose level will be at 3 x 10^8 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) grafted γδ T cells per infusion.
The second dose level will be at 1 x 10^9 CAR-γδT cells per infusion. The third dose level will be increased to 3 x 10^9 cells CAR-γδT cells.
Each cycle of therapy will consist of 4 intravenous infusions, given 7 days apart.</intervention_model_description>
