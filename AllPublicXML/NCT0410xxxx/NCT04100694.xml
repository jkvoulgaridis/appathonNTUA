  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Merus is providing single patient/named access to the HER2/HER3 bispecific antibody,
      MCLA-128, to patients with advanced NRG1-fusion positive solid tumor under this early access
      program who are ineligible for an ongoing MCLA-128 clinical trial or have other
      considerations that prevent access to MCLA-128 through an existing clinical trial.
      Participating sites will be added as they apply for and are approved for the EAP. A medical
      doctor must decide whether the potential benefit outweighs the risk of receiving an
      investigational therapy based on the individual's medical history and program eligibility
      criteria.

          -  At least one evaluable or measurable lesion according to RECIST v1.1

          -  Patient with advanced metastatic solid tumor with documented NRG1 fusion determined in
             a qualified local laboratory by molecular profiling using methods such as next
             generation sequencing [DNA or RNA] or FISH as routinely performed at CLIA or other
             similarly-certified laboratories.

          -  Treatment with anticancer medications or investigational drugs within the following
             intervals before the first administration of MCLA-128:

               1. At least 14 days for chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation
                  therapy OR

               2. At least 5 half-lives have passed since discontinuation of the systemic treatment

          -  Any condition that in the opinion of Merus may preclude appropriate use of the
             investigational medicine

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any untreated, symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) lesion

          -  Presence of an active and uncontrolled infection

          -  Leptomeningeal metastases

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of MCLA-128 or history of severe
             hypersensitivity reactions to human or humanized monoclonal antibodies, including
             therapeutic antibodies

          -  Presence of NYHA Class III or IV congestive heart failure or LVEF &lt;50% or history of
             significant cardiac disease, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, myocardial
             infarction, or ventricular arrhythmia requiring medication

          -  Presence of any other medical or psychological condition deemed by the Physician to be
             likely to interfere with a patient's ability to sign informed consent, cooperate or
