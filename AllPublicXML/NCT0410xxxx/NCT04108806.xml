    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a worldwide health problem and its prevalence is
      increasing among aging population. Symptomatic PAD Is a major cause of major amputation with
      reduction of the functional capacity and quality of life . Arterial calcification is calcium
      crystallization deposits in the extracellular matrix of the intima and media . Medial
      calcification is usually associated with chronic kidney disease and diabetes mellitus, while
      intimal calcification comes usually as a part of atherosclerotic process . The relationship
      between calcification and PAD is well established . Arterial calcification is associated with
      increased risk of procedural failure and major amputation . Many calcium scoring systems have
      been proposed, including peripheral arterial calcium scoring scale (PACSS which highlights
      the pathologic location of calcification along with the length of the segment affected. The
      peripheral academic research consortium (PARC) suggested another calcium scoring scale that
      classified calcification into 4 major grades . The DEFENETIVE Ca++ have proposed another
      calcium severity scoring . Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) is highly sensitive to presence
      and location of atherosclerotic calcium .

      The impact of intimal and medial vascular calcification on the safety and effectiveness of
      endovascular devices to treat symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) remains poorly
      defined warranting continued research to elaborate relationship between calcification and
      endovascular outcome.
