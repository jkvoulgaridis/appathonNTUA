  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cord blood (CB) transplants are an option for patients lacking an HLA identical donor but are
      hampered by low cell dose, prolonged aplasia and high transplant related mortality. UM171, a
      novel and potent agonist of hematopoietic stem cell self renewal could solve this major
      limitation, allowing for CB's important qualities as lower risk of chronic GVHD and relapse
      to prevail. In a previous trial (NCT02668315), the CB expansion protocol using the ECT-001-CB
      technology (UM171 molecule) has proven to be technically feasible and safe. UM171 expanded CB
      was associated with a median neutrophil recovery at day (D)+18 post transplant. Amongst 22
      patients who received a single UM171 CB transplant with a median follow-up of 18 months, risk
      of TRM (5%) and grade 3-4 acute GVHD (10%) were low. There was no moderate-severe chronic
      GVHD. Thus, overall and progression free survival at 12 months were impressive at 90% and
      74%, respectively. The UM171 expansion protocol allowed access to smaller, better HLA matched
      CBs as &gt;80% of patients received a 6-7/8 HLA matched CB. Interestingly there were patients
      with high-risk hematologic malignancies and multiple comorbidities (5 patients who had
      already failed an allogeneic transplant and 5 patients with refractory/relapsed acute
      leukemia/aggressive lymphoma). Despite this high risk population, progression was 20% at 12
      months.

      This new study seeks to test a similar strategy in a group of patients with high risk acute
      leukemia/myelodysplasia.

The cord to be expanded will undergo CD34+ selection. The CD34- product is cryopreserved and will be thawed and infused on Day +1 post-transplant. The CD34+ product will be placed in a closed culture with UM171 for a 7-day expansion and is infused on Day 0.
Patients will receive standard supportive care and GVHD prophylaxis (such as MMF and tacrolimus).</description>
