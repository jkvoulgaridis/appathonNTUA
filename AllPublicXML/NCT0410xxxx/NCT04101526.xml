    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The study will be deemed acceptable if ≥ 50% of eligible cancer survivors who are approached agree to participate and &gt; 50% of intervention group participants report that, on average, they are at least &quot;mostly satisfied&quot; with the intervention (i.e., report an average score of ≥ 3 on a scale of 1 to 4).</description>

    <measure>Feasibility of New Intervention for Cancer-Related Sleep Disturbances</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The study will be deemed feasible if ≥ 75% of the intervention group participants attend at least half of the educational components of the intervention. This will be operationalized as having attended at least half of the sessions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of New Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy of the newly created intervention will be assessed using (a) Scores on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, which consists of 19 individual items creating 7 components that produce one global score. Each item is weighted on a 0-3 interval scale. The global score is calculated by totaling the 7 component scores, producing a score ranging from 0-21, where lower scores denote a healthier sleep quality. (b) the Insomnia Severity Index, which has 7 questions on a 0-4 scale which is totaled producing a score ranging from 0-28, where lower score denotes no clinically significant insomnia.</description>
