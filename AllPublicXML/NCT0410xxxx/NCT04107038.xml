  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate the impact that monitored anesthetic care (MAC) versus
      general endotracheal anesthesia (GETA) has on hospital length of stay, rate of ICU admission,
      and procedural mortality for patients undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement
      (TAVR). Also, the investigators hope to determine if the use of Transesophageal
      Echocardiography (TEE) during GETA impacts device success. Adult patients undergoing
      transfemoral approach TAVR for aortic valve stenosis may be eligible candidates for this
      study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Length of Stay</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The total number of hours that the patient stayed in the hospital will be measured from the &quot;Anesthesia Start&quot; time until their time of discharge, as recorded in their electronic medical record.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>ICU Admission Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will determine the ICU admission rate by taking the total number of patients admitted to the ICU and dividing it by the number of cases in each arm of the study, based on MUSC's &quot;fast track&quot; pathway and our inclusion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Procedural Mortality</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of the study population that died within 30 days of their procedure or during index procedure hospitalization - if the postoperative length of stay is longer than 30 days.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Paravalvular Regurgitation</measure>
    <time_frame>For GETA cases, will be recorded after valve implantation. For all cases, will be recorded from a TTE report that is completed on post-operative day 1 or 2 and at 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>Paravalvular regurgitation is a specific type of aortic regurgitation that is determined qualitatively by the echocardiographer. It is defined as the grade of aortic valve regurgitation around the perimeter of the implanted prosthesis. The assigned grade will be classified according to a unifying five-class scheme, at the determination of the cardiologist. Grade of aortic regurgitation is measured as none, mild, moderate, or severe. None is best, severe is worst. For GETA cases, paravalvular regurgitation will be recorded after valve implantation by the anesthesiologist performing TEE, as is routine. For all cases, paravalvular regurgitation will be recorded from a TTE report that is completed on post-operative day 1 or 2 (the 1st post-operative TTE) during routine clinical care, and again by TTE report at 1 year during routine clinical follow-up.</description>
