  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Context and hypothesis: The prevalence of diabetes mellitus keeps going to increase, due to
      the ageing of the population and the high prevalence of overweight and obesity. Thus about 5%
      of the French population is said to have diabetes according to the national health insurance
      reimbursement data estimations. 15 to 20% of diabetic patients will have a foot chronic ulcer
      in their lifetime. Nowadays, diabetes is still the leading cause of non-traumatic amputation
      in France, amputation being very often preceded by a trophic disorder. Thus, the person with
      diabetes has a 7-fold risk of amputation. For the year 2013, in France, incidence rates of
      hospitalizations for lower limb amputations and foot wounds in the diabetic population were
      252/100000 and 668/100000 respectively. In an attempt to prevent the risk of foot wounds in
      people with diabetes, the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) has
      established foot grades associated with an increased risk of foot wounds. These grades are
      now used by health authorities to calibrate their care offer such as reimbursements for
      podiatry care. Chronic kidney disease is one of the major complications of diabetes. In 2013,
      according to data from the French registry (REIN), 4,856 diabetics started renal replacement
      therapy in 2016, representing 46% of the newly dialyzed population. This represents a
      relative risk 9.2 times higher than in the general population. The Investigators hypothesize
      that beyond the risk of wound, there is a link between the stage of chronic renal disease and
      the risk of foot ulcer grade as defined by the IWGDF. The link between chronic renal disease
      and this common marker of foot risk has never been studied to our knowledge. The long-term
      objective, beyond this study, is to improve patient pathways and thus improve the prevention
      of foot wounds in diabetics with renal insufficiency. This is all the more true since
      prevention actions in the dialysis population have already shown their effectiveness on a
      large scale on the risk of amputation.

      Protocol : All patients with a diabetes mellitus who consult diabetology and nephrology
      services at the Montpellier University Hospital will be included in this study. The
      consultation wil be the same as usual. The Investigators will ask for the history of
      diabetes, the history of complications, the current treatments and the Investigators will
      make a standardized clinical examination of feet with a foot risk gradation according to the
      IWGDF.The investigators will report the standard biologicals values.

    <textblock>
      A simple standardization of the clinical examination (Foot Risk Grading), history collection
      and biological data will be organized by the study sponsors.

      List of collected data, origin and circuit of the data:

      Entry of patient data (clinical, biological and additional examinations) on a database
      registered at the University Hospital of Montpellier on a secure server.

      Data from :

        -  Computerized medical records and consultation letters.

        -  The question form completed by the physician- The results of biological examinations
           carried out outside or inside the university hospital vested with a standardized
           standard prescription form

      All the data corresponds to the current annual or infra-annual follow-up of patients
      consulting for the pathologies studied: Diabetes and renal failure.

      The data will be anonymized by a chronic search entry number and 1st letter of the surname
      and first name.

      The statistical analysis of the data will be carried out internally at the Montpellier
      University Hospital, in collaboration with the Medical Information Department, in accordance
      with the partnerships already in place between our teams.

      Data :

      Simple demographic characteristics: Age, gender Clinical history: Longstanding diabetes,
      diabetic retinopathy, diabetic maculopathy, ischemic heart disease, history of stroke, lower
      limb arteriopathy, known gastroparesis, high blood pressure, hypercholesterolemia,
      microalbuminuria or known proteinuria.

      Clinical features: BMI, lower limb neuropathy - monofilament test error, pulse abolition

      . Treatments: diabetes, type of kidney substitution, other treatments Toxic: Tobacco, Alcohol
      Quality of patient follow-up: date of last ophthalmic consultation (For each diabetic person:
      one consultation per year is recommended - this criterion is monitored by health insurance as
      a quality criterion for follow-up)

      Biological assessment: Creatinemia, Calcaemia, Phosphatemia, Magnesemia, 1.25OHVitD,
      25OHVitD, 25OHVitD, Natremia, Kalemia, Albuminaemia, PTH, CRP, Uric acid, HbA1C,
      Hemoglobinaemia, HDL, LDL, Triglyceridaemia, Cholesterol, Albuminuria/Creatinuria ratio,
      Proteinuria/Creatinuria ratio
