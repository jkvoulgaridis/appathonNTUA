    <intervention_model_description>This study consists of 3 periods:
Observational Period: for upto 12 weeks Treatment Period: for 52 weeks Treatment free follow up period: for a minimum of 4 weeks to a maximum of 16 weeks
Subjects rolling over from CLOU064A2201 will be assigned to one of the periods as follows:
Subjects with a UAS7≥16 at Week 12 or Week 16 will directly enter the treatment period. (Subjects with a UAS7&lt;16 at Week 12 of CLOU064A2201 enter the follow-up period of CLOU064A2201)
Subjects with a UAS7&lt;16 at Week 16 (i.e., who have not relapsed during the follow-up period of CLOU064A2201) will be assigned to the observational period.
After relapse (UAS7≥16 at least once), the observational period can be terminated immediately and subjects may enter the treatment period. Subjects who have never relapsed within 12 weeks will discontinue the study after the observational period.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed.

             adhere to the study visit schedules.

          -  Subjects rolling over from CLOU064A2201 must have completed the Week 12 visit (end of
             treatment period) or the Week 16 visit (end of the follow-up period) and will be
             allocated to the treatment period or the observational period of CLOU064A2201E1 based
             on the UAS7 score (of the 7 days prior to the respective visit) as follows:

               -  Subjects rolling over at Week 12 of CLOU064A2201 with a UAS7≥16 will be allocated
                  to the Treatment period (note: subjects with UAS7&lt;16 at Week 12 are not eligible
                  to roll-over into CLOU064A2201E1 but need to enter the follow-up period of
                  CLOU064A2201).

               -  Subjects rolling over at Week 16 of CLOU064A2201 with a UAS7≥16 will be allocated
                  to the Treatment period.

               -  Subjects rolling over at Week 16 of CLOU064A2201 with a UAS7&lt;16 will be allocated

               -  Resting QTcF ≥450 msec (male) or ≥460 msec (female) at day 1 of the treatment
                  period or inability to determine the QTcF interval

               -  Use of agents known to prolong the QT interval unless it can be permanently
                  discontinued for the duration of study

          -  Significant bleeding risk or coagulation disorders

          -  Known or suspected history of an ongoing, chronic or recurrent infectious disease
