      The primary objective with this study is to investigate the short-term efficacy (primary
      endpoint at week 3) of Internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) provided soon
      after trauma. The secondary objective is to investigate the long-term efficacy (primary
      endpoint at week 7) of ICBT. 100 participants recently exposed to a potentially traumatic
      event will be randomised to either ICBT or assessment only.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

      The primary objective with this study is to investigate the short-term efficacy (primary
      endpoint at week 3) of Internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) provided soon
      after trauma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES The secondary objective is to investigate the long-term efficacy
      (primary endpoint at week 7) of ICBT.

      Trial design: Randomized trial where participants are allocated to either ICBT (n=50) or
      control group (assessment only; n=50). Participants randomized to control group are
      subsequently offered identical ICBT treatment, so that all participants will eventually
      receive treatment.

      All participants are assessed at baseline (W0), post-treatment (primary endpoint; W3) and at
      one-month follow-up (secondary endpoint; W7). Long-term follow-up assessments are also
      conducted at 6- and 12-months. The primary outcome measure is also measured weekly from
      baseline and up to the 1-month follow-up (W7).

      Primary outcome measure used are the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic
      and Statical Manual, Fifth Edition (PCL-5). Secondary outcome measures used are Montgomery
      Åsberg Depression Rating Scale - Self-report (MADRS-S), Euroqol (EQ-5D) and Trimbos and
      Institute of Medical Technology Assessment Cost Questionnaire for Psychiatry (TIC-P).

      Participants are self-referred through advertisements in newspapers, web-pages, social media
      and at primary care, psychiatric and emergency clinics throughout Sweden. Interested
      applicants do an Internet-administered screening on an encrypted webpage using the PCL-5,
      MADRS-S, Alcohol User Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), Drug User Disorders
      Identification Test (DUDIT), TIC-P, questions about inclusion and exclusion criteria and also
      give general background information. Written information about the study is given including
      objectives, benefits, risks and requirements imposed by the study.

      An assessor calls the participant and conducts a structured clinical interview including The
      Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.). The aim of this interview is to
      preliminary assess inclusion criteria and rule out exclusion criteria. Information is also
      given over the phone by the interviewer about the study protocol.

      Safety parameters Participants will have the opportunity to report any adverse events during
      treatment, at posttreatment and follow-up assessment.

      Data collection: Data will be collected electronically via the treatment platform.

      Main statistical analysis: Between-group estimates on outcome are done using a mixed-effects
      regression model with repeated measurements. All analyses will be done according to intention
      to treat and post hoc per protocol analyses will also be conducted.

    <time_frame>Baseline, weekly from baseline up to 1-month follow-up, 6 month follow up and 12 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Change in symptoms of post traumatic stress from baseline, during treatment to post treatment and follow up (6 and 12 months). The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) is a 20-item self-report measure that assesses the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms. All items are scored on a 0-4 scale. Higher score indicate worse severity.</description>

    <description>Change in depressive symptoms from baseline to post treatment and follow up (1, 6 and 12 months). The Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale - Self-report (MADRS-S) is a 9 item self-report measure that assesses the presence and severity of depressive symptoms. All items are scored on a 0-6 scale. Higher score indicate worse severity.</description>

    <measure>Euroqol, EQ-5D</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post treatment week 3, one-month follow up, 6 month follow up and 12 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Change in overall health from baseline to post treatment and follow up (1, 6 and 12 months). EQ-5D is a standardised self-report measure of overall health status measured in terms of five dimensions; mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Mobility dimension asks about the person's walking ability. Self-care dimension asks about the ability to wash or dress by oneself, and usual activities dimension measures performance in &quot;work, study, housework, family or leisure activities&quot;. In pain/discomfort dimension, it asks how much pain or discomfort they have, and in anxiety/depression dimension, it asks how anxious or depressed they are. The respondents self-rate their level of severity for each dimension using a three-level scale: 1 having no problems, 2 having some problems and 3 having extreme problems. A higher score indicate worse severity.</description>

    <description>Change in economic costs from baseline, post treatment, 1 month, 6 month and 12 months follow up. TIC-P collect data on medical consumption and productivity losses in patients with mild to moderate mental health problems. A higher score indicate worse severity.</description>
