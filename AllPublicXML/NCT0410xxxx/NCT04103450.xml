          -  Participant has the ability to continue to receive a stable dose of Benign Prostatic
             Hyperplasia (BPH) treatment with either a) alpha blocker monotherapy or b) alpha

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, the participant is able and willing to comply with

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant experienced any Serious Adverse Event in Study URO-901-3005 that was

          -  Participant is using any prohibited medications

          -  Participant has uncontrolled hyperglycemia (defined as fasting blood glucose &gt;150
             milligrams per deciliter [mg/dL] or 8.33 millimoles per Liter [mmol/L] and/or
             non-fasting blood glucose &gt;200 mg/dL or 11.1 mmol/L) based on most recent available
