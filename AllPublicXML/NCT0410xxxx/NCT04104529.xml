      Development of a prospective clinico-biological database allowing the provision of clinical
      data and corresponding biological materials to the medical and scientific community.

    <textblock>
      Targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) aims at delivering ionizing radiation specifically to
      tumors for therapeutic purposes. Different types of radionuclides can be used to deliver the
      radiation: beta emitters less (Iodine-131, Lutecium-177), alpha (Radium-223) or Auger
      (Indium-111). They will target tumor cells either by natural tropism (iodine for thyroid
      cancer, for example) or by coupling them to a vector (antibody, peptide ...).

      Patients with thyroid cancer, prostate cancer or neuroendocrine tumors who should benefit
      form TRT may be included in this project. The clinical-biological database will help better
      understanding of the radiobiological mechanisms of action of ionizing radiations on both
      normal tissues and tumor cells and the psycho-oncological mechanisms involved in patients
      treated with TRT. The collected data will help treatment optimization.

      To meet these demands, the research must then integrate databases creation open to
      researchers and the ongoing evaluation of the impact of projects on the health of cancer
      patients. Integrated research associated with quality biological research is the guarantee of
      medical progress. The multidisciplinary structure around collections of biological resources
      will enable the various actors to harmonize not only the collection but also the sharing of
      their data with a view to making them available for medico-scientific projects at a regional
      and national dimension. The Clinical Biological Database (BCB) should be used to identify and
      characterize new molecular markers for better diagnosis and / or treatment. It should also
      permit to optimize the collection of all this information, their integration and their
      transversal exploitation by different research disciplines (epidemiological, fundamental,
      translational, clinical).
