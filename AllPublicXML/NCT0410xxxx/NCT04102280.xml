  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical investigation will be performed to generate clinical data on clearances and
      removal rates for ß2-microglobulin and other uremic toxins and on clinical adverse events of
      the modified polysulfone membrane to fulfil obligations to follow the FX P600 dialyzer in the
      market.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to test whether the FX P600 is non-inferior to the
      Xevonta Hi 15 dialyzer and the Elisio 150H dialyzer in removing β2-microglobulin related to
      the albumin removal into the dialysate during high volume online hemodiafiltration.

      The secondary objective of this study is to compare the FX P600 dialyzer with the comparator
      dialyzers with regard to their efficacies in removing other performance variables (see
      below). Furthermore, the safety of the FX P600 will be investigated by collecting and
      analyzing clinical adverse events.
