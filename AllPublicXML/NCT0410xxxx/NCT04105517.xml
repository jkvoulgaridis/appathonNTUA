  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infantile hemangioma is a benign tumor belonging to the group of vascular tumors in the ISSVA
      classification (International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies). The diagnosis is
      clinical and radiological. The hemangioma appears during the first weeks of life (70%
      classically within 2 weeks after birth) but can, when it develops in the subcutaneous tissue,
      appear until the age of 2 to 3 months .

      Its evolution is characteristic and is divided into 3 phases with a proliferative phase
      characterized by a rapid increase in the size of the tumor (up to 6 to 12 months), a phase of
      stabilization (from 12 to 36 months) with a stopping of the growth of the hemangioma and a
      regression of its size and a phase of involution with the disappearance of the lesion which
      may give way to residual fibroadipose tissue, cutaneous telangiectases, scars … The usual
      complications of haemangiomas occur during the proliferative phase. It is necrosis,
      ulcerations that can be complicated by bleeding or infection and eventually indelible
      scarring. Other complications related to the site of development of hemangiomas (amblyopia,
      astigmatism, upper respiratory obstruction, nasal obstruction, sphincter disorders, eating
      disorders), hemangiomas destroying structures noble (breast hypodévelopment, alopecia). The
      aesthetic prognosis can be seriously compromised for facial locations.

      Historically, when drug therapy was required, patient management was based on systemic
      corticosteroids (at doses of 3 to 5 mg / kg / day) in first-line therapy and vincristine as a
      second-line failure of corticosteroid therapy or when life-threatening is at stake.

      In 2014, the high French health authority (HAS) gave Marketing Authorization for Hemangiol
      3.75 mg / ml oral solution for the management of infantile proliferative hemangioma requiring
      first-line systemic treatment, evaluating the actual benefit as important.

      The selected indication concerns children from 5 weeks to 5 months with:

        -  Hemangiomas leading to a vital or functional risk,

        -  Hemangiomas ulcerated painful and / or not responding to simple care,

        -  Hemangiomas with a risk of permanent scarring or disfigurement. The 2014 HAS
           Transparency Commission wishes in its report &quot;to have follow-up data of prescriptions
           allowing to describe on a representative sample of patients, the characteristics of the
           treated patients, the indication, the doses and the durations of treatment of this
           specialty &quot;.

      The objective of our study is to describe the use of Hemangiol in current practice in our
      hospital from 2014 to 2018.

      This study is retrospective, longitudinal, descriptive and observational. Children aged 0 to
      1 years hospitalized for introduction of Hemangiol between January 2014 and November 2018
      will be included. Patients refuse the use of medical data will be excluded.

      The main objective is to describe the population who received Hemangiol. The secondary
      objectives is to evaluate

        -  the effectiveness of Hemangiol on proliferative infantile hemangiomas, -the tolerance of
           Hemangiol in children with proliferative infantile hemangiomas

        -  the interest of systematic cardiological consultation in children with proliferative
           infantile hemangiomas receiving Hemangiol

      The following criteria will be collected

      Demographic description: age, sex, height, weight

      Personal history

      Description of the hemangioma:

        -  organ concerned: skin, liver, parotid, mixed.

        -  location: head, thorax, pelvis, limbs, diffuse ...

        -  single or multiple

        -  indication of treatment: aesthetic, functional, ulcerated, cardiac hyperacidity

      Rhythm of follow-up: duration of treatment and observance of treatment

      Prescribed dose: 1, 2, 3 or 4 mg / kg / day in 2 doses

      Evolution of the hemangioma: progression, regression, stagnation. Needed a second medical
      therapeutic line by specifying the treatment introduced. Necessity of surgical management by
      specifying the delay between surgery and the introduction of treatment

      Description of serious adverse events: hypotension, bradycardia, bronchospasm, hypoglycaemia.
      Description of other adverse events.

      Number of cardio-pediatric consultations, specifying:

        -  incidence of diagnosed heart disease through systematic cardiac consultation

        -  effect on ECG data of increasing dosage of Hemangiol: heart rate, PR duration, QRS
           duration, QT duration
