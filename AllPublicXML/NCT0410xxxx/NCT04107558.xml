      The main purposes of this study are as follows:

      Compare the effect of painful stimuli with and without Hypnosis and Virtual Reality (HVR) on
      healthy volunteers.

        -  Use of sensors and captors to monitor physiological and neurophysiological changes by
           painful stimulus

        -  Monitor level of pain and anxiety with and without HVR

        -  Monitor level of unpleasantness of the pain with and without HVR

        -  Monitor level of Anxiety, Absorption, Dissociation, Satisfaction and Comfort with and
           without HVR

      The control of pain and anxiety in a hospital environment is usually managed by
      pharmacological means that involve a series of risks and side effects.

      For many years, non-drug solutions have been of interest to the public and the care staff.
      The benefits of hypnosis and of virtual reality are highlighted in many studies and today
      allow a different approach to medicine. It is important to invest in tools that are less
      expensive and also effective for the well-being of the patient and the care staff. The use of
      a blended solution using both clinical hypnosis and virtual reality has been only scarcely
      documented.
