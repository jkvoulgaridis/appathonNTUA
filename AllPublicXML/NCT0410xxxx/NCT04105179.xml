  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares two total knee replacement implants to asses muscle function and quality,
      and the immune response to the implants. 30 patients will receive the Smith and Nephew
      Journey II implant, while 30 patients will receive the Zimmer NexGen LPS-flex implant. 15
      healthy controls will also be recruited and compared.

  <detailed_description>

      Patients will undergo biomechanics testing while they complete sit-to-stand, stand-to-sit,
      lateral step down, level walking, and single leg balance tasks up to 1 month before surgery,
      and 6 and 12 months after surgery. They will also undergo MRI imaging up to 1 month before
      surgery and 12 months after surgery to assess muscle quality. A secondary outcome will also
      be to analyze the immunological response in the patients who received femoral components made
      of oxidized zirconium versus contemporary components made of cobalt chrome. Fifteen healthy
      controls will also participate in the study and will undergo the biomechanical, MRI and blood
      draws at a single visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The participants receiving a knee implant must requiring a total knee replacement

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any degenerative conditions (other than osteoarthritis at the affected knee) impacting
             joints of the lower extremities

          -  bilateral knee replacements

          -  previous joint replacement at the affected knee

          -  any other past or present conditions that may impact gait

          -  any active infection and any diagnosed conditions that may affect the local and
             systemic immune response (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, HIV infection, lupus, pregnancy,
             and thrombocytosis)

          -  BMI and waist circumference (WC) will be another exclusion criterion since both BMI
             and WC are associated with health problems and gait abnormalities. Any patient with
             both BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2 and a WC &gt; 102 cm in men or &gt; 88 cm in women will be excluded from
             the study.

        Healthy Controls Inclusion

          -  controls must not suffer from lower extremity injuries or joint conditions that might
             alter gait dynamics Exclusion

          -  BMI and waist circumference (WC) will be another exclusion criterion since both BMI
             and WC are associated with health problems and gait abnormalities. Any patient with
             both BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2 and a WC &gt; 102 cm in men or &gt; 88 cm in women will be excluded from
             the study
