  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial was to assess glycemic control and incretin release in subjects
      affected by type-2 diabetes, a condition in which GLP-1 release is impaired. It is known that
      nutrition affects a variety of factors in overall quality of life in diabetes and we
      hypothesized incretin secretion may improve in acute. As little is known regarding
      oxyntomodulin secretion in relation to diet, we explored this gut-derived hormone behavior as
      well.

      Hence, the administration of two meals was carried out; these were equal in terms of calories
      but different for macronutrients composition. Appetite rating was assessed as well through a
      100-mm horizontal Visual Analogue Scale, either at fasting and for 4 hours once the meal was
      completed.

    <textblock>
      Type-2 diabetes (T2D) is a multifactorial metabolic burden whose metabolic features include
      alterations in GLP-1 secretion and ultimately hunger/satiety circuit derangement.
      Manipulating the composition of the diet in order to promote GLP-1 secretion may represent a
      promising lifestyle strategy for obesity and T2D management.

      The objective of this study was to assess the post-prandial profile of appetite- regulating
      hormones and assessing the post-prandial appetite ratings using a Visual Analogue Scale
      (VAS), as well as measuring the fasting and postprandial glucose/insulin responses in
      overweight and/or obese, well controlled patients with T2D.

      Twelve T2D patients (M:F = 7:5) aged 63.1±8.5 years were enrolled in a randomized,
      controlled, crossover trial. Subjects consumed on two different days, at one-week interval,
      an experimental High Fiber Vegetarian meal (HFV) rich in dietary carbohydrate and fiber in
      comparison with a standard, Mediterranean-like meal (MED). The two meals were isocaloric.
      Appetite ratings, glucose/insulin and gastrointestinal hormone responses were assessed either
      at fasting and every 30' until 210' for GLP-1 and Oxyntomodulin and 240' for glucose and
      insulin after the ingestion of the meal.

    <description>We assessed VAS scores in relation to meals through the quantification of self-reported hunger, satiety, and desire to eat. Participants were asked to mark a validated 10-mm horizontal scale (Visual analogue scale) at multiple time points [0' (fasting), +30', +60', +90', +120', +150', +180, +210', +240' (minutes)]. These ratings were subsequently quantified and assessed for potential correlation with any of the hormones assessed (i.e., GLP-1, oxyntomodulin, glucose, and insulin). Each scale had a left end equal to zero mm (i.e., &quot;not at all&quot;) and a right end equal to 100 mm (i.e., &quot;absolutely&quot; or &quot;definitely yes&quot;), with no subscales. Each participant was instructed on how to fill the questionnaire properly and every assessment occurred with no disturbance and/or any other patient.</description>
