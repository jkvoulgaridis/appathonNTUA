  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized controlled trial evaluating the clinical and cost-effectiveness of
      Tuning in to Kids (TIK) compared to treatment as usual (TAU). Participants are recruited
      among referred children aged 2-5 years with difficulties with emotion regulation. The study
      setting is Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services clinics. Parents of children
      randomized to TIK will attend 8 two-hourly group sessions. A brief version of TIK will be
      offered to the child's daycare teacher. Participants are assessed at baseline, week 12 and
      month 9 after inclusion. The primary clinical outcome is Coping with Toddlers' Negative
      Emotions Scale.
