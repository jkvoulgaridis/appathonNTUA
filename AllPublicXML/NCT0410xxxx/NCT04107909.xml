  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various modifications have been tried in laparoscopic cholecystectomy since its introduction.
      One, two and three port LC have been performed on limited scale. we aim to compare three port
      LC with four port LC in patients with cholelithiasis. The main objective of this study is to
      evaluate the outcome of 3 ports LC for treatment of cholelithiasis by comparing the result
      with 4 ports LC with respect to safety and efficacy.

    <description>Both four port and three port LC is performed With the patient in supine position, with the surgeon and assistant on the left side and the monitor on the right side. Head up and right up position is employed during surgery in both the groups. Pneumoperitoneum of 12mmHg is created using open Hassan's method through the umbilical port.
In 3 port a 5.5 mm umbilical visiport for 5 mm lens 30 degree A second 10 mm trocar is placed inferior to the sternum at the midline, while the third 5mm trocar is placed 4-5cm inferior to the right costal margin on the right midclavicular line. For the four port LC, additional 5mm port is placed in the sub costal region at the anterior axillary line. Posterior dissection and delineation of The Calot's triangle is done. Then, the cystic artery and cystic duct are identified, isolated, doubly clipped and divided. The gallbladder is removed through the umbilical port using a 10mm gallbladder extractor.</description>
