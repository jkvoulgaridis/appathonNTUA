    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is a common health problem among older adults and their informal caregivers.
      Chronic pain has negative effects on physical and psychological health status and it is a
      strong predictor of poor quality of life. In this study, a dyadic face-to-face pain
      management program will be provided to older adults and informal caregivers to help the dyads
      equip with pain-related knowledge and pain coping skills. The effectiveness of the dyadic
      program will be assessed. Participants will be recruited follow snowball sampling and will be
      randomly allocated to experimental group and control group using 1: 1 radio. The dyadic pain
      management program will last four weeks, including group discussion, pain-related knowledge
      and physical exercises. Pain intensity, anxiety, depression, stress, pain self-efficacy and
      quality of life will be measured in baseline, post-treatment and at one-month follow.
      Acceptability and satisfaction to the program will be collected.

      This study will be held in Caritas District Elderly Centre-Yeun Long (Tin Chak Centre) and
      Caritas Cheng Shing Fung District Elderly Center (Shamshuipo) in Hong Kong. For sample size,
      no suitable standard deviation and effect size was found in previous similar study through
      the literature review, so this study will be a pilot RCT study with a total 60 dyads of
      sample size. 30 older adults and 30 informal caregivers will be in each group (experimental
      group and control group). The dyadic pain management program will be held in the community
      activity center at weekends and will involve three parts: demographic data, outcome measures
      (baseline, post-treatment and one-month follow-up measures) and pain education.

      Potential participants' eligibility will be confirmed by a questionnaire designed according
      to inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria. An information sheet will be provided to the
      eligible dyads and informed consent will be signed on the scene. Experimental group will
      start pain management program when finish the baseline assessment and control group will be
      given one page of pain management information download from Department of Health.
      (http://www.elderly.gov.hk/english/common_health_problems/bones_and_joints/index.html). For
      optimal communication, two WhatsApp groups will be created consisting of all the caregivers
      in experimental group and control group respectively.

      Outcomes will be measured at three times during the whole intervention, T0 baseline prior to
      intervention, T1 in week four when the experimental group finish all the program and T2 in
      week eight with one-month follow-up after the program. Dyads' demographic and
      caregiving-related questions will be completed prior to beginning the program in T0. Pain
      related situations, anxiety, depression, stress, quality of life, pain self-efficacy will be
      measured from older adults and informal caregivers at T0, T1, T2, using a same battery of
      questionnaires. Dyads' acceptability and satisfaction will be administered immediately after
      the last session. Data will be collected by a research assistant blinded to the dyads' group
      assignments.

      Outcome measures It is a dyadic intervention so outcomes will be measured from older adults
      and informal caregivers.

      Primary outcome The Brief Pain Inventory-Chinese Version It is a tool to evaluate the
      intensity, site, quality, relief, interference and causes of pain in patients. Four items for
      the degree of pain severity, one item for the degree of pain relief and seven items for
      degree of pain interferes will assess, numbering the different pain sites from 0 to 10. For
      BPI-C, the Cronbach's Î± for the pain severity and pain interference items are 0.83-0.89 and
      0.90-0.91 and has good acceptable test-retest reliability .

      Secondary outcomes:

      World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief It is a self-report questionnaire which
      assesses 4 domains of quality of life, including physical health, psychological health,
      social relationships, and environment. Participants will express how much they have
      experienced in the preceding two weeks on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all)
      to 5 (completely). Previous studies showed that WHOQOL-BRIF has good internal consistency and
      validity.

      Depression Anxiety Stress Scale It is a self-administered psychological instrument to
      evaluate the degree of depression, anxiety and stress involving 21 items. Every part has
      seven items on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 3. The instrument was used in
      previous studies and had good internal consistency and validity.

      Pain Self-efficacy Questionnaire It is a tool to measure the self-efficacy in coping with
      daily activities with pain . A Chinese version of the PSEQ will be used in this study.
      Participants will express participants' confidence in performing ten activities experiencing
      pain on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all confident) to 6 (completely
      cinfident). Previous studies illustrated the test-rest reliability coefficient of PSEQ was
      0.75 and internal consistency, Cronbach's alpha was 0.95, which was reliable .

      Satisfaction and acceptability Participants' satisfaction and acceptability of the dyadic
      intervention will be assessed at the end of the grogram. Some open-ended questions will be
      asked, including &quot;What topics, content, or concepts could have been covered in more/less
      detail?&quot; &quot;As a result of participating in dyadic pain management intervention, did you make
      some positive changes in your life?&quot; &quot;Would you feel the group discussions interesting and
      informative? Did the activities and exercises relieve your pain symptom?&quot; These questions
      were used in previous studies to evaluate the satisfaction and acceptability of intervention
      program.

The DASS-21 is a set of three self-reported scales designed to measure the emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress. Each of the three DASS-21 scales contains 7 items and divided into subscales. The score of each item ranges feom 0 to 3 (o = do not apply to me at all, 3 = applied to me very much or most of the time). Total score is multiplied by 2 of the sum of each subscales. Higher score indicates the greater degree of the symptom.</description>

    <description>Changes from baseline to Week 4 and one-month after the intervention in pain self-efficacy using Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ). PSEQ is a 10-item questionnaire assessing the confidence people with ongoing pain have in performing activities while in pain. Score of each item ranges from 0 to 6 (0 = not at all confident, 6 = completely confident). A total score is calculated by adding the scores for each item which ranging from 0 to 60. Higher scores reflect stronger self-efficacy beliefs.</description>
