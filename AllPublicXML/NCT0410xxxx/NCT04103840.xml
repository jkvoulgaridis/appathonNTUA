  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic alcohol consumption is associated with intestinal bacterial dysbiosis, yet little is
      known about the role of intestinal fungi, or mycobiota in liver disease. Although the
      intestinal microbiome contains bacteria, fungi, and viruses, research in the field of liver
      disease has almost exclusively focused on the interaction between the host and gut bacteria.
      The fungal microbiota is an integral part of the gastrointestinal micro-ecosystem with up to
      106 microorganisms per gram of faeces. Numerous interactions between fungi and bacteria and
      the complex immune response to gastrointestinal commensal or pathogenic fungi have been
      demonstrated in prior studies. Alcohol-dependent patients display a reduced intestinal fungal
      diversity and Candida overgrowth. Compared with healthy individuals and patients with
      non-alcohol-related cirrhosis, alcoholic cirrhosis patients also demonstrate systemic
      exposure and immune response to mycobiota. Thus, chronic alcohol consumption is associated
      with an altered mycobiota and translocation of fungal products. Manipulating the intestinal
      mycobiome might be an effective strategy for attenuating alcohol-related liver disease
      especially alcoholic hepatitis. In this study, we will attempt to find out the natural fungal
      mycobiome in Severe alcoholic hepatitis when compared with apparently healthy asymptomatic
      controls from their family. This will allow us to therapeutically modify the unbalanced gut
      microbiota and improve patient outcomes. Secondly, it will provide further insight as to why
      alcohol-associated hepatitis patients are particularly susceptible to fungal infections. In
      the age of frequent antibacterial drug therapy, the role of commensal and pathogenic fungi in
      the human gut has gained paramount importance.

      The patients of severe alcohol-associated hepatitis admitted under Department of Hepatology,
      in Liver intensive Care Unit (LICU) Male or Female medical wards or coming to follow up in
      Liver clinic of Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India
      from will be screened for enrolment after ethical approval from the institute ethics
      committee. Both previously compensated and decompensated patients will be enrolled in this
      prospective observational pilot study. All patients will be followed up at 30 and 90 days
      from inclusion into the study.

      Estimation of sample size Sample size will be estimated based on previous studies. This is a
      pilot prospective observational study. Based on currently available data from our centre on
      acute-on chronic liver failure, 22.5% of cirrhotics have suspected IFI, and up to 25% of SAH
      have suspicion for IFI, it is estimated that a total sample size of 60 patients would be
      required, with an effect size of 0.5, alpha 0.05, and power 0.85. Therefore, 80 patients will
      be required to enroll to account for 15% attrition. Hence, we propose to enroll 80
      consecutive patients with SAH with 80 matched controls from their family starting from 15th
      August 2019.
