  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caries prevalence in the Dominican Republic (DR) seems high, although recent information is
      lacking. In DR there is a growth and development program for all children from the age of 0
      to 5.Even though there is a mandatory educational health program for children and parents in
      this program, where periodically pediatricians examine them, this program does not include
      oral health education/prevention. Thus, it is proposed A) to devise materials to be used by
      pediatricians to share relevant information about caries control to parents of toddlers, and
      B) to evaluate the impact of such material on caries prevention for groups of toddlers over a
      1.5-year period. Educational material will be developed for parents, and the pediatricians
      will deliver this material to 10-months-old children randomly selected at Plaza de la Salud
      Hospital. The PI will train the pediatricians in caries prevention and how to deliver the
      information to the parents in a clear manner. A total of 306 will be allocated into two
      groups. The experimental group (128 children) will receive the devised educational materials
      at 10 months, follow-up information will be provided at growth and development visits when
      the child is 18-, and 24 months old. The second group will be considered as the control group
      and will not receive any educational materials (178 children). All the enrolled children will
      receive fluoride containing toothpaste and tooth brushes. After 18 months when the children
      will be about 3 years old they will be examined to assess dental caries status. A sample
      mortality rate of 40% is expected during the two-year follow-up. Differences in caries status
      between the two groups will be examined using Welch's independent t-tests for unequal
      variances.

    <description>Printed and online educational materials were developed and provided to pediatricians so they can share relevant information about caries control to parents of toddlers. A previous interview was performed to pediatricians as focus groups to know how they are doing their evaluations and what do they take into account during the children visits in order to identify where to focus for the training what it is necessary to change. After that pediatricians were trained to give oral health recommendations. So, to the intervention group, the pediatricians will give these recommendations to the parents and also they will give them a printed educational material previously developed for the project.</description>
