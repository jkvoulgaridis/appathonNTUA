  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim: Male circumcision is one of the oldest and most commonly performed surgical procedures
      in the world and in our country. Circumcision, which concerns such a large population, is a
      stressful, traumatic, negative experience. Impairment in comfort is a condition in which a
      child who is scheduled for circumcision operation often suffers. Physical, emotional,
      sociocultural and environmental factors contribute to the formation of this condition.
      Comfort Theory is a nursing model that makes it easier for the caregivers to see their
      problems more systematically and to plan more easily. In the literature review, no studies
      have been found to determine the effect of nursing care based on Kolcaba Konfors Comfort
      Theory to the comfort and components of the children and their parents who have undergone
      circumcision operation. Therefore, this study was needed. In this study, nursing care based
      on Kolcaba's Comfort Theory, which continues throughout the perioperative period, was applied
      to children and their parents.

      Method: In this study, the effect of nursing care based on Kolcaba's Comfort Theory on fear,
      anxiety, pain, comfort and anxiety in parents and health care satisfaction was tested in
      children. Care was given when the child and his / her parents applied to the outpatient
      clinic for anesthesia consultation on the working day before the operation, and care was
      continued in the day surgery unit. On the 1st and 3rd days after discharge, the researcher
      provided tele-monitoring and consultancy services. In addition, communication with the
      parents was maintained at all times as needed. Care was terminated on the 10th day after
      discharge. The time of the study was approximately 12-14 days for each child and his / her
      parents.

      The sample of the study was determined as 120 boys and their parents (60 control each, 60
      intervention each). In this study, standard nursing care will be applied to the control group
      and nursing care based on Kolcaba's Comfort Theory will be applied to the intervention group.
      The data will be collected with the Child and Family Descriptive, VAS, Children's State
      Anxiety (CSA) and Children's Fear Scale (CFS), Comfort Behavior Checklist, Spielberger State
      Anxiety Scale, PedsQL Health Care Satisfaction Scale.

      Nursing care consists of 3 types of comfort-oriented care interventions. These interventions;

        1. Standard maintenance interventions,

        2. Emotional focused comfort care interventions,

        3. Cognitive and functional comfort care interventions.

    <measure>Comfort Behaviors Checklist</measure>
    <time_frame>In two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Comfort Behaviors Checklist was developed in 1989 by Kolcaba. Developed as a last resort, data collectors are used to rate a patient's apparent comfort. While not as desirable as actually asking a patient about his or her comfort, the instrument can fill a gap regarding data collection in comatose, very frail (as in terminal), or cognitively limited patients. Kolcaba and DiMarco (2005) reported that postoperative comfort in children can be assessed using the Comfort Behavior Checklist. The reliability and validity study of our country was conducted by Unutkan and Balcı Yangın (2018).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>In two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The pain VAS is a continuous scale comprised of a horizontal (HVAS) or vertical (VVAS) line, usually 10 centimeters (100 mm) in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors, one for each symptom extreme. Instructions, time period for reporting, and verbal descriptor anchors have varied widely in the literatüre. For pain intensity, the scale is most commonly anchored by &quot;no pain&quot; (score of 0) and &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot; or &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot; (score of 100 [100‐mm scale]). Varies, but most commonly respondents are asked to report &quot;current&quot; pain intensity or pain intensity &quot;in the last 24 hours.&quot; A higher score indicates greater pain intensity. Based on the distribution of pain VAS scores in postsurgical patients who described their postoperative pain intensity as none, mild, moderate, or severe, the following cut points on the pain VAS have been recommended: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain (5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75- 100 mm)</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Children's Fear Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>In two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It was developed by McMurty et al. (2011). The validity and reliability study of the Turkish Children's Fear Scale was conducted by Özalp Gerçeker and colleagues in 2017. The scale can be used to assess fear in children aged 4-10 years. The CFS consists of five drawn facial expressions ranging from neutral expression (0 = no anxiety) to the frightened face (4 = severe anxiety), and can be easily evaluated by parents, researchers, and healthcare professionals who care for the child. It is a scale of one item. CFS was developed based on the Faces Anxiety Scale developed to measure the anxiety or fear of adults in the intensive care unit of McKinley et al. (2003).</description>

    <measure>Children's Anxiety Meter-State (CAM-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>In two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The scale was developed by Ersig et al. (2013). The Turkish validity and reliability study of the scale was conducted by Özalp Gerçeker et al. The scale can be used to assess anxiety in children aged 4-10 years. The score can vary from 0 to 10 (Ersig et al., 2013)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>In two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In the study, STAI will be used to determine the anxiety of parents. It was developed by Spielberger et al. (1970). The Turkish validity and reliability study of the STAI was conducted by Öner and Le Compte in 1983. The scale is a 4-point Likert type and contains two 20-item expressions. Direct expressions express negative emotions and reversed expressions express positive emotions. It was reported that the Cronbach Alpha internal consistency coefficient ranged between α = 0.83 and 0.87 (Sarıtaş and Büyükbayram, 2016).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The PedsQL (Pediatric Quality of Life InventoryTM)</measure>
    <time_frame>In two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PedsQL will be used to measure the level of health care satisfaction of parents. The scale consists of 25 questions. The questions in the scale are aimed at measuring satisfaction with medical care services and psychosocial satisfaction. Cronbach Alpha internal consistency coefficient of the scale, which was validated by Varni (1999), was found to be α = .96. Scale was adapted to Turkish by Ulus and Kublay (2012).</description>
