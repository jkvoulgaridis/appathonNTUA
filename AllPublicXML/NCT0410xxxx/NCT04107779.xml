      A Randomized, Open Label, Parallel Group Study in Adult Smokers to Evaluate Changes in
      Biomarkers of Cigarette Smoke Exposure After Switching Either Exclusively or Partly to using
      JUUL Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems With Two Different Nicotine Concentrations
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies and data reported in the literature support that Electronic Nicotine
      Delivery Systems (ENDS) have less toxicant exposure. This study will serve as a clinical
      evaluation of exclusive-use of selected JUUL ENDS in 2 different nicotine concentrations (5%,
      3%), with the purpose of gaining data to support the hypothesis that exclusive-use of JUUL
      ENDS over the course of 6 days will result in a significant reduction in toxicant exposure
      compared to combustible cigarettes.

      This will be a randomized, open label, parallel group study in adult smokers to be conducted
      at up to 5 sites in the United States. Changes in Biomarkers of Exposure (BoEs) from baseline
      when using four JUUL ENDS with 2 different nicotine concentrations (5%, 3%) relative to Usual
      Brand (UB) of combustible cigarettes and a study group abstaining from any tobacco/nicotine
      product use will be assessed in this study. JUUL ENDS will be used either exclusively or
      partially (dual-use), with subjects in the dual-use group using both JUUL 5% ENDS (choice of
      Virginia Tobacco (VT), Mint, Menthol or Mango flavors) and UB of combustible cigarettes.
