  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapeutic approaches targeting immune checkpoint proteins PD-1/PD-L1 have recently
      demonstrated clinical efficacy in several cancer types, and have changed the therapeutic
      landscape in metastatic melanoma or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      The monoclonal anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab has been registered by both FDA (Food and Drug
      Administration) and EMA (European Medicine Agency), for metastatic NSCLC patients, after
      failure of a prior platinum-based chemotherapy.

      The approval was based on the results of phase III clinical trials in metastatic NSCLC. But
      all the trials only enrolled patients with good general condition, PS (Performance Status) 0
      or 1. However, the prevalence of poor PS patients at time of diagnosis is high in lung cancer
      patients.

      For patients with metastatic NSCLC and PS 3, there is no standard treatment except best
      supportive care, since all trials that accrued unselected PS 3 patients fail to prove any
      survival advantage, and most PS &gt;3 patients die within 2 to 4 months from diagnosis. Indeed,
      these patients are currently excluded from clinical trials. Specific dedicated clinical
      trials and treatment guidelines for this patient population are urgently needed, taking into
      account for the high prevalence of such patients.
