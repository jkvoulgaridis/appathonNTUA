  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates treatment with the dietary supplement µSmin® Plus in a group of patients
      suffering from chronic venous insufficiency in comparison with a similarly-sized group of
      patients receiving placebo evaluated by quality of life questionnaires, VAS pain scale, CVI
      symptomatology, and change in the circumference of the affected leg at calf level
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study we use a dietary supplement - µSmin® Plus - for symptomatic treatment of CVI
      and we will monitor its impact on CVI symptoms, features, and consequences (item) of the
      disease listed below: limb edema, walking, daily tasks performance, pain/burning symptoms,
      pruritus/paresthesis, sensation of heaviness/fatigue, time wasted in the management of the
      disease, social burden, disease impact on self-confidence, and its impact on physical
      exercise/recreational activities. Results of related clinical trials were published before
      showing that this is an active field in clinical reasearch.

    <intervention_model_description>Diosmin is a naturally occurring flavonoid present in citrus fruits and other plants belonging to the Rutaceae family. It is used for the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) for its pheblotonic and vaso-active properties, safety and tolerability as well.
µSmin® Plus is a proprietary flavonoid complex with enhanced bio-efficacy. It contains highly concentrated micronized and standardized Diosmin. Highly improved bioavailability and improved oral absorption by micronization of the particles.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>56 days</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life is assessed by ChronIc Venous Insuficiency quality of life Questionnaire ( CIVIQ-20 questionnaire ). The 20-item questionnaire, provides a global index and an outline of 4 quality-of-life dimensions—&quot;pain&quot; (4 items), &quot;physical&quot; (4 items), &quot;psychological&quot; (9 items), and &quot;social&quot; (3 items). Items on the CIVIQ-20 scale were scored from 1 to 5. There are 20 questions in the CIVIQ-20, each with 5 possible answers (1 to 5), the minimum possible score being 20 and the maximum 100. In order to calculate the GIS, the difference between the final score and the minimum possible score is to be divided by the difference between the theoretical maximum and minimum scores (100-20=80), multiplied by 100. A low score will correspond to greater patient comfort.</description>

    <description>To evaluate the efficacy of the dietary supplement µSmin® Plus on ameliorating the symptoms of Chronic Venous Insufficiency in terms of change in the circumference of affected legs and quality of life, in comparison with placebo, from baseline to week 8 visit; The unit for this measurement is centimeter.</description>

    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS scale ) from 0 to 10 for pain measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>56 days</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analogue Scale is a straight horizontal line of 100 mm. The ends are defined as the extreme limits of the pain (symptom, pain, health) orientated from the left (worst) to the right (best). Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance in millimeters on the 10 centimeters line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity and a low score indicates a low pain intensity.</description>

The lowest possible score is 0=absent meaning that the patient has no symptoms and the highest possible score is 30=sever meaning that the patient has a very severe venous symptoms.</description>
