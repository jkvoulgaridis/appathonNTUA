  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Spain, palbociclib was launched last November 1st, 2017. However, since February 2015 the
      on-going compassionate use programme of palbociclib has enabled drug access to patients with
      RH+/HER2- breast cancer previously treated with at least 4 treatment lines for advanced
      disease. During this period, approximately 400 patients have received treatment within this
      programme. Since this population of patients more pre-treated was not included in the studies
      for regulatory submission, the collection of efficacy and toxicity data in the clinical
      practice setting is of clinical interest.
