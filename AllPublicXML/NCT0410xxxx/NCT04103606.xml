  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Body dissatisfaction represents a prevalent condition in young women, and it is associated
      with low self-esteem, depression, and symptoms of Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) and Eating
      Disorders (EDs). The aim of the trial is to test the effect of a mobile health application
      called &quot;GGBI: Positive Body Image&quot; in reducing body dissatisfaction, body dysmorphic
      disorder/eating disorder symptoms, and associated psychological features in female university
      students considered at high-risk of developing Body Image Disorders (BIDs).

      Hypothesis: Participants using &quot;GGBI: Positive Body Image&quot; immediately following baseline
      assessment (Time 0; T0) (immediate-use App group: iApp) would exhibit greater reduction in
      body dissatisfaction, body dysmorphic disorder/eating disorder symptoms, and associated
      psychological features than participants who did not use &quot;GGBI: Positive Body Image&quot; in this
      phase of the study (delayed-use App group: dApp). Following crossover (Time 1; T1), the
      investigators expect that participants gains in the iApp group would be maintained at
      follow-up (Time 2; T2).

    <description>Assessed with the Questionario sul Dismorfmismo Corporo (Questionnaire about Body Dysmorphic Disorder; QDC; Cerea et al., 2017), a self-report questionnaire assessing body dissatisfaction and body dysmorphic disorder symptoms made up of 40 items. Items are rated on a 7-point Likert scale (from 1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree; score range: 40-280), with higher scores indicating extreme body dissatisfaction and body dysmorphic disorder symptoms. Individuals who score above the cut-off of the questionnaire (QDC total score = 130) should be referred for further assessment because they might present extreme body dissatisfaction/body dysmorphic disorder symptoms or may be at risk of developing body dysmorphic disorder</description>

    <measure>Change of eating attitudes and behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>16 days</time_frame>
    <description>Eating Disorder Inventory-3 (EDI-3; Garner, 2004; Italian version by Giannini et al., 2008): a self-report questionnaire assessing eating disorders core features made up of 91 items on a 6-point Likert scale (from always to never), with higher scores indicating higher eating disorder symptoms. It contains three primary subscales: Drive for Thinness (score range = 0-28; higher scores indicating higher drive for thinness), Bulimia (score range = 0-32; higher scores indicating higher bulimic symptoms), and Body Dissatisfaction (score range = 0-40; higher scores indicating higher body dissatisfaction). These subscales compose the Eating Disorder Risk Composite (EDRC) score. The other nine additional scales are Low Self-Esteem, Personal Alienation, Interpersonal Insecurity, Interpersonal Alienation, Interoceptive Deficits, Emotional Dysregulation, Perfectionism, Asceticism, and Maturity Fears.</description>

    <description>Assessed with the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale (RSES; Rosenberg, 1965; Italian version by Prezza, Trombaccia, and Armento, 1997), a self-report questionnaire assessing self-esteem. The Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale is made up of 10 items rated on a 4-point Likert scale (from 1 = &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to 4 = &quot;strongly agree&quot; ), with higher scores indicating higher self-esteem</description>

    <measure>Change in social anxiety symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>16 days</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed with the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS; Mattick &amp; Clarke, 1998; Italian version by Sica, Musoni, Bisi, Lolli, &amp; Sighinolfi, 2007), a self-report questionnaire assessing social anxiety symptoms. The Social Interaction Anxiety Scale made up of 19 items on a 5-point Likert scale (from 0 = &quot;not at all characteristic of true of me&quot; to 4 = &quot;extremely characteristic of true of me&quot;; score range: 0-76); higher scores indicate higher levels of social interaction anxiety symptoms</description>
