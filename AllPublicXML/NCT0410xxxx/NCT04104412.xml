      This experimental use umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells in treatment of the early stage
      of lumbar discogenic pain (endogenous pain of the disc) to evaluate its safety and efficacy.

      This experimental is mainly aimed at over 18years old people, regardless of gender, with
      refractory and persistent back pain for more than 6 months.

      The efficacy and safety of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCS) were evaluated by low-temperature
      plasma ablation and intravertebral disc injection, which were divided into treatment group
      and control group.

      This experimental use umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells in treatment of the early stage
      of lumbar discogenic pain (endogenous pain of the disc) to evaluate its safety and efficacy.

      This experimental is mainly aimed at over 18years old people, regardless of gender, with
      refractory and persistent back pain for more than 6 months.

      The straight leg elevation test was 70 degrees negative. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of
      the lumbar spine showed herniated disc &lt; 6 mm, no obvious compression of spinal cord and
      nerve roots. T2-weighted mri of the lumbar spine showed decreased single/multisegment signal
      in the intervertebral disc (black disc sign) or High intensity zone (HIZ) in the posterior
      part of the intervertebral disc annulus. The clinical signs of nerve localization were
      consistent with MRI changes.

      The efficacy and safety of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCS) were evaluated by low-temperature
      plasma ablation and intravertebral disc injection, which were divided into treatment group
      and control group.

      The safety evaluation including:physical examination, vital signs, routine hematuria and
      faeces, liver and kidney function, blood lipids, electrolytes, coagulation, rapid virus
      detection, tumor markers, electrocardiogram and adverse reaction records at the 3, 6, 12 and
      24 weeks before and after treatment.

      The prime efficacy evaluation is VAS( visual analogue scale) at the 3, 6, 12 and 24 weeks
      before and after treatment.

    <measure>Validity evaluation by detection the change of the VAS pain score relief rate for Lumbar disc pain of participants in different time point and compare with the VAS pain score before treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Recording the VAS scores at 3, 6, 12 and 24 weeks after the operation and compare with the VAS score before the operation.
Pain relief rate =(VAS before treatment - VAS after treatment)/VAS before treatment ×100%.
VAS scale Use a line with 10 centimeters long as a point between 1 and 10
0 points, no pain, no pain sensation;
1-3 points, mild pain, no effect
4-6 points, moderate pain, affecting work but not life;
7-10 points, severe pain, severe pain, affect work and life.
Efficacy evaluation: more than 75% is the basic remission; 50%-75% is effective; 25%-50% effective; Less than 25% is invalid.
e.g. the VAS score before the operation is 8, the score in the third week after operation is 6, the pain relief rate is (8-6)/8x 100%=14.3% the VAS score before the operation is 8, the score in the sixth week after operation is 3, the pain relief rate is (8-3)/8x 100%=62.5%</description>

    <description>Secondary measures were assessed at 3, 6, 12 and 24 weeks before and after treatment, including:
Subjective indicators:
ODI(The Oswestry Disability Index) score:
0%-20%: Minimal disability: This group can cope with most living activities. Don't need treatment.
20%-40% Moderate disability: This group experiences more pain and problems with sitting, lifting, and standing. Personal care, sexual activity, and sleeping are not grossly affected, and the back condition can usually be managed by conservative means.
40%-60%: Severe disability: Pain remains the main problem in this group of patients, but travel, personal care, social life, sexual activity, and sleep are also affected.
60%-80%: Crippled: Back pain impinges on all aspects of these patients' lives—both at home and at work—and positive intervention is required.
80%-100%: These patients are either bed-bound or exaggerating their symptoms. Need evaluated by careful observation of the patient during medical examination.</description>
