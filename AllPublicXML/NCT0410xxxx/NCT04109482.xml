  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A phase 1/2 study to assess the safety and efficacy of MB-102 in patients with relapsed or
      refractory BPDCN, AML or high-risk MDS.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Phase 1 portion of the study will determine the maximum tolerated dose of MB-102.

      The Phase 2 portion of the trial is divided into three arms to evaluate the efficacy of
      MB-102 in relapsed or refractory BPDCN (Arm 1), relapsed or refractory AML (Arm 2) and
      demethylation resistant high-risk MDS (Arm 3).

    <description>The European Organization for Research and Treatment (EORTC) QLQ-C 30 Version 3.0 is an integrated, modular approach for evaluating the quality of life of patients participating in international clinical trials. The questionnaire is designed to measure cancer patients' physical, psychological and social functions. The questionnaire is composed of 5 multi-item scales (physical, role, social, emotional and cognitive functioning) and 9 single items (pain, fatigue, financial impact, appetite loss, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, sleep disturbance and quality of life).
It utilizes a four-point scales for the first 28 questions which are coded with response categories as &quot;Not at all&quot;, &quot;A little&quot;, &quot;Quite a bit&quot; and &quot;Very much.&quot;. the final two question consist of an overall physical condition questions which have employed a 7-point response scale where the higher number indicates a better overall health.</description>
