  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is essential to treat acute hypercapnic respiratory failure.
      However, facial pressure ulcers appearing during facemask-delivered noninvasive ventilation
      are a source of NIV failure by interface intolerance.

      A Philips facemask (model : AF541 SE Oro-Nasal mask) has the particularity to display two
      options for its positioning : a usually used &quot;over-the-nose&quot; positioning or an
      &quot;under-the-nose&quot; positioning that is supposed to reduce the incidence of facial pressure
      ulcers while keeping in the same time the qualities of a standard facemask.

      The goal of this controlled randomized trial is to test the hypothesis that the
      &quot;under-the-nose&quot; positioning actually reduces the incidence of facial pressure ulcers,
      compared to the usually used &quot;over-the-nose&quot; positioning.

      Results of this trial should lead to the proposition of a new interface strategy to prevent
      facial pressure ulcers and therefore to improve the tolerance of NIV via the use of facemasks
      displaying an &quot;under-the-nose&quot; positioning.

    <description>The primary endpoint is the development of a facial pressure ulcer within the first 3 days after NIV initiation</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of the delay for facial pressure ulcers to appear in the experimental arm, compared to the control arm</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days after NIV initiation</time_frame>
    <description>This secondary endpoint is the delay (in hours) between NIV initiation and the development of a facial pressure ulcer.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of the severity of facial pressure ulcers in the experimental arm, compared to the control arm</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days after NIV initiation</time_frame>
    <description>This secondary endpoint is the highest facial pressure ulcer severity score observed during patient hospitalization. This score is evaluated according to the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel guidelines (Edsberg LE et al., 2016). Stage 1 pressure injury (the less severe score) corresponds to intact skin with a localized area of nonblanchable erythema. Stage 2 pressure injury corresponds to partial-thickness skin loss with exposed dermis. Stage 3 pressure injury corresponds to full-thickness skin loss. Stage 4 pressure injury (the most severe score) corresponds to full-thickness skin and tissue loss.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of the patient comfort in the experimental arm, compared to the control arm</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours after NIV initiation</time_frame>
    <description>This secondary endpoint is the comfort patient score at 24 hours after NIV initiation. This score is a numeric scale, validated for NIV (Lemyze M et al., 2013 ; Gregoretti C et al., 2002), going from 1 to 5 (1: very uncomfortable ; 2: uncomfortable ; 3: acceptable ; 4: quite comfortable ; 5: comfortable).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of the incidence of NIV failure in the experimental arm, compared to the control arm</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days after NIV initiation</time_frame>
    <description>This secondary endpoint is the incidence of NIV failure defined as the need to resort to intubation or palliative care (in the case of a do-not-intubate order) during patient hospitalization. NIV failures may be caused by refractory respiratory acidosis, refractory hypoxemia, pressure ulcers, interface intolerance, excessive unintentional air leaks or shock.</description>
