  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this research is to exhaustively document the labor, delivery, and
      early postpartum course of 15,000 mother-newborn pairs in settings where the occurrence of
      adverse birth outcomes is high. The Investigators will gather detailed laboratory,
      physiologic, and clinical information, and precisely characterize major adverse diagnoses and
      outcomes. The resulting high-quality, granular, and generalizable data will be used to
      develop new algorithms to signal actionable intrapartum diagnoses and prospectively stratify
      women according to their risk for adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes.

      This is a prospective multi-country cohort study of 15,000 women in labor and their newborns.
      Women will be recruited and screened for study participation at the time of presentation to
      the hospital labor unit. Participants will be assessed through labor, delivery, and discharge
      and at 7- and 42-day postpartum phone calls. Liveborn infants will be enrolled at birth and
      followed through 42 days of life. The pilot phase of this protocol will enroll up to 500
      women in labor and their newborns and follow them through labor, delivery, and 42 days
      postpartum.
