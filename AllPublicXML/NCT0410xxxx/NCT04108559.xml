  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator's purpose was to compare the effects of the surgical drain and kinesiologic
      tape applications on postoperative morbidity after mandibular third molar surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 90 patients will be scheduled for impacted third molar surgery. The patients will
      be divided into 3 groups.All surgeries will be carried out by the same surgeon. Group A will
      be treated with kinesiologic tape, Group B will be treated with a surgical drainage tube and
      Group C will be control group. After surgery in control group, routine surgical extraction
      will be performed.The investigators will compare postoperative pain, swelling, trismus and
      patients' comfort.

      The duration of each procedure from the start of the incision to the time of last suture
      placement will be noted.

      Patients are recalled on days 2, 7, 14 postoperative pain, facial swelling, maximum mouth
      opening, wound dehiscence. For the assesment of the pain, visual analog scale will be used.
      For the swelling evaluation, measurement will be done from the different three region on the
      face:

        -  Tragus-Pogonion

        -  Tragus-Labial Commissura

        -  Angulus Mandible-Lateral canthus

      Maximum mouth opening will be noted before and after (one week later) the surgery.

    <description>Swelling measurement will be done from the different three region on the face. Tragus-Pogonion Tragus-Labial Commissura Angulus Mandible-Lateral canthus. The swelling measurement will be done preoperatively, postoperative 2nd day, 7th day after the surgery.</description>

    <measure>Pain will be assessed using a visual analogue scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1week</time_frame>
    <description>The level of postoperative pain will be evaluated using a 10-cm visual analogue scale , with zero representing no pain and 10 representing excruciating pain. Pain measurement will be done everyday in one week after the surgery.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Trismus will be evaluated using a caliper at maximum mouth opening.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1week</time_frame>
    <description>Trismus will be assessed by measuring the maximum interincisal opening (in millimetres) - the distance between the incisal margin of the upper and lower central incisors. Trismus measurement will be done preoperatively, postoperative 2nd day, 7th day after the surgery.</description>

    <description>After the routine impacted third molar surgery, the kinesiologic tape will be prepared individually for each patient; it will be cut into three equal strips (approximately 1.6 cm in width) and placed between the clavicle and the tragus-commissura line. Kinesiologic tape will be removed on the second postoperative day, and all sutures on will be removed on 7. postoperative day.</description>
