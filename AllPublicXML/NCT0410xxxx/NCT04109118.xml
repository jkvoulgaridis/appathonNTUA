  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a clinical trial, designed to pilot test a Distress
      Tolerance-Benzodiazepine Discontinuation (DT-BD) intervention for patients on opioid agonist
      therapy who currently use benzodiazepines, compared to a Relaxation Therapy (RT) control
      condition. Both are adjunctive psychosocial interventions in people seeking to discontinue
      (BZD) use. The goal of the study is to assess the applicability and feasibility of these
      interventions through treatment retention and qualitative interviews with eight participants
      who are receiving opioid agonist treatment and who regularly use BZDs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study pilots two 12-week psychosocial interventions each paired with identical
      benzodiazepine tapers with the aim of assisting individuals receiving OAT discontinue
      benzodiazepine use. All participants will receive the same benzodiazepine (BZD)
      discontinuation protocol; the only difference will be whether they receive the DT or RT
      interventions. There is no randomization process and the trial will be open label.
      Participants will be assigned one of the two interventions with the first participant
      receiving the DT-BD intervention, followed by the next participant receiving the RT
      intervention, and so on in that pattern. Specifically, among the eight participants, four
      will receive the DT-BD intervention and four will receive the RT intervention. The RT
      intervention has been utilized in past BZD discontinuation clinical trials and was found to
      be an adequate control intervention. Both interventions consist of 12 weeks with 3 weekly
      therapy sessions prior to an 8-week BZD taper. Some participants may be prescribed
      non-benzodiazepine medications to treat the underlying conditions for which they were using
      BZDs [e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) for anxiety or hypnotics for
      insomnia]. Data collection will occur at baseline, then weekly for 12 weeks.

    <measure>BZD withdrawal symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BZD withdrawal symptoms will be measured using the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment-Benzodiazepines (CIWA-B). The CIWA-B is a 20 item instrument, to assess severity of benzodiazepine withdrawal, including nausea and vomiting, anxiety, tremor, sweating, auditory disturbances, visual disturbances, tactile disturbances, headache, agitation, and clouding of sensorium.

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II will be used to measure inflexibility or experiential avoidance. It is a 7 item self-report measure of psychological inflexibility or experiential avoidance. Each of the 7 items can be rated on a scale of 1 (never true) to 7 (always true) so scores can range from 7 to 49. Higher scores equal greater levels of psychological inflexibility.</description>

    <description>Distress Tolerance - Benzodiazepine Discontinuation (DT-BD) is a psychosocial intervention. It is paired with a benzodiazepine taper. The aim of the psychosocial intervention is to improve individuals' ability to tolerate distress in order to assist benzodiazepine discontinuation in patients treated with OAT. There will be 3 sessions between therapist and participant prior to the start of the benzodiazepine taper. The taper for both the intervention and control conditions occurs over 9 weeks and involves weekly meetings with a benzodiazepine prescriber during which a gradual benzodiazepine dose reduction will take place. The DT-BD intervention combines elements of existing psychosocial interventions. Specifically, interoceptive exposure techniques will be paired with elements of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and relapse prevention (RP).</description>

    <description>Relaxation Therapy (RT), has been utilized in previous trials involving anxiety disorders and BZD discontinuation. In addition to providing non-specific support through therapist contact, it provides psychoeducation about BZD use in OAT and progressive muscle relaxation training. The relaxation training includes training and review of progressive muscle-relaxation procedures in session and at home.</description>

    <description>All participants will undergo BZD discontinuation. Once the starting BZD dose is determined by prescription monitoring and/or self-report, we will maintain participants on this dose until the start of the BZD taper. Participants will see a study physician weekly to receive their BZD medication for the week until the taper is completed. BZD discontinuation in this study will consist of a gradual BZD taper in dose over 8 weeks. The taper will be flexible in that the study physician will utilize clinical judgement to lengthen the taper if necessary, depending on the severity of the participant's withdrawal symptoms. Anchor points will be set (33% reduction in dose after 2 weeks, 50% mid-treatment, 100% by week 8) to emphasize the time-limited nature of the taper.</description>
