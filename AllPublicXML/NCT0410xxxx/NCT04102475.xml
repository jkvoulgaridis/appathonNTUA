  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is a highly challenging disease which consequences are serious. Relapse
      rate is estimated between 38 and 41% during the year following hospitalization. The efficacy
      of patients' phone contact procedure on relapse has been assessed and has shown interest in
      numerous disorders. However, no study has ever used phone contact as a relapse prevention
      intervention tool in AN.

      Objective: To evaluate efficacy of a phone contact procedure to increase body weight at 12
      months after a first hospitalization for AN, by comparison to standard medical follow-up.
      Secondary objectives are to evaluate effect of phone contact procedure on: change in body
      weight at 6 month, general psychopathology disorder, psychopathology disorder specific to AN,
      rate of usual follow-up visit, and medico-economic impact.

      Method: Prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial, for
      subject over 15 years old presenting with diagnosis of AN. Patients randomized in EATLINE
      group will be contacted by phone at 15 days, 1, 2, 4 and 9 months after discharge from
      hospitalization. Patients in control group will benefit from usual follow-up.

      Expected outcomes and perspectives:that there will be a significant decrease in relapse due
      to phone contact procedure compared to control group. Results would justify additional
      devices at the end of hospitalization, until development of various connected tools allowing
      to &quot;stay in contact&quot; with patients in order to optimize the current therapeutic possibilities
      of AN.

    <description>After discharge from a first hospitalization:
Phone calls at 15 days, 1, 2, 4 and 9 months by a trained psychologist. The phone interview will be guided by the same standardized frame, which was developed by a group of experts and tested with a group of patients. The purpose of this intervention is to provide a therapeutic and motivational approach, with positive reinforcement and reassurance.
Added to treatment as usual (TAU): outpatient visits (at least monthly consultations) or scheduled hospitalizations
6- and 12-month assessments as an outpatient interview with an assessor who is blind to condition</description>
