  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The skin and gut microbiome of rosacea patients differs from individuals without rosacea and
      that the microbiome suffers from unique derangements in rosacea patients following antibiotic
      therapy.

      This study was proposed to examine microbial signatures of the skin and gut microbiome in
      patients with moderate to severe rosacea and to identify differences between microbe
      communities in patients with rosacea and volunteers without rosacea using 16S ribosomal
      ribonucleic acid (rRNA) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, sequencing and
      computational phylogenetics and to assess alterations in the gut and skin microbiota of
      patients with moderate to severe rosacea in response to varying formulations of antimicrobial
      treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must be over the age of 18 years old.

          -  Participants must have a current diagnosis of moderate-to-severe
             erythematotelangiectatic or papulopustular rosacea or free of rosacea to serve as
             control.

          -  Participants must have the ability to understand and communicate with the
             investigator.

             ivermectin

          -  Subjects unwilling to avoid facial washing for 24 hours prior to sampling and to come
             to sampling visit without make-up.
