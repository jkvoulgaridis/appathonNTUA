    <textblock>
      Laser treated short dental implants will be placed in a posterior atrophic ridge with only
      8-10 mm available bone height. Their stability will be measured through a period of 12 weeks.
      They will be compared to the stability of SLA treated Short dental implants placed in the
      same situations.

    <description>Patients will be randomized into two groups, control group for SLA implants, and study group will receive the Laser treated implants. Implants will be placed classically in the posterior maxillary region and their stability will be measured by ISQ device at the placement. Measurements will be taken again at 2, 4, 6, 8 , 10 and 12 weeks.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  • Adult patients with Edentulous posterior maxillae with insufficient ridge for
             placement of standard length dental implant, but allowing placement of short 8mm
             dental implant.

               -  Males and females.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • Heavy smokers more than 20 cigarettes per day.

               -  Patients with systemic disease that may affect normal healing.

               -  Psychiatric problems

               -  Disorders to implant are related to history of radiation therapy to the head and
                  neck neoplasia, or bone augmentation to implant site

               -  Patients suffering from immunodeficiency, bruxism, stress situation (socially or
                  professionally), emotional instability, and unrealistic aesthetic demands.

               -  Intraoral soft and hard tissue pathology.
