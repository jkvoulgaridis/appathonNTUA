  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to prospectively determine, at 10 days after
      orthopedic shoulder or knee surgery, if pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) therapy is
      beneficial in reducing patient-reported post-operative pain, as measured by visual analog
      scale (VAS). The amount of pain medication taken daily and the physical function outcome
      scores after surgery and PEMF treatment will also be measured.
