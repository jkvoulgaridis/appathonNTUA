  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unemployment is particularly common among women with multiple sclerosis (MS). This study uses
      a vocational rehabilitation program involving neuropsychological testing as an intervention.
      The use of in-person feedback and case management following neuropsychological testing is
      compared to phone feedback only. Adherence to treatment and employment outcomes will be
      evaluated over three years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Employed women at a tertiary-care MS center were screened for common issues impacting work
      productivity (fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and depression). Women who met screening
      criteria were randomized to one of two treatment groups: either neuropsychological testing
      and phone feedback to review findings and tailored recommendations (standard-care treatment);
      or neuropsychological testing, in-person feedback, and two calls from a care-coordinator
      (experimental treatment). Adherence to recommendations and employment status at one year are
      evaluated. Follow-up periods also occur at year two and year three.

    <description>Participant received neuropsychological testing, report detailing cognitive strengths and weaknesses, tailored recommendations to address areas of weakness (including psychological and/or physical symptoms impacting work productivity). Participant then receives in-person feedback (and a copy of the report at this visit) and two calls from a care-coordinator research nurse at approximately 1 and 6 months post feedback, who asks participant whether they completed recommendations and assist participant in completing recommendations where possible (i.e., help find a provider, explanation of importance of completing recommendations, etc).</description>
