  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) represents the most severe form of endometriosis and is
      present in 20-35% of all women suffering from the disease. Intestinal nodules are observed in
      3% to 37% of endometriosis patients. In cases of colorectal DIE, adequate therapy depends on
      the depth of infiltration and the size of the lesion as well as the woman's quality of life .
      Removal of the specimen after segmental bowel resection can be performed by either
      mini-laparotomy or by the natural orifice specimen extraction (NOSE) technique .

      The assessment of the quality of life and fertility outcome of the patients was done by using
      electronic questionnaires before and after surgery.

      The conventional method raises concerns because this could disrupt the integrity of the
      abdominal wall. Moreover, extraction site laparotomy is associated with higher postoperative
      pain scores . The occurrence of particular complications such as incisional hernias and wound
      infections is also higher than after conventional laparoscopic procedures .

      In order to avoid these complications, NOSE technique has been introduced. During NOSE
      colectomy the specimen is extracted through a natural orifice and an intracorporeal
      anastomosis is performed For the operative treatment of bowel endometriosis both transrectal
      and transvaginal NOSE have been performed.

      From 1st of February 2018, 234 consecutive patients underwent segmental bowel resection
      because of colorectal DIE at the Dept. of Obstetrics and Gynecology Semmelweis University
      Budapest.

      The surgical plan was made individually, tailored to the symptoms of the patients. Nodules
      larger than 3cm causing obstructive problems and affecting more than 50% of the bowel
      circumference or multifocal DIE nodules (less than 2 cm from the principal lesion) or
      multicentric (more than 2 cm from the principal lesion) nodules were treated by segmental
      resection and anastomosis.

      Apart from obstructive sequelae severe (visual analog scale, VAS) endometriosis related pain
      represented surgical indication as well.

      The procedures, namely the transrectal NOSE technique and the conventional segmental
      laparoscopic resection were randomized using simple randomization, the coin flipping method.

      At the time of admission patients filled a questionnaire (Endometriosis Health Profile, EHP
      30;Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index,GIQLI; LARS-Low Anterior Resection Syndrome , and a
      validated questionnaire pain catastrophisation) regarding their symptoms and fertility .

      The endometriosis related pain was measured by using Visual Analog Scale (VAS scores) The
      patients were asked to fill the questionnaires at 30 days, 60months, 1year and 2 years after
      the surgery.

      During the present study investigators are planning an average follow-up of 24 months.

    <description>Impact of surgical technique on the quality of life. The outcome will be assessed using validated electronic questionnaires containing questions from Endometriosis Health Profile.

    <description>The Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (LARS) is a common complication that occures after colorectal surgery. The LARS score is a simple self-administered questionnaire measuring bowel dysfunction after rectal surgery. Contains questions regarding incontinence, emptying difÔ¨Åculties, urgency, and frequency. The calculated score ranges from 0 to 42, with a score of 0-20 representing no LARS, a score of 21-29 representing minor LARS and a score of 30-42 representing major LARS.</description>

As follows:
Grade I Any deviation from the normal postoperative course without treatment by invasive interventions Grade II Requiring pharmacological treatment with drugs other than such allowed for grade I complications.
Grade III
Requiring surgical, endoscopic or radiological intervention
IIIa
Intervention not under general anesthesia
IIIb
Intervention under general anesthesia Grade IV
