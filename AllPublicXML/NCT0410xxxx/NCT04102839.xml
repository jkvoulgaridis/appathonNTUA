  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a longitudinal study during which qualitative interviews will be conducted with
      caregivers of Soleno C601/C602 study subjects. There is an additional option for caregivers
      to collect video data of PWS patients doing specific activities of daily life.

      The purpose of this study is to understand the real-world and nuanced impact of a potential
      therapeutic on individual PWS patients. The results of this study will complement the
      outcomes being captured during the Soleno C601/C602 clinical studies.

      There is no treatment or intervention associated with this study.
