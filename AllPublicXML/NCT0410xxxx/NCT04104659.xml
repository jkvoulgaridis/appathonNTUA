  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recent development of a PET tracer,[18F]MK-6240(an[18F]tau imaging
      agent,CerveauTechnologies)that has high affinity for the human phosphorylated tau deposits in
      AD brain offers new opportunities to investigate tau pathology. The investigators will
      evaluate this imaging agent in individuals from families with a known Autosomal Dominant
      Alzheimer's Disease (ADAD) mutation. This study of tau PET using [18F]MK-6240 is performed in
      conjunction with DIAN and DIAN Extended Registry (DIAN-EXR).

    <description>Aim 3 multivariate linear regression models will be implemented within the general linear mixed model framework and estimated using restricted maximum likelihood estimation. This approach allows for the estimation of the association between [18F]MK-6240 and tauopathy measures across all brain regions to be studied in a single model, by considering the dependency in the plaque measures caused by multiple brain regions being nested within a single patient.</description>

    <measure>Study the temporal dynamics of tau deposition (using [18F]MK-6240).</measure>
    <time_frame>12 years from enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>We will first fit a model in training samples and then use the fitted model to predict the longitudinal changes in tau PET and compare the predicted changes with observed data in independent validation samples. This process will be repeated multiple times, thus correcting for the upward bias and computing &quot;honest&quot; measures of replicability of a specific statistical model. We will repeat the cross-validation process for all scientifically interpretable candidate models that we will consider when comparing to tau PET data. A pseudo-panel from additional cross-sectional datasets can also be used in which observations of different subjects in different time-to-onset lengths are matched across observable covariates.</description>

    <description>A statistical approach will be applied but will consider both Aβ and tau PET. Neuropsychometric measures will be grouped into composites representing working memory, episodic memory, language function, and a global composite. Linear mixed effects models will be implemented including family and DIAN site as random effects. Models will include baseline levels of Aβ PET and tau PET from summary measures, EYO, group (asymptomatic and symptomatic), and all interactions</description>

    <description>PET tracer, [18F]MK-6240 (an[18F]tau imaging agent,CerveauTechnologies)that has high affinity for the human phosphorylated tau deposits in AD brain offers new opportunities to investigate tau pathology.(Hostetler, Walji et al. 2016, Lohith, Bennacef et al. 2016, Walji, Hostetler et al. 2016, Lohith, Bennacef et al. 2017, Neelamegam, Yokell et al. 2017).We will evaluate this imaging agent in individuals from families with a known Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer's Disease (ADAD) mutation.
The planned dosage for [18F]MK-6240 is a single intravenous bolus injection of 185 MBq (5.0 mCi) in a large peripheral vein followed by a 10 mL normal saline (0.9% NaCl) flush.</description>
