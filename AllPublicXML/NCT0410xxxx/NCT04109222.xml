      The primary objective of the study is to provide sera (collected from participants before
      vaccination and after final vaccination) to the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research
      (CBER) for further analysis by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to support
      formulation recommendations for subsequent influenza vaccines.

        An individual fulfilling any of the following criteria to be excluded from study
        enrollment:

          -  Participation at the time of study enrollment (or in the 30 days preceding the first
             study vaccination) or planned participation during the present study period in another
             clinical study investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device, or medical procedure.

          -  Receipt of any vaccine in the 30 days preceding the first study vaccination, or
             planned receipt of any vaccine before Visit 2 for participants receiving 1 dose of

          -  Previous vaccination against influenza (in the 2019-2020 influenza season) with either
             study vaccine or another vaccine.

             months preceding planned inclusion).

          -  Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, or history of a
             life-threatening reaction to study vaccine or to a vaccine containing any of the same
             substances.

          -  Thrombocytopenia, which may be a contraindication for intramuscular vaccination, at
             the discretion of the Investigator.

          -  Bleeding disorder, or receipt of anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding inclusion,
             contraindicating intramuscular vaccination.

             prospective participant should not be included in the study until the condition has
             resolved or the febrile event has subsided.

          -  Identified as an Investigator or employee of the Investigator or study center with
             direct involvement in the proposed study (participants ≥ 65 years of age) or
             identified as an immediate family member (i.e., parent, spouse, natural or adopted
             child) of the Investigator or employee with direct involvement in the proposed study
