  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The LIVMOR Data Collection Study is a multicenter, IDE Exempt Study to generate a library of
      device-specific signals collected noninvasively. The study was not designed to evaluate
      specific hypothesis or endpoint, rather it was intended for data collection purposes to
      generate a library of raw clinical data that were retrospectively used for the development
      and subsequently the validation of the L-1000AF System. The L-1000AF System is a wrist worn
      system intended to provide continuous remote monitoring of atrial fibrillation (AF) episodes.
      The system is intended for use under the care of a physician and is not intended for the
      diagnosis of AF.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LIVMOR is developing a series of wearable medical device systems intended to promote general
      wellness and help subjects and physicians manage various diseases that can benefit from
      increased visibility of physical activity, sleep, weight, blood pressure, stress/recovery
      levels and cardiac rhythms.

      Data from human subjects is necessary to develop and validate LIVMOR devices. LIVMOR
      completed a multicenter, IDE Exempt Study to generate a library of device-specific signals
      collected non-invasively using components of the LIVMOR system and simultaneously acquired
      with ECG Holter data using a commercially available Holter monitor. Data from the analysis of
      the Holter monitor was adjudicated by physicians skilled in the analysis and interpretation
      of ECGs compared to the analysis from the LIVMOR AF Detection Algorithm to establish the
      sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm for detection of AF in comparison to ground
      truth.

      The study was not designed to evaluate specific hypotheses or endpoint, rather it was
      intended for data collection purposes to generate a library of raw clinical data that were
      retrospectively used for the development and subsequently the validation of the L-1000AF
      System.
