    <textblock>
      The knowledge of prevalence and risk factors of nocturnal polyuria might be important for the
      treatment of women with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Thus, our aim is to describe the
      prevalence and risk factors of nocturnal polyuria in women with LUTS.

    <textblock>
      Between September 2010 and January 2019, all women with LUTS visiting urogynecological
      department of a medical center for urodynamic evaluation were reviewed. Nocturnal polyuria
      was defined when the proportion of night-time voided volume over 24-hour voided volume was
      greater than 33% for ≥65 year-old women, and when the proportion of night-time voided volume
      over 24-hour voided volume was greater than 20% for &lt;65 year-old women. Backward stepwise
      multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed using all statistical variables in
      the univariate logistic regression analysis. P &lt; 0.05 was considered as statistical
      significant.
