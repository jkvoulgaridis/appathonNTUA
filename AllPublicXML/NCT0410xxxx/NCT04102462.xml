    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, as based on a
             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (BP, PR),
             12-lead ECG, and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 45 years (inclusive)

          -  BMI of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive)

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study, in
             accordance with GCP and local legislation

          -  Male subjects who meet any of the following criteria from administration of trial
             medication until 30 days after trial completion:

               -  Males who are willing to use a medically acceptable method of contraception.
                  Acceptable methods of contraception for use by male subjects include sexual
                  abstinence, a vasectomy performed at least 1 year prior to dosing, and barrier
                  contraception (condom)

               -  Subjects who are not vasectomised or sexually abstinent have to ensure that an
                  additional acceptable method of contraception will be used by his female partner
                  such as intrauterine device (IUD), surgical sterilisation (including
                  hysterectomy), hormonal contraception (e.g. implants, injectables, combined oral
                  or vaginal contraceptives) that started at least 2 months prior to drug
                  administration, or barrier method (e.g. diaphragm with spermicide)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including BP, PR or ECG) deviating from normal
             and assessed as clinically relevant by the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the
             range of 50 to 90 bpm

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease assessed as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

             immunological or hormonal disorders

             hernia repair)

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders

          -  History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells, or blackouts

             medication or its excipients)

          -  Use of drugs within 30 days or 5 elimination half-lives, of planned administration of
             trial medication that might reasonably influence the results of the trial (including
             drugs that cause QT/QTc interval prolongation)

          -  Intake of an investigational drug in another clinical trial within 60 days or 5
             elimination half-lives, of planned administration of investigational drug in the
             current trial, or concurrent participation in another clinical trial in which
             investigational drug is administered

          -  Smoker (more than 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes per day)

          -  Inability to refrain from smoking on specified trial days

          -  Alcohol abuse (consumption of more 24 g per day)

          -  Drug abuse or positive drug screening

          -  Blood donation of more than 100 mL within 30 days of planned administration of trial
             medication or intended blood donation during the trial

          -  Intention to perform excessive physical activities within one week prior to the
             administration of trial medication or during the trial

          -  Inability to comply with the dietary regimen of the trial site

          -  A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (such as QTc intervals that are
             repeatedly greater than 450 ms or any other relevant ECG finding at screening

          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsade de Pointes (such as heart failure,
             hypokalaemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)

          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,
             because the subject is not considered able to understand and comply with study
             requirements, or has a condition that would not allow safe participation in the study
