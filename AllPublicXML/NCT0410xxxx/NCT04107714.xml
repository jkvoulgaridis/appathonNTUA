  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the group-based intervention &quot;Starting the
      Conversation&quot; as a webinar in Germany. Feasibility and efficacy of the program will be tested
      in a pilot randomized-controlled trial (RCT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parents of children with mental illness often experience public and self-stigma, and keeping
      a child's mental illness secret is a common strategy to avoid stigma. Both secrecy and
      disclosure have pros and cons for parents and their children. Therefore, the decision
      whether, when, and to whom to disclose a child's mental illness is complex. Interventions can
      provide guidance for systematic consideration and a well informed decision.

      The manualized peer-led group intervention &quot;Honest, Open, Proud&quot; (HOP) supports people with
      mental illness in their decision whether to disclose mental illness. Research showed positive
      effects of the intervention on stigma stress, disclosure-related distress and quality of
      life. Based on HOP, &quot;Starting the Conversation&quot; (STC) was developed to systematically guide
      parents through their decision whether and how to disclose a child's mental illness.

      At the moment, there is no data regarding feasibility and efficacy of STC, but two pilot RCTs
      of STC are currently underway, one in Western Australia and one in Wisconsin, USA. The aim of
      the current study is to evaluate feasibility and efficacy of STC as a webinar in a pilot RCT
      in German.

    <description>The peer-led and web-based group program contains four lessons plus one booster session:

Lesson 2: Different ways to disclose: Participants learn about different ways to disclose and their respective pros and cons. Afterwards participants discuss possible responses they might experience and develop strategies to cope with.
Lesson 3: Communication about disclosure between parents and their child: Participants discuss pros and cons of (non-)disclosure for their children and how to negotiate whether to disclose or not.
Lesson 4: Telling your story: Participants learn how to tell their own story.
In a booster session, participants discuss their experiences with disclosure or non-disclosure.</description>
