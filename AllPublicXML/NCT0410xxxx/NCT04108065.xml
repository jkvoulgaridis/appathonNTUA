      The primary aim of the study is to evaluate postprandial gallbladder emptying and plasma
      concentrations of the glucose-lowering and satiety-promoting gut hormone glucagon-like
      peptide 1 (GLP-1) during third trimester of pregnancy in women with gestational diabetes
      mellitus (GDM) compared with age and body mass index (BMI)-matched pregnant control women
      with normal glucose tolerance (NGT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) defined as glucose intolerance first detected during
      pregnancy is a strong predictor of future type 2 diabetes. Patients with GDM exhibit severely
      reduced postprandial responses of the insulinotropic and satiety-promoting gut hormone
      glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which normalise alongside remission of GDM after delivery.
      Ingested nutrients and bile acids constitute potent stimulators of GLP-1 secretion. Reduced
      postprandial GLP-1 responses likely contribute to the pathophysiology of GDM, but the
      mechanisms are unknown. Based on previous studies studying gallbladder emptying during
      pregnancy, we hypothesize that reduced postprandial GLP-1 responses in GDM is due to
      incomplete gallbladder emptying during third trimester. If our hypothesis proves right,
      reduced gallbladder emptying and ensuing attenuation of postprandial GLP-1 secretion will
      constitute an obvious and druggable target for the treatment of GDM.

      Fifteen women with gestational diabetes mellitus and 15 age and body mass index (BMI)-matched
      pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance will be enrolled in the study. For each subject,
      the study encompasses one screening visit and two experimental days; one during third
      trimester of pregnancy and one 3-9 months post partum. On experimental days, a standardised
      liquid mixed meal test (added 1.5 g of paracetamol for evaluation of gastric emptying
      according to paracetamol absorption) with repeated ultrasonographic gallbladder scans and
      blood samples will be performed.
