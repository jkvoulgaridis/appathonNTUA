  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that there are about 600 million diabetes mellitus (DM) patients all over the
      world until 2040，and almost 50% of whom have some degree of diabetic retinopathy (DR) at any
      given time. About 5% to 10% diabetic retinopathy would develop vision-threatening
      complications, including proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), capillary non-perfusion,
      or macular edema. Data from the DRS suggest that given long enough duration of diabetes,
      approximately 60% of patients with DR will develop PDR, and without intervention, 75%
      nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) will development PDR within 1 year follow up,
      45% will develop high-risk PDR, nearly half of PDR will experience profound visual loss.
      panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) only reduced 50% risk of sever visual loss and about 25% of
      the sNPDR patients who finished PRP need Pars-plana vitrectomy (PPV) in a 5 year follow up.

      Vitreous have been proven to play an important role in the development of NPDR to PDR, which
      were the collection of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) factors and the major
      component of proliferative lesion in the later stage of PDR.

      Micro-invasive Pars-plana vitrectomy has been shown as a safe and effective method in the
      treatment of PDR, through removing the pathological vitreous, proliferative membrane and also
      the VEGF factors. However, whether or not Micro-invasive Pars-plana vitrectomy will be more
      effective than PRP to control the progression of NDPR remained unknown.
