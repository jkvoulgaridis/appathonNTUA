  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to refit habitual wearers of daily disposable contact lenses who
      currently experience symptoms of dry eye and discomfort during lens wear with a different
      type of daily disposable contact lens. Ocular signs and symptoms of dry eye will be assessed
      following the guidelines outlined by the Tear Film and Ocular Surface Society (TFOS) in the
      Dry Eye Workshop II (DEWS II). The performance of the habitual contact lenses and the study
      lenses will be determined using different optometric assessments. Study lenses will be worn
      for one month following a daily disposable wear schedule.

          2. Has read and signed an information consent letter;

          3. Is willing and able to follow instructions and maintain the appointment schedule;

          4. As per TFOS DEWS II, have dry eye symptoms (without CL wear) as determined by an OSDI
             score of ≥13 and at least one of the following:

               1. Tear osmolarity ≥ 308mOsm/L or interocular difference &gt;8 mOsm/L

               2. Non-invasive tear breakup time of &lt; 10 seconds in at least one eye

               3. More than 5 spots of corneal staining OR &gt; 9 conjunctival spots in at least one
                  eye

          5. Reports dryness while wearing DD CLs with CLDEQ-8 score ≥ 12 and ≤ 203

          6. Habitually wears soft spherical DD CLs with a power between +6.00D and -10.00D

          7. Manifest spectacle cyl ≤1.00DC in either eye

          8. BCVA ≤0.20 log MAR each eye with habitual &amp; DT1

          9. Acceptable fit with habitual &amp; DT1

         10. Willing to wear DT1 CLs at least 3 days per week and 6 hours per day throughout the
             study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Is participating in any concurrent clinical or research study;

          2. Has any known active* ocular disease and/or infection;

          3. Has a systemic condition that in the opinion of the investigator may affect a study
             outcome variable;

          4. Is using any systemic or topical medications that in the opinion of the investigator
             may affect a study outcome variable;

          5. Has known sensitivity to the diagnostic pharmaceuticals to be used in the study;

          6. Is pregnant, lactating or planning a pregnancy at the time of enrolment (by
             self-report);

          7. Is aphakic;

          8. Has undergone refractive error surgery;

          9. Has taken part in another clinical research study within the last 14 days;

         10. Current habitual wearer of DT1

         11. Any ocular and/or systemic conditions or concomitant medication to contraindicate
             contact lens wear or be expected to interfere with the primary outcome variables.

               -  For the purposes of this study, active ocular disease is defined as infection or
                  inflammation which requires therapeutic treatment. Mild (i.e. not considered
                  clinically relevant) lid abnormalities (blepharitis, meibomian gland dysfunction,
                  papillae), corneal and conjunctival staining and dry eye are not considered
                  active ocular disease. Neovascularization and corneal scars are the result of
                  previous hypoxia, infection or inflammation and are therefore not active.
