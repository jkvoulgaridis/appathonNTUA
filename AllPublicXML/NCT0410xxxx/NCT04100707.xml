  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with knee pain, local anesthetics and radiofrequency applications to
      superolateral, superomedial and inferomedial genicular nerves that innervate the knee joint
      are also preferred methods besides analgesic and physical therapy. When necessary, total knee
      replacement is the preferred method for primary knee arthrosis.

      However, continuing knee pain is reported in approximately 20% of patients after total knee
      replacement. In similar cases; In the painful knees, the blockages of the genicular nerves
      are successfully applied.

      In this study; the efficacy of imaging-guided radiofrequency application will be investigated
      in patients presenting with knee pain after total knee replacement.

      Although simple analgesic and physical therapy methods are applied, some patients suffer from
      pain. Genicular nerve blocks and radiofrequency methods are performed usually for this
      reason. This procedure is performed with ultrasound and / or fluoroscopy, sterile staining
      and covering of painful knee to the middle of thigh and leg, localization of superomedial,
      superolateral, inferomedial genicular nerves are tested and then conventional radiofrequency
      is applied to all 3 nerve regions.Fifty patients who had total knee prosthesis for
      gonarthrosis in the Orthopedics and Traumatology Clinic at least 3 months postoperatively had
      knee pain (infection, mechanical causes and radicular pain) were included in the study.The
      VAS and WOMAC values recorded at the time of application and the VAS and WOMAC values
      recorded at the 1st week, 1st month and 3rd month after the procedure will be used to
      evaluate the effectiveness of the method.

    <description>Western Ontario and Mc Masters Osteoarthritis index (VOMAC) will be used to evaluate functional status on the efficacy of Ultrasound and fluoroscopy use.VOMAC is a disease-specific score in which pain, stiffness and physical functions are evaluated. It consists of 24 questions, 5 of which are pain, 2 are stiffness and 17 are evaluating physical function. It has both total score and subgroups can be evaluated separately. Maximum scores were 20 for pain subgroup, 8 for stiffness and 68 for physical function. High scores indicate that the patient has poor values in that group.</description>
