      This is a multicenter, open-label Phase I trial and the aim of this trial is to evaluate the
      drug-drug interaction and safety with SHR3162 combined with Abiraterone in Metastatic
      Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients. The trial is a dose-escalation and -expansion
      study. Approximately 35~38 patients in will receive fixed- dose of orally Abiraterone and
      only one of two dose levels of orally SHR3162. The Primary endpoints are incidence of adverse
      events(AE) and PK characteristics. The secondary endpoints are efficacy and recommended phase
      2 dose(RP2D).

          2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) of 0 or 1;

          3. Radiographic evidence of metastasis;

          4. Sustained therapy of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue(LHRHA)or received
             bilateral orchiectomy; patients who did not receive bilateral orchiectomy are willing
             to receive sustained therapy of LHRHA;

          5. Evidence of prostate cancer progression under the sustained therapy of LHRHA or
             bilateral orchiectomy;

          6. Adequate hepatic, renal, heart, and hematological functions;

          7. Patients have given voluntary written informed consent before performance of any
             study-related procedure not part of normal medical care,with the understanding that
             consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future
             medical care；
