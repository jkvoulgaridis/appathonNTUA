    <textblock>
      There are currently no pharmacological treatments approved to treat borderline personality
      disorder (BPD). This trial will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      brexpiprazole for the treatment of subjects diagnosed with BPD to provide a pharmacological
      treatment for BPD.

                  90 days prior to screening or at Day 0 are eligible, unless the behavior is
                  better described as an actual attempt, interrupted attempt, or aborted attempt
                  according to C-SSRS definition and/or investigator judgment and therefore
