  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      25 to 50% of endometriotic patients are infertile and use medically assisted procreation. In
      general, the assessment of pain in medically assisted procreation is very little studied.
      Pain assessment studies in endometriotic patients remain limited to a quantitative assessment
      of pain symptomatology, without contextualization of painful manifestations. The primary
      objective of our study is the qualitative and contextualized assessment of pain during In
      Vitro Fertilization (IVF) protocol in endometriotic and non-endometriotic patients. The
      secondary objectives of our study are the quantitative study of pain, the measurement of the
      impact of personal efficiency on painful symptomatology, evaluation of depression, the
      results of IVF (implantation, pregnancy and live birth rates), and compare pain between
      endometriotic or non-endometriotic patients and between primary infertility and secondary
      infertility. According to the results obtained in this study, therapeutic strategies for the
      management of pain could be proposed, with the aim of improving the quality of life and the
      results of IVF in these patients.
