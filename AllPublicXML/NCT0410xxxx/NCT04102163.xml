  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of treatment (medical and/or surgical) on
      Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in participants with Crohn's Disease (CD) and Complex
      Perianal Fistula (CPF), by the Quality of Life in patients with Anal Fistula Questionnaire
      (QoLAF-Q), at 12 months after treatment initiation in routine clinical practice.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective follow-up post-authorization observational study of participants with
      CD and CPF. The study will provide real-world data on how CPF treatments in CD participants
      affect their HRQoL.

      The study will enroll approximately 300 participants. All participants will be enrolled in
      one observational cohort.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Spain. The study will collect data from a
      routine medical practice visits for CD participants with CPF and an application that will be
      designed ad hoc and will passively record participant's data. The overall duration of this
      study will be approximately 29 months. Participants will be followed up at Months 6 and 12
      post-treatment.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Months 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D- is a generic, self-reported measure of utility that consists of a five-item descriptive system and a visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system has two versions, namely the 3L and 5L, both involving five health dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). In the EQ-5D-5L that will be used, participants may choose from the following five response levels: no problems=1; slight problems=2; moderate problems=3; severe problems=4; and unable to/extreme problems=5. Higher values indicate worst health.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Months 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>FIQOL comprises of 29 items that cover four dimensions of perceived health: lifestyle (10 items), behavior (9 items), depression/ self-perception (7 items), and embarrassment (3 items). Each item has a range of 1 to 4, with 1 being the lowest value for the state of quality of life.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Months 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PSS assesses participant's perceived nonspecific stress in a given situation or a daily life situation. The overall score of the scale is measured on a 14-item scale (from 0 to 4 points). Each item is scored 0 (never) to 4 (very often). Total score is obtained by inverting the scores on items 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 y 13 (as follows: 0=4, 1=3, 2=2, 3=1 y 4=0) and summing up the scores of the 14 items. Higher total scores indicate higher perceived stress.</description>

    <description>The IIEF is a multi-dimensional, self-administered questionnaire to assess erectile dysfunction. A score of 0 to 5 is awarded to each of the 15 questions that examine the 4 main domains of male sexual function: Erectile Function (EF), Orgasmic Function (OF), Sexual Desire (SD) and Intercourse Satisfaction (IS). EF has five categories: 1-10(Severe Erectile Dysfunction), 11-16(Moderate dysfunction), 17-21(Mild to moderate dysfunction), 22-25(Mild dysfunction), 26-30 (No dysfunction). OF: sum of Questions (Q) 9 and Q10, each rated 0 (no sexual stimulation) to 5 (almost always/always). OF domain score range: 0 to 10; lower scores denoted lower OF. SD: sum of Q11 and Q12, each rated 1 (almost never or low/no sexual desire) to 5 (almost always or very high sexual desire). SD domain score range: 2 to 10;lower scores denoted lower SD. IS: sum of Q6, Q7, and Q8, each rated 0 (low/no satisfaction) to 5 (high satisfaction). IS domain score range: 0 to 15; lower scores denoted lower satisfaction.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) Scores at Months 6 and 12 After Treatment for CPF</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Months 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The FSFI is a 19-item multidimensional self-report questionnaire for the assessment of female sexual function. It has five domains of sexual function, including: desire and subjective arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain/discomfort. FSFI is scored on a scale ranging from 1.2 to 6.0 (desire), 0 to 6.0 (arousal, lubrication, orgasm, and pain/discomfort) or 0.8 to 6.0 (satisfaction), with higher scores indicating better performance. The total score, falling in a possible range from 2.0 to 36.0, is obtained by adding the six domain scores together.</description>
