  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Statin administration is supposed to reduce subclinical atherosclerosis by decreasing LDL
      cholesterol levels, possibly via lipid-independent anti-inflammatory effect. Its pleiotropic
      properties also adding beneficial effect against CMV infection.

      The investigators plan to study atorvastatin in virally- suppressed HIV-infected patients on
      stable ART with CMV seropositive and statin-naïve to evaluate the subclinical atherosclerosis
      changes assessed by carotid intima media thickness (CIMT).

    <intervention_model_description>Atorvastatin tablets in generic form. The placebo tablets will be prepared by Cipto Mangunkusumo hospital pharmacist, were composed of starch and were similar to atorvastatin tablets in size, shape, and colour. The participants will get the medication supply every month along with the refill of antiretroviral drugs. The drug and placebo tablets will be administered to patients by a staff member who are privy to the treatment. In the end of every month, each participant should return the unused pills every month.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Subjects with undetectable HIV-RNA, positive anti-CMV, having Framingham Risk Score above 10% with LDL &lt; 130 or under 10% with LDL &lt;160 will undergo thorough medical history and anthropometric examination as the initial data. Patient will be seen for regular clinical follow up as standard of care in the clinic (monthly/ bimonthly). Follow up visit will include clinical and laboratory procedure. At week 24, blood collection procedures and neurocognitive examination procedures will be repeated. At week 48, blood collection procedures, CIMT, FMD, transient elastography with CAP, and neurocognitive examination procedures will be repeated.</masking_description>

    <description>Numerical changes (in millimeter) between baseline and 48 weeks. Common Carotid Artery (CCA) intima media thickness measured by using B mode imaging system (Affiniti 70 series), equipped with a linear array transducer &gt; 7 MHz with minimal compression (&lt;10:1) and footprint of at least 3 cm. This procedure is operated by certified Cardiologist.

    <description>Numerical changes (in percentage) between baseline and 48 weeks FMD.
Using a high-resolution ultrasound linear array transducer, longitudinal images of the right brachial artery (mostly 3-15 cm above the elbow) were recorded at the baseline and for 3 minutes after cuff deflation following suprasystolic compression (50 mmHg over the systolic blood pressure) of the right forearm for 5 minutes. This procedure is operated by certified cardiologist.
