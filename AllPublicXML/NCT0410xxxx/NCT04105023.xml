  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence that genistein present in soy can improve insulin resistance in rodents and
      humans with metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, it is not known if this improvement is
      associated with changes in the gut microbiota. In the present study, the investigators show
      that the consumption of genistein for 2 months could have an effect on insulin resistance in
      subjects with MetS. This effect will be accompanied by a modification of the gut microbiota
      taxonomy. As a consequence, there will be a reduction in metabolic endotoxemia accompanied by
      an increase in AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and the expression of
      genes of fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle.

      The investigators included 45 participants who met the following inclusion criteria: adults
      between 20 and 60 years of age with a diagnosis of MetS, HOMA index greater than 2.5, BMI ≥30
      and ≤ 40 kg / m2 and who signed the consent letter. Patients who had any added pathology,
      pregnancy, smoking or consumed medications were excluded. Once the letter of informed consent
      was accepted, the patients were assigned to the respective treatment group. These individuals
      were advised to consume the recommended diet for subjects with MetS according to the
      guidelines of the ATPIII. Participants were randomly distributed to consume a) placebo
      treatment or b) genistein capsules (50 mg/day). The participants were followed for 2 months.
      In the previsit, informed consent letters were given, and blood samples were taken to
      evaluate glucose concentration, lipid profile, lipopolysaccharide and serum insulin. Also
      determined blood pressure, body weight, height, body composition and gut microbiota. The
      presence of insulin resistance was determined by means of the HOMA-IR index and by an oral
      glucose tolerance test. After 2 months, the same variables were assessed, and an expert
      surgeon in the operating room performed a vastus lateralis muscle biopsy, then RNA extraction
      and gene expression microarray assay was performed
