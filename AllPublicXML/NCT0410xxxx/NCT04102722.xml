  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, pilot study being conducted to evaluate the safety and performance
      of the investigational device (MUST) in detecting malignant lesions in breast tissue.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, prospective, pilot study in which all enrolled subjects will receive
      the same screening mammography procedures (i.e., 3D mammography plus MUST).

      Subjects will have between 1 and 4 clinic visits. The number of visits will be based upon the
      mammography and MUST findings, and whether additional procedures, such as MRI, biopsy, or a
      repeat MUST are warranted.
