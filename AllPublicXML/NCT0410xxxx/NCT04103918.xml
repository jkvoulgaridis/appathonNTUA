      The Research Question of the present study is the following: in a population of men and women
      affected by facial and neck wrinkles, will linear hyaluronic acid (Jalucomplex®)
      significantly decrease the appearance of facial and neck wrinkles, results observed after 12
      weeks?

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open, non-comparative study for evaluating the performance and safety of the
      medical device Jalucomplex in the treatment of facial and neck wrinkles.

      Similar dermal fillers have been used in several clinical investigations in humans with a
      good rate of clinical success and good safety profiles.

      Jalucomplex®'s acts by increasing tissue volume based on the natural ability of hydrophilic
      hyaluronic acid molecules to bind to an amount of water far greater than their own weight.
      This allows the material to fill intra-dermal spaces and supplement the intercellular matrix.
      Linear hyaluronic acid is a polymer that represents one of the essential components of human
      skin, subcutaneous and connective tissue; its ability to form complexes with water molecules
      increases the level of tissue hydration, turgidity and plasticity.
