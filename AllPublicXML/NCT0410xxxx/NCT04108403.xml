  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have previously found moderately painful massage produces comparable
      changes in pain sensitivity as a conditioned pain modulation paradigm in healthy participants
      suggesting shared underlying mechanisms. The researchers aim to extend these findings by
      understanding the influence of expectation on these findings.

      Massage is a muscle biased intervention individuals seek for pain alleviation; however, the
      mechanisms of massage are not well established. In this study, the investigators aim to
      determine the effect of expectations on massage related hypoalgesia. Individuals meeting
      eligibility criteria and agreeing to participate will attend one session that lasts
      approximately one hour. A myofascial trigger point (taut band of muscle tissue) will be
      assessed on the neck of the participant. Next, a baseline assessment of pressure pain
      threshold will be performed followed by random assignment to one of four study arms.

    <description>A computerized pressure algometer with a 1cm diameter rubber tip will be applied to the web space of the non-dominant foot. Participants are instructed to say &quot;stop&quot; so the stimulus can be terminated when the sensation first transitions from pressure to pain (threshold).</description>

    <description>A myofascial trigger point will be assessed in the trapezius muscle and massage applied to this area of the neck. Participants in this arm will receive a positive expectation instructional set followed by a moderately painful massage (pain = 50/100). Massage will be applied for one minute, four times with assessment of pressure pain threshold at the foot between each interval.</description>
