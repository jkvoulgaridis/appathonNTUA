  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multicenter, phase 1/1b study to assess safety/tolerability and
      preliminary clinical activity of E7766 as a single agent administered intravesically in
      participants with NMIBC. Both intermediate risk and BCG-unresponsive NMIBC participants will
      be included.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Phase 1/1b study consist of two parts: Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion. In the Dose
      Escalation Part, E7766 will be administered intravesically to participants with intermediate
      risk NMIBC or participants with BCG unresponsive NMIBC with increased dose levels to assess
      safety/tolerability profile of E7766 and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of E7766. In the Dose Expansion Part, E7766 at RP2D will be
      administered to participants with NMIBC with or without carcinoma in situ (CIS) to confirm
      safety and assess preliminary clinical activity of E7766 as a single agent. Clinical activity
      will be evaluated by complete response (CR) rates at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18
      months, 24 months, and by duration of complete response (DOCR) in all participants who have
      achieved CR on treatment with E7766.
