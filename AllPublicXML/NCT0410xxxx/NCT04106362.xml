  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well radiation therapy and cisplatin with or without
      cetuximab works in treating patients with human papillomavirus (HPV) positive, KRAS-variant
      stage III-IV oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays
      to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal
      antibodies, such as cetuximab, may help the body?s immune system attack the cancer, and may
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving radiation therapy,
      cisplatin, and cetuximab may work better in treating patients with HPV positive, KRAS-variant
      oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma compared to radiation therapy and cisplatin alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy of radiation therapy with concurrent cisplatin combined with
      concurrent cetuximab in KRAS-variant oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) patients
      in terms of overall survival (OS) at 2 years.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy of radiation therapy with concurrent cisplatin combined with
      concurrent cetuximab in KRAS-variant OPSCC patients in terms of patterns of failure at 6
      months and 2 years.

      II. To determine the efficacy of radiation therapy with concurrent cisplatin combined with
      concurrent cetuximab in KRAS-variant OPSCC patients in terms of progression-free survival
      (PFS) at 2 years.

      III. To determine the efficacy of radiation therapy with concurrent cisplatin combined with
      concurrent cetuximab in KRAS-variant OPSCC patients in terms of locoregional control (LRC) at
      2 years.

      IV. To determine the efficacy of radiation therapy with concurrent cisplatin combined with
      concurrent cetuximab in KRAS-variant OPSCC patients in terms of distant metastasis-free
      survival (DMFS) at 2 and 5 years.

      V. To determine the efficacy of radiation therapy with concurrent cisplatin combined with
      concurrent cetuximab in KRAS-variant OPSCC patients in terms of OS at 5 years.

      VI. To determine the safety of radiation therapy with concurrent cisplatin combined with
      concurrent cetuximab in KRAS-variant OPSCC patients in terms of acute toxicity profiles at
      the end of radiation, at 1 month, and at 6 months.

      VII. To determine the safety of radiation therapy with concurrent cisplatin combined with
      concurrent cetuximab in KRAS-variant OPSCC patients in terms of late toxicity profiles at 1
      and 2 years.

      VIII. To determine the safety of radiation therapy with concurrent cisplatin combined with
      concurrent cetuximab in KRAS-variant OPSCC patients in terms of patient-reported swallowing
      outcomes at 6 months and 1 and 2 years.

      IX. To assess the predictive value of fludeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography
      (PET) at 10-14 weeks post-treatment.

      X. To assess the predictive value of additional blood and tissue biomarkers for disease
      outcomes at 2 years.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the impact of cetuximab on the immune response as well as treatment outcome
      and toxicity.

      II. To evaluate biomarkers for immune response in HPV-associated OPSCC through saliva and
      blood samples to be collected prior to treatment and at each follow-up visit.

      III. To evaluate for additional checkpoint targets through tumor tissue taken at the time of
      initial biopsy and profiled for tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, activation markers, and
      antigen-specific T-cell receptor (TCR) utilization/diversity.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Beginning on day 0, patients undergo radiation therapy over 6 weeks for a total of 35
      fractions. Patients also receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours on days 0 and
      21.

      ARM II: Patients receive cetuximab IV over 120 minutes 5-7 days prior to start of radiation
      therapy and then IV over 60 minutes weekly on Monday or Tuesday for 7 weeks. Patients also
      undergo radiation therapy and receive cisplatin as in Arm I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2-4 weeks, every 12 weeks
      for 2 years, and then every 3-12 months for up to 5 years.

          -  Serum creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x institutional ULN OR creatinine clearance (measured via
             24-hour urine collection) &gt;= 50 ml/min (that is, if serum creatinine is &gt; 1.5 times
             the ULN, a 24-hour urine collection to calculate creatinine clearance must be
             performed) (within 2 weeks prior to registration)

          -  Female subjects must either be of non-reproductive potential (i.e., post-menopausal by

             including undergoing treatment, scheduled visits, and examinations including follow up

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with biopsy-proven metastatic, HPV-negative, KRAS-variant negative, or
             recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
