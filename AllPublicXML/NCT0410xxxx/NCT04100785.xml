  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to explore the efficacy and acceptability of a clinician-guided
      internet-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (iCBT) programme for patients with depression,
      in Singapore.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All outpatients, from the Institute of Mental Health, Singapore, who are diagnosed with a
      primary diagosis of mild to moderate depression and were referred to the Psychology
      Department for therapy were invited to take part in this research. Participants were
      randomised into two groups: iCBT Intervention Group and Delayed Waitlist-Control Group. The
      four-week iCBT programme comprised of three face to face 30-minute sessions with a clinician
      and six online modules).The treatment group is hypothesised to exhibit pre-post improvements
      in depressive symptoms, compared to the control group.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9)</measure>
    <time_frame>week 1, week 3, week 4 and 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a nine-item self-report measure of symptoms and severity of major depressive disorder, based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. Scores on each item range from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). An overall cut-off score of 10 or greater has been found to be sensitive to a DSM-IV diagnosis of depression (Kroenke, Spitzer, Williams, amp; Löwe, 2010). The PHQ9 has an internal reliability of 0.86- 0.89, sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 88% for the clinical cut-off of 10. Test-retest reliability of 0.84, and moderately correlated(r=0.58) with the SF-20 mental health scale. (Kronke et al.,2001).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>week 1, week 3, week 4 and 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-7 is a seven-item self-report measure of symptoms and severity of Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD), based on the DSM-IV criteria for GAD. Scores for each item range from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). An overall cut-off score of 10 or greater has been found to be sensitive to DSM-IV diagnoses of GAD, social phobia and panic disorders (Kroenke, Spitzer, Williams, Monahan, amp; Lo ̈we, 2007). The GAD-7 has an internal reliability of 0.92, test-retest reliability of 0.83, and criterion validity of 0.75 with SF-20 mental health scale (Spitzer et al., 2006) .The GAD-7 is increasingly adopted in empirical studies and in large scale dissemination studies as a general measure of shifts in anxiety symptoms (Clark et al., 2009).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>week 1, week 3, week 4 and 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The WSAS is a five-item self-report measure of the extent of impairment in work and social functioning. Scores ranged from 0 to 40. An overall score of above 20 appears to suggest moderately severe or worse psychopathology. Scores between 10 and 20 are associated with significant functional impairment but less severe clinical symptomatology. The WSAS has an internal reliability of 0.70-0.94, Test-retest reliability of 0.73. Convergent validity compared with clinical interviews and severity of depression is 0.76-0.86.</description>

    <description>The iCBT programme comprised of 6 online modules, delivered over 4 weeks, with 3 face-to-face sessions provided by a clinician.The face-to-face sessions were conducted at week 1, 3 and 4. The objectives of the face-to-face sessions was for participants to discuss with the clinician about the application of the content of the modules and the active therapeutic interventions were all found in the online modules.</description>
