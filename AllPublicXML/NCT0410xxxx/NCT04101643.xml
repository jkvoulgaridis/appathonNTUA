  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spastic paraplegia type 5 (SPG5) is a rare subtype of hereditary spastic paraplegia, a highly
      heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders defined by progressive neurodegeneration
      of the corticospinal tract motor neurons. SPG5 is caused by recessive mutations in the gene
      CYP7B1 encoding oxysterol-7a-hydroxylase. This enzyme is involved in the degradation of
      cholesterol into primary bile acids. CYP7B1 deficiency has been shown to lead to accumulation
      of neurotoxic oxysterols. Oxysterols were found to impair metabolic activity and viability of
      human cortical neurons at concentrations found in SPG5 patients, indicating that elevated
      levels of oxysterols might be key pathogenic factors in SPG5. Monoclonal antibodies that
      inhibit proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) have emerged as a new class of
      drugs that effectively lower cholesterol levels. Evolocumab, a member of this class, is a
      fully human monoclonal antibody that reduces LDL cholesterol levels by approximately 60%. We
      thus performed this interventional trial with Evolocumab 420 mg for SPG5 patients.
