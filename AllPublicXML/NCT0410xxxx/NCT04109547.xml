  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study compares 2 medicines for type 2 diabetes: oral semaglutide (a new medicine) and
      placebo (a dummy medicine). Researchers will test semaglutide to see how well it works
      compared to placebo. The study will also test if semaglutide is safe. Participants will
      either get semaglutide or placebo - which treatment is decided by chance. Participants will
      get 1 tablet a day to take with up to half a glass of water. Participants must take the
      tablet first thing in the morning on an empty stomach. After taking the tablet, participants
      must not eat or drink anything for at least 30 minutes. After the 30 minutes, participants
      can have their first meal of the day and take any other medicines they may need. The study
      will last for about 8 months (36 weeks). Participants will have 9 clinic visits and 2 phone
      calls with the study doctor. At all 9 of the clinic visits, participants will have blood
      samples taken. At 5 of the clinic visits, participants must arrive fasting. This means they
      cannot eat for 8 hours before the visit. It is fine to drink water up to 2 hours before the
      visit. This is for some of the blood samples that will be taken at the visit. Women cannot
      take part if pregnant, breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant during the study period.
