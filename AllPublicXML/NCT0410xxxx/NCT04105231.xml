  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of cannabidiol (CBD) compared with risperidone in the
      treatment of people with both psychosis and cannabis abuse. Half of participants will receive
      monotherapy with CBD and the other half will receive risperidone monotherapy. We hypothesize
      that CBD will have superior therapeutic efficacy and fewer side effects compared with
      risperidone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with both psychosis and cannabis abuse are particularly difficult to treat because
      cannabis abuse worsens psychotic symptoms and increases the risk that a first-episode
      psychosis will progress into schizophrenia. It is the THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) content in
      cannabis that aggravates psychotic symptoms whereas the CBD (cannabidiol) content has
      potential therapeutic effects. This trial investigates treatment with CBD (without THC)
      versus risperidone (an antipsychotic agent) in people with both psychosis and cannabis abuse.
      The hypothesis is that CBD will ameliorate psychotic symptoms and increase the risk of
      cannabis cessation to a larger extent than risperidone. Based on previous clinical and
      preclinical data, we also expect a superior effect of CBD on anxiety and cognitive
      dysfunction compared with risperidone. Sleep disturbances are often a limiting factor in
      improving quality of life measures, and it is also examined how CBD affects objective and
      subjective sleep quality as well as circadian rest-activity cycles. Based on previous studies
      investigating CBD as monotherapy in patients with schizophrenia, it is expected that CBD will
      be associated with fewer adverse events than risperidone.
