  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Upper extremity motor impairment is one of the major sequelae of stroke, resulting in
      limitation of activities of daily livings. Noninvasive neuromodulation is one of the
      therapies for motor recovery, which includes transcranial magnetic stimulation and
      transcranial direct current stimulation(tDCS). Anodal tDCS increases excitability and
      cathodal tDCS decreases excitability of neurons.

      In systematic reviews, tDCS applied over primary motor cortex showed positive results on
      motor learning and improvements of hand fine motors. Recently, there has been trials of tDCS
      over cerebellum, considering the connectivity of primary motor cortex and cerebellum in motor
      controls. However, the results of these trials are yet contradictory, and the study using the
      functional near infrared spectroscopy to prove the effects of tDCS over distant area is
      lacking.

      Therefore, in this study, we used functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to observe
      the hemodynamic change of primary motor cortex when applying tDCS over cerebellum ascertain
      their connectivity.

      In this crossover design, participants are randomly allocated to &quot;sham tDCS-washout
      period-anodal tDCS group&quot; or &quot;anodal tDCS- washout period- sham tDCS group&quot;. The recording of
      fNIRS starts 3 minutes before the tDCS stimulation and continues throughout 20 minutes of
      stimulation, until 30 minutes after the stimulation cessation. After 7 days of washout
      period, second recording is done as the same protocol. Outcome measures are the changes of
      concentration of deoxyhemoglobin [deoxy-Hb] and oxyhemoglobin [oxy-Hb].

    <description>Ybrain tDCS System (Ybrain, Korea) is used. Anode of tDCS is placed over right cerebellar hemisphere (3cm lateral from the occipital protuberance) and cathode over the on ipsilateral buccinator muscle.
For Sham tDCS, total stimulation lasts 90 seconds: ramp up period of 30 seconds, stimultation for intensity of 2mA for 30 seconds, and ramp down period of 30 seconds. At least 7 days of washout period is in between two tDCS. For Anodal tDCS, 20 minutes of stimulation for intensity of 2mA.</description>
