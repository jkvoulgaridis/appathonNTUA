  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A double-blind placebo controlled randomized Phase 3/4 study in subjects with nonalcoholic
      steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis stages 2-3 who are overweight or obese and have
      prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.

      The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the effect of Aramchol as compared to
      placebo on NASH resolution, fibrosis improvement and clinical outcomes related to progression
      of liver disease.

      Subjects will be randomized to receive Aramchol 300mg BID or matching placebo in a 2:1
      randomization ratio.
