  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the rapid shift to virtual care, this pilot study aims to determine the feasibility of
      prescribing low-duration, interval-based training through virtual care. If successful, this
      study will inform a larger randomized control trial to determine if the prescription of
      low-duration interval-based training improves chronic disease through the measurement of
      hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), and weight to a greater extent than the general guideline to aim for
      150 minutes of PA weekly.

      Dr. Fernando will invite patients to participate in this trial during their virtual diabetes
      appointments at the East Elgin Family Health Team (EEFHT). Participants will be randomized
      1:1 using computer-generated randomization software to receive either a population-based,
      standard activity intervention (control group) or a high-intensity interval training (HIIT)
      intervention, which they will complete on their own time, at the location of their choosing
      (at home, gym, outside, or elsewhere). Data will be collected at baseline (T1), and
      participants will be followed up after 3 months (T2) and 6 months (T3). All data acquisition
      is from standard of care (i.e. patients are already seen every 3 months for diabetes visits).
      Data collection at T1, T2 and T3 will include:

        -  Weight and Height (measured using the Health-O-Meter weigh scale, used to calculate BMI)

        -  Minutes of PA (self-reported by participants using the log books designed for this
           study)

        -  HbA1C (requisition will be provided by Dr. Fernando. Patients will be exempt from
           completing the baseline HbA1C if they have had a HbA1C measurement in the past 30 days &amp;
           the patient has not made significant lifestyle changes or had any blood glucose
           medications changed; in this case, the measurement completed in the past 30 days will be
           used as the baseline measure)

        -  Blood glucose and blood pressure medications

    <description>This PA intervention will be primarily self-directed by the patients themselves. Each participant will receive a 1-page double-sided handout detailing their PA protocol. Participants in this arm will receive a CSEP handout (page 4&amp;5 from: http://csep.ca/CMFiles/Guidelines/CSEP_PAGuidelines_0-65plus_en.pdf) detailing their PA recommendations.Participants will be instructed to follow their PA protocol, while noting down which days they completed the PA using a log booklet provided to them by Dr. Fernando (their family physician). Participants will be provided with the phone number for Justine Horne who is a lifestyle coach and co-investigator on this trial. If participants have questions about their PA protocol, Justine will respond to these over the phone.</description>
