  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most patients with Chronic Hepatitis B are on nucleoside analogy (NA) long term, but this
      leads to HBsAg loss (defined as functional cure) of only 2% at 6 years. Recently a number of
      studies have shown significant HBsAg loss rates after stopping nucleoside analogues (NA).
      However, no criteria to select such patients have been evaluated. Consequently, the objective
      of the study is not only to determine the proportion of patients able to achieve HBsAg loss
      in those with qHBsAg≤100IU/ml. The study is designed as a randomised control trial with 1:2
      parallel arm randomisation to continuing NA or stopping therapy. Patients will be monitored
      after stopping therapy for Hepatitis B flares and also to document HBsAg loss.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) affects over 250 million persons and is considered one of the major
      causes of mortality and morbidity globally. Standard treatment consists of nucleos(t)ide
      analogues (NA) or peginterferon (PEG). There has been increasing interested in HBsAg loss,
      defined as functional cure. However this has been difficult to achieve with NA, and although
      rates of HBsAg loss are higher with PEG, they are still &lt;10%. However, a number of studies
      have shown that HBsAg loss rates were significantly higher in those who stopped NA. A study
      from Greece by Hadziyannis had a 39% HBsAg loss after patients stopped adefovir therapy.
      Further studies have shown similar results, and those not able to clear HBsAg have had
      quiescent disease, although some patients had to restart therapy usually due to hepatitis B
      flares. No deaths have been reported. Consequently, while stopping therapy has led to HBsAg
      loss in some patients, it is not clear which patients would benefit the most. The prior
      studies have indicated that patients most likely to lose HBsAg had low qHBsAg levels and a
      level ≤100 IU/ml had a high possibility of HBsAg loss. Consequently, we propose to test
      whether patients with CHB on NA &gt;1year and without liver cirrhosis and with qHBsAg≤100 IU/ml
      are able to lose HBsAg compared to those who continue NA. The study is designed as a parallel
      arm RCT randomised 1:2 to continue NA versus stop NA. Patients will be monitored regularly
      for clinical status, virological markers, and liver markers. The primary endpoint is HBsAg
      loss at the end of the study in those who stop versus those who continue NA. Additional
      outcomes will be hepatitis B flares, inactive hepatitis B status, virological relapse, and
      restarting therapy.
