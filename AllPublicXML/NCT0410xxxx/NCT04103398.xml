  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multicenter phase III randomized trial. The purpose is to investigate both the
      efficacy and safety of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus sorafenib versus TACE
      alone for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will recruit 162 patients with unresectable HCC, and they will be randomized (1:1)
      into two groups (TACE+sorafenib group, TACE group). Patients in TACE+sorafenib group will
      receive TACE one day following oral sorafenib (initial dose: 400mg BID). Patients in the TACE
      group will receive TACE alone.

TACE will be performed via injecting chemotherapy drugs (oxaliplatin 200mg, raltitrexed 4mg, epirubicin 20mg in cTACE or 70mg in dTACE) and embolizing agents (gelatin sponge or microsphere) into blood vessels that help tumor grow.</description>
