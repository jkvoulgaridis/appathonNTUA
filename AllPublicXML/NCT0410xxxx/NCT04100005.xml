      This study seeks to correlate microbiome sequencing data with information provided by
      patients and their medical records regarding Crohn's disease.

      The goal of this Research Study is to better understand how the genetic information in
      subject's microbiome correlates to the information provided in surveys and in medical records
      regarding Crohn's disease.
