  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In primary and secondary liver tumors microwave ablation could be an alternative to surgical
      resection.It could be performed laparoscopically. Under ultrasound control the microwave
      device is placed in the tumor.Therefore spatial orientation is challenging: the tumor is
      often missed and the failure rate is high. During learning curve this could lead to
      incomplete tumor ablation and high rate of local recurrence. Targeting systems could optimize
      that. The CasOne-SPOT-system is an innovative electromagnetic tracking and navigation system
      for laparoscopic microwave ablation. In this study targeting precision using the SPOT-System
      should be compared to conventional laparoscopic ultrasound-guided microwave ablation.
      Therefore tumor mimics (1-2cm) will be created in ex-vivo pig livers and microwave ablation
      will be performed ultrasound guided or ultrasound navigated. The ablation procedures will be
      performed by two novices and two experienced surgeons. Aim of this trial is to is to
      evaluate, if laparoscopic microwave ablation could be facilitated by the use of the
      SPOT-navigation system.
