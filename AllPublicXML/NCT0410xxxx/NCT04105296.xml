  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current study is to determine the effects of applying epidural stimulation
      (ES) on motor control recovery in Veterans with SCI. The intervention will be accompanied
      with the use of a powered exoskeleton (EKSOÂ®) for 6 months to facilitate standing and to
      produce step-like movement in persons with chronic motor complete (AIS A or B) SCI and level
      of injury below C5 . Walking speed, distance, muscle activation pattern as measured by
      surface EMG and walking parameters including stand-up time, walking time, distance will be
      considered primary outcome variables. Cardiovascular performance, as measured by resting
      blood pressure and heart rate, peak oxygen consumption during walking, energy expenditure,
      whole and regional body composition assessments will also be measured. The effects of
      training (ES+EKSO) on , and speed of walking will also be evaluated.

      Five veterans with chronic motor complete SCI (AIS A or B) will be recruited to participate
      in the current trial. The primary objective is to determine how implantation of an epidural
      stimulator can help to control movement in the leg muscles to stand and perform stepping.
      Participants will be trained using a robotic suit and parallel bars. The procedure of using
      epidural stimulation with the robotic suit is experimental. The participant will be scheduled
      to perform temporary implantation followed by permanent implantation. Seven days later, two
      8-electrode arrays of Vectris lead will be implanted in an operating room. The research team
      will be responsible for helping the participants to trigger the paralyzed muscles from supine
      and sitting using for 5 days per week. Participants would be required to come for study
      visits twice daily for 2 hours per day. Each visit will last approximately 1 hour in the
      morning and 1 hour in the evening. During these visits, participants will practice walking
      with a robotic suit for 30-60 minutes followed by overground walking between parallel bars,
      or with a walker or crutches.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A written clearance by the medical doctor to ensure that the participant is safely
             able to engage in the program.

          2. Participants who require assistance with activities of daily living, must have a
             caregiver or companion with them throughout their participation in the study.

          3. Participants will have to be 2 years post-injury with any level of injury below C5 and
             using wheelchair as the primary mode of mobility. The study is primarily exploratory,
             and all participants will be between 18-70 years old with SCI.

          4. Hip width (distance between two greater trochanters), upper leg length (greater
             trochanter to the lateral aspect of joint line of the knee joint) and lower leg length
             (lateral aspect of joint line of the knee joint to the bottom of the foot) that can
             fit the robotic suit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unhealed fracture in either lower or upper extremities

          2. Severe scoliosis, hip knee ROM or flexion knee contractures preventing positioning in
             an exoskeleton or plantarflexion deformity greater than 20 degrees.

          3. High resting blood pressure greater than 140/80 mmHg and or sudden hypotension upon
             standing as characterized by drop in blood pressure by 20 mmHg especially in persons
             with tetraplegia.

               -  subjects with uncontrolled autonomic dysreflexia

               -  subjects with concurrent severe neurological injuries other than SCI: MS, CP,
                  TBI, stroke;

               -  subjects with unresolved deep vein thrombosis (DVT);

               -  subjects with prosthetic lower limbs;

               -  subjects with psychiatric or cognitive impairments which will interfere with
                  proper operation of both the spinal cord stimulator as well as the exoskeleton;

               -  subjects with an unhealed spinal fracture or unstable spine; and
