  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative evaluation of the precise localization of the intrapartotic facial nerve is
      essential for the ENT surgeon to assess the risk of nerve damage during parotid tumor
      excision, and inform the patient of the risk of post-paralyzed facial nerve palsy. procedure

      1. st visit: Inclusion, parotid MRI 3Tesla high resolution with specific sequences and
           gadolinium injection performed at the A. de Rothschild Foundation. Evaluation by two
           radiologists of the exact position of the parotid tumor with respect to the trunk of the
           facial nerve and its first branches, classified into two categories: contact (≤ 5 mm) or
           distance (&gt; 5 mm).

        2. nd visit: Surgical intervention of the parotid tumor. The surgeon will specify the same
           data as those collected by the radiologists after the MRI. The surgeon will not be aware
           of the data concerning the ratios of parotid tumor to facial nerve collected on MRI
           sequences for research purposes.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine the sensitivity of a high-resolution 3 Tesla MRI with gadolinium injection with specific sequences versus intraoperative findings of the surgeon (gold standard), to evaluate the anatomic relationships between parotid tumor and facial nerve.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Sensitivity of new MRI sequences to determine whether the parotid tumor is in contact or at a distance from the facial nerve (common core and first division branches) in comparison with the intra-operative examination (gold standard).
The contact between the parotid tumor and the trunk of the facial nerve or its first branches of division is a binary qualitative variable with modalities defined as:
&quot;Yes&quot;: tumor on contact (distance between the tumor and the trunk of the facial nerve or its first branches between 0 and 5 mm)
&quot;No&quot;: trunk of the facial nerve or its first divisional branches located at a distance (ie more than 5mm from the parotid tumor).</description>
