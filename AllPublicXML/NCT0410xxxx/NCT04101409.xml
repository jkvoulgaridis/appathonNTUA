  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acoustic neuroma had several treatment options. One of standard treatment is to
      receive the Gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery, other options included suboccipital
      craniotomy and conservative treatment. Thus, shared decision making (SDM) is necessary to aid
      patients to choose an appropriate treatment that suits their needs.

      The investigators have developed a decision aids (DAs) and plan to conduct a randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate its impact on acoustic neuroma patients. The measurements
      include a battery of interview-based questionnaires and evaluations of decision regret and
      post-treatment depression. The investigators expect the DAs would benefit the intervention
      group in the aspects of knowledge, communication and anxiety status during and after their
      treatment sessions.

    <description>Total score of decision regret, The dependent variable for this study was decision regret, assessed using the Decision Regret Scale (DRS). The DRS consists of five statements: (1) It was the right decision; (2) I regret the choice that was made; (3) I would go for the same choice if I had to do it over again; (4) the choice did me a lot of harm, and (5) the decision was a wise one. Agreement with each statement is measured on a five-point Likert scale (1 = strongly agree to 5 = strongly disagree). Score of each item is converted to a 0-100 scale by subtracting 1 from each item and multiplying by 25. Scores from items 2 and 4 are reversed. To obtain a global score, all items are summed and the total is divided by 5. Scores range from 0 (no regret) to 100 (high regret), increasing by increments of 5.
