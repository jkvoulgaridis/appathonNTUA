  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcoholic hepatitis carries a risk of high mortality at short term, especially in its severe
      form. Its diagnosis is confirmed by liver biopsy. The prevalence of alcoholic hepatitis,
      severe or not severe, is poorly known and prospective data are needed. The present
      observational study aims to define the prevalence of alcoholic hepatitis among patients
      admitted for jaundice and determine their outcome according to the severity. Survival and
      markers of liver dysfunction will be assessed. A biobank including genetic samples will be
      created to identify the disease profile in terms of inflammation and regeneration. The
      performance of non-invasive criteria for diagnosis will also be studied.
