  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether targeted cognitive training, a low-cost and low-risk
      commercial cognitive remediation therapy, directly impacts therapeutic targets as well as
      secondary outcomes in college undergraduates. The active intervention will be compared to an
      active control condition (computer games). Participants will also attend CSU TILT Academic
      Workshops.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this project is to investigate whether commercial cognitive remediation
      therapy improves cognitive functioning in college undergraduates. The secondary goal is to
      investigate neurophysiological, cognitive, and psychosocial mechanisms of change. The
      investigators will compare cognitive remediation therapy to computer games. The active
      control condition will allow the investigators to determine whether targeted cognitive
      training, as an adjunct to academic skills training provided by CSU TILT, provides
      significant improvement over computer games alone (which is also thought to provide some
      value as &quot;brain training&quot;). Participants who agree to enroll in the study will be randomized
      to one of two intervention arms: cognitive remediation (CR) or active control (AC). In the CR
      arm, participants will complete 20 hours of targeted cognitive training, in 30-min session, 5
      days per week, over 8 weeks. The AC Arm will follow the same schedule, except that
      participants will complete video games (e.g., pong). All participants will repeat assessments
      at randomly determined midpoint, as well as after the 8 weeks of training have been
      completed.

    <description>Cognitive Remediation comprises of six exercises supplied by BrainHQ by Posit Science Corporation: Sound Sweeps (targets auditory processing speed): Two successive frequency-modulated tone sweeps are presented and participants indicate whether the frequency increased or decreased within each tone: Fine Tuning (targets auditory perception and processing speed): Participants indicate which one of two confusable syllables were presented; Syllable Stacks (targets auditory memory); Users report the order of presented syllables in a serial memory span task; Memory Grid (targets auditory memory); Participants match identical cards representing syllables; To do List Training (targets auditory memory): Participants see a g rid of everyday items (e.g., plant, carrots, shovel) and select the items in accordance with spoken instructions; Rhythm Recall (target auditory memory): Participants recreate auditory melodies</description>
