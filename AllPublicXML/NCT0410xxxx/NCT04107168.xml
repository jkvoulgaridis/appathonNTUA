  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a observational study to investigate how the microbiome correlates with efficacy and
      toxicity of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with advanced cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The gastrointestinal microbiome of a healthy individual is comprised of many hundreds of
      bacteria species and thousands of bacteria strains. The composition of bacteria in an
      individual's microbiome can change over time and this can be influenced by factors including
      diet, drugs, genetics and infection. These bacteria play a central role in digestion of food,
      development and regulation of our immune system as well as our resistance to pathogens.
      Recent evidence suggest that a patient's intestinal microbiota composition plays a critical,
      though as yet poorly defined, role in determining both therapeutic efficacy and likelihood of
      significant adverse events to T-cell checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy.

      Immune checkpoint inhibitors are revolutionising treatment of many types of metastatic
      cancer, including melanoma, renal and non-small cell lung cancer, in the expectation of
      improving patient overall survival. However, they have limitations as they do not work for
      all patients and can cause unpredictable, complex immune-related toxicities. The
      investigators will perform a detailed study of cancer patients receiving checkpoint
      inhibitors. Saliva and a series of stool samples will be collected from each patient to
      analyse their microbiome and will be linked to treatment response, by examining blood samples
      and - if available - tumour and organ samples. The investigators hope this work will enable
      personalisation of patient immunotherapies based on microbiome biomarkers, as well as
      precisely manipulate a patient's microbiota to optimise their immunotherapy.

      Comparison with a limited cohort of healthy household members (up to 360 volunteers) acting
      as controls will provide additional essential information about the role of the
      patient-specific microbiome.

               -  Received no prior immune checkpoint inhibitors (previous treatment with other
                  types of anti-cancer therapy is determined by patient cohort; for patients with
                  unresectable disease, prior adjuvant therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitor(s)
                  is allowed if completed at least 6 months previously).

               -  Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, sample

             abnormality which in the judgment of the investigator would place the patient at undue
             risk, or interfere with their ability to comply with the study. Examples may include,
             but are not limited to:

               -  Patients with uncontrolled ischaemic heart or other cardiovascular event (e.g.
                  myocardial infarction, new angina, stroke, transient ischaemic attack, or new
                  congestive cardiac failure) within the last 6 months

               -  Cirrhotic liver disease, known chronic active or acute hepatitis B, or hepatitis
                  C

               -  Current active, severe, or uncontrolled autoimmune condition, including but not
                  limited to Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

             Use of inhaled or topical steroids is allowed.

        Household control eligibility requirements:

        Confirmation of suitability to be a household control participant will be determined by
        completing a self-assessed questionnaire either at home or in clinic.

        Household controls must:

          -  NOT have had any gastrointestinal infections i.e., parasites, viruses or diarrhoeal
             episodes during the last 6 months.

          -  NOT have taken antibiotics for at least 6 months

          -  NOT have or be recovering from any chronic intestinal disease such as:

               -  Crohn's disease

               -  Ulcerative colitis

               -  Coeliac disease

               -  Irritable bowel syndrome

               -  Stomach ulcers

          -  NOT have a chronic autoimmune disease or significant allergies e.g., multiple
             sclerosis, asthma requiring regular medication, psoriasis.

          -  NOT have and NOT be recovering from any form of cancer.

          -  NOT take proton pump inhibitors, steroids, other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
             such as ibuprofen or aspirin.

        In addition, household controls must sign informed consent and be aged ≥18 years old.
