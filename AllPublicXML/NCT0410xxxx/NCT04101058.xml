  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO)/ Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders (NMOSD) is an
      immune-mediated inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system mainly
      involving optic nerve and spinal cord. It is clinically characterized by simultaneous or
      sequential involvement of the optic nerve and spinal cord, presenting a progressive or
      remission and relapse course, which can lead to paralysis and blindness.

      The objective of this study is to provide evidence regarding treat effects and factors
      related to prognosis which will help physicians better evaluable risk-benefit in NMOSD
      management and improve patients' outcome.

      Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO)/ Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders (NMOSD) is an
      immune-mediated inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system mainly
      involving optic nerve and spinal cord. It is clinically characterized by simultaneous or
      sequential involvement of the optic nerve and spinal cord, presenting a progressive or
      remission and relapse course, which can lead to paralysis and blindness.

      Globally, there is no solid data available for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of
      patients with acute Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders (NMOSD) attack, particularly very
      rare data from prospective studies. This is a multicenter, prospective, real-world cohort
      study in patients with acute NMOSD attack in China.

      Baseline data for approximately 200 patients with acute NMOSD attack from approximately 4
      centers will be collected. Patients with acute NMOSD attack (including first episodes and
      relapses) whose expansile disability status score (EDSS ) ≥ 2 points at baseline will be
      eligible to be further included in prospective study cohort for analysis of treatment effects
      and prognosis.

      The objective of this study is to provide evidence regarding treat effects and factors
      related to prognosis which will help physicians better evaluable risk-benefit in NMOSD
      management and improve patients' outcome.
