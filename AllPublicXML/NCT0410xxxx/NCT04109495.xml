  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition of hospitalized patients is reported in the range of 20-60% according to the
      definition and assessment method of malnutrition.

      In particular, the incidence of malnutrition in cancer patients is high up to 30-85%.

      Gastrointestinal disease is related to the digestion and absorption of nutrition therefore
      malnutrition rate of those patients is relatively high. Careful management of nutrition
      support is needed.

      Malnutrition causes dysfunction of the mesenteric membrane, immune function impairment,
      decreased function of major organs such as liver, kidney and heart and alteration in
      pharmacodynamics. It could also increase infection rate and complications of chemotherapy,
      delay recovery time, so that increase morbidity, mortality and length of hospital stay.

      Proper nutrition management reduces malnutrition prevalence and medical costs of hospitalized
      patient, therefore nutrition screening and evaluation is necessary. The recent spread of
      smartphones has made it easier to record and evaluate meals, which are used in the diet
      market for weight loss through meal records and feedback based on smartphone applications.
      This approach is also expected to benefit patients with gastrointestinal cancer, where proper
      nutrition and feedback are important. In particular, pancreatic cancer, the worst intractable
      cancer of mankind, is digestive cancer with the most severe muscle mass reduction and
      nutritional deterioration after diagnosis.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a prospective cohort study designed to investigate the usefulness of the Noom smartphone application on nutrition management of pancreatic cancer patients. We randomly assigned patients with first diagnosed pancreatic cancer to Noom user group or non-Noom user group. A total of 40 participants were included for randomization. All patients underwent nutritional assessments (PG-SGA), laboratory test and quality of life assessments (EORTC QLQ) at enrollment, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. During study period, Noom user group voluntarily record meals and get feedback.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>A patient-generated subjective global assessment (PG-SGA) for oncology patients has been developed by Ottery. This tool has two sections-a medical history section that is completed by the patient, and a physical assessment section that is completed by nursing, medical, or dietetic staff. The medical history section includes additional questions regarding the presence of oncology nutrition impact symptoms.</description>

    <measure>EORTC Questionnaires - Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The European Organization for Research and Treatment(EORTC) questionnaire was designed to measure cancer patients' physical, psychological and social functions. The questionnaire is composed of 5 multiitem scales (physical, role, social, emotional and cognitive functioning) and 9 single items(pain, fatigue, financial impact, appetite loss, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, sleep disturbance and quality of life).</description>

    <measure>Skeletal muscle index change</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Cross-sectional skeletal muscle area (SMA, cm2) at this level is highly correlated with total body skeletal muscle mass. Adjustment of SMA for height2 results in skeletal muscle index (SMI, cm2/m2), a measure for relative muscle mass. Using skeletal muscle index change we evaluated sarcopenia in pancreatic cancer patients.</description>

    <description>The study population included first diagnosis of pancreatic cancer patients within 3 months of pancreatic cancer center visit, and randomly assigned to the use of Noom user group and non-use group. A total of 40 patients, 20 from each group, were used to examine nutritional status(PG-SGA), blood index analysis, and quality of life(EORTC QLQ) at 0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. At the same time, the patients voluntarily record meals and receive feedback using Noom. The purpose and contents of this study are explained in detail to the subjects, and written consent is obtained. The questionnaire items included gender, age, weight, type of diagnosed digestive disease, treatment method, nutritional supplement, oral status and intake of oral supplement foods, and past medical history. To assess the nutritional status using laboratory data, blood(about 8ml) is collected for each visit.</description>
