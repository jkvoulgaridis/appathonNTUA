  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total knee replacement (TKR) is a common and costly procedure widely used to relieve pain and
      improve function in patients with symptomatic advanced knee osteoarthritis (OA). As of 2013,
      the annual incidence of TKR was over 680,000 surgeries and annual costs exceeded $11 billion.
      Growing evidence suggests that while pain and functional status improve following TKR,
      physical activity (PA) typically does not surpass pre-TKR levels. Engagement in PA can
      meaningfully improve quality of life (QoL), pain, and function. Given the large investment in
      TKR, the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of TKR could be substantially increased if TKR
      recipients became more physically active.

      The Knee Arthroplasty Activity Trial (KArAT) is a randomized control trial and participants
      will be randomly assigned to one of three arms. Participants across all arms will receive
      usual post-operative care for TKR surgery. Participants in the first arm will complete basic
      study activities, such as responding to surveys and attending two in-person clinic visits.
      Participants in the second arm will receive a wrist-based physical activity tracker
      intervention and receive phone calls from study staff about improving their general well
      being. Participants in the third arm will receive a telephonic active coaching (motivational
      interviewing) and financial incentives (TAC(MI)+FI) based intervention, as well as a
      wrist-based physical activity tracker intervention. The second and third arms will receive
      financial rewards for wearing a wrist-worn activity tracker for twelve months during the
      study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have designed the KArAT trial with two specific aims. First, to conduct a
      parallel three-arm RCT to establish the efficacy and sustainability of the effect of
      personalized intervention built on the principles of behavioral science and behavioral
      economics in improving PA among sedentary person who have undergone TKR. Our second aim is to
      establish the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of TAC(MI)+FI to improve PA in persons who
      have undergone TKR.

      The three arms will include:

      Arm 1: Usual post-TKR care

      Arm 2: Usual post-TKR care + Wrist-based physical activity tracker wear + Phone calls about
      general well being

      Arm 3: Usual post-TKR care + Wrist-based physical activity tracker wear + Telephonic Active
      Coaching (Motivational Interviewing) + Financial Incentives (TAC(MI)+FI).
