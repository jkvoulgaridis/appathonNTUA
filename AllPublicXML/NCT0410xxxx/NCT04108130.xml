  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in
      surgical patients. National estimates suggest 1,062,000 PPCs per year, with 46,200 deaths,
      and 4.8 million additional days of hospitalization. Abdominal surgery is the field with the
      largest absolute number of PPCs. Our long-term goal is to develop and implement perioperative
      strategies to eliminate PPCs. Whereas PPCs are as significant and lethal as cardiac
      complications, research in the field has received much less attention, and strategies to
      minimize PPCs are regrettably limited. Recently, we and others have suggested a crucial role
      of anesthesia related interventions such as ventilatory strategies, and administration and
      reversal of neuromuscular blocking agents in reducing PPCs. These findings are consistent
      with the beneficial effects of lung protective ventilation during the adult respiratory
      distress syndrome (ARDS). While surgical patients differ substantially from ARDS patients as
      most have no or limited lung injury at the start of surgery, intraoperative anesthetic and
      abdominal surgery interventions result in lung derecruitment and predispose to or produce
      direct and indirect, potentially multiple-hit, lung injury. Thus, effective anesthetic
      strategies aiming at early lung protection in this group of patients are greatly needed.
      Indeed, the current lack of evidence results in wide and unexplained variability in
      anesthetic practices creating a major public health issue as some practices within usual care
      appear to be suboptimal and even potentially injurious. We hypothesize that an
      anesthesia-centered bundle, based on our recent findings and focused on perioperative lung
      protection, will minimize multiple and synergistic factors responsible for the multiple-hit
      perioperative pulmonary dysfunction and result in decreased incidence and severity of PPCs.
      Founded on strong preliminary data, we will leverage a network of US academic centers to
      study this hypothesis in two aims: Aim 1. To compare the number and severity of PPCs in
      patients receiving an individualized perioperative anesthesia-centered bundle to those in
      patients receiving usual anesthetic care during open abdominal surgery. For this, we propose
      to conduct a prospective multicenter randomized controlled pragmatic trial with a blinded
      assessor in a total of 750 patients. The bundle will consist of optimal mechanical
      ventilation comprising individualized positive end-expiratory pressure to maximize
      respiratory system compliance and minimize driving pressures, individualized use of
      neuromuscular blocking agents and their reversal, and postoperative lung expansion and early
      mobilization; Aim 2. To assess the effect of the proposed bundle on plasma levels of lung
      injury biomarkers. We theorize that our intervention will minimize overinflation and
      atelectasis reducing plasma levels of biomarkers of lung inflammatory, epithelial, and
      endothelial injury. Such mechanistic insights will facilitate bundle dissemination and
      support adoption as it has for lung protective ventilation for ARDS. At the end of this
      project, we expect to change clinical practice by establishing a new and clinically feasible
      anesthesia-centered strategy to reduce perioperative lung morbidity.

    <description>PROMIS is system of individual scales (e.g., Fatigue PROMIS measure, Dyspnea PROMIS measure) to quantify the physical, mental, and social health outcomes of a patient surrounding a particular health issue. The short form for both the Fatigue PROMIS measure will be used for the current study.
Items on the Fatigue PROMIS measure are rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1-5), where 1 most often means &quot;not at all&quot; and 5 most often means &quot;very much&quot;. Some items are reverse-coded.
Total T-scores will be used in the analysis of the current study. T-scores are derived from the total raw scale scores (sum of each item on the scale). Lower values represent a better outcome and higher values represent a worse outcome.
Fatigue PROMIS T-scores will be compared at 4 time-points.</description>

    <ipd_description>We will comply with the NIH Policy on the Dissemination of NIH-Funded Clinical Trial Information (NOT-OD-16-149) and NIH/NHLBI guidelines. We will submit data and specimens to the NHLBI BioLINCC repository, and follow procedures specified in The BioLINCC Handbook. The first step is the assembly and submission of a list of material as we will also submit specimens to the NHLBI biorepository. The second step will be to prepare a data redaction plan removing personal identifiers and administrative data. We will recode low-frequency data values to protect subject privacy. After we complete redaction, we will prepare study data set documentation, a summary of the changes and deletions during the redaction process, and a summary document. We will submit the data to the BioLINCC repository following the standard procedures. We will comply with any modifications identified during the BioLINCC repository review, and submit final material acceptable to the repository.</ipd_description>
