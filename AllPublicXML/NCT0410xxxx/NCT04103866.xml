  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current use of Juvederm Voluma XC is indicated for deep (subcutaneous and/or
      supraperiosteal) injection for cheek augmentation to correct age-related volume deficit in
      the mid-face in adults over the age of 21. In this particular setting, the intended use of
      the product Juvederm Voluma XC is to show that the filler works to alleviate stress in high
      pressure areas in the foot during gait, thus decreasing foot pain and allowing individuals to
      walk more comfortably.

    <description>Juvederm will be used in various parts of the foot to increase collagen volume and decrease high pressures of stress typically seen as people age. It will serve to promote the following: foot cushioning due to tissue atrophy, increase comfort when walking, decrease gait peak pressures which will decrease stress on bones and soft tissue and heal calluses, skin lesions, etc. It will also decrease the patient need for balancing and offloading by the use of an in-shoe orthotic device that requires a closed shoe system. Many people complain of pain walking barefoot, in high heels and sandals where orthotics are not effective.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient's 40 to 75 years of age

          -  Foot and ankle disability index of at least 55 (based on the majority of people having
             moderate difficulty in weight-bearing living) and heavy clinical significance of fat
             atrophy as evaluated by the principal investigator creating a standard analysis.

          -  Atrophy of the heel or the ball of the foot will be evaluated in the step wise
             approach.

          -  Second a clinical exam by the primary investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who do not have high pressure fat pad atrophy

          -  Patient is being treated for cancer

          -  Skin infections

          -  Unhealed or acute foot fractures

          -  Patients with a decrease in dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding

          -  Patients who have had previous injections with fillers

          -  Patients with nerve injury or nerve damage to the foot causing symptoms of numbness,
             tingling, burning, and sharp shooting or stabbing sensations. This criteria shall be
             determined by a. direct patient feedback. If the patient verbally states that they
             have numbness tingling burning sharp shooting or stabbing pains in their feet or
             ankles they will not be included.

             b. Semmes Weinstein Monofilament Testing - Semmes Weinstein monofilament testing will
             be performed on all patients. The Semmes Weinstein will be performed on the great toe
             submetatarsal one submetatarsal three submetatarsal five the heel and the dorsum of
             the foot. If a patient cannot feel the sends Weinstein filament in any of those
             locations they will be eliminated.

          -  Active an acute diabetic foot ulceration

          -  Patients with severe allergies manifested by history of anaphylaxis

          -  Patients with a history or presence of multiple severe allergies

          -  Patients with a history of allergies to gram-positive bacterial proteins

          -  Patients with a history of allergies to lidocaine.
