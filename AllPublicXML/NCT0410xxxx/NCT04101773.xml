      Rationale: There is level I evidence in literature that the first management step of HD is
      basic treatment, including laxatives and high fibre dieti, ii. The next treatment modality
      after basic treatment in case of persistent symptoms is rubber band ligation (RBL), which can
      be repeated if necessary.

      There is currently no consensus and a lack of evidence regarding the best treatment option
      for these patients having recurrent HD: continuing RBL or a surgical intervention.
      Furthermore, there is no estimate of costs and cost-effectiveness in this patient group.

      Objective: The primary objective of this RCT is to compare the effectiveness of RBL, sutured
      mucopexy and haemorrhoidectomy regarding recurrence and patient-reported symptoms for
      recurrent grade 2 and 3 HD after at least 2 previous RBL treatments. Secondary objectives are
      to compare RBL, sutured mucopexy and haemorrhoidectomy for recurrent grade 2 and 3 HD after
      previous RBL treatments in terms of early and late complications, impact of symptoms on daily
      activities, patient satisfaction with treatment, health-related quality of life, costs and
      cost-effectiveness, and budget impact.

      Study design: Dutch prospective multicentre randomized controlled trial.

      Study population: Patients â‰¥18 who have recurrent grade 2 or 3 haemorrhoidal disease and who
      had at least 2 rubber band ligation treatments. In total, 558 patients will be included.

      Intervention: Rubber band ligation versus sutured mucopexy versus haemorrhoidectomy. All
      three interventions are part of Dutch usual care, and serve as each other's control.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary outcomes are (1) recurrence and (2) patient-reported
      symptoms assessed after 12 months. Secondary outcome variables are early and late
      complications, impact of symptoms on daily activities, patient satisfaction with treatment,
      health-related quality of life, costs, cost-effectiveness and budget-impact.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Haemorrhoidal disease (HD) is the most common type of anorectal complaint in the Netherlands,
      with an annual prevalence of 10% in general practice. There is level I evidence in literature
      that the first management step of HD is basic treatment,including laxatives and high fibre
      diet. The general practitioner usually offers basic treatment. If basic treatment fails
      patients are referred to the hospital. About 50.000 patients are referred to a hospital for
      HD in the Netherlands annually. The next treatment modality after basic treatment in case of
      persistent symptoms is rubber band ligation (RBL), which can be repeated if necessary. RBL is
      an easy, cheap and outpatient-based procedure. Thirty per cent of the patients, approximately
      15.000 patients a year, develop recurrent symptoms after basic treatment and repeat RBL.
      There is currently no consensus and a lack of evidence regarding the best treatment option
      for these patients having recurrent HD: continuing RBL or a surgical intervention. Literature
      indicates that haemorrhoidectomy is the surgical treatment of choice based on outcomes like
      recurrencerate. The major drawback of this technique is that it is very painful and more
      costly compared to RBL. A relatively novel, but regular surgical alternative is the sutured
      mucopexy. Although hospital costs of sutured mucopexy are comparable to haemorrhoidectomy,
      the operation is less painful and requires less recuperation time. The recurrence rate of
      sutured mucopexy is ranked between that of RBL and haemorrhoidectomy.

      A Dutch national survey conducted by our research group evaluating the management practices
      of HD demonstrated considerable variation in the best (surgical) treatment option regarding
      recurrent HD, resulting in potentially undesirable practice variation. The treatment of
      recurrent grade 2 or 3 HD currently depends on the preference and the experience of the
      surgeon and of the patient, without high level evidence substantiating this practice
      variation. This implies a need for a high quality study regarding the treatment of recurrent
      grade 2 or 3 HD. Diminishing this practice variation will endorse cost-effectiveness in
      healthcare settings.To our knowledge, this will be the first RCT worldwide comparing RBL,
      sutured mucopexy and haemorrhoidectomy in recurrent grade 2 or 3 HD and generating high-level
      evidence of the (cost-) effectiveness. The investigators consider combining 2 trials in one
      with a direct comparison between these three interventions to be an efficient research
      approach.

      Up till now, trials were mostly powered on traditional outcomes like recurrence, a definition
      that differs widely between studies.To improve transparency between studies and facilitate
      the ability to compare and combine (future) studies, our research group developed a European
      Society of Coloproctology (ESCP) Core Outcome Set (COS) for HD. This international COS for HD
      selected 'patient-reported symptoms' as primary outcome. Additionally, the investigators
      recently developed a patient reported symptom score for HD: the PROM-HISS. This PROM is based
      on most cited symptoms in literature and patient interviews. The patient advisory board (PAB)
      of this project underlines the clinical relevance of this PROM. As the PROM-HISS has not yet
      been used in other studies and has to be validated, the investigators will additionally use
      patient-reported symptoms assessed by the PROM-HISS, next to recurrence, as primary outcome
      in this trial.

    <description>The Patient-Reported Outcome Measure-Haemorrhoidal Impact and Satisfaction Score (PROM-HISS) is a newly developed questionnaire assessing the symptoms of haemorrhoidal disease over time. These are blood loss, pain, prolapse, soiling and itching. These 5 items are graded using a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from (1) 'not at all', (2) 'a little', (3) 'reasonable', (4)'a lot' and (5) 'very much'. This results in a symptom score correlating with the severity of experienced HD symptoms. The PROM-HISS will be completed by e-mail. The PROM-HISS will assess a change of the symptoms over time. ThePROM-HISS is not validated yet, but an international validation study is being developed. Hence, the scale ranges are not clear yet.</description>

    <description>Assessed with the second part of the Patient-Reported Outcome Measure-Haemorrhoidal Impact and Satisfaction Score (PROM-HISS), which are each scored on a numeric rating scale from 0 to 10. Regarding impact of symptoms, 0 correlates with 'no impact at all' and 10 with 'highly impacted on daily life'. For patient satisfaction with treatment, this ranges between 0 'not satisfied' and 10 'very satisfied'. The PROM-HISS is not validated yet, but an international validation study is being developed. Hence, the scale ranges are not clear yet.</description>

    <description>Total costs over the course of 12 months will be calculated by multiplying resource use with the costs per unit. Resource use(e.g. treatment, control visits, visits to the GP, other diagnostic/medical procedures, medication) will be obtained from the CRFand from recall cost-questionnaires (e.g. over the-counter medication, and lost work days). Sources for valuation of the costs will be cost prices of the Dutch costing manual and cost prices from thePharmaco therapeutic compass. If necessary, local hospital cost prices or otherwise NZa tariffs will be used, which are largely based on integral cost prices from the Dutch hospitals. Absence of work will be calculated by using the friction cost method,which is recommended by the Dutch manual for costing (Zorginstituut Nederland, 2015).</description>

    <description>A budget impact analysis (BIA) will be performed in accordance with the Dutch guidelines for economic evaluations and the ISPOR guidelines. The BIA will be performed from different perspectives (e.g. societal, healthcare) with a time horizon of 5 years. As input for the BIA, we will use the results that will become available from the clinical and cost-effectiveness study.The BIA will be performed using a simple decision analytic model. Different scenarios will be compared to investigate various levels of implementation or full substitution of any of the 3 interventions, as well as the swiftness of implementation (1-5 years). In order to test the robustness of the results, sensitivity analyses will be performed on data input and assumptions. No discounting will be performed. The target population in the BIA will be similar to the study population.</description>

    <description>RBL is generallya simple, inexpensive procedure. It entails a ligation of haemorrhoids using rubber bands. In RBL, a disposable suction device applies a rubber band at least 2 cm proximal to the dentate line at the base of each haemorrhoidal cushion by using an anoscope. The banding process causes necrosis of the banded tissue and slough. The resultant inflammatory reaction causes refixation of the mucosa to the underlying tissue, helping to eliminate haemorrhoidal prolapse.The end result is a return of the haemorrhoidal cushions to a more normal size and configuration, with resolution of haemorrhoidal symptoms.</description>

    <description>A sutured mucopexy is an operation performed under general anaesthesia. At 4 cm proximal of the dentate line, a Z- shaped stitch through the rectal wall is placed and then at the upper level of the haemorrhoidal tissue, pulling up the prolapsing haemorrhoid high into the anal canal.</description>
