  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the Efficacy, Long Term Safety and Tolerability of
      RT001 in subjects with Friedreich's Ataxia
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy,
      safety, tolerability, in subjects with FRDA following the oral administration of study drug
      (active or placebo capsules). Sixty eligible patients will undergo various assessments at
      different time points during the the study. The study duration is 13 months which includes
      screening, treatment and safety follow up phone call.

    <measure>Effect of RT001 on modified Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (mFARS)</measure>
    <time_frame>11 months</time_frame>
    <description>The modified FARS is derived from the FARS Neuro Scale. The FARS Neuro Scale is based on the neurological examination of the Bulbar System, Upper Limb Coordination, Lower Limb Coordination, Peripheral Nervous System and Upright Stability Function. The mFARS will not include sub-scores from Peripheral Nervous System.</description>

    <measure>Distance walked during a 1-minute walk (T1MW)</measure>
    <time_frame>11 months</time_frame>
    <description>The T1MW is a quantitative measure of lower extremity function. The distance walked over 1 minute is measured</description>

    <measure>Effects of RT001 on a Fatigue scale</measure>
    <time_frame>11 months</time_frame>
    <description>To measure the change in score from baseline to Month 11 on a fatigue scale. This scale rates your fatigue over the last 7 days and is rated on a 5 point scale with a range of responses from not at all, a little bit, some what, quite a bit and very much.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effects of RT001 on Clinical Global Impression [CGI]</measure>
    <time_frame>11 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI is a 3-item observer rated scale that measures illness severity, global improvement and therapeutic response.The illness severity is rated on a 7-point scale, with the severity of illness scale using a range of responses from 1 (normal) through 7 (amongst the most severely ill patients). The global improvement scores range from 1 (very much improved) through to 7 (very much worse). Treatment response ratings should take account of both therapeutic efficacy and treatment-related adverse events and range from 0 (marked improvement and no side-effects) and 4 (unchanged or worse and side-effects outweigh the therapeutic effects). Each component of the CGI is rated separately; the instrument does not yield a global score.</description>
