  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of PD has made considerable advances in recent years with respect to drug
      therapies, as well as many new physiotherapy and drug-based methods, and there have also been
      great improvements in therapy thanks to deep brain stimulation. Cognitive rehabilitation has
      shown to be effective in PD (Abbruzzese et al., 2016), however, there has yet to be a major
      breakthrough in the treatment and prevention of PDD (Parkinson's Disease Dementia ). This is
      where the high frequency and intensive prevention described here comes into play.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive decline is an important and common complication in Parkinson's Disease (PD);
      approximately 27% of non-demented PD patients have Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) (Litvan et
      al. 2012, Chaudhuri et al., 2011) and up to 80% develop PD dementia (PD-D) over the long term
      (Hely et al., 2005). Cognitive course in PD is heterogeneous and affects visuospatial,
      attentional, executive and memory function; studies report different cognitive subtypes and
      divergent patterns of cognitive decline (Kehagia et al., 2010; Litvan et al., 2011;
      Williams-Gray et al., 2007; Yarnall et al., 2014). Recently, models have been constructed to
      estimate individual risk for global cognitive impairment using a small set of predictor
      variables (Liu et al. 2017; Velseboer et al., 2016). These prediction algorithms were
      developed in large samples of PD patients and accurately forecast cognitive decline in both,
      patients with MCI and patients with PD-D and were successfully replicated in independent
      samples; a score with a predefined cut off point predicts dementia with high positive and
      negative predictive values (Liu et al., 2017).

      The primary aim of this study is the possible stabilization or delay of cognitive decline as
      well as the improvement of the quality of life of the patients. As secondary outcome, the
      change in symptoms associated with PD, will be investigated. Psychological states as
      depression and anxiety, as well as cognitive performance in different areas, for example
      attention and memory shall be investigated. Neurological symptoms, for example motor function
      and sleepiness, will also be assessed as secondary parameters and potentially confounding
      factors.

      This study is a 4 week randomized controlled trial (RCT) with one experimental intervention
      group and one control group (Stepped-wedge trial). Primary and secondary outcome measures are
      assessed at baseline and are repeated after the 4-week intervention period and at 6 month in
      a follow-up assessment. After 4 weeks there is an intermediate measurement consisting of the
      primary outcome measures.

      The intervention group receives individualized program: the program will be tailored to the
      patient's needs, strengths and weaknesses, resulting from the initial assessment.

      The intervention group receives individualized program: the program will be tailored to the
      patient's needs, strengths and weaknesses, resulting from the initial assessment.

        1. Goal management training (Ariane Giguere-Rancourt et al., 2018) - is a home-based
           approach for PD patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). The program will applied
           to High Risk Patients for PDD. This well-validated cognitive training is developed to
           improve executive functions. It helps patients to raise awareness of deficits and
           improve cognitive control in goal-directed behaviors. Each session last 75-90 minutes,
           one per week.

        2. Physiotherapy - The role of physiotherapy is to maximize functional ability and minimize
           secondary complications through movement rehabilitation within a context of education
           and support for the whole person. The overall aim is to optimize independence, safety
           and well-being, thereby enhancing quality of life (Claire L Tomlinson et al., 2014).

           Physiotherapists train patients for example in cueing strategies to improve gait,
           strength to improve balance, motor co-ordination to improve posture and compensatory
           movement strategies to improve transfers (Samyra H.J. et al., 2004) The therapy sessions
           are individually guided by a physiotherapist and/or well-trained voluntarists at
           University Hospital of Basel (CH). Each session lasts 30 min, 1 to 3 per week.

        3. Rhythmic Music Gymnastic - Music makes it easier for patients with PD to improve the
           sense of rhythm disturbed by the disease. Just listening to loud and rhythmic music
           leads to a measurable improvement in agility.

           In cooperation of music- und physiotherapy Beelitz music-gymnastics 1+2 has been
           developed: training schemes with music for a daily training program. The music has been
           composed in accordance with the Patterned Sensory Enhancement. Tune, chords and rhythm
           &quot;depict&quot; the movement in sound. By this movement and motivation are improved. (3) Each
           session lasts 60 min, 1 to 3 times a week.

        4. Speech therapy -PD affects also face muscles, muscles in mouth and throat that are used
           to speak. This may cause a person's voice to change, as well as dysarthria, or
           difficulty in speaking, and dysphagia, or difficulty in swallowing.

      These problems may be referred to a speech and language therapist who is trained in all forms
      of communication, including non-verbal communication such as facial expressions or body
      language. Such therapists can teach techniques and offer tips for better communication. Each
      session lasts 60 min, 1 to 3 times a week.

      Control-group will obtain best medical treatment (Stepped-wedge trial).

    <measure>The Reliable Change Index in in Mini Mental Status (MMS; Folstein et al., 1975)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after 4 weeks of training, After 6-month</time_frame>
    <description>This is a widely used procedure, which is referred to as the screening of cognitive deficits. The test includes 22 tasks that are performed as an interview with the patient. A sum value is formed over the 22 tasks; the higher the sum, the better the cognitive function is assessed. From a total value of &lt; 24/30 points, there is a suspicion of a significant cognitive disorder.</description>

    <measure>The Reliable Change Index in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA; Nasreddine et al., 2005)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after 4 weeks of training, After 6-month</time_frame>
    <description>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA; Nasreddine et al., 2005) can be used as an alternative to MMS as a cognitive screening procedure. This measuring instrument was developed because the executive functions are only insufficiently reflected in the MMS. The MoCA is therefore more sensitive than the MMS to cognitive disorders associated with frontal disorders (Lessig, Nie, Xu, &amp; Corey- Bloom, 2012). The test is based on 12 tasks over which a sum value is formed. With a total value of &lt; 26/30, there is a suspicion of clinically relevant cognitive deficits.</description>

    <measure>The Reliable Change Index in the Trail Making Test (TMT; Reitan, 1958)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after 4 weeks of training, After 6-month</time_frame>
    <description>This is a paper pencil test and comprises two subtasks. Part A measures information processing speed, Part B is used to measure cognitive flexibility. In subtask A, numbers must be connected as quickly as possible in ascending order, while in subtask B numbers must be connected as quickly as possible alternately with letters (numbers in ascending order, letters along the alphabet: 1 - A - 2 - B - C, etc.). From this, various parameters can be calculated, including processing time, number of errors and cognitive adaptability independent of information processing speed (ratio processing time part B divided by processing time part A).</description>

    <measure>The Reliable Change Index in the Stroop Test (Stroop, 1935)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after 4 weeks of training, After 6-month</time_frame>
    <description>This test consists of three passages, which also include different cognitive Measure functions. During the first passages, the test person is presented with a colour chart; the task is to name the colour points as quickly as possible. The processing time is also a measure of the information processing speed. In the second pass, a blackboard is presented on which words are written in certain colours. In round three, the test person should name the colour of the words presented that interfere with the printing colour. In addition to the characteristic value of the processing time per pass, the error susceptibility and the interference susceptibility can also be determined independently of the processing time (processing time pass 3 divided by processing time pass 1).</description>

    <time_frame>Before and after 4 weeks of training, After 6-month</time_frame>
    <description>This test measures cognitive flexibility and the tendency towards perseveration. The test person is asked to assign four target cards, which differ in terms of the three criteria colour, shape and number, to each card according to a self-chosen sorting rule. After six correctly sorted cards, the test person is instructed to change the rule. This process is repeated until all three criteria have been sorted. Four scores are provided: Number of Categories Correct, Number of Perseverative Errors, Number of Total Errors, and Percent of Perseverative Errors.</description>

    <measure>The Reliable Change Index in Digit Span and the Corsi Block Test (Härtig et al., 2000)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after 4 weeks of training, After 6-month</time_frame>
    <description>Digit Span und the Corsi Block Test serve to evaluate the verbal and visual working memory. In the Digit Span, a sequence of numbers is presented orally, which is first repeated forwards and later backwards by the test person. The presented sequences become longer and longer. In the Corsi Block, the test person is presented with a board with irregularly arranged cubes. The task is to remember a sequence of tapped cubes and then to tap the cubes in the same sequence or later to follow the path shown in reverse order. Also with this test the difficulty increases, as the offered sequences become increasingly longer.
The total score for the Digit Span is the sum of 12 items, ranging from 0 (worst possible result) to 12 (best possible result).
The total score for the Corsi Block is the sum of 14 points in forward typing, ranging from 0 (worst score) to 14 (best symptoms) and the sum of 12 points in backward typing from 0 (worst score) to 12 (best symptoms).</description>
