  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye is a common ocular surface disease of multifactorial etiology characterized by
      elevated tear osmolality and inflammation leading to a disrupted ocular surface. The latter
      is a risk factor for ocular surface infection, yet overt infection is not commonly seen
      clinically in the typical dry eye patient. This suggests that important innate mechanisms
      operate to protect the dry eye from invading pathogens. Understand the pathogenesis of dry
      eye will be the measure to prevention and treatment of dry eye.

      In this essay, the investigators use the data of experiment in the patients with dry eye and
      normal, acquire their tear production, tear film stability, and surface damage. The
      investigators use weka to calculate the prediction accuracy of the 6 algorithm and select the
      best one, optimize the parameters to get the final prediction accuracy.

    <measure>OSDI</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI; Allergan Inc., Irvine, CA)consists of a 12-item questionnaire and is used to assess dry eye disease; the OSDI questions are drawn from three different categories: vision-related functions, ocular symptoms and environmental triggers. The OSDI is scored on a 4-point scale from 0 (indicating no problems) to 4 (indicating a significant problem). Responses to all of the questions are combined to generate a composite OSDI score that ranges from 0 to 100, with higher OSDI scores representing greater disability. Subjects were asked questions regarding the dry eye symptoms that they experience.</description>

    <measure>Schirmer I test</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Schirmer I test (SIT) without anesthesia for tear secretion function was conducted by placing a 30-mm sterile Schirmer Tear Test strip into the junction of the middle and lateral thirds of the inferior fornix of each eye for 5 minutes. The wet portion of the strip was subsequently measured, with lower scores indicating less tear production.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fluorescein staining</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The cornea was divided into upper, lower, nasal, temporal and central zones. Superficial punctate keratopathy (SPK) in the cornea was scored from 0 to 3 in each area. Where 0 indicated no staining in the cornea; 1,＜5 punctate stains; 2,5-10 punctate stains; and 3,＞10 or filamentous staining detected. The total score was recorded by adding the scores of the five zones for each eye (range: 0-15).</description>

    <measure>Noninvasive Tear Breakup Time</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Noninvasive Tear Breakup Time (NI-TBUT) measurements of subjects' eyes were obtained by Keratograph 5. At the start of the recording, the patients were asked to blink three times and then keep their eyes open as long as possible. Irregularities in the reflected image indicated the instability of the tear film. Meanwhile, the examination was recorded on video and a single eye of each subject was assessed three times. All the tests were performeded the same temperature and humidity conditions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tear meniscus height</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tear meniscus height was also performed by the Keratograph 5 and the image of tear meniscus height was obtained by the instrument. The observer measured the tear meniscus height the center of the lower lid margin. This evaluation was taken three times and the average value was recorded.</description>
