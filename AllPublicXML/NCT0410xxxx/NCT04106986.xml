    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of pulsed electromagnetic field and
      progressive resistance exercise on Knee Osteoarthritis. It is experimental research study
      that look at the additive effect of pulsed electromagnetic field and progressive resistive
      exercise on pain level, patient-reported and performance-based physical function and Quality
      of life for patients with knee osteoarthritis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: osteoarthritis is the main cause of disability in elderly population.[1,2] It
      affects almost one third of individuals aged 65 and older and approximately 25% of
      osteoarthritis patients 60 years and older cannot perform activities of daily living.[3] The
      clinical symptoms that lead to disability in Knee osteoarthritis are more frequent than all
      other joint complaint.

      A large body of evidence exists proving the beneficial effects of progressive resistance
      exercise (PRE) in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA).[4,5,6] Pulse electromagnetic
      field(PEMF) is a physical therapy modality that could be used for treating knee
      osteoarthritis (OA) and there emerging evidence suggesting its beneficial effect in reducing
      pain and improving function for knee osteoarthritis (OA)[7] The purpose of the study is to
      examine the effectiveness of using pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) with progressive
      resistance exercise (PRE) training in decreasing pain level ,improving physical function, and
      improving quality of life in patients with Knee osteoarthritis (OA) A small randomized
      control trial conducted to recruit 32 patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Participants
      with knee osteoarthritis (OA) as defined by American College of Rheumatology recruited from
      Prince Basma Educational Hospital. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive 24
      sessions (3 sessions/week for 8 weeks) of either the combined (PRE and PEMF) treatment or PRE
      only. Participants will be evaluated at baseline, after the end of treatment protocol (8
      weeks), and at 3 and 6 months follow up. Mixed ANOVA and repeated measure ANOVA will be used
      to evaluate the differences between groups in pain, and physical function, and quality of
      life

    <measure>Change Scores of The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 3 and 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>is knee-specific instrument , developed to assess the patients opinion about their knee and associated problems. the Knee Injury and osteoarthritis outcome Score(KOOS) evaluates both short-term and long-term consequences of knee injury. It holds 42 items in 5 separately scored sub-scales; pain, other symptoms , functions in daily living (ADL), Function in sport and Recreation (sport/Rec), and knee-related Quality of Life (QOL). An Arabic version of KOOS has been found to be valid and reliable was used in our study[8]</description>

    <measure>Change Scores of The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 3 and 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The SPPB assesses lower extremity function and has 3 components: walking gait speed, standing balance, and time to complete 5 chair stands. The total score is the sum of the three tests scores. The total score will be the variable used during data analysis. The SPPB has demonstrated good intra and inter-tester reliability, responsiveness, and validity[9,10]</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change Scores of The Numeric pain rating scale (NPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 3 and 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The NPRS is an 11-point scale comprising a number from 0 through 10; 0 indicates &quot;no pain&quot;, and 10 indicates the &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot;. Patients are instructed to choose a single number from the scale that best indicates their level of pain. The Arabic version of NPRS has shown good to excellent test-retest reliability and validity for patients with knee OA.[11]</description>

    <measure>Change Scores of The RAND-36 health survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 3 and 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The RAND-36 (identical items of SF-36 health survey with different scoring system) is an easily administered health status and quality of life self-reported measure. It consists of 36-items that assess eight health concepts: general health perceptions, physical functioning, limitations of activities due to physical health problems, limitations of activities due to emotional problems, bodily pain, social functioning, energy and emotional well-being. A valid and reliable Arabic version of RAND-36 health survey was used in our study.[12]</description>

    <description>The pulsed electromagnetic field treatment consist of 30 minutes pulsed electromagnetic field with 50 Hz pulses
The progressive resistance exercise training consist of 45 minutes of progressive resistance exercise protocol as the following:
The PRE session begun with warm-up exercises that included riding a stationary ergometer for 5 minutes followed by stretching exercises for the hamstrings, quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles. After this, subjects performed non-weight bearing (open chain) and weight bearing (closed chain) quadriceps exercises.
The amount of resistance and number of repetitions for each exercise are based on a modification of the daily adjustable progressive resistance exercise (DAPRE) program that was described by Knight eta al.</description>
