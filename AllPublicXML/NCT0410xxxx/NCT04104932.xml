      Isolated minor rib fractures (IMRFs), which is defined by single or two isolated minor rib
      fractures caused by trauma or stress. Traditionally, rib fractures are managed mainly by
      surgical stabilization or conservative treatment. In 2018, a systemic review and
      meta-analysis for patients with multiple rib fractures had revealed a shorter duration of
      mechanical ventilation, shorter hospital length of stay, and fewer trauma-associated
      complications in the surgical group than in the non-surgical group. In contrast, IMRFs are
      seldom life threatening, and compared to extremity fractures, rib fractures do not require
      matching accurately. Thus, IMRFs are usually treated conservatively. However, the
      investigators have clinically observed that patients suffering severe pain due to progressive
      rib displacement may take longer to return to normal activity, have lower quality of life,
      and even an increased risk of complications. Moreover, limited studies discussed the efficacy
      of surgical interventions for IMRFs. Therefore, the investigators conduct a prospective
      observational cohort study to compare the outcomes of surgical stabilization and conservative
      treatment in patients with IMRFs. The investigators collect patients with IMRFs whose
      situation were both suitable for surgical and non-surgical interventions. After explanation,
      patients can decide to undergo conservative or surgical treatment by themselves. The
      investigators will follow up pain scores, chest X-ray, pulmonary function tests, and duration
      of return to normal activity. Those data will be statistically analyzed by two-tailed
      two-sample t-test. This prospective cohort study is supposed to provide more evidence for
      clinical decision making and optimal management of IMRFs.
