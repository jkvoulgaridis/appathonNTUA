      This work is designed to:

        1. Evaluate the efficacy of lung ultrasonography in detecting opening and closing lung
           pressures in ventilated preterm neonates with respiratory distress syndrome.

        2. Determine the efficacy of lung ultrasonography in optimizing lung volume and its
           correlation with pulmonary inflammatory reaction as evidenced by IL-6 level in tracheal
           aspirate.

      The studied population included 44 preterm infants. Anthropometric measurements, gestational
      age, sex, mode of delivery, maternal disease and Apgar score were found to be matched in the
      two studied groups indicating successful randomization as seen in these balanced demographic
      variables between the groups.

      The studied population included 44 preterm infants. Then they were allocated randomly to one
      of 2 groups in order by admission:

      Group A: included 22 patients on whom the recruitment maneuver was applied guided by lung
      ultrasonography.

      Group B: included 22 patients on whom the recruitment maneuver was not ultrasound guided.
      This is considered the control group.

    <intervention_model_description>The study was conducted on 44 preterm neonates who were mechanically ventilated for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Then they were allocated randomly to one of 2 groups in order by admission:
Group A: it included 22 patients on whom the recruitment manoeuvre was applied guided by lung ultrasonography.
Group B: it included 22 patients on whom the recruitment maneuver was not ultrasound guided. This is considered the control group.</intervention_model_description>
