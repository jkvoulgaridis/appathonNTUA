  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have significantly higher levels of
      unemployment and underemployment compared to their typically developing peers and all other
      groups with neurodevelopmental disorders, even though major companies that have employed and
      trained young people with ASD acclaim their significant innovations in their companies. The
      investigators hope to examine the effects of specialized employment support programs, over
      current traditional vocational rehabilitation approaches, for adults with ASD on their
      ability to maintain steady employment and overall benefit to the organizations at which they
      will be employed.

      The investigators predict that Stanford University's Neurodiversity at Work (NaW) Program
      will improve employment outcomes and positively impact the overall quality of life of
      individuals with ASD in this program. The investigators hope that the findings of the study
      will lead to the advancement of programs aimed to support individuals with ASD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, there has been limited research examining effects of specialized employment support
      programs (such as Stanford's Neurodiversity at Work) for adults with ASD. Results from this
      study will have substantial positive impact on the field because they will significantly
      elevate the investigators' understanding of the factors involved in successful employment and
      QoL outcomes in individuals with ASD. Furthermore, understanding the trajectories of
      psychiatric symptoms, employment outcomes and QoL will facilitate the development of
      educational tools, training materials and intervention tools to help in improving overall
      outcomes of individuals with ASD.

      The study has four specific aims that the investigators hope will contribute towards the
      advancement and proliferation of programs, such as Stanford's Neurodiversity at Work (NaW)
      aimed to support individuals with ASD, both in in the workplace and beyond.

      The investigators' first aim is to compare job retention rates resulting from NaW starting
      before onboarding and NaW starting 6 months after onboarding (NaW-DS) for adults with ASD, as
      well as compare duration of sustained employment for NaW and NaW-DS (NaW-delayed start).

      The second aim is to compare the change in QoL between NaW and NaW-DS for adults with ASD at
      month 15 past onboarding. The investigators predict that NaW will result in a higher QoL, as
      measured by the World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment (WHOQOL-100), in adults
      with ASD, compared to NaW-DS. The investigators also have an exploratory aim of determining
      costs of employee turnover achieved from the NaW and NaW-DS, as well as comparing rates of
      job offers between specialized internship programs (IP) and specialized pre-employment
      training programs (PT).

      Additionally, behavioral assessments will be administered to participants throughout the
      duration of the study as additional exploratory measures.

      Results from this study will provide an evidence base for the understanding of trajectories
      of psychiatric symptoms, employment outcomes and QoL will facilitate the development of
      education tools, training materials and intervention tools to help improving overall outcomes
      of individuals with ASD.

    <description>Measures individuals' perceptions of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns.
Purpose of measure: compare the change in Quality of Life (QoL) between NaW and NaW-DS for adults with ASD at month 15 post-onboarding; compare the trajectories of change in QoL between NaW and NaW-DS for adults with ASD over time.
This scale consists of four domains: physical health, psychological, social relationships, and environment. A higher score indicates a better quality of life, while a lower score indicates a lower quality of life. There is a total of 100 items in this scale. The minimum score is 100, with the highest score being 500. The five point scale ranges from &quot;Not at all&quot; to &quot; Extremely&quot; (or &quot;Completely&quot; or &quot;Very satisfied&quot;). Subscales are combined to produce a total score.</description>

    <description>A 10-item scale that measures global self-worth by measuring both positive and negative feelings about the self. The scale is believed to be uni-dimensional. The minimum score is 10, with the maximum score being 40. A lower score indicates an individuals' lower self-esteem, while a higher score indicates higher levels of self-esteem. The four point scale ranges from &quot;Strongly agree&quot; to &quot;Strongly disagree.&quot;</description>

    <description>SPAI assesses specific somatic symptoms, cognitions, and behaviors across a wide range of potentially fear-producing situations to measure social anxiety and fear. The scale contains 17 items. The minimum score is 17, and the maximum is 85. A lower scale indicates lower levels of social phobia, while a higher score indicates higher levels of social phobia. The five point scale ranges from &quot;Not at all&quot; to &quot;Extremely.&quot;</description>

    <description>A scale which surveys adolescent and young adult knowledge of social skills and behavioral abnormalities. The scale contains 30 items that are &quot;True/False&quot; and multiple-choice in nature. A lower score (fewer items correct) indicates less knowledge of social skills, while a higher score indicates more knowledge of social skills.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months after onboarding, 12 months after onboarding, and 18 months after onboarding.</time_frame>
    <description>The Autism Spectrum Quotient was developed by the Autism Research Centre to test if adults with high-functioning autism or Asperger Syndrome are just an extreme on a dimension of autistic traits that runs right through the general population. This scale is comprised of 50 items and the four point scale ranges from &quot;Definitely agree&quot; to &quot;Definitely disagree.&quot; Higher and lower scores are irrelevant, as the scales are often reversed within this instrument.</description>
