  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase I trial to evaluate the safety of a hematopoietic cell-based gene
      therapy for patients with Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency (PKD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autologous hematopoietic stem cells from mobilized peripheral blood will be transduced ex
      vivo (outside the body) with a lentiviral vector carrying a correct copy of the deficient PKD
      gene. The corrected stem cells will be infused intravenously back to the patient with the
      goal of correcting the hematological manifestations of the disease.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  PKD diagnosis with a confirmed PKLR mutation.

          -  Age ≥18 years old and &lt;50 years for the initial 2 patients enrolled; ≥12-17 years for
             the next 2 patients; ≥8-11 years for the final 2 patients.

          -  History of severe, transfusion-dependent anemia, defined as:

               1. At least 6 red blood cell transfusion episodes over a prior 12-month period, or
                  at least 3 red blood cell transfusion episodes per year over 2 prior years (in
                  the absence of precipitating events such as infection or surgery) and

               2. Hb levels &lt;9.5 g/dL in the previous 12 months despite prior splenectomy. OR for
                  adult patients (age ≥ 18 years):

               3. Hb levels &lt;8.0 g/dL in the absence of transfusions (documented during 2 or more
                  assessments during the prior 1-2 years) regardless of transfusion requirements.

          -  Adequate cardiac, pulmonary, renal and hepatic function, as detailed in relevant
             exclusion criteria.

          -  Availability of detailed medical records, including transfusion requirements, for at
             least the prior 2 years.

          -  Willing and able to read and correctly understand the patient information sheet and
             provide consent (or informed assent for minors) regarding study participation.

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test for female patients of childbearing potential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of other known causes of hemolysis (in addition to PKD). Patients with
             concurrent G6PD deficiency diagnosed during pre-study evaluation may be considered for
             eligibility if in the opinion of the Investigator, the hemolytic anemia is the result
             of PKD and the G6PD deficiency is considered an incidental finding.

          -  A venous thromboembolic event (VTE; i.e., pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis)
             or arteriothromboembolic event (ATE; including unstable angina, myocardial infarction,
             stroke or transient ischemic attack) during the prior 12 months.

          -  Any evidence of severe iron overload that, per Investigator discretion, warrants
             exclusion.

          -  Evidence of bridging fibrosis, cirrhosis or active hepatitis on liver biopsy. Liver
             biopsy is required when liver iron concentration (LIC) is ≥15 mg/g on T2* magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI) of liver. If a liver biopsy has been performed less than 6
             months prior to enrollment, it does not need to be repeated.

          -  Significant medical conditions including documented HIV infection, active viral
             hepatitis, poorly-controlled hypertension, pulmonary hypertension cardiac arrhythmia
             or congestive heart failure; pulmonary hypertension or ATEs (including stroke or
             myocardial infarction) within the 6 prior months.

          -  Active hematologic or solid organ malignancy, not including non-melanoma skin cancer
             or another carcinoma in situ. Patients with previously resected solid organ
             malignancies or definitively treated hematologic malignancies may be eligible if there
             has been no evidence of active malignancy during the prior 3 years.

          -  Uncontrolled seizure disorder.

          -  Cardiac T2*&lt;10 ms by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or left ventricular ejection
             fraction (LVEF) &lt;45% by echocardiogram or multiple gated acquisition (MUGA) scanning.

          -  Hepatic dysfunction as defined by: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST) &gt;2.5× the upper limit of normal

          -  Renal dysfunction as defined as serum creatinine &gt; upper limit of normal (ULN).
             Patients with creatinine above ULN may be eligible pending documentation of a
             glomerular filtration rate (GFR)≥60 mL/min/1.73m^2 as calculated by the Modification
             of Diet in Renal Disease equation (Stevens 2006), the revised Schwartz formula (for
             patients under 18 years old) (Schwartz 2009), or 24-hour urine collection.

          -  Pulmonary dysfunction as defined by either:

               -  Need for supplemental oxygen during the prior 2 weeks (in absence of acute
                  infection) or

               -  Oxygen saturation (by pulse oximetry) &lt;90%.

          -  Any medical or other contraindication for both leukapheresis and BM harvest procedure
             as determined by the treating Investigator.

          -  Any medical or psychiatric condition that in the opinion of the Investigator renders
             the subject unfit for trial participation or at higher than acceptable risk for
             participation.

          -  Poor functional status, evidenced by Karnofsky Index &lt;70 in adults or Lansky &lt;70 in
             children.

          -  Participation in another clinical trial with an investigational drug within 14 days
             before the informed consent signature. Participation in observational studies is
             allowed.

          -  Pregnant women or women with a positive serum pregnancy test at screening or breast
             feeding or planning to become pregnant within the next 24 months.
