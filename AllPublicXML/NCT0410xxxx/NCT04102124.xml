      The aim of this trial is to evaluate SHR3680 combined with SHR3162 and SHR3680 single drug to
      improve Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients whether the patient's
      overall survival (OS) is superior to placebo.

      This is a multicenter, randomized , double-blind Phase II trial and the aim of this trial is
      to evaluate SHR3680 combined with SHR3162 and SHR3680 single drug to improve Metastatic
      Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients Previously Treated With Abiraterone and
      Docetaxel whether the patient's overall survival (OS) is superior to placebo. The Stage I
      part is a dose-escalation and -expansion study. Approximately 18~24 patients in Stage I will
      receive fixed-dose of orally SHR3680 and only one of two dose levels of orally SHR3162. The
      Primary endpoints of the Stage I are incidence of adverse events(AE) and recommended phase 2
      dose(RP2D). The Stage II part is a randomized , double-blind study. Approximately 90~120
      patients in Stage II will receive SHR3162 combined with SHR3680, in which one fixed-dose
      levels of SHR3162 will be selected based on the result of the Stage I.The Primary endpoint of
      the Stage II is overall survival(OS).

          4. Sustained therapy of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue(LHRHA)or received
             bilateral orchiectomy; patients who did not receive bilateral orchiectomy are willing
             to receive sustained therapy of LHRHA;

          5. Evidence of prostate cancer progression under the sustained therapy of LHRHA or
             bilateral orchiectomy;

          6. Adequate hepatic, renal, heart, and hematological functions;

          7. Patients have given voluntary written informed consent before performance of any
             study-related procedure not part of normal medical care,with the understanding that
             consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future
             medical care.

          8. Patient has been treated with Abiraterone and treatment failed（Treatment failure is
             defined as the progression of disease during treatment）

          9. Patient has been treated with Docetaxel and treatment failed or can not tolerate
             docetaxel chemotherapy or patients who are not suitable for docetaxel treatment at the
             time of screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have received any anti-tumor therapy in the past 4 weeks,including radiotherapy,
             chemotherapy, operation, targeted therapy, immuntherapy, and endocrinotherapy;

          2. Planned to initiate any other anti-tumor therapies during the study;

          4. Clinically significant cardiovascular diseases;

          5. History of seizure or certain conditions that may predispose to seizure;

          6. Severe concurrent disease and infection that, in the judgment of the investigator,
