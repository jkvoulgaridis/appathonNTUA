  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study we want to learn more about the characteristics of neutrophils that
      are present in the blood and secretions from a breathing tube of patients with sepsis. Sepsis
      is a severe type of infection, affecting various parts of the body. Neutrophils are a type of
      white blood cell that are part of the body's immune system. Even though neutrophils are
      important in getting rid of germs, they also may be harmful to parts of the body by causing
      injury in the lungs in patients with sepsis. Neutrophils can change their character in
      sepsis. Because of this, it is important for doctors to know what kind of neutrophils are in
      the blood and secretions from the breathing tube of patients with sepsis so that they can
      work to develop therapies to prevent these cells from being harmful.
