  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac rehabilitation includes aerobic and anaerobic training adapted to cardiovascular
      pathology for which cardiac rehabilitation is prescribed. It is essential to adapt the
      content of these cardiac rehabilitation sessions to optimize aerobic and anaerobic
      performance and quality of life. Improvement of the first ventilatory threshold is one of the
      main objectives since it illustrates the adaptation of the patient to submaximal exercise,
      typical of everyday life.

      The research laboratory &quot;Autonomous Nervous System - Epidemiology, Physiology, Engineering,
      Health&quot; (SPA-EPIS) has an international expertise in training optimization in top-athletes.
      He have shown the importance of the relationship between the power-force-velocity profile and
      athletes performances.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this sudy, each patient has a force and a velocity that can be optimized with training to
      achieve maximum power. This optimization can be evaluated through a force-velocity profile,
      measured from an only sprint on a cycloergometer.

      The hypothesis that force-velocity profile could be used in cardiac rehabilitation in
      coronary patients to induce a force-velocity balance adapted through personalized sessions
      and regular medical follow-up.

      This prospective, controlled, randomized and open label study will attempt to evaluate
      further the relevance of force or velocity training based on the initial force-velocity
      profile of coronary patients included in the cardiac rehabilitation program in the University
      Hospital of Saint-Etienne.
