    <textblock>
      This study will be using Luminex-based peptide assay (LPA) to determine major IgE-binding
      epitope among immediated-reaction of wheat allergic children to differentiate clinical
      phenotype.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Luminex-based peptide assay (LPA) is a novel tool using machine learning techniques,
      developed to predict different degrees of food allergy has been successfully reported among
      cow's milk protein allergy. This technique provide a more precise and advanced adaptation
      from microarray‐based immunoassay (MIA). Using this technique will aid us for the
      differentiation of clinical phenotypes of wheat-allergic patients. This study will be the
      first study to date using this technique aim to determine major IgE-binding epitope among
      immediated-reaction of wheat allergic children to differentiate clinical phenotypes, and may
      lead to further study to develop the new therapeutic approach to wheat-allergic patients.

    <description>For Luminex data, the binding intensity of antibody to epitope specific beads was calculated from the florescence signal of each bead. An index score of binding intensity was generated from the log2 transformation of the signal‐to‐background ratio and each peptide element, which was close to a normal distribution. A plate effect was observed and adjusted for using linear models. Antibody binding intensities (Luminex) from different groups were compared. To assess the changes in epitope‐binding profiles, a linear model was used with group as a factor. Comparisons of interests were tested using t tests and resultant P‐values were adjusted for multiple hypotheses using the Benjamini‐Hochberg approach, which controls the false discovery rate (FDR) across epitopes. Epitopes were defined as differentially binding epitopes (DBE) if the FDR &lt; 0.05 and fold changes (FCH) &gt; 1.5.</description>
