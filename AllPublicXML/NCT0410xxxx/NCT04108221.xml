      Interventional, randomised, prospective, monocentric and single blind study

      Primary objective :

      demonstrate the equivalence of c-TAP Block to us-TAP Block in postoperative analgesia

      Secondary objective :

        -  Assess the effectiveness of c-TAP block on us-TAP Block in the obese and/or malnourished
           patient subgroup

        -  Compare the running time of the c-TAP Block to the us-TAP Block

        -  Assess the safety of the c-TAP Block gesture in terms of trauma to the intraperitoneal
           organs by the injection needle two groups:

        -  Arm A : c-TAP Block performed by the surgeon

        -  Arm B : us-TAP Block performed by the anesthesist under ultrasound control

      Schedule :

        -  Inclusions start at: 16/09/2019

        -  End date of inclusions: 01/09/2020

        -  End date of follow-up: 01/09/2020

    <description>The time will be quantified with a stopwatch. For the c-TAP, the stopwatch will be started as soon as the injection equipment of the locoregional anesthesia is received. For the us-TAP block, the stopwatch will be started after the end of the surgical procedure and as soon as the anesthetist starts to wash his hands to proceed with the injection</description>

    <intervention_name>laparoscopy or laparotomy withTransversusAbdominis Plane Block</intervention_name>
    <description>The US-TAP is performed by the anesthetist under ultrasound control after the end of the procedure of laparoscopy or laparotomy. Under sterile conditions, the anesthetist identifies the oblique abdominal muscles externally, obliquely internally and transversely by ultrasound. A 20 ml needle of 0.5% ropivacaine is injected.
The surgical TAP (c-TAP) block is performed by the surgeon at the end of the procedure of laparoscopy or laparotomy.The needle and the product used are identical to those of the us-TAP block. The positioning of the needle is in the plane of the fascia between the internal oblique muscle and the transverse muscle, identified by a significant loss of resistance.</description>
