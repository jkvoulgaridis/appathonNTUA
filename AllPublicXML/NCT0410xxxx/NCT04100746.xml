      The most common cause of end-stage ankle arthritis is trauma. Post traumatic ankle arthritis
      is accepted as the most common cause of ankle arthritis,with reports ranging from 70% to 80%
      of all ankle arthritis. Factors contributing to the development of posttraumatic ankle
      arthritis are the initial cartilage damage, malreduction ,nonunion, infections, and
      instability. In a retrospective study,found that 55% of patients with posttraumatic ankle
      arthritis presented with a varus malalignment, whereas 8% had valgus malalignment 1.
      Nonoperative treatments, including orthotics, wedges, shoe modifications,anti-inflammatory
      medications, and activity modification,are usually not successful. Although the gold standard
      treatment for ankle arthrosis remains ankle arthrodesis, the significant loss of motion in
      the ankle is limiting and may lead to the development of arthritis in adjacent joints in the
      hind foot and forefoot . Total ankle replacements (TAR) used only in older, low-demand
      patients with neutral alignment and intact stabilizing ligaments. Ankle arthroscopy is
      indicated in acute, recurring-acute, and chronic ankle pain to detect the possible presence
      of anterior ankle impingement (bony or soft tissue), syndesmotic injury, osteochondral
      defects and loose bodies . Supramalleolar osteotomy have been used for varus and valgus as
      well as sagittal and rotational deformities .Fibular osteotomy, Calcaneal slide osteotomy and
      osteotomies of the medial arch can be also used as joint preserving procedure. Our study is
      designed for evaluation of the effect of joint preserving procedures in young patient with
      asymmetrical ankle arthritis.
