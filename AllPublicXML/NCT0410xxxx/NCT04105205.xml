  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human study to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
      escalating single doses of apramycin. This trial will be conducted as a single ascending dose
      trial in up to 5 sequential dose cohorts (group-comparison). Each cohort will consist of 8
      healthy subjects, 6 will receive apramycin and 2 placebo.
