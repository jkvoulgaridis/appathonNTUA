    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the activity and efficacy of pembrolizumab, a checkpoint
      inhibitor, in Veterans with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)
      characterized by either mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) or biallelic inactivation of CDK12
      (CDK12-/-). The secondary objectives involve determining the frequency with which dMMR and
      CDK12-/- occur in this patient population, as well as the effects of pembrolizumab on various
      clinical endpoints (time to PSA progression, maximal PSA response, time to initiation of
      alternative anti-neoplastic therapy, time to radiographic progression, overall survival, and
      safety and tolerability). Lastly, the study will compare the pre-treatment and at-progression
      metastatic tumor biopsies to investigate the molecular correlates of resistance and
      sensitivity to pembrolizumab via RNA-sequencing, exome-sequencing, selected protein analyses,
      and multiplexed immunofluorescence.

      Research Plan:

      This is a single-arm, open-label phase II study that examines the response rate of
      pembrolizumab in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients who have
      either a mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) or a biallelic inactivation of CDK12 (CDK12-/-).
      The study will enroll mCRPC patients who have the selected genetic mutation and at least one
      metastatic lesion that is amendable to biopsy. All patients must have progressed on at least
      one prior line of mCRPC therapy, such as abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide. Eligible
      patients will undergo at least 12 weeks (4 cycles) of pembrolizumab (200 mg IV).

      Methodology:

      Patients with either a mismatch repair deficiency or biallelic inactivation of CDK12 in their
      tumor are eligible for this study. If the patient has progressed on at least one prior
      therapy for mCRPC, including abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide, he is eligible to begin
      genetic screening. Patients with these mutations will be identified primarily through
      standard of care genetic testing with either archival tissue or blood. Specimens will be sent
      to VA approved vendors for genetic testing to determine if the patient has the necessary
      mutations to receive the study drug (pembrolizumab). If eligible, the patient will sign the
      Main Treatment ICF and proceed with the screening procedures. Once enrolled the patient will
      undergo a biopsy of a metastatic lesion (baseline biopsy) to identify molecular correlates.
      If the patient does not have any archival tissue or blood to be used to identify genetic
      mutations, the biopsy of a metastatic lesion will be used to both identify genetic mutations
      and to identify molecular correlates.

      When the patient has met all the eligibility criteria, he will receive pembrolizumab.
      Pembrolizumab will be administered at a starting dose of 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks
      until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. During the treatment, patients will
      either simultaneously receive a GnRH analogue or undergo a bilateral orchiectomy prior to
      treatment to maintain a castrate level of testosterone ( 50 ng/dl). At progression, patients
      will undergo a second biopsy of the same metastatic lesion of the baseline biopsy. The
      baseline (pre-treatment) and at-progression biopsies will be used for correlative analyses to
      determine the efficacy of pembrolizumab.

      Note: after the testing process is complete, Oncoplex will return any remaining sample back
      to the Department of Pathology at the West LA VA Medical Center. These specimens will be
      stored in Dr. Matthew Rettig's biorepository on site for analysis and future research.

      Results:

      Since this is a new study, the results have not yet been obtained. The primary endpoint of
      this study is to measure the objective response rate, radiographic progression free survival
      at 6 months, and decline in PSA of 50% or more 12 weeks of therapy.

      Clinical Significance:

      There are 230,000 new incidences of prostate cancer and 30,000 deaths from prostate cancer
      per year in the US. It is the second most common cause of death in American men. Importantly,
      prostate cancer is diagnosed in more than 12,000 US Veterans each year, representing nearly
      one third of all cancer diagnoses in Veterans.

      Metastatic prostate cancer is incurable, and its treatment is palliative. However, many
      Veterans with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) progress despite
      experiencing some clinical benefit from hormonal therapy and chemotherapy. As a result, novel
      therapies that provide a robust clinical benefit and have a good safety profile are needed
      for these patients.

      Immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitor, for mCRPC patients that have either a mismatch
      repair deficiency (dMMR) or a biallelic inactivation of CDK12 (CDK12-/-) is an attractive
      therapy, especially since therapies involving checkpoint inhibitors have exhibited
      significant improvements in patients with advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer,
      renal cell carcinoma, and many other cancers. The results of this study will establish the
      ideal subset of mCRPC patients who will benefit from the study drug. Importantly, the
      correlative studies will provide critical insight into the mechanisms of primary and acquired
      resistance that occur despite selection of patients with CDK12-/- or dMMR. This result can
      inform further selection of patients for checkpoint inhibition, as well as identify other
      potential therapies that can be co-administered with pembrolizumab to prevent or overcome
      resistance to checkpoint inhibitors.

    <description>This is a single-arm, open-label study of the checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab, in Veterans with mCRPC who have progressed on at least 1 prior novel androgen receptor (AR) signaling inhibitor, inclusive of abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, apalutamide, and darolutamide. In addition to progressive mCRPC, a patient must have a somatic tumor mutation characterized by dMMR or CDK12-/- detected by next generation sequencing (NGS). Patients enrolled in this study will be treated with pembrolizumab at the FDA approved dosage of 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks (21 days) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. During study, patients will maintain a castrate level of testosterone, = 50 ng/dL by ongoing treatment with a GnRH analogue or prior bilateral orchiectomy. Prior to initiating treatment with pembrolizumab, patients will undergo a baseline biopsy of a metastatic lesion. An additional biopsy of a metastatic lesion at the time of progression will be encouraged as well.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must be 18 years of age or older at the time the Informed Consent is signed.

          -  The subject (or legally acceptable representative if applicable) must provide written
             informed consent for the trial.

          -  Pathologic diagnosis of prostate cancer of adenocarcinoma or small cell histology.

          -  Metastatic disease as documented by technetium-99m (99mTc) bone scan or metastatic

             eligibility. NaF PET-CT is an alternative to 99mTc bone scan. If lymph node metastasis
             is the only evidence of metastatic disease, it must be 1.5 cm in short axis and above
             the level of the iliac bifurcation. Imaging studies for the purpose of determining
             eligibility must be completed within 60 days of Day 1.

          -  Progressive castration resistant prostate cancer as defined by serum testosterone &lt; 50
             ng/mL and one of the following:

               -  PSA progression confirmed per Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group
                  (PCWG3),

               -  Radiographic progression of soft tissues according to Response Evaluation
                  Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (iRECIST 1.1) modified based on PCWG3, or
                  radiographic progression of bone according to PCWG3.

          -  Prior use of a novel AR signaling inhibitor for 4 weeks, including abiraterone acetate
             plus prednisone/prednisolone, enzalutamide, apalutamide, and/or darolutamide.

        NOTE: These AR signaling inhibitors may have been used for mCSPC, M0CRPC, and/or mCRPC.

          -  Ongoing surgical or medical castration, with testosterone levels of &lt;50 ng/dL. If the
             subject is being treated with GnRH analogs (subject who has not undergone bilateral
             orchiectomy), this therapy must have been initiated at least 30 weeks prior to
             initiation of pembrolizumab and must be continued throughout the study.

          -  ECOG PS grade of 0-2.

          -  Metastatic lesion that is amenable to biopsy and performed within 180 days of Day 1.

          -  dMMR or CDK12-/- as determined by somatic tumor DNA NGS.

               -  Either monoallelic or biallelic inactivation of CDK12 on NGS is considered
                  sufficient for eligibility purposes.

               -  MMR genes include: MLH1, MSH2, MLH3, PMS1, MSH6, and PMS2.

               -  dMMR is established by MSI-H on NGS. However, for &quot;weak&quot; MMR genes, inclusive of
                  PMS2 and MSH6, monoallelic inactivation will be allowed for eligibility purposes
                  if and only if there is at least MSI-low or hypermutation that is concomitantly
                  present.

               -  If there is biallelic inactivation of &quot;strong&quot; MMR genes (MLH1 and MSH2), then
                  patients must manifest MSI-H. However, if the tumor DNA utilized for MSI analysis
                  was obtained &gt; 6 months prior to NGS, then the NGS should be repeated to
                  determine if MSI-H has developed. Monoallelic inactivation of &quot;strong&quot; MMR genes
                  will be allowed if MSI-H is present; in this scenario, it is presumed that
                  biallelic inactivation is present but the second inactivating event was not
                  detected due to technical issues such as low sensitivity for copy loss.

    <ipd_description>None of the biospecimens will be destroyed. Unused specimens will be used for future research to access clinical data indefinitely. Subjects can request to have all of their specimens destroyed at the end of the study. The research blood and tumor tissue specimens will not be marked with any personal identifiers. As soon as they are collected by a study personnel, the samples will be labeled with a code. The key to the code will remain locked in the research office that is only accessed by study personnel. Only coded specimens will be sent to commercial vendors and VA GLAHS in West LA.
The study investigators will perform research testing on their tissue specimens that is independent of the genetic analysis to be performed at commercial vendor. There are no plans to share the results of other testing performed on their specimens. These results are only for research purposes. However, certain exploratory biomarker test results may be shared with the subject.</ipd_description>
