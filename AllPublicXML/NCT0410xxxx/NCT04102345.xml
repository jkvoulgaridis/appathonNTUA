  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pragmatic, clinical study the investigators propose that lavender aromatherapy is
      comparable to Zolpidem (Ambien) in improving the quality of diagnostic sleep studies.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep efficiency</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of total time in bed actually spent in sleep. It is calculated as sum of Stage N1, Stage N2, Stage N3, and REM sleep, divided by the total time in bed and multiplied by 100. A higher percentage is indicative of more efficient sleep.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>A successful polysomnogram (PSG)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>A binary outcome (yes/no) based on chart review. The outcome will be inferred from documentation in the chart either in notes or PSG report showing a successful split night or if a diagnosis is made or if a repeat PSG is ordered. Yes is a successful PSG.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wake after sleep onset (WASO)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Number of minutes of wakefulness occurring after defined sleep onset. Higher number of minutes indicates a higher WASO or more time awake after onset of sleep.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Total sleep time (TST)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Total amount of sleep time scored during the total recording time; includes time from sleep onset to sleep offset and is distributed throughout the sleep time as minutes of Stage N1 sleep, Stage N2 sleep, Stage N3, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. A longer total sleep time would be a higher number of minutes.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep onset latency</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Time in minutes from 'lights off' that marks the starting of total recording time to the first epoch scored as sleep. This is how long one takes to fall asleep. A higher number of minutes is indicative of a higher sleep onset latency.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep onset latency</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Rapid eye movement latency is the time in minutes from the sleep onset to the first epoch of REM sleep. This is the time one takes to transition from non-REM to REM sleep. A high number of minutes indicates a longer sleep latency.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Stage 3/4 sleep percentage</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Percent of time spent in stage N3 sleep. A higher percentage means that one spends more time in stage N3 sleep than the other stages.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Arousal index</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Total number of arousals x 60/TST (min). A higher arousal index indicates a higher number of arousal during the total sleep time.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>side effects</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Side effects will be inferred from post sleep study questionnaire. Side effects will be described and compiled as a binary outcome (yes/no). This will be used to report the safety profile of the two interventions as an exploratory outcome. Yes means the presence of side effects.</description>

    <description>1-2 drops of Lavender (essential oil) in approximately 120 ml of distilled water is added to a diffuser 10 minutes before light out. The diffuser runs for approximately 2 hours before automatically being shut off. A low mist option is used on the diffuser.</description>
