      This is a prospective single-institution longitudinal study to access quality of life with
      PROMIS testing, ODI, NDI, VAS and short form 36 health physical component score. The study
      will also include serial radiographic assessments and biodynamic force plate and hand
      dynamometer testing. This study will follow for five years post-consent.
