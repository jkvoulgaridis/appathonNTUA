  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the drug spironolactone - which is used to treat
      acne and male pattern hair growth in women - is effective in treating hidradenitis
      suppurativa in females and which dose of the drug works the best. Participation in this study
      will take about 4 clinic visits over approximately 7 months with the option to continue for
      longer if desired.

    <description>The proportion of patients achieving a clinical response - defined as at least a 2-grade improvement in Hidradenitis Suppurativa Physician's Global Assessment (HS-PGA) score relative to baseline at 6 months. HS-PGA is an anchored 6-stage HS-specific physician global assessment scale that was defined for use in a phase-II clinical trial. It is based on the number and type of nodules, abscesses, and fistulas.</description>

Patients will be instructed to continue any current treatment regimen for hidradenitis suppurativa that was initiated at least 4 weeks prior to their enrollment in the study.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Individuals will be screened for eligibility by a screening visit conducted by named
        investigators.

        Inclusion Criteria To be eligible for the study: (All answers must be &quot;YES&quot; for subject to
        be eligible.)

          1. Subject must have clinically diagnosed hidradenitis suppurativa, with an inadequate
             response to other treatment modalities, including but not limited to local or systemic
             antibiotics, immunosuppressive agents, retinoids, biologic therapies, surgical
             management.

          2. Subject disease severity must be classified as 'mild' or more severe on the HS-PGA
             Scale at screening exam, because subjects classified as 'clear' or 'minimal' on the
             scale will be unable to achieve the prespecified treatment response.

          3. Subject must be a female.

          4. Subject must be 18-70 years of age.

          5. Women of child-bearing potential must be on effective contraception. Acceptable
             methods of contraception include oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), hormonal or copper
             IUDs, contraceptive implants, contraceptive injections, birth control patches, vaginal
             rings, condom, sponge, diaphragm with spermicide, or prior surgical sterilization.

          6. Subject must provide written informed consent prior to any study-related procedures
             being performed.

          7. Subject must be willing to comply with all clinical study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria The presence of the following excludes subjects from the study: (All
        answers must be &quot;NO&quot; for subject to be eligible.)

          1. Subject has previously received spironolactone or another antiandrogenic treatment for
             hidradenitis suppurativa.

          2. The subject is a pregnant or nursing female.

          3. Subject is hyperkalemic, defined by a potassium level of greater than 5.1 mEq/liter.

          4. Subjects with Addison's disease.

          5. Subjects taking eplerenone or other potassium-sparing diuretics, lithium,
             cholestyramine, ACE inhibitors/angiotensin II antagonists/aldosterone blockers, or
             NSAIDS.

          6. Subjects receiving potassium supplementation.

          7. Subjects with history of renal disease or an eFGR &lt; 30.

          8. Subjects with acute or chronic liver failure.

          9. Subject has an acute psychiatric condition that impairs ability to give consent or
             follow study protocols.

               -  All races and ethnicities will be considered for inclusion in the study.

               -  Males will be excluded from this study due to the high incidence of gynecomastia
                  and sexual dysfunction seen in spironolactone use at higher doses in men. It is
                  not routinely used to treat dermatologic conditions in men due to its poor
                  tolerability.

               -  Subjects under the age of 18 will not be considered for inclusion in this study.
                  The disease most often manifests during the second and third decades of life,
                  therefore the disorder is far less prevalent in children and adolescents.2
