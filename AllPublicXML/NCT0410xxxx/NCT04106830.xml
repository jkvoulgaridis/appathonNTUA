      CLUE is an prospective study to determine structural and functional changes of brain and
      spinal cord, as well as the inflammatory environment in patients with neuroinflammatory and
      demyelination disease. Subjects will receive new magnetic resonance (MR) technics including
      double inversion recovery (DIR) imaging diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), quantitative
      susceptibility mapping (QSM) and resting-state functional imaging and follow up for one year.

    <textblock>
      The study is an observational study of multi model imaging to determine structural and
      functional changes of brain and spinal cord, as well as the inflammatory environment in
      patients with neuroinflammatory and demyelination disease. Brain and spinal cord involvement
      are common in neuroinflammatory and demyelination disease including clinical isolated
      syndrome (CIS), multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSDs).
      The pathophysiology in neuroinflammatory disease involves the intensive autoimmune
      inflammatory response, resulting in demyelination and neuroaxonal injury and loss. Some
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers have been reported to indicate the pathology and reflect
      disease activity especially during acute stage. But they couldn't directly reflect the
      macroscopic and microscopic neuroaxonal change in brain and spinal cord, which seem to be
      important determinants of long-term severe disability in chronic neuroinflammatory disease.

      Finally, new MRI techniques are the most reliable and non-invasive method to assess the
      structure and function of brain and spinal cord, plus to monitor disease activity in clinical
      practice. Double inversion recovery (DIR) imaging allows better detection of cortical and
      white matter lesion, which has highlighted the role in MS. Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI)
      which has been proposed to characterize the deviation of water diffusion in neural tissues
      from Gaussian diffusion, is promising to provide information of demyelination and subsequent
      inflammatory processes in brain or spinal cord. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) has
      enabled MRI of tissue magnetic susceptibility to advance from simple qualitative detection of
      hypointense blooming artifacts to precise quantitative measurement of spatial
      biodistributions. QSM better depicts spatial susceptibility patterns in MS lesions compared
      to phase-based imaging [14]. Besides, resting-state functional imaging has the potential to
      map the intrinsic functional brain networks and to detect early functional brain changes in
      neuroinflammatory disease.

      This study will be a prospective cohort study of patients with neuroinflammatory and
      demyelination disease. Subjects will undertake MR scans at acute stage, and required
      follow-up visits after 1 moth, 6 months and one year. The MR scans is necessary at each
      visit.

      This study does not limit treatment methods. Patients commonly use high-dose intravenous
      steroid therapy (HD-S) during acute stage. The HD-S treatment course referred to intravenous
      administration of 1 g of glucocorticoid daily for 3 consecutive days and continuous dose 240
      mg reduction for 60mg oral administration. Immunomodulatory therapies are necessary for the
      remission stage. The treatment methods include: Azathioprine (start at 50 mg per day, add 50
      mg per week to 2 mg/kg*d); Mycophenolate Mofetil (The initial dose was 0.25g bid, add 0.5g
      per week to 0.75g bid); and Rituximab (500 mg on the 1st day, the 15th day, the 30th day and
      the 180th day, then 500mg per year).

    <description>admission to the hospital on day 1, on discharge 180 days later and on follow up 360 days later.] The Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was developed to measure the disability status of subjects with multiple sclerosis. It allows an objective quantification of the level of functioning that could be widely and reproducibly used by researchers and health care providers. The EDSS provides a total score on a scale that ranges from 0 to 10. The first levels 1.0 to 4.5 refer to people with a high degree of ambulatory ability and the subsequent levels 5.0 to 9.5 refer to the loss of ambulatory ability. The range of main categories include (0) = normal neurologic exam; to (5) = ambulatory without aid or rest for 200 meters; disability severe enough to impair full daily activities; to (10) = death due to Multiple sclerosis (MS). In addition, it also provides eight subscale measurements called Functional System (FS) scores.</description>

    <description>Timed 25-foot walking trials will be assessed on admission to the hospital on day 1, on discharge 180 days later and on follow up 360 days later. The Timed 25-Foot Walk test is a quantitative measure of lower extremity function. If required, the subject may use an appropriate assistive device to walk as quickly as he/she can from one end to the other end of a clearly marked, unobstructed, 25-foot course. Timing will begin when any part of the subject's foot crosses the tape. Timing will end when any part of the subject's foot crosses the finish line (identified by a taped mark on the floor). Time will be recorded in seconds. The task is immediately administered again (a maximum five-minute rest period is allowed between trials) by having the subject walk back the same distance. The average of the two values will be recorded.</description>

    <description>admission to the hospital on day 1, on discharge 180 days later and on follow up 360 days later.] Low Contrast Visual Acuity: Low-contrast Sloan letter charts are readily available and provide a practical, quantitative, and standardized assessment of visual function. Each chart consists of rows of black letters (decreasing in size from top to bottom) on a white background.
For this trial, 2.5% low contrast visual acuity will be measured on days 1 and 5 during the steroid phase and completion after the plasma exchange phase. Charts will be read at a 2.5-meter distance by trained examiners in the hospital room with constant lighting.</description>
