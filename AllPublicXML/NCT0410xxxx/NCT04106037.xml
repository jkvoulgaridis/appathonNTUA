  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Legionnaire's disease (LD) is a major cause of both community acquired and nosocomial
      pneumonia, with Legionella pneumophila serogroup A (Lp1) being the most virulent and the
      greatest cause of disease. Sample culture of low respiratory tract is considered the gold
      standard in the diagnosis of LD, however its sensitivity seems to be poor and its performance
      is technically demanding. The introduction of urinary antigen detection testing (LUA) brought
      a major advance in LD diagnosis, with upt to 95% of cases in Europe being diagnosed with this
      method. Despite the high sensitivity of LUA for Lp1, ranging from 80-90%, its negative
      predictive value is low in other serogroup than Lp1 and therefore, Legionella may be
      unrecognized as agent of pneumonia. Although underdiagnosed and underreported, LD represents
      the second most common cause of pneumonia requiring admission in intensive care unit (ICU).
      Average fatality rate of LD in Europe reaches 10%, but its mortality is considered to be even
      higher in nosocomial patients.

      Despite the higher fatality rate in hospitalized LD patients, poor is the knowledge on the
      risk factors that could induce disease and that increase mortality in the hospitalized
      population affected by LD. In order to shed more light on this topic a cohort of patients
      diagnosed with LD in the last 3 years will be retrospectively examined.

        All confirmed human cases of Legionnaires' disease diagnosed within the CHU Brugmann
        hospital, the St Pierre Hospital and the UZ Brussel Hospital. The definition of
        Legionnaires' disease diagnosis is met whether a seroconversion is detected or positive
        respiratory samples cultures are objectivized or positive LUA are observed. Seroconversion
        is defined as a rising of Legionella antibodies, dilution superior to 1/128 by indirect
        immunofluorescence. Nosocomial cases of Legionnaires' disease are defined in this study as
        the ones having an onset of symptoms more than 10 days after hospitalization.
