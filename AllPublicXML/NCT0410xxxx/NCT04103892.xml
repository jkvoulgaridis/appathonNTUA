  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical trial is a Phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled study in Major
      Depressive Disorder (MDD) participants currently treated with antidepressant therapy. The
      objective of the study is to assess CLE-100 for the treatment of MDD in participants
      currently treated with standard antidepressant therapy.

    <textblock>
      CLEO study is performed in two parts (part A and Part B). The sponsor is currently recruiting
      only for the Part A of the study.

      Part A will be an inpatient study to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of
      CLE-100 in MDD participants currently treated with an antidepressant drug. It will include a
      screening phase (up to 35 days), a 1 week inpatient double-blind treatment phase and an
      outpatient post treatment safety follow-up phase of 1 week after last study drug
      administration. The participants will remain on their current antidepressant therapy with no
      dose change during the study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Administered Karolinska Sleepiness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Karolinska Sleepiness Scale is a single-item, subjective, self-reported instrument measuring sleepiness on a 9-point Likert scale (1 to 9), where a higher value represents a worse outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (MOAA/S)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The MOAA/S will be used to measure treatment-emergent sedation. The MOAA/S is a widely used clinician-administered measure of alertness/sedation for clinical trials. The MOAA/S measures the alertness/sedation spectrum on a 6-point scale (0 to 5) based on verbal cues, where a higher value represents a better outcome.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinician-Administered Dissociative Symptoms Scale (CADSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The CADSS will be administered to assess treatment-emergent dissociative symptoms. The CADSS is a 23-item instrument that is clinician-administered. Each item is scored on a 5-point scale (0 to 4. A higher value represents a worse outcome. The CADSS total score ranges between 0 and 92.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The C-SSRS will be performed to assess suicidal ideation and behavior. The C-SSRS is an instrument used to assess suicide risk by measuring symptoms of suicidal ideation, self-harm, and suicidal behavior that is administered by trained personnel. The suicidal ideation is evaluated with a &quot;yes/no&quot; questionnaire and the suicidal behavior severity is scored on a 6-point scale (0 to 5) where a higher value represents a more severe behavior.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Four-items positive subscale from the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Four items of the BPRS will be administered to assess treatment-emergent psychotic symptoms. The BPRS is a widely used, clinician-administered instrument that involves 4 subscales: Negative Symptoms, Positive Symptoms, Manic-Hostility, and Anxiety/Depression. The 4-item Positive Symptoms subscale of the BPRS will be used to screen for potential psychiatric symptoms (suspiciousness, hallucinations, unusual thought content, and conceptual disorganization). Each item is scored on a 7-point scale (1 to 7). where a higher value represents a worse outcome. The 4 items BPRS total score ranges between 4 and 28.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>20-item Physician Withdrawal Checklist (PWC-20)</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The PWC-20 is a clinician-administered assessment to evaluate potential withdrawal symptoms following cessation of the double-blind treatment. The PWC-20 is a shortened version of the original 35-item instrument used to determine withdraw symptoms in subjects following discontinuation of anxiolytics. The items are evaluated on a 4-point scale (0 to 3) where a higher value represents a worse outcome. The total score ranges between 0 to 60.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive function evaluated by Cogstate battery</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Cogstate battery of cognitive tests will be used to measure psychomotor function, attention, visual learning, and working memory. The Cogstate battery will include the following tests: Detection Test, Identification Test, One Back Test, Groton Maze Test.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The DSST is a psychometric test assessing the integrity of executive function, processing speed, attention, spatial perception, and visual scanning, which are functions required for driving, and will be performed repeatedly. The DSST is a valid and sensitive instrument to evaluate cognitive dysfunction and changes in cognitive function. The DSST is a timed test taken by the subject and scored based on both the number of correct answers and the speed at which they were determined. The score ranges between 0 to 135.</description>
