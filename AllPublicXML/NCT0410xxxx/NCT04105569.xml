  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pilot case series with a split-mouth design to track subjects with known exposure (dental
      biofilm accumulation) over 21 days. Descriptive design, using single cell RNA sequencing as a
      &quot;digital biopsy&quot; to catalog and contrast inflamed versus non-inflamed tissues from within the
      same mouth and across patients. Specimens (human) will biobanked from the 'digital biopsy'
      site for future analysis, including: Gingival crevicular fluid, oral epithelial
      stem/progenitor cells, and plaque samples, for 'omics analyses including metabolomics,
      microbiomic, and genomic data.

      Purpose is to conduct the first study of human gingiva in health and after biofilm-induced
      inflammation in the gingiva using scRNAseq. The pilot will involve induction of experimental
      gingivitis in all participants.

      Participants include recruitment of 6 participants. Following consenting, screening, and
      enrollment, a customized acrylic stent will be used only on the selected sextant/teeth
      specified in the protocol, and only during tooth brushing to prevent oral hygiene in selected
      sextant/teeth. After the completion of the 3-week gingivitis induction phase, participants
      will enter a 2 week resolution phase. In the resolution phase, participants will reinstate
      full mouth oral hygiene, with the exception of flossing. Oral prophylaxis will be performed
      to regain health. During the 3 week gingivitis induction phase, participants will be required
      to return to the clinic every 7 days for safety checks.

      Study Procedures (methods): Medical history, demographics (height/weight), urine based
      pregnancy test, vital signs (to include blood pressures, and pulse), standard dental clinical
      measures (to include plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing, and clinical
      attachment level), alginate impressions taken for fabrication of an acrylic stent (mouth
      guard), 2 gingival biopsies, 4 subgingival (below the gum line) plaque samples, 4 Gingival
      Crevicular Fluid (naturally occurring fluid between the gum and teeth) samples, and adult
      prophylaxis

    <ipd_description>Single-cell RNA sequencing data will be shared through the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), a public functional genomics data repository supporting MIAME-compliant data submissions, which accepts sequence-based data. Gene list data will be searchable, cell by cell, through an online database. The files will be deposited both as raw reads (.fastq) and differential gene expression (.txt and .xlsx). Once data have been cleaned, assessed for differential gene expression, and validated by FISH/IHC, data will be made public. This will allow us to make this data freely available for others to investigate and reanalyze for their own purposes to accelerate further discoveries.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_time_frame>Gene expression data will be available for download once the manuscript has been accepted for publication.</ipd_time_frame>
