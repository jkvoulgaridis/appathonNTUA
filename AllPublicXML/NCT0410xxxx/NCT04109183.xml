    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial was to evaluate the safety and preliminary evaluation of
      Azvudine tablets (FNC) in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors therapy in
      treatment-naive patients with HIV infection.; the secondary objective is to explore the
      effective dose of clinical use of Azvudine (FNC) tablets .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Azvudine (FNC), a new class I drug with independent intellectual property rights, is a novel
      nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor with good inhibitory activity against HIV-1 and
      obtained the National Medical Products Administration(NMPA) approved for clinical research.

      In this trial, 172 patients who had not received anti-HIV treatment were enrolled, including
      FNC4mg group, FNC3mg group, FNC2mg group, and 3TC control group, 43 cases, 5 research
      centers, and each research center was simultaneously engaged and competing. The enrolled
      subjects underwent 7 visits including baseline visits, and HIV -1RNA and CD4 cell counts were
      tested and statistically analyzed for each visit.
