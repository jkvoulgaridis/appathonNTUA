  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemay005 is a novel phosphodiesterase type 4(PDE4) inhibitor being developed for the
      treatment of psoriasis.After single asending dose and mutiple asending dose in health
      subjects. And the patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis will be randomized into 4
      cohorts(15mg, 30mg, 60mg and placebo) approximately 216 subjects will be enrolled (52 for
      each cohort ). This study includes an 16-week treatment Period, then a 36-week Treatment
      Period without placebo.

    <description>The static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) rated the investigator's overall clinical assessment of a participants plaque thickness, erythema, and scaling on a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (clear, except for residual discoloration) to 5 (majority of plaques have severe thickness, erythema, and scale). To assign a sPGA score, the investigator examined all psoriatic lesions and assigned a severity score ranging from 0 to 5 for thickness, erythema, and scaling. Scores for thickness, erythema, and scaling are summed and the mean of these 3 scores equals the overall sPGA score. Decreases in sPGA correspond to clinical improvement.</description>
