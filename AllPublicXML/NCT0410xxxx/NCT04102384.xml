  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to assess the usability and satisfaction of an electronic patient
      reported outcomes (e-PRO) mobile application. The secondary aim is to assess and compare
      response rates between two study groups (e-PRO group vs REDCap survey group). A potential
      differentiating factor between delivering surveys via smart phone and other electronic modes
      of delivery is the perceived advantage of being able to conveniently complete survey
      questionnaires at any time and any location. This could help address certain limitations of
      the quantitative survey method such as recall bias. Furthermore, the portability,
      connectivity and ubiquity of smartphones may reduce the amount of training or instructions
      required for users to complete a survey questionnaire on a smartphone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are vital to understanding the impact of a medical condition
      and treatment from the participant's perspective. However, the collection of data can be
      inconsistent in both administration and completion due to the method of delivery. Thus,
      careful consideration of the data collection mode is needed to ensure the quality of the
      data. The method of delivery has been shown to have a direct effect on the survey response
      rates thereby ensuring the validity of the data analyses and results. Previous studies have
      demonstrated an increase in Web-based survey response rates as compared to paper-based survey
      response rates. Novel methods of collecting PROs may help to streamline both the process and
      collection of PROs during clinical trials.

      A potential differentiating factor between delivering surveys via smart phone and other
      electronic modes of delivery is the perceived advantage of being able to conveniently
      complete survey questionnaires at any time and any location. This could help address certain
      limitations of the quantitative survey method such as recall bias. Furthermore, the
      portability, connectivity and ubiquity of smartphones may reduce the amount of training or
      instructions required for users to complete a survey questionnaire on a smartphone. For
      researchers, this type of survey delivery method may offer the benefits of a wider target
      audience and reduce research implementation costs. The e-PRO app is designed to further
      facilitate the delivery of PRO instruments in a convenient manner to participants. Through
      its computing capability, and user-friendly interface, the e-PRO app can collect data and
      implement complex scoring requirements, thus supporting the delivery of self-administered
      survey questionnaires. The goal of this two-arm randomized controlled pilot is to explore the
      usability and satisfaction with a novel e-PRO app.

    <description>A survey will be administered to compare groups on their experiences with the survey-method administration (Investigator developed survey). The following components will be taken into account: acceptability-- participant satisfaction with various aspects of the solution (e.g. content, complexity, comfort, delivery, and credibility). Adoption-- participants' intention to try; perceived barriers and facilitators for uptake. Appropriateness-- participant's perceived relevance to need; suitability to daily patient workflow. Feasibility-- suitability for using daily, weekly etc. This survey is not a scored survey.</description>

    <measure>Survey response rate e-PRO vs emailed link</measure>
    <time_frame>At close-out</time_frame>
    <description>Response rate will be tracked on a weekly basis from the e-PRO system and the REDCap embedded email link to compare response rate between the control and intervention group. The AAOPR (2006) recommendation for RR formula will be used to calculate the RR. This is the number of completed surveys (completed and partially completed) divided by the number of completed surveys (completed and partially completed) plus the number of all non-completed surveys (sent to a potential participant but not completed because of incorrect e-mail address, incorrect mailing address, or other reasons).</description>
