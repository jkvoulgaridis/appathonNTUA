  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the indwelling urinary catheterization (IUC), urinary leakage may develop around the
      catheter in the following days of catheterization. The volume and type of fluid used to
      inflate the catheter balloon has the potential to be a factor in the development of this
      problem.

      In this study, the investigators aimed to investigate the effect of the type and amount of
      fluid used in inflating the silicone foley catheter balloon on the development of urinary
      leakage around the catheter. In addition to purpose, the following questions were answered to
      determine the optimal solution type and volume in inflating the balloon:

        -  What was the incidence of urinary leakage in IUC?

        -  Was there a relationship between catheterization time and urine leakage?

        -  Was there a relationship between the type of fluid used to inflate the foley catheter
           balloon and urine leakage?

        -  Was there a relationship between the amount of fluid used to inflate the foley catheter
           balloon and urine leakage?

    <description>Patients were followed up every 12 hours for the presence of urine leakage around the catheter. The presence of urine leakage was monitored by macroscopic examination, wetting of the diaper, and pH meter strip wrapped around the catheter. In addition, urine samples of the urine leakage were collected, and urine pH and leakage pH were compared.
Participation of the patients in the study groups was continued until one or more of the following criteria met:
Urinary leakage around the catheter, Termination of catheterization, Transferring the patient to another unit, Development of Exitus.</description>
