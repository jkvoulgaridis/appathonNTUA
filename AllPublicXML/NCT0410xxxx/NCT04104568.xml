  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Informal caregivers of people with dementia are at greater risk of developing physical and
      mental health problems when compared to the general population and to informal caregivers of
      people with other chronic diseases. Internet-based interventions have been explored in its
      potential to minimize the negative effects of caring, accounting for their ubiquitous nature,
      convenient delivery, potential scalability and presumed (cost)effectiveness. iSupport is a
      self-help online program developed by the World Health Organization to provide education,
      skills training and support to informal caregivers of people with dementia. This intervention
      study aims to determine the effectiveness of a Portuguese culturally adapted version of
      iSupport to decrease caregiver burden, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and to improve
      quality of life, positive aspects of caregiving and general self-efficacy. The study has two
      arms: access to &quot;iSupport&quot; for three months or access to an education-only e-book. iSupport
      is grounded in problem-solving and cognitive behavioral therapy techniques and it consists of
      23 lessons organized around 5 modules: 'Introduction to dementia'; 'Being a carer', 'Caring
      for me', 'Providing everyday care', and 'Dealing with behaviour changes'.

      One hundred and eighty four participants will be recruited by referral from national
      Alzheimer's associations. Participants will be included if they match the following criteria:
      being 18 years or older and provide e-consent; being a self-reported non-paid caregiver for
      at least 6 months; caring for a person with a formal diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease; being
      skilled to use internet; and experience a clinically relevant level of burden or depression
      or anxiety symptoms. Data is collected online, resorting to self-administered instruments, at
      baseline, 3 and 6 months after baseline. A two-sided alternative hypothesis was assumed for
      this study: Mean caregiver burden at 3 months after baseline is different in informal
      caregivers of people with dementia assigned to the iSupport program as in those assigned to a
      minimal education-only intervention. Findings from this intervention study will offer
      evidence to support an informed decision making on scaling up iSupport as a new intervention
      program with minimal costs aimed at minimizing the psychological distress of informal
      caregivers of people with dementia in Portugal and elsewhere.

    <measure>Change from baseline in subjective burden using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver burden measured with the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), Portuguese validated version, total score. The instrument comprises 22 items answered on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always) except for the final question on global burden, rated from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Total score for the ZBI ranges from 0 to 88 points, with higher scores indicating greater burden. The ZBI has good internal consistency (0.89), test-retest and interrater reliability as well as construct and concurrent validity, including reports of positive correlation with depression symptoms and time devoted to care provision. Regarding the psychometric properties of ZBI in Portugal, face, content, ecological, discriminant and convergent validity were documented, along with test-retest reliability (ICC= 0.93, CI95% 0.88 - 0.96, p &lt; 0.001) and internal consistency (α = 0.88). The ZBI is one of the most used instruments to measure burden in intervention studies with caregivers.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Symptoms of depression and anxiety measured through the Portuguese version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), total scores. The instrument comprises two subscales with 7 items each, using a 4-point scale. Total scores for each scale range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating more severe anxiety or depression symptoms.</description>

    <description>Access, for 3 months, to an online self-help training and support program: iSupport for dementia - European-Portuguese version. The e-program offers information, skills training and support for informal caregivers of people with dementia. It comprises five modules, including twenty-three lessons on dementia and caregiver support. In line with good practices on digital engagement, the education plan can be personalized by the caregiver. This means that it can be adjusted to the person's availability and lessons can be selected according to particular needs. Each lesson includes interactive exercises with immediate feedback; and positive messages as well as 'skills certificates' are displayed when lessons are completed. Framed as a multi-component intervention, iSupport is grounded in problem-solving and cognitive behavioral therapy techniques including psycho-education, behavioral activation, cognitive reframing, relaxation and antecedent-behavior-consequence (ABC) analysis.</description>
