  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of BI
      1323495 in healthy subjects following bid oral administration of multiple rising doses, each
      over an 11 day treatment period.

      Secondary objectives are the exploration of the pharmacokinetics (PK) including dose
      proportionality (only for Part 1) as well as attainment of steady state. This includes
      exploration of a therapeutic exposure range, a range not adequately achieved in the
      single-rising dose trial 1405-0001.
