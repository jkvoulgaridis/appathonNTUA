    <textblock>
      In this study, 30 patient and caregiver dyads will be randomized to receive the
      SPIRIT-dementia intervention or usual care. Participants will be follow-up with 2-3 days
      after the intervention to evaluate the impact of SPIRIT on preparedness outcomes. Additional
      follow up with caregivers will occur 6 months later.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment or dementia, usually vascular dementia or Alzheimer's, co-occur in
      approximately 38% of patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD). When dementia is
      superimposed on ESRD, the risk for poor outcomes, including disability, hospitalization and
      death, sharply increases. Similarly, initiating dialysis in older adults with multiple
      comorbidities, including dementia, does not offer survival benefit. However, advance care
      planning (ACP) discussions with dialysis patients rarely occur. The reality of ESRD plus
      dementia is that most of these patients are likely to die or progress to advanced dementia
      without ever engaging in ACP discussions before the cognitive window of opportunity closes.
      Moreover, persons with dementia (regardless of their cognitive impairment level) are
      routinely excluded from clinical trials of ACP, largely because investigators assume that
      these people do not have the cognitive capability to appreciate the complexity of ACP. In an
      on-going study (&quot;SPIRIT in Dementia&quot;) the researchers carefully adapted SPIRIT for persons
      with mild to moderate dementia (mostly due to Alzheimer's) and their surrogates. In a sample
      of 23 dementia patients without complex multimorbidity and their surrogates, the researchers
      were able to conclude that meaningful ACP conversations were possible even for individuals
      with moderate dementia. Based on these findings, this supplement study will leverage the
      infrastructure of the parent SPIRIT in ESRD trial to pilot test the adapted SPIRIT
      intervention for patients with ESRD plus dementia as a model for determining whether patients
      with dementia superimposed on complex multimorbidity can fully participate in ACP discussion.

      This purpose of this pilot randomized controlled trial with 30 patient and caregiver dyads is
      to:

        -  estimate the effects of the SPIRIT-dementia intervention on: (a) preparedness outcomes
           for end-of-life decision making (defined as dyad congruence on goals of care, patient
           decisional conflict, and surrogate decision-making confidence) 2-3 days
           post-intervention, and (b) care decisions (withdrawal from dialysis, Do-Not-Resuscitate
           order, hospice enrollment) assessed at 6 months post-intervention, or the patient's
           death, whichever occurs first,

        -  estimate the effects of the SPIRIT-dementia intervention on surrogates' post-bereavement
           distress (anxiety and depression symptoms) at 1 month after the patient's death, and

        -  explore the relationships among patients' cognitive status, decision-making capacity and
           their ability to express end-of-life wishes.

    <measure>Change in Dyad Congruence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 Days Post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Dyad congruence will be assessed using the Goals-of-Care Tool which includes two scenarios describing medical conditions commonly occurring in ESRD patients. Possible responses to the scenarios are: &quot;The goals of care should focus on delaying my death, and thus I want to continue life-sustaining treatment&quot;, &quot;The goals of care should focus on my comfort and peace, and thus I do not want life-sustaining treatment, including dialysis&quot;, and &quot;I am not sure&quot;. Patients and surrogates complete this tool independently and their responses are then compared to determine dyad congruence.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient's Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 Days Post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Patient decisional conflict will be measured using the 13-item Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS), a validated measure in the context of end-of-life decision making. Participants indicate their level of agreement with statements about their plans for their future medical care by selecting (1) Strongly Agree, (2) Agree, (3) Neither Agree nor Disagree, (4) Disagree, or (5) Strongly Disagree. The total score ranges from 13 - 65 with higher scores indicating greater difficulty in weighing benefits and burdens of life-sustaining treatments and decision making.</description>

    <measure>Change in Surrogate's Decision Making Confidence (DMC) scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 Days Post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Surrogate decision-making confidence will be measured using the 5-item Decision Making Confidence (DMC) scale. Surrogates indicate how confident they are about making medical decisions if the patient becomes unable to make their own decisions by their level of agreement with statements along a scale of (0) &quot;Not confident at all&quot; to (5) &quot;Very confident&quot;. Total scores range from 0 - 20, with higher scores indicating greater confidence.</description>

    <measure>Change in Surrogate's Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 Month after the Patient's Death</time_frame>
    <description>Surrogate post-bereavement anxiety and depressive symptoms will be measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Surrogates indicate their level of agreement with statements by selecting responses rated from 0 (the problem in the statement is not an issue) to 3 (the problem in the statement is a very big issue). The separate anxiety and depression subscale scores range from 0 to 21 with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity. A score of 0-7 indicates &quot;normal&quot;, 8-10 indicates &quot;borderline abnormal&quot;, and 11-21 indicates &quot;abnormal&quot; levels of anxiety or depression.</description>

    <description>The interventionist will begin the SPIRIT-dementia session by assessing the patient's and surrogate's cognitive, emotional, and spiritual/religious representations of the patient's illness, prognosis, and end-of-life care. Individualized information will be provided about the effectiveness of life-sustaining treatment for people with end-organ failure, and the patient will examine their values about life-sustaining treatment at the end of life. The interventionist will help the surrogate prepare for end-of-life decision-making and for the emotional burden of decision-making. A Goals-of-Care document will be completed at the end of the session. The delivery of SPIRIT-dementia incorporates &quot;enhanced consent techniques,&quot; such as reducing information load by proceeding in manageable segments, offering repetition of material, opportunity for rehearsal, and using targeted questioning to verify adequate comprehension prior to eliciting preferences for goals of care.</description>
