      This study aims to obtain preliminary data for utility of alternate biomarkers for monitoring
      glucose control in diabetic women during pregnancy and/or predicting risk of adverse neonatal
      events in these women. Our population is unique compared to published studies and contains
      significant numbers of African American women and overweight or obese women. Two of these
      markers have been examined in several other populations of pregnant women and have shown
      utility for both outcomes. However, the recommended levels of these markers need to be
      determined in specific populations as ethnicity and BMI affect the values. Values obtained in
      recruited women will be compared with biobanked samples from women who have no evidence or
      history of diabetes. Additionally, two other potentially promising markers will be examined
      (beta-hydroxybutyrate and triglycerides). Both these analytes change during pregnancy and
      beta-hydroxybutyrate has shown correlation with large for gestational status or macrosomia in
      some studies. A combination of markers may be a better predictor of adverse neonatal outcomes
      than a single marker.

        Our study population includes a large percentage of African Americans as well as a
        significant percentage of women with BMI â‰¥30. All women enrolled in the study will be
        pregnant and have been diagnosed with diabetes.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All women included in the study will either have diabetes diagnosed before pregnancy
             or will have been diagnosed during pregnancy (GDM). We do not exclude minors, since in
             Missouri, they may consent to medical treatment without parental consent for medical
             issues relating to pregnancy,

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No specific exclusion criteria will be used. BMI data will be collected and utilized
             to sort patients into various subgroups, but will not be used as exclusion criteria.
