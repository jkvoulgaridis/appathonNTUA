  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to correlate the effect of ischemic mitral regurgitation on the
      outcome of STEMI patients treated with successful primary PCI using clinical data and
      echocardiography on presentation and during short term follow up after 3 months

      -  IMR is defined as mitral regurgitation (MR) caused by chronic changes of LV structure
           and function due to ischemic heart disease. It is not a valve disease but represents the
           valvular consequences of increased tethering forces and reduced closing forces. It is
           reported in approximately one-fifth of patients following acute myocardial infarction
           (MI) and one-half of those with congestive heart failure. IMR is a frequent complication
           of coronary artery disease and it worsens the prognosis.

        -  It is important to distinguish between primary MR due to organic disease of one or more
           components of the mitral valve apparatus and secondary MR which is not a valve disease,
           but represents LV disease. Secondary MR is defined as functional MR, due to LV
           remodeling by cardiomyopathy or coronary artery disease. In the latter clinical setting,
           secondary functional MR is called IMR. There are some limitations in this definition of
           functional IMR. Recent studies have revealed evidence of structural changes in the
           mitral leaflets in response to tethering on them by LV pathological remodeling. The
           leaflet adaptation includes enlargement and increased stiffness.

        -  Aim of the work :

      To correlate the effect of ischemic mitral regurgitation on the outcome of STEMI patients
      treated with successful primary PCI using clinical data and echocardiography on presentation
      and during short term follow up after 3 months
