  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multicenter,dose-escalating phase I study was designed to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of MIL62 in Chinese patients with
      relapsed/refractory CD20-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma(NHL) for whom no treatment of
      higher priority was available.
