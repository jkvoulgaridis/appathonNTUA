  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in intensive care unit (ICU) patients and is associated
      with longer hospital stays and worse survival. The mortality rate of critically ill patients
      in the ICU who receive renal replacement therapy for AKI ranges between 50-80%,
      cardiovascular disease being the second largest cause of death. A previous pilot study from
      the investigator's group showed that myocardial stunning occurs in AKI patients during
      continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and may explain the high cardiovascular mortality
      in this population. In the chronic intermittent dialysis setting, mild dialysate cooling was
      shown to improve intradialytic hemodynamic stability and prevent myocardial stunning. The aim
      of this study is to find out whether cooling the blood in the CRRT circuit is an effective
      intervention to prevent myocardial stunning in AKI patients undergoing CRRT and improve
      patient outcomes.

      Patients will be recruited from the in-patient Nephrology program and Intensive Care Unit
      within the London Health Sciences Centre organization (Victoria Hospital, University
      Hospital). All patients bound to receive CRRT for AKI will be considered. Due to the nature
      of the intervention, it is not possible to blind neither the patient nor the clinical staff
      to the treatment group they have been randomized to, however the research team member(s)
      analyzing the echo data will be blinded to the patients' treatment group and time interval.
      Additionally, the study uses robust objective measurements that will be unaffected by the
      patients' awareness of the group they have been randomized to.

      Participants will be followed until discharge from the ICU. End of study will be defined as
      60 days or hospital discharge for the last recruited patient. Assessment of hemodynamic
      response and 2-dimensional echocardiography will be performed throughout CRRT. All
      participants will undergo an echocardiogram prior to start of dialysis, 4-12 hours after
      starting dialysis, daily for up to 7 days after dialysis start, and at discharge from the
      intensive care unit. Blood work will be collected prior to beginning dialysis, 4-13 hours
      after starting dialysis, 24 hours after starting dialysis, and 7 days after dialysis start.
      Off line analysis will take place subsequently to measure longitudinal strain for 12 regions
      of the left ventricle at each time point.

All participants will undergo CRRT via a temporary vascular access - a dialysis-specific central venous catheter inserted in a central vein (internal jugular vein, subclavian vein, femoral vein).
Participants in the control group will receive standard-of-care CRRT, where returning venous blood will be rewarmed with an external blood warmer. The blood warmer temperature will be set by the attending clinician as per usual practice.</intervention_model_description>
