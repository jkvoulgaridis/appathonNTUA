  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) compose approximately 20% of soft tissue sarcomas with
      an annual incidence of approximately 7 per million population. GISTs occur throughout the GI
      tract, most commonly in the stomach or small intestine. The main treatment for localised GIST
      is surgical resection. At least 40% of these patients will develop recurrence or metastasis
      following complete resection. Local recurrence, liver metastases and/or dissemination within
      the abdominal cavity are the most common clinical manifestations. Although imatinib and
      sunitinib has greatly improved the quality of life and survival of patients with advanced
      GIST. Analysis of clinical trials revealed that patients with tumours with KIT exon 17 or 18
      mutations, with a second mutation in KIT exon 17 or 18, had worse responses to imatinib and
      sunitinib. Some patients with PDGFRA D842V mutation do not respond to the present standard
      therapies.

      Anlotinib (1-[[[4-(4-fluoro-2-methyl-1H-indol-5-yloxy)-6-methoxyquinolin-7-Yl] oxy]
      methyl]cyclopropanamine dihydrochloride) , a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI),
      characterized as a highly selective and potent c-KIT, VEGFR, PDGFR, FGFR inhibitor. In vitro
      and in vivo, Anlotinib has a broad spectrum of inhibitory action on tumor angiogenesis and
      growth, which showed broad activity against soft tissue sarcoma and GIST with D842V, D816H,
      V560G and V654A mutations. In 2015, the US FDA granted orphan drug treatment for ovarian
      cancer.

             infarction, serious/instable angina pectoris, symptomatic congestive heart failure or
