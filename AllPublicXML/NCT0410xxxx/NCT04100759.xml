  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smokers are at higher risk of developing Erectile dysfunction (ED) independent of age and
      comorbidities. Sildenafil is a cytochrome p3A4 (CYP3A4) substrate used for enhancing the
      erectile function in males. The study purpose is to determine the effect of smoking on male
      sexual function based on the international index of erectile function score (IIEF) and
      investigate the effect of smoking (Cigarettes or marijuana) on the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of sildenafil.

      The study is a randomized, single dose, one way, open label, parallel study in thirty-six
      (36) subjects randomized into three groups;group(1) included twelve(12) healthy non-smoker
      males, group(2) included twelve(12) healthy smokers (Cigarettes) and group(3) included
      twelve(12) healthy smokers (marijuana).

      Each group received a single dose of Viagra 50 mg film coated tablet (Sildenafil 50 mg) Blood
      samples were collected at the following sampling intervals: pre-dose administration, 10
      minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8,10, 12 and 24 hours post
      dose.

      Blood samples were centrifuged and plasma was separated and stored at -80 degree Celsius till
      time of analysis.

      Plasma concentrations of sildenafil were determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass
      spectrometry (LC/MS/MS)
