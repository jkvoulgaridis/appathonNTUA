  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is one of the most common inborn diseases. Early
      diagnosis of this condition is very important and it can be harmful both to miss DDH and
      label normal infants as having DDH. Why DDH can be missed or labelled to normal children is
      not well understood but can be related to the doctor's knowledge, skill and the way the hip
      consultation is conducted. This research aims to help overcome these issues and proposes the
      use of a diagnostic aid (checklist) for DDH in general (GP) practices.

      The Investigator will divide general practices (GP) in England into two groups. One group
      will use our checklist for all hip checks they carry out. The other group will work as they
      usually do, without the aid. The study wishes to compare if GPs who use the checklist will do
      better in identifying babies with DDH than those who do not use our checklist. The
      Investigator will also evaluate whether using the checklist reduces costs for families around
      trips to doctors or hospitals, and costs to the NHS. In addition The Investigators will
      interview general practitioners, health visitors and carers of infants to elicit their
      perceptions about the intervention.

      The study will include GPs registered in England who carry out the 6-week hip check and agree
      to being randomised and to hospitals releasing data on infants they had examined during the
      study period. Practices planning to close within 12 months of the start of the study are not
      eligible. Eligible infants will be identified by general practice patient registers and
      infants will be invited to attend a 6-week check at their local practices, the research
      sites. The study plans to include a total of 152 practices in this study and will collaborate
      with 15 NIHR CRNs to recruit GP practices with efficient and existing infrastructure.

      1. Objectives:

             -  To determine whether the use of a check list for the 6-week hip check can (i)
                reduce the number of clinically insignificant referrals from primary to secondary
                care, and (ii) reduce the number of Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH)
                diagnosed beyond the age of 12 weeks.

             -  To determine the cost-effectiveness of this intervention considering a life time
                horizon.

             -  To conduct an integrated qualitative and quantitative process evaluation in order
                to: understand the participants' experience with the intervention; identify how the
                intervention affects general practitioners' capability, opportunity and motivation
                in relation to the 6-week check; study how the intervention is implemented; and
                investigate how contextual factors affect uptake of the intervention.

        2. Type of trial: Phase III, cluster randomised controlled trial

        3. Trial design and methods: This trial incorporates (i) 4-months internal pilot in order
           to confirm realistic recruitment targets; (ii) process evaluation encompassing
           qualitative research on changing physician referral behaviour and on normalising the
           intervention in practice; and (iii) health economic evaluation.

        4. Trial duration per participant: 24 months

        5. Planned trial sites: 152 GP practices in England. Half will be randomised to the
           experimental arm (using the diagnostic aid) and half to the control arm (standard of
           care 6 week hip check)

        6. Total number of participants planned: 152 GP practices will be randomised (in which 110
           infants each year are anticipated to be assessed within the 6-week hip check across the
           practices).

        7. Main inclusion criteria:

             -  Inclusion: GP practices registered in England and who carry out the 6-week hip
                check as part of their routine work - these practices must be using either EMIS,
                VISION or System One clinical computer systems
