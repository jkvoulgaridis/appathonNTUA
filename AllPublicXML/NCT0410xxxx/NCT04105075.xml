    <textblock>
      The study included 176 patients with COPD. The first group included 88 normal weight patients
      with COPD: 71 men and 17 women, mean age 62.40 ± 8.83 years. The second group included 88
      patients with COPD and obesity: 64 men and 24 women, mean age 62.94 ± 5.96 years. We assessed
      the frequency of COPD exacerbations in last 12 months, the severity of symptoms such as
      dyspnea, sputum production, fatigue. Spirometry, six-minute walk test and analysis of body
      tissue type composition were performed. BODE index was calculated. Levels of leptin,
      adiponectin, interleukins-4,6,8,10, interferon-γ, c-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis
      factor receptor 1 (TNF-R1), tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNF-R2), tumor necrosis factor
      alpha (TNF-α) were measured in blood serum.

        The study included 176 patients with COPD. According to the Global Initiative for Chronic
        Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD, 2019) classification, all patients belonged to the group D,
        GOLD 2-4 (GOLD 1 = forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) ≥ 80% predicted, GOLD 2 = 50
        ≤ FEV1 ≤ 80% predicted, GOLD 3 = 30 ≤ FEV1 ≤ 50% predicted, GOLD 4 = FEV1 &lt; 30% predicted).
        Patients were divided in two groups depending on the body mass index (BMI): 18.5-24.99 kg /
        m2 - normal weight, 30 kg / m2 and more - obesity. The first group (group 1) included 88
        patients with COPD and normal weight: 71 (80.68%) men and 17 (19.32%) women aged from 43 to
        72 years (mean age 62.40 ± 8.83 years). The second group (group 2) - 88 patients with COPD
        and obesity: 64 (72.73%) men and 24 (27.27%) women aged from 50 to 72 years (mean age 62.94
        ± 5.96 years).
