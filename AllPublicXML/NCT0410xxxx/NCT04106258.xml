  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hemoporfin photodynamic therapy
      (PDT) with different light doses for port-wine stain (PWS）in 2-7 years old children. The
      pharmacokinetic behavior and pharmacokinetic parameters of hemoporfin in children will be
      investigated as well.
