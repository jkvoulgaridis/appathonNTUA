  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia affects 2 to 5% of adults in the general population. Patients describe a
      combination of symptoms centred around fatigue not induced by exercise and not relieved by
      rest.

      The diagnosis of fibromyalgia is self-perpetuating by the deconditioning, consequence of a
      reduced muscle mass due to inactivity and periods of prolonged rest.

      Thus, it seems fundamental to develop other non-drug approaches: among them, adapted physical
      activity is recommended by most learned societies because of a good level of evidence (Level
      1, Grade A). The question remains, however, whether simple advice to resume physical activity
      is sufficient (routine care with medical assessment at 3 months) or whether a physical
      activity supervised inside and outside the hospital is not more relevant.

      In order to set up an optimal patient path within the Group of hospitals of Loire territory,
      the working group composed of doctors from different specialities of the department
      considered it important to carry out a randomised study evaluating the effectiveness of a
      healthcare organisation combining:

        -  an adapted and supervised physical activity intervention (1 month hospital initiation
           then 2 months in town)

        -  therapeutic education sessions for the patient with motivational interviews Compared to
           usual clinical practice (adapted physical activity adapted in autonomy at home +
           therapeutic patient education sessions with motivational interviews).

    <description>measured with Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) : on a 7-point scale, rated from 1 for &quot;much worse&quot; to 7 for &quot;much better&quot;. It is a simple and practical evaluation tool to use. The combination of the level of achievement via the Patient Global Impression of Change and the initial documentation of the patient's objectives via the shared educational assessment is a relevant and understandable approach for the patient.</description>

    <measure>fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>assessed by Fatigue Severity Scale. This is a short questionnaire of 9 questions to which the patient answers on a scale from 1 to 7.
Simply add the scores and divide by 9 - you get a result on 7 points. The higher the result, the greater the fatigue. Several studies speak of a threshold at 5.5</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of sleep</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>assessed by the Pittsburgh. The questionnaire includes 19 self-assessment questions and 5 questions for the spouse or roommate (if any). Only self-assessment questions are included in the score.
The 19 self-assessment questions combine to give 7 components&quot; of the score with each component receiving a score of 0 to 3.
In all cases, a score of 0 indicates that there is no difficulty while a score of 3 indicates the existence of severe difficulties. The 7 components of the score add up to give an overall score from 0 to 21 points, 0 meaning that there is no difficulty, and 21 indicating on the contrary major difficulties.</description>
