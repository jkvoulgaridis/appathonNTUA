  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether consuming snacks containing
      different blends of dietary fibers alters the type and number of bacteria found in your gut
      and improves markers of overall health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will complete a 47-day, multi-phase feeding study to evaluate the effect of two
      snack prototypes containing two different fiber blends on gut community structure and
      features of host biological state (plasma proteome/ metabolome). The information gained from
      this work will increase our understanding of the importance of specific dietary fibers in
      manipulating the composition of the gut microbiota in ways that may improve our metabolic
      health.
