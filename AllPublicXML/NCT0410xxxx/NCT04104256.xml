  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is strong consensus - based on robust randomized trial data - that routine
      pre-operative (pre-op) testing for cataract surgery is inappropriate. Yet despite these
      widely endorsed evidence-based recommendations, most seniors undergoing cataract surgery
      still receive unnecessary blood testing, EKGs, and chest X-rays (CXRs); another substantial
      percentage even undergo non-indicated cardiac stress tests. A quality improvement initiative
      will integrate three new BPA nudges into the UCLA Health EHR. The nudges are informed by
      behavioral economic theory and are designed to alter the choice architecture for physicians
      to decrease the rate of pre-op test ordering while still preserving clinician autonomy. We
      will evaluate a quality improvement initiative that would reduce low-value pre-operative
      testing for cataract surgery.

      There is strong consensus - based on robust randomized trial data - that routine
      pre-operative (pre-op) testing for cataract surgery is inappropriate.1-4 Because pre-op
      testing provides no benefit to patients, the American Academy of Ophthalmology even named
      reducing routine pre-op testing for cataract surgery as their #1 issue that patients and
      physicians should question as part of the Choosing Wisely™ campaign.5 Yet despite these
      widely endorsed evidence-based recommendations, most seniors undergoing cataract surgery
      still receive unnecessary blood testing, EKGs, and chest X-rays (CXRs); another substantial
      percentage even undergo non-indicated cardiac stress tests.6

      With cataract surgery being the most common medical procedure among Medicare beneficiaries
      (predicted 4.4 million per year by the year 2030),7 widespread reduction of routine pre-op
      testing for cataract surgery would save billions of dollars, reduce exposure to unnecessary
      and potentially harmful tests, and allow millions of seniors to spend more time enjoying life
      rather than wasting their time receiving inappropriate health care.

      The investigators hypothesize that an interdisciplinary electronic health record (EHR)-based
      intervention that applies behavioral economics approaches (i.e., &quot;nudges&quot;) will dramatically
      reduce pre-op testing for cataract surgery in a real-world clinical setting. The
      investigators propose to test this hypothesis by conducting a pragmatic randomized trial,
      implementing our intervention at UCLA Health (Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where ~3200
      cataract surgeries are performed per year). Our specific aims are to:

        1. Integrate three new BPA nudges into the UCLA Health EHR. The investigators will conduct
           a four-arm randomized pragmatic trial to compare the effectiveness of the nudges vs.
           usual care. Three distinct nudges were tailored to highlight the safety/liability
           aspects of pre-op tests, the financial benefits to the patient of not experiencing preop
           tests, and the psychological benefits to the patient of not experiencing pre-op tests.
           The quality improvement initiative will include three types of behavioral nudges to
           promote the desired reduction in low value care:

             -  Nudge #1 will display as &quot;Routine pre-operative tests do not increase the safety of
                cataract surgery and are considered inappropriate per current evidence-based
                recommendations (ASA and AAO Recommendations).&quot;

             -  Nudge #2 will display as &quot;Routine pre-operative tests can increase the patient's
                out-of-pocket costs without improving the safety or medical outcomes of cataract
                surgery and are considered inappropriate per current evidence-based recommendations
                (ASA and AAO Recommendations).&quot;

             -  Nudge #3 will display as &quot;Routine pre-operative tests can cause aggravation and
                psychological stress for the patient without improving the safety or medical
                outcomes of cataract surgery and are considered inappropriate per current
                evidence-based recommendations (ASA and AAO Recommendations).&quot;

        2. Randomize providers who conducted a pre-op visit in 2019 over a one-year period to one
           of 4 types of pre-operative visits (usual pre-op care, Nudge #1, Nudge #2, or Nudge #3)
           and measure and compare the efficacy of each intervention. The investigators will
           measure and compare rates of testing before and after initiation of the randomization.
           Outcomes will be measured 12-months after the intervention start including:

           a. Primary outcome = change in percentage of patients undergoing pre-op testing (labs,
           EKG, CXR) b. Secondary patient, physician, and system-level outcomes i. Patients:
           perceived benefit/harm of not getting tested ii. Physicians: perceived change in
           workflow, autonomy, satisfaction iii. System: day of surgery cancellations, median time
           to surgery, costs saved, return on investment

           Reducing patient exposure to unnecessary care is central to improving patient outcomes
           and value. This project is fully aligned with UCLA Health leadership's current priority
           on supporting cross-departmental system change to improve quality of care, outcomes, and
           value for UCLA patients. Because of the close partnership between our UCLA Informatics
           co-Investigators and the EHR vendor (Epic), the low-cost intervention that the
           investigators propose to implement and test would be easily available to all Epic-based
           health systems, with potential to dramatically reduce inappropriate pre-op testing
           across the nation.

           EHRs are in their infancy, and the investigators as a scientific community are only
           beginning to learn how to use them as tools to promote desired care processes.8 This
           proposed pragmatic trial would break new ground in our understanding of how behavioral
           economics approaches can be used to tamp down on care that does not promote better
           patient outcomes.
