  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are many factors that can affect the diagnostic yield of EUS-FNA, including lesion
      factors, the endoscoist experience, the needle size, the number of needle passes, and the
      suction technique. since diagnostic efficacy of different suction techniques for EUS-FNB is
      still uncertain, thus we decided to compare the diagnostic efficacy of three common methods:
      the 10 ml standard negative pressure, slow pull and wet suction.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      the standard suction: after the needle is inserted in the mass, removing the stylet before
      performing EUS-FNA. Then attach a 10mL syringe to the end of needle. 20 times of for-backward
      Suction was applied after the lesion was punctured.

      slow-pull : after the needle is inserted in the mass, slowly pull the stylet out while
      performing EUS-FNA with 20 times for-backward.

      wet suction: after removing the stylet, the needle was flushed with 5mL of saline solution to
      replace the column of air with saline. A 10mL syringe was attached to the end of the needle.
      20 times of for-backward Suction was applied after the lesion was punctured.
