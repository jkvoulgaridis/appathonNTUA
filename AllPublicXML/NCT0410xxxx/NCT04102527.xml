  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Terminal Chronic Kidney Disease undergoing Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) often have
      pathophysiological factors that promote chronic constipation. It affects the quality of life
      of Patients undergoing PD in a much greater way than for hemodialysis patients because it
      causes complications, mechanical and infectious associated with the transmural migration of
      enteral bacteria, with an impact on patient morbidity and survival of the technique. In
      addition, it should be noted that PD patients often take potentially constipants treatments
      such as phosphorus chelators, calcium inhibitors, opiates, iron preparation and
      antidepressants. Taking these drugs decreases gastric acidity, which is associated with an
      increased prevalence of peritonitis.

      In this context, a significant lack of literature, specifically studying the risk factors for
      constipation in Terminal Chronic Kidney Disease patients treated with DP and the correlation
      with mechanical and infectious complications, is improvable.

      Patients included in this trial will be monitored as part of the usual management of their
      pathology, a Terminal Chronic Kidney Disease treated by the Peritoneal Dialysis technique.

      During this treatment, patients will be follow every 2 months in consultation in the
      Metabolic Diseases Department of the Hospital of Vichy.

      These consultations include:

        -  Pre-selection consultation/Inclusion (visit to J0 -3 months)

        -  Half-yearly review (visit J0, visit at 12 months and visit at 24 months)

        -  Simple consultation (visits to 2, 4, 8, 10, 14, 16, 20, 22 months)

        -  Annual review (visits at 6 and 18 months)

      In this prospective trial, there is no intervention on the patient; They will only have to
      complete questionnaires on their intestinal transit (Charlson Scale, Katz Scale, Neurological
      Functional Score, Intestinal Function Index, Severity Score for constipation, Bristol Scale,
      Constipation Assessment Scale, Constipation Risk Assessment Scale). No minimal risk and
      constraint is identified, excluding our trial from the category of interventional research.
      The category 3 (non-interventional trial) of the jard√© classification is therefore accepted.

        Clinically stable patients who have been in Peritoneal Dialysis for at least three months
        will be pre-selected three months before the start of the study and included via the
        Metabolic diseases Center of the Hospital.

        This protocol will be offered to adult patients suffering from Terminal Chronic Kidney
        disease undergoing Peritoneal Dialysis.

        The investigator will inform the details of the protocol and answer all questions from
        patients. It will be given sufficient time to reflect for the signing of the information
        and non-opposition form. Volunteers will be included after signing this document.
