      Smith &amp; Nephew are assessing a new single use NPWT system.There is a significant amount of
      clinical evidence to show that NPWT may reduce oedema, increase healing and reduce chance of
      infection, through maintenance of pressure therapy, in closed incisions. The proposed
      clinical strategy is to conduct a study assessing performance and safety of the new single
      use NPWT system in order to assess whether the same benefits of other NPWT systems on the
      market can be applied to therapy provided with the new system. Subjects with abdominal
      incisions and knee incisions following knee surgery will be recruited to the study and
      receive NPWT for 7 days. The performance of the system will be logged by the device and
      acceptability of the device will be assessed by patient and clinician. Safety will be
      assessed with a 30 day follow up to assess complications and device related events.

          -  Immediately after the surgery, subject will have one suitable closed abdominal or knee
             surgery incision, (if there is more than one incision then the clinician should choose
             the one which in their opinion is most suited for PICO therapy) that fits under the
             absorbent dressing area of the appropriate PICO ONBOARD dressing sizes (dressing sizes
             equivalent to PICO dressings 10 x 20 cm, 10 x 30 cm, 10 x 40 cm, 15 x 20 cm, 15 x 30
             cm).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindications (per the PICO ONBOARD IB) or hypersensitivity to the use of the
             investigational product or their components (e.g. silicone adhesives and polyurethane
             films [direct contact with incision], acrylic adhesives [direct contact with skin],
             polyethylene fabrics and super-absorbent powders [polyacrylates]) within the
             dressing).

             related) within thirty (30) days of operative visit or during the study.

          -  Subjects with skin features (e.g. tattoos, skin colour, pre-existing scarring) which
             in the opinion of the Investigator, will interfere with the study assessments.

             within the last 3 months

          -  Subjects undergoing a procedure as part of palliative care (to be confirmed during
             surgery).

          -  Subjects where the Electronic Component area of the device would be placed on a
             load-bearing anatomical location (i.e. areas vulnerable to pressure damage).
