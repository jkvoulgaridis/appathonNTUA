  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infertile women undergoing hysteroscopy for diagnostic or therapeutic indication are asked to
      donate a sample of endometrium.

      Endometrial samples of study participants are examined for signs of chronic endometritis by
      immunohistochemical analysis.

      High-throughput sequencing of the microbial 16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) subunit is
      performed to identify and quantify the microbes present in the sample.

      Obstetric and reproductive outcome is recorded 12 months after hysteroscopy (telephone
      interview).
