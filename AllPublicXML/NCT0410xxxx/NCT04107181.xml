      This project is to assess if the introducer, &quot;calla&quot;, can be used in place of a speculum
      during a routine Pap smear. For the patient arm, the introducer will be used in conjunction
      with standard of care procedures. The healthy volunteer arm will include taking the
      introducer home for a week to determine if each person can find their cervix without the help
      of a physician. As well as completing surveys on ease of use and demographics related to
      their medial history.

    <description>There will be 2 types of healthy volunteers recruited to participate in this arm. The home study is to determine ease of use/feasibility of the introducer. The other group of healthy volunteers will be interviewed only. The goal of this study is to better understand how to improve women's health through learning about women's perceptions of their reproductive anatomy, specifically the cervix, comfort in discussing reproductive health topics with providers, and thoughts on two tools used to see the cervix.</description>
