      In polytrraumatized patients, Does hyperglycaemia on admission increase the risk of morbidity
      and mortality compared to polytraumatised patients with normal blood glucose level ?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trauma is still the leading cause of death in young adults and a major cause of morbidity and
      mortality at all ages.(1,2). Polytrauma is defined as injury to several physical regions or
      organ systems, where at least one injury or the combination of several injuries are life
      threatening with the severity of injury being equal or &gt;16 on the scale of the Injury
      Severity Score (ISS). Prediction of mortality in trauma patients is an important part of
      trauma care (3). The trauma and injury severity score (TRISS) and Acute Physiology and
      Chronic Health Evaluation IV (APACHE IV) are used commonly to predict injury severity and
      risk of mortality. Although it is regarded as the international standard in trauma scoring,
      it has complex calculating and incorporates the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) for neurological
      evaluation (4). Regardless of the accuracy of trauma scores, is based on an anatomical
      description of every injury and cannot be assigned to the patients until a full diagnostic
      procedure has been performed(5) . Many studies have revealed alteration in glucose metabolism
      in trauma and proportional relation of its high level to the degree of injury (6).
      hyperglycaemia is associated with similar complications as uncontrolled diabetes, including
      an increased mortality, an increased number of infectious complications, and poor wound
      healing. The presence of elevated blood glucose also impedes normal host defences against
      infection and impairs the normal inflammatory response (7.8).

        -  Therefore, this study will be conducted to compare between alterations in easy and rapid
           predictors as glucose level, base deficit and lactate and difficult and slow predictors
           as TRISS and APACHE IV. So, it could be considered an early and easy rapid predictor of
           outcome .
