    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to determine the safety profile of the study drug after it is
      given by mouth to healthy participants. Blood tests will be performed to check how much
      LY3372689 gets into the bloodstream and how long the body takes to get rid of it. Each
      enrolled participant will receive multiple doses of LY3372689 or placebo and will remain in
      the study for up to eight weeks.
