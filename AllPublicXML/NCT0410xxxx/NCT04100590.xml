    <textblock>
      Biomarkers of recent drug use and intoxication have societal relevance, in that they are used
      by law enforcement and other agencies to detect drug impairment. For instance, a breathalyzer
      can quickly and accurately detect blood alcohol content (BAC) to indicate if a person is
      under the influence of alcohol; however, there is currently no similar way to quickly detect
      if a person is under the influence of cannabis. In light of increasing cannabis use, it is
      important to define a quantitative, objective method of determining recent use and
      intoxication.

      The link between changes in eye characteristics (e.g. movement, pupil dilation) and cannabis
      use is documented (Peragallo et al. 2013), but insufficiently characterized. Certain outcomes
      of eye behavior are known to be affected by recent cannabis use (e.g. the eyes' ability to
      converge on a target; Stapleton et al 1986), while findings are mixed regarding other
      outcomes (e.g. the eyes' ability to smoothly follow a target; Fant et al. 1998). Thus, the
      goal of this study is to identify a characteristic pattern of eye behavior, defined by
      performance on a battery of four eye tasks, as a function of recent cannabis use (7% vs. 0%
      THC).

      Using 30 healthy cannabis users (15 men, 15 women), this study will be one of the first to
      assess changes in eye behavior as a function of recent cannabis use within a quantified
      virtual reality (VR) environment. This study will examine the effect of smoked cannabis (7%
      vs. 0% THC) on individual eye movements, with the goal of defining the utility of the eyes as
      potential objective indicators of cannabis use and intoxication. Four eye tests (nystagmus,
      smooth pursuit, convergence, and pupillary light response; outlined below), which previous
      literature has defined as effective in detecting recent drug use (including opioids and
      alcohol; Murillo et al. 2004), have been compiled into a 5-minute task battery using a VR
      headset environment equipped with high frequency infrared eye trackers (the HTC Vive with
      Pupil Labs Tracking). This 5-minute VR battery of four eye tests will be administered prior
      to cannabis consumption as a baseline, and then at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, and
      165 min after cannabis, with the goal of comparing baseline values to the ten post-cannabis
      timepoints to detect changes in eye behavior as a function of cannabis intoxication. The
      study will also utilize a battery of subjective-effects and mood visual analogue scales
      (0-100 mm; e.g. 'Good Drug Effect') prior to the eye test battery at each timepoint, allowing
      us to correlate each outcome of the eye tasks to subjectively reported cannabis impairment
      and mood.

      In addition to measuring eye behavior as a function of cannabis use, the training session of
      this study will be used to also collect exploratory data on the relationship between pupil
      dilation and experimental pain. Using Quantitative Sensory Testing (Medoc TSA-II NeuroSensory
      Analyzer), thermal pain threshold and tolerance will be induced using a cold stimulus (4.0°C;
      induced with a 30 x 30 mm Peltier thermode, which is 1.5&quot; square metal applicator that is
      connected to the TSA-II NeuroSensory Analyzer device and software, and produces an ongoing
      cold sensation applied to the lower palm of the participant's non-dominant hand).
      Participants will indicate first feelings of pain (pain threshold), and when the pain becomes
      too much to bear (pain tolerance) by pressing a button on a controller connected to the
      TSA-II. Throughout exposure to the cold stimulus, changes in pupil size to the patient's
      subjectively reported pain latencies will be recorded.

    <description>Using a Virtual Reality headset, a stimulus (a fixation cross) moves from the center of the visual field to 45 visual degrees to the right and left and is held at each extreme for 10 seconds. The accuracy with which the participant completes this task will be measured by comparing pupil position with the target position within the virtual reality environment, down to the millimeter. Speed will also be assessed by measuring pupil position as a function of target fixation, down to the millisecond.</description>

    <description>Using a Virtual Reality headset, a stimulus (a fixation cross) moves from the center of the visual field to 40 visual degrees up and down and is held at each extreme for 10 seconds.

    <measure>Smooth Pursuit (SP)</measure>
    <time_frame>% Change from baseline during each of two sessions (measurements taken at baseline, 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, and 165 minutes post-cannabis)</time_frame>
    <description>Using a Virtual Reality headset, a stimulus (a fixation cross) moves from each extreme of the visual field at a speed of 40 degrees/second. This test measures the tracking ability of the eyes. The smooth pursuit test is embedded in the nystagmus tests; it takes place in between the HGN/VGN tests as the stimulus moves from the horizontal/vertical extremes. Horizontal smooth pursuit is assessed as the stimulus moves from one side of the visual field to the other, while vertical smooth pursuit is assessed when the stimulus moves from the upper extreme of the visual field to the lower extreme, or vice versa. The accuracy with which the participant completes this task will be measured by comparing pupil position with the target position within the virtual reality environment, down to the millimeter. Speed will also be assessed by measuring pupil position as a function of target fixation, down to the millisecond.</description>

    <description>Using a Virtual Reality headset, a stimulus (a fixation cross) moves from 12 inches to 2 inches away from the participant's nose at a continuous speed over 5 seconds, then is held at that point for 10 seconds. The accuracy with which the participant completes this task will be measured by comparing pupil position with the target position within the virtual reality environment, down to the millimeter. Speed will also be assessed by measuring pupil position as a function of target fixation, down to the millisecond.</description>

    <description>Using a Virtual Reality headset, a bright light is presented in a previously dark setting for 10 seconds followed by 30 seconds of no light for pupil adjustment. Size and speed of pupil constriction will also be assessed (in millimeters and millisecond, respectively).</description>

    <time_frame>% Change from baseline during each of two sessions (measurements taken at baseline, 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, and 165 minutes post-cannabis)</time_frame>
    <description>Using a Virtual Reality headset, a light is flashed once for one second followed by an observation period of 5 seconds. During the observation period, no lights flash and the participant's reaction to darkness is assessed. Size and speed of pupil constriction will also be assessed (in millimeters and millisecond, respectively).</description>

    <measure>Quantitative Sensory Testing Thermal Pain (QST-TP)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 time at Screening</time_frame>
    <description>A thermal testing analyzer (Medoc TSA-II NeuroSensory Analyzer) with a 30 x 30 mm Peltier thermode is used to apply a cold stimulus on the thenar eminence of the palm. The temperature is set to 4.0°C. Using a computerized response button, participants will note the time (in seconds) at which they begin to perceive the cold as painful, and when it becomes too painful to continue. At this latter point, the program will discontinue the cold stimulus and return to baseline temperature. Participants also continuously rate the magnitude of perceived pain using a computerized Visual Analog Scale (Co-VAS, a range of 0-100mm; 0=no pain, 100=worst pain imaginable) throughout stimulation. Throughout this assessment, changes in pupil dilation will be measured using the eye-tracking headset and correlated to their subjective Co-VAS pain responses. If participants exceed the 3-minute cut-off, the task will be discontinued in order to avoid tissue damage.</description>
