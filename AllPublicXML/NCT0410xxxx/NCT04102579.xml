    <measure>Change from Baseline (average of Screening and Day -1) to Maintenance (average of Weeks 10 and 12) in the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) Total Maximal Chorea (TMC) Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, Day -1, Week 10, and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The TMC is part of the motor assessment of the UHDRS and measures chorea in 7 different body parts including the face, oral-buccal-lingual region, trunk and each limb independently. The TMC score is the sum of the individual scores and ranges from 0 to 28. A decrease in score indicates improvement in chorea.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) Response Status at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-C is a 7-point Likert scale that rates the overall global improvement of chorea since the initiation of study drug dosing, ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse), as assessed by the clinician. Subjects whose CGI-C score is either a 1 (&quot;very much improved&quot;) or a 2 (&quot;much improved&quot;) will be classified as responders.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) Response Status at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PGI-C is a 7-point Likert scale that rates the overall global improvement of chorea since the initiation of study drug dosing, ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse), as assessed by the subject. Subjects whose PGI-C score is either a 1 (&quot;very much improved&quot;) or a 2 (&quot;much improved&quot;) will be classified as responders.</description>

    <time_frame>Day -1 and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Neuro-QoL Upper Extremity Function Short Form consists of 8 questions about physical abilities, rated from 1 (unable to do) to 5 (without any difficulty).</description>
