  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is one of the healthcare-related infections that is
      common in critically ill patients, prolongs hospital stay, significantly increases mortality
      and additional health care costs.

      Microaspiration of oropharyngeal secretions the primary pathway in the formation of VAP has
      led researchers to focus on the detection of applications to prevent microbial colonization.
      Continuous or intermittent oropharyngeal aspiration, open system aspiration versus closed
      system aspiration, extensive oral care, oropharyngeal aspiration prior to patient positioning
      are some of these applications.

      When the patient is turned to position, the outbreak accumulated in the oral cavity is more
      likely to move to the lower respiratory tract. In this study, it is assumed that aspiration
      of oropharyngeal secretions prior to each position change will reduce the accumulation of
      oral secretion in the endotracheal tube cuff and reduce aspiration of contaminated secretion
      and reduce the risk of developing VIP. This randomized controlled experimental study was
      planned to confirm the validity of this assumption.

      This study was a randomized controlled experimental study designed to investigate the effect
      of oropharyngeal aspiration on decreasing the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia in
      patients receiving mechanical ventilation. The research was conducted between July 2015 and
      April 2019 in anesthesiology and reanimation intensive care unit. The study was carried out
      with 20 patients who underwent oropharyngeal aspiration as needed and 20 patients with
      oropharyngeal aspiration prior to each change of position.

    <description>Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) was used in the diagnosis of VAP and, VAP was diagnosed in patients whose CPIS was above 6 in the evaluation. Broncho alveolar lavage specimens were cultured for VAP agent/s. Antibiotic susceptibility of microorganisms grown in positive cultures were investigated.</description>

    <description>Patients in the experimental group underwent oropharyngeal aspiration prior to each position change in addition to routine nursing care (Endotracheal aspiration in case of indication and oropharyngeal aspiration in the follow-up; routine and non-routine position changes every 2 hours during the day and 4 hours during the night; oral care).
Patients in this group underwent oropharyngeal aspiration at least 9 times in 24 hours with a pressure of 100-120 mmHg for 10 seconds prior to routine (2 hours a day, 4 hours a night) and non-routine position changes.
After the oropharyngeal aspiration was completed, the patient's position was changed.</description>
