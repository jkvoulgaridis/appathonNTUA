  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Large volume paracentesis (LVP) with albumin administration is the standard of care for
      patients with refractory ascites complicating end-stage liver disease. However, the use of
      albumin is frequently limited due to expense and occasional short supply. The goal of this
      study is to determine if the administration of Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) during large volume
      paracentesis is effective in lowering plasma renin activity by 25% compared to baseline.

    <measure>Change in plasma renin activity (PRA) post paracentesis</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy of LVP with FFP will be measured as the change of plasma renin activity (PRA) from Day 1 to Day 6 during the 2nd LVP with FFP. We hypothesize that FFP will reduce the PRA by 25% from Day 1 to Day 6.</description>
