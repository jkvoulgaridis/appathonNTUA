    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of C-Trelin OD Tablet
      5mg(Taltirelin Hydrate) in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in
      patients with ataxia induced by spinocerebellar degeneration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Taltirelin Hydrate, an active substance of C-Trelin OD tablet 5mg, is an analogue of
      Thyrotropin Releasing Hormone(TRH). TRH is distributed widely in the brain, and exerts
      variety of central nervous system effects as well as endocrine activity such as releasing of
      Thyroid Stimulating Hormone(TSH) and Prolactin. Based on these actions, studies have been
      attempted for the treatment of various neurological diseases such as refractory epilepsy,
      cerebellar ataxia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cerebellar ataxia and so on. C-Trelin OD
      tablet 5mg (Taltirelin Hydrate) for the clinical trial is a commercially available drug that
      was approved by Ministry of Food and Drug Safety(MFDS) based on the safety and efficacy.
      However, the studies with this medicine were conducted before 1997, and the evaluation
      criteria for the efficacy was quite different from the current evaluation criteria.

      In this clinical trial, K-SARA as an objective evaluation criteria validated in Korean
      patients is used to confirm the efficacy of C-Trelin to improve ataxia, and to prove safety
      by evaluating changes in clinical laboratory data and adverse events.

    <description>Changes in Clinical Global Impression(CGI) is a commonly used measure to assess the severity of symptoms, improvement, the effectiveness of treatment and it consists of Clinical Global Impression-Severity(CGI-S), Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale(CGI-I), and Clinical Global Impression-Efficacy index(CGI-E). Clinical Global Impression-Efficacy index(CGI-E) indicates the effect of the current treatment and the severity of the side effects. It is calculated by dividing the treatment effect by the side effects. The treatment effect ranges from 1 to 4, and higher scores indicate the better effect. The side effect ranges from 1 to 4, and higher scores indicate the greater side effect.</description>

EQ-5D-5L descriptive system consists of 5 items (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain / discomfort, anxiety / depression), and 5 levels for each item [No problems (Level 1), slight problems (Level 2), moderate problems (Level 3), severe problems (Level 4), extreme problems (Level 5)]. EQ Visual Analogue Scale(EQ VAS) measures and records the subject's rating for their current health-related quality of life state on a 20cm visual analogue scale. Each endpoint is marked with &quot;best imaginable health(100)&quot; and &quot;worst imaginable health(0)&quot;.</description>

Each item is scored by 0 to 2 and higher scores indicate the better performance. The sum of each individual score consists of the total gait scores(12 points), the total balance scores(16 points), and the sum of the gait and balance scores(28 points).</description>
