      The purpose of this study is to assess the usefulness of the Thyromental Height Test in
      prediction of difficult intubation and the utility of double lumen video endotracheal tubes
      in patients scheduled for elective thoracic procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most of the thoracic surgery interventions require lung isolation techniques. Currently the
      most commonly used lung isolation techniques are double lumen tubes or single lumen tubes
      with additional use of bronchial blockers. In both cases fiberoptic bronchoscopy is used for
      proper placement and maintenance during operation. Recently double lumen video endotracheal
      tubes were proposed as a new alternative for lung isolation techniques. The double lumen
      video endotracheal tube differs significantly in size and physical characteristics from
      standard single lumen endotracheal tube and intubation may prove to be challenging even for
      an experienced practitioner. Therefore proper prediction of difficult intubation play a
      crucial role in a clinical setting. Sensitivity and specificity of existing anthropometric
      scales and tests used for prediction of difficult intubation seem lacking so new methods such
      as Thyromental Height Test (TMHT) are being introduced. It is based on the height between the
      anterior border of the thyroid cartilage and the anterior border of the mentum, measured
      while the patient lies in the supine position with closed mouth. The main objective of the
      trial is to assess the clinical usefulness of TMHT in prediction of difficult intubation
      using double lumen video endotracheal tubes in patients scheduled for elective thoracic
      surgical procedures. The secondary aim is to evaluate the utility of double lumen video
      endotracheal tubes as a novel method of lung separation.

    <description>The height between the anterior border of the thyroid cartilage (on the thyroid notch just between the 2 thyroid laminae) and the anterior border of the mentum (on the mental protuberance of the mandible), in supine position with mouth closed, measured with a depth gauge during routine preoperative anaesthetic visit.</description>

    <time_frame>Intraoperative</time_frame>
    <description>During fiberoptic bronchoscopy after the operation airway trauma on the level of bronchus, tracheal bifurcation, trachea and vocal cords were reported, where 0 was defined as no visible trauma, 1 as a redness, 2 as oedema, 3 as hematoma and 4 as active bleeding.</description>

    <description>During direct laryngoscopy the laryngeal view is graded in Cormack-Lehane Scale by the laryngoscopist. Grade I is assigned when the glottis is fully visible, grade II when the glottis is partially visible, grade III when only the epiglottis is visible and grade IV when neither glottis nor epiglottis is visible.</description>
