      Phase IV, open-label study will evaluate effects of Benralizumab in the treatment of severe
      asthma in patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who have been identified to have severe asthma with ABPA will be consented and
      enrolled in the study to receive benralizumab injections administered every 4 weeks for the
      first 3 injections with an additional injection eight weeks to follow for a total of 16 weeks
      active treatment with a follow-up/termination visit eight weeks from the last injection. The
      termination visit will occur week 24 for subjects who complete the study treatment. Subjects
      who receive the first dose of benralizumab but withdraw from the study or terminate study
      treatment for any reason should complete all the procedures outlined for the termination
      visit.

        SELECT INCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Female and Male patients aged 18-75 years inclusively at the time of Visit 1 with a
             physician diagnosis of Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis has met the ISHAM
             Working Group Diagnostic Criteria for ABPA:

               -  Predisposing condition: Bronchial asthma

               -  Obligatory criteria (both should be present)

                    -  Type I aspergillus skin test positive (immediate cutaneous hypersensitivity
                       Aspergillus antigen) or elevated IgE level against Aspergillus fumigatus
                       (Af)

                    -  Aspergillus niger or Aspergillus flavus may be eligible provided
                       antigen-specific IgE and IgG measurements are available for use.

                    -  Elevated total IgE levels (&gt;1,000IU/mL)*

               -  Other criteria (at least two of three)

                    -  Presence of precipitating or IgG antibodies against Af in serum

                    -  Radiographic pulmonary opacities consistent with ABPA

                    -  Total eosinophil count &gt;500 cells/uL in steroid na√Øve patients (may be
                       historical)

                         -  (if the patient meets all other criteria, an IgE value &lt;1,000 IU/mL may
                            be acceptable)

          -  Severe chronic asthma (for at least 12 months) requiring treatment with high dose ICS
             plus asthma controller prior to Visit 1

               -  Other acceptable asthma controllers include long acting bronchodilators (e.g. a
                  long acting beta-agonist (LABA) or long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA)), a
                  leukotriene inhibitor, theophylline preparations and/or maintenance OCS (daily or
                  every other day OCS requirement in order to maintain asthma control

               -  Documented current treatment with high daily doses of ICS ( &gt;500ug of FP

                       inhalers, then the patient must be on a high daily ICS dose for 3 months
                       prior to entering the study.

          -  History of at least 2 asthma exacerbations while on ICS plus another asthma controller
             (see inclusion criterion 2 for examples) that required treatment with systemic
             corticosteroids (IM, IV, or oral) in the 12 months prior to Visit 1. For patients
             receiving oral corticosteroids as a maintenance therapy, an exacerbation is defined as
             a temporary increase of their maintenance dose for a minimum of 3 days.

          -  History of anaphylaxis to any biologic therapy

          -  Known history of allergy or hypersensitivity reaction to benralizumab or any of its
