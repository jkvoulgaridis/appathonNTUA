        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males or non-pregnant, non-lactating females.

          2. Age 18 or greater at the time of informed consent.

          3. Able and willing to provide written informed consent.

          4. Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes.

          5. Chronic DFU as the index ulcer meeting all of the following criteria:

               1. present for at least 4 weeks at the time of Screening Visit 1

               2. located below the malleoli of the foot

               3. extends to the dermis or subcutaneous tissue, surrounded by healthy skin, without
                  evidence of exposed muscle, tendon, bone, or joint capsule

               4. area measures 1 to 10 cm2 inclusive, at Screening Visit 1, and

               5. non-healing (defined as ≤50% reduction in ulcer size by the Baseline Visit, as
                  compared to Screening Visit 1).

          6. Negative for antibodies to HLA Class I molecules expressed on Corlicyte MSCs, as
             measured by Luminex HLA single antigen beads, within 3 months prior to start of
             Treatment Phase without interval sensitizing events.

          7. For an index ulcer on the plantar surface of the foot, willingness to offload the foot
             per study protocol.

          8. In women of childbearing potential, willingness to use effective means of birth
             control during the course of the study; if using systemic birth control, this must
             have been used for 6 months or longer prior to Screening Visit 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Planned DFU treatment to the index ulcer that includes enzymatic agents, cytotoxic
             agents or any substance(s) that would affect MSC survival during the study period.

          2. Women planning to become pregnant during the course of the study.

          3. Significant history of, or current evidence of a severe comorbid medical or
             psychiatric condition such as liver disease, end-stage renal disease, untreated
             proliferative retinopathy, bleeding diathesis, schizophrenia, or laboratory
             abnormality that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude enrollment
             because of unacceptable risk.

          4. Presence of any skin condition or skin disorder around the index ulcer that might
             interfere with the diagnosis of or assessment of study-related endpoints, such as
             atopic dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, or seborrheic dermatitis.

          5. Presence of actinic keratosis or skin cancer within 2 cm of the index ulcer.

          6. Cellulitis or other active infection of the index ulcer or any non-index ulcer at
             Screening.

          7. Use of an investigational agent for ulcer care within 30 days prior to Screening Visit
             1.

          8. Receipt of an investigational agent or device not approved by the US FDA for marketed
             use in any indication within 30 days prior to Screening Visit 1.

          9. Planned participation in another therapeutic study for any indication prior to
             completion of study participation.

         10. Unwillingness or inability to comply with study visits and study procedures for the
             entire duration of study participation.

         11. Known positivity for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

         12. Active osteomyelitis or gangrene of either foot at Screening.

         13. Known Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection within 30 days
             prior to Screening Visit 1.

         14. Poorly-controlled diabetes mellitus, defined as hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) &gt;12%.

         15. Unsuitable for cellular therapy for any reason, in the opinion of the Investigator.

         16. Planned use of cell therapy or amniotic membrane treatment for the index ulcer during
             study participation.

         17. Significant titer of antibodies to HLA Class I molecules expressed on Corlicyte MSCs,
             as measured by Luminex HLA single antigen beads.

         18. Presence of severe peripheral artery disease (PAD) defined as clinical evidence of
             critical limb ischemia (CLI) during Screening.
