  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib, open label clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and
      antitumor activities of IN10018 as monotherapy and in combination with cobimetinib in
      subjects with metastatic uveal melanoma and NRAS-mutant metastatic melanoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with metastatic uveal melanoma (UM) or with NRAS-mutant metastatic melanoma will be
      enrolled.

      IN10018 will be assessed firstly as monotherapy, and then in combination with cobimetinib.
