  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a standardized assessment for patients treated for
      venous malformations (VM).

      Venous malformations result from the abnormal development of veins which may result in pain,
      swelling, bleeding, functional impairment, disfigurement, and psychological distress. The
      impact of VM on patient quality of life varies based on the location and size of the
      malformation.

      A patient reported outcome (PRO) is a patient's own account of patient's health condition.
      PRO measures are valued to clinicians, as many treatment effects are known only to the
      patient. No studies to date have analyzed the validity of existing PRO measures for VM
      patients.

      Current assessment does not include all symptoms or take in to account the relevance of VM
      location. Past studies show a discrepancy between treatment outcomes reported by patients and
      physicians. Therefore, there is a need to develop VM-specific PROs to better understand the
      effectiveness and benefits of treatment for VM.
