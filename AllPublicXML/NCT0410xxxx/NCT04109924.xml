  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well TAS-102, irinotecan, and bevacizumab work in treating
      patients with pre-treated colorectal cancer that has spread to other places in the body
      (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such
      as TAS-102, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Irinotecan may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Immunotherapy with bevacizumab, may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere
      with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving TAS-102, irinotecan, and
      bevacizumab may work better in treating patients with colorectal cancer compared to
      traditional chemotherapy and bevacizumab.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine the median progression free survival (PFS) benefit of leucovorin calcium,
      5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) naive patients treated with trifluridine and
      tipiracil hydrochloride (TAS-102) + irinotecan + bevacizumab as compared to historic control
      groups treated with FOLFIRI + bevacizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Estimate the objective response rate (ORR), median overall survival (OS), and adverse
      event (AE) profile.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive irinotecan intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes and bevacizumab IV over 30-90
      minutes on days 1 and 15. Patients also receive trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride
      orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 2-6 and 16-20. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6
      months for up to 2 years.
