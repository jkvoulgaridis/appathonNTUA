      Phase IIIb. Early Psoriatic Arthritis. Investigator initiated, double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, two-armed, parallel-group, single centre trial.

      The Primary Objective is to assess whether the combination of golimumab with methotrexate and
      steroids is superior to standard care (MTX monotherapy plus steroids) in reducing clinical
      disease activity in patients with early, treatment naïve PsA.

        Arthritis (CASPAR) criteria (Appendix 4) confirmed less than 24 months prior to screening.

        Subjects with active PsA defined as the presence of at least 3/68 tender and at least 3/66
        swollen joints or 2 swollen and 2 tender joints plus one affected entheseal site (Achilles
        tendon and/or plantar fascia) at baseline.

        form. Women of childbearing potential or men capable of fathering children must be using
        adequate birth control measures (eg, abstinence, oral contraceptives, intrauterine device,
        barrier method with spermicide, surgical sterilization) during the study and for 6 months
        after receiving the last administration of study agent. Female subjects of childbearing
        potential must test negative for pregnancy. Female subjects must agree to not donate eggs

        of study agent.

        Patients fulfilling the following TB criteria:

        7.1. Have no history of latent or active TB prior to screening. An exception is made for
        subjects with a history of latent TB and documentation of having completed appropriate
        treatment for latent TB 3 years prior to the first administration of study agent. It is the
        responsibility of the investigator to verify the adequacy of previous antituberculous
        treatment and provide appropriate documentation.

        7.2. Have no signs or symptoms suggestive of active TB upon medical history and/or physical
        examination.

        7.3. Have had no close contact with a person with active TB or, if there has been such a
        contact, will be referred to a physician specializing in TB to undergo additional
        evaluation, and if warranted, receive appropriate treatment as if having latent TB prior to
        or simultaneously with the first administration of study agent.

        7.4. Within 6 weeks prior to the administration of study agent, either have a negative
        QuantiFERON-TB Gold test result or have a newly identified positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold
        test result in which active TB has been ruled out and for which appropriate treatment for
        latent TB has been initiated either prior to or simultaneously with the first
        administration of study agent.

        7.5. In the event of 2 indeterminate QuantiFERON-TB Gold in-tube tests results, the
        subjects will be treated as if having latent TB prior or simultaneously with the first
        administration of study agent.

        7.6. Have a chest radiograph (posterior-anterior view), read by a qualified radiologist,
        whose diagnostic assessment is consistent with no evidence of current active TB or old
        inactive TB, and taken within 12 months of the study.

        7.7. Have a screening laboratory test result as follows: 7.7.1. Hb≥8.5 g/dL or ≥5.3 mmol/L
        7.7.2. White blood cell (WBC) count ≥3.5x103 cells/uL 7.7.3. Neutrophils ≥1.5 x103 cells/uL

             (TNFi) or other biologic drugs.

        heart failure, myocardial infarction within 52 weeks from screening, unstable angina
        pectoris, uncontrolled hypertension (BP&gt;160/95), severe pulmonary disease, or history of
        human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, immunodeficiency syndromes, central nervous
        system (CNS) demyelinating events suggestive of multiple sclerosis, renal or
        gastrointestinal conditions, which in the opinion of the investigator places the patient at
        an unacceptable risk for participation in the study or would make implementation of the
        protocol difficult.

        Patients with cancer or a history of cancer (other than resected cutaneous basal cell
        carcinoma, and in situ cervical cancer) within 5 years of screening.

        urinary tract or skin (eg. Paronychia, chronic ulcers, open wounds) within 4 weeks of
        screening.

        syndrome or impaired renal function, as shown by:

        • Serum Creatinine &gt; 133 mol/L

        antibody total).

        11.1. Subjects who test positive for surface antigen (HBsAg+) are not eligible for this
        study, regardless of the results of other hepatitis B tests.

        11.2. Subjects who test negative for surface antibody (HBsAg-) and test positive for core
        antibody (anti-HBc+) and surface antibody (anti-HBs+) are eligible for this study.

        11.3. Subjects who test positive only for surface antibody (anti-HBs+) are eligible for
        this study.

        11.4. Subjects who test positive only for core antibody (anti-HBc+) must undergo further
        testing for hepatitis B deoxyribonucleic acid (HBV DNA test). If the HBV DNA test is
        positive, the subject is not eligible for this study. If the HBV DNA test is negative, the

        ability to comply with the study protocol.

        Patients with a history of any viral hepatitis within 1 year of screening Patients who have
        received or are expected to receive any live virus or bacterial vaccinations or treatments

        instilled into the bladder for the treatment of cancer) within 3 months prior to the first
        administration of study agent, during the trial, or within 6 months after the last
        administration of the study agent.
