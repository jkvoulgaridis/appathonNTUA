  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deafness significantly affects several auditory tasks of everyday life in children:
      understanding speech in quiet and noisy environments, spatial location of sounds ...

      These difficulties in locating sound sources are often ignored by parents and underestimated
      by children. Nowadays we there is specific tools to evaluate these problems in children.
      Indeed, there is a validated French questionnaire (Speech and Spatial Questionnaire SSQ) for
      adults that evaluates auditory abilities, including sound localization, in different tasks of
      daily life. Although robust, this questionnaire includes 49 questions and is too long for
      daily use in consultation. For this reason, Moulin et al validated in 2018 a short version of
      the SSQ questionnaire for adults with only 15 items.

      Based on this model, the aim of this study is to develop and test a paediatric questionnaire
      with 12 items to assess more specifically auditory difficulties in deaf children. This
      questionnaire will follow the validated frame of the adult SSQ questionnaire and will consist
      of three subscales: speech hearing (4 items), spatial hearing (4 items), and qualities of
      hearing (4 items). These 3 subscales are identical to those defined in long and short form pf
      the adult SSQ questionnaire.

    <description>This questionnaire evaluates auditive abilities (including sound localisation) in different every day life tasks, in deaf children. It is made up of 12 items ; for each item the score range is between 0 (worse outcome) and 10 (best outcome). The questionnaire is devided into 3 subscores of 4 items : speech audition, spatial audition and quality of audition.
Thanks to that tool, internal structures (internal consistency, sub-scale structure obtained by principal component analysis and cluster analysis) and psychometric values will be compared with adult versions of the questionnaire (complete and abbreviated) published in the international literature. Overall scores, scores by subscales and items will be compared.</description>
