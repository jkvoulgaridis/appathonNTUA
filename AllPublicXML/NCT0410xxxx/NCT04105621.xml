    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study of drug addicts confined in Zhejiang rehabilitation
      centers. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the association between diet and
      health status among drug addicts. The second aim is to characterize the continuous blood
      glucose response to dietary intakes over 2 weeks. The third aim is to describe the dynamic
      changes of gut microbiota at three time points in drug addicts during compulsory
      detoxification and to evaluate the association between gut microbiota, diet and addiction
      severity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over recent decades, there is a growing trend of drug addiction in China that poses great
      public health challenges. Drug abuse can lead to many health related problems such as
      malnutrition and mental disorders along with reduced quality of life. Dietary intervention
      plays a pivotal role in disease prevention and drug rehabilitation for drug addicts, but the
      associations between dietary intake and health related outcomes among drug addicts remain
      unclear.

      In addition, the relationship between the human gut microbiota and its response to addictive
      drugs as a newly arisen subject is given wide attention in recent years. However, the
      underlying mechanism requires further investigation. The dynamic changes of gut microbiota
      among drug addicts during compulsory drug rehabilitation period are in vague.

      Under the same diet exposure, different drug addicts may have different blood glucose
      responses as well as gut microbiota profiles. Therefore, in order to examine the association
      between diet, gut microbiota and drug addiction, our study design will include three
      components: (1) the measurement of dietary intake using FFQ while the menu offered by drug
      rehabilitation center and food diary; (2) the measurements of blood glucose over 2 weeks
      using continuous glucose monitors; and (3) the measurements of gut microbiota at three time
      points using 16s rRNA sequencing techniques.

    <measure>Drug craving intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 6 months after enrollment; 12 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>This was evaluated by Obsessive Compulsive Drug Use Scale (OCDUS). This scale had 13 items, each with a 5-point Likert-response (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5). Items 6 and 13 were reverse-scored. The total score ranges from 13 to 65 and a higher value represent a higher intensity of drug craving.</description>
