  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human study in health volunteers. The purpose is the local tolerability
      and systemic safety of Hemay808, which is an ointment made of a novel small molecule
      Hemay028. The safety and systemic pharmacokinetics (PK) of Hemay028 will be evaluated
      following topical application of Hemay808 to healthy volunteers.

    <textblock>
      There are two pre-test groups. Group1 use Hemay808 and placebo on sensitive areas. Group2
      will only topical use Hemay808 on 5%BSA.

      After 2 pre-test group, 4 formal testing groups will start. 1% Hemay808 apply to 25%BSA; 3%
      Hemay808 apply to 25%BSA; 3% Hemay808 apply to 55%BSA; 7% Hemay808 apply to 25%BSA. First a
      single doses then wash-out for three days, after that subjects will applicant twice daily for
      7 days to assess the local skin tolerability, and systemic PK of these treatments.

      Approximately 42 healthy adult volunteers will be enrolled in this study with 8- 10
      volunteers each cohort.
