    <measure>Quality of life measure: McGill Quality of Life survey</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>MQOL was designed to measure quality of life of people at all stages of a life-threatening illness, from diagnosis to cure or death. MQOL assesses general domains applicable to all patients, incorporates the existential domain, balances physical and non-physical aspects of quality of life, and includes both positive and negative influences on quality of life.
MQOL is a patient-reported instrument that employs 16 items plus a single-item global scale, each with a 2-day time frame. Five domains (physical well-being, physical symptoms, psychological, existential, and support) were identified through principal component analysis, and each of the domains is scored as a separate sub-scale. An overall index score can be calculated from the means of the five sub-scales. The single-item global quality of life scale is included as a validity variable but also can be used in conjunction with the overall MQOL and sub-scale scores.Each question uses a 0-10 scale with anchors at each end.</description>

    <description>Patients will complete a 60-minute exercise session once per week for 12 weeks. The exercise sessions will be individualized to the patient's needs and fitness level by a trainer. A patient will work with the same trainer throughout the study, who will plan the patient's individualized exercise regimen, and who will provide one-on-one supervision for the duration of each 60-minute session. Each 60-minute session will include cardiovascular, strength, and flexibility training. The intensity level for the aerobic exercise ranges from 30-45% of the individual's predicted VO2max, controlled by heart monitors and lasting 30 min. Strength training will involve a full body workout, with emphasis on all major muscle groups and employing machines, free weights, and resistance tubing. Patients will complete 3 sets of 10 repetitions for each strength exercise. Flexibility training will involve static stretching of all major muscle groups for 15-20 seconds at the completion of each workout.</description>

    <description>The study intervention is a supervised, individualized exercise oncology program described in previous literature2,3,12 and provided by Maple Tree Cancer Alliance, a non-profit organization providing exercise training to individuals with cancer (https://www.mapletreecanceralliance.org/). This organization was founded in 2011 and currently operates in 9 hospitals serving Ohio and Pennsylvania, offering free exercise programs and nutritional guidance to approximately 500 patients annually to help relieve side effects related to cancer treatment.</description>
