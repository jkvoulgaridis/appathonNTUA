      This observational study aims to determine the efficacy and safety of the Shark Screw®
      transplant for osteotomy and arthrodesis in hand and foot surgery.

    <textblock>
      The Shark Screw® transplant (surgebright GmbH) is a human cortical bone allograft for
      osteosynthesis and can replace metal or bioabsorbable devices in various procedures. In
      total, the clinical records from 32 patients who had undergone surgical procedure at the hand
      or foot between October 2016 and January 2018 with the use of a Shark Screw® transplant for
      joint arthrodesis or for the stabilization of osteotomies serve as data sources for this
      study. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Shark Screw®
      transplant in hand and foot surgery by analyzing the recovery, wound and bone healing
      process.
