  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To identify biomarkers of common eye diseases based on single-cell sequencing technologies
      using PBMC samples. These diseases include uveitis, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular
      degeneration and polypoid choroidal vasculopathy. Our study may provide new insight into the
      underlying mechanisms, and reveal novel predictors and intervention targets for the
      diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of these diseases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pathogenesis of common eye diseases such as uveitis (including Behcet's disease (BD) and
      Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (VKH)), diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular
      degeneration (AMD) and polypoid choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) remains unknown. Although
      immunosuppressants, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents, and pars plana
      vitrectomy (PPV) have been widely used for treatment, the current therapeutic options are
      limited. In addition, there is a lack of biomarkers to indicate the prognosis and treatment
      response of these diseases. The aim of this study is to identify biomarkers and to provide a
      new target for individualized diagnosis and treatment of common eye diseases based on single
      cell sequencing technology.
