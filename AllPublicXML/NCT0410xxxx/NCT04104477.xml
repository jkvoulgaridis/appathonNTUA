    <textblock>
      This study examines carpometacarpal osteoarthritis (CMC OA) and aims to elucidate the
      biomechanical, neuromuscular, and somatosensory mechanisms that contribute to CMC OA symptoms
      by using orthopaedic biomechanics and quantitative pain testing. Completion of this study
      will provide a comprehensive dataset describing how movement strategies (muscle activity and
      joint posture) as well as experimental and clinical pain differ between individuals with CMC
      OA and age-matched controls.

    <description>GCPS grades the severity of chronic pain in the general population. GCPS is a seven question survey which yields a &quot;Characteristic Pain Intensity&quot; score and an overall &quot;Disability&quot; score providing insight into global pain severity. Answers are plotted on a scale from 0-10; with 0 being 'no pain' and 10 being 'pain as bad as could be' or 'extreme.'</description>
