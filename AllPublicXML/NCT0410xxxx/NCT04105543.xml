  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study of the use of an investigational drug that selectively delivers
      radiation to malignant tumor cells, CLR 131, in combination with external beam radiation
      therapy (EBRT) in subjects with locoregionally recurrent head and neck cancer. The trial will
      enroll up to 24 participants who are amenable to retreatment with radiation therapy.
      Participants who also have distant metastatic disease may be enrolled on this clinical trial,
      but they must have evaluable disease that will be clinically treated with radiation therapy,
      as per standard of care. All participants will receive a dosimetry test dose of CLR 131 to
      establish drug uptake by the tumor and enable Monte Carlo dose estimation based on CLR 131
      SPECT/CT imaging evaluation. Participants showing uptake will receive a cumulative tumor dose
      of 60-70 Gy using personalized dose calculation (via Monte Carlo methods) of CLR 131 combined
      with external beam radiation.

             systemic disease.

             lesion that is amenable to radiation therapy.
