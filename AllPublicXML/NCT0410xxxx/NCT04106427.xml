  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial testing the effects of 10
      sessions of continuous theta burst stimulation and the effects of 16 sessions of social
      cognitive remediation therapy on gesture performance and nonverbal communication skills in
      schizophrenia
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study focuses on nonverbal communication skills in schizophrenia. The trial will test,
      whether the combination of noninvasive brain stimulation and group psychotherapy will improve
      gesture performance and thus nonverbal communication in schizophrenia
