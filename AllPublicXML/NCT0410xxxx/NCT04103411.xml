  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of persons with hypertension is increasing and with it the number of related
      cardiovascular events and related functional or cognitive declines. While studies have
      suggested that physical activity, in particular, high-intensity interval training (HIIT),
      could be as efficient as the commonly used antihypertensive medications, no studies have
      actually compared their effects in the same population. This protocol will determine if HIIT
      is at least as efficient as hydrochlorothiazide in order to lower 24h-ambulatory blood
      pressure (BP) in prehypertensive older adults.
