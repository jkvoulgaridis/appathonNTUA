    <textblock>
      Numerous studies describing surgical treatments to preserve hip replacements has several
      controversies and none of these procedures are universally accepted nor have compelling
      evidence for osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). With developing a newly approach
      osteonecrotic device surgical procedure to support the regeneration of necrotic bone and
      articular cartilage in vivo, this will be the first randomized-controlled feasibility study
      to determine its safety in ONFH patients.

      Total of 20 patients were enrolled and randomized in this study. There are two groups, 10
      patients in osteonecrotic device group; 10 incore decompression group. After their baseline
      data has been collected and their surgical procedure has been completed, the following
      postoperative data collection are then continued to 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, one year,
      and two years' prior from the start of their surgery, in order to understand the new approach
      of the osteonecrotic device's safety in comparison to the core decompression surgical
      procedure.

    <description>A biphasic osteochrondral composite method to support the regeneration of articular cartilage in vivo. With its concept that could be securely installed by press-fit without additional fixation, this approach can present an alternative to perform graft harvest and implantation in a single surgery.</description>

    <description>Core decompression is a common surgical procedure that aims to improve vascular inflow by decreasing intraosseous pressure in the femoral head. It is performed that involves removing a cylindrical core of bone from the proximal femur.</description>
