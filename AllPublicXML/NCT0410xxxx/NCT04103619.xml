  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. To establish clinical efficacy, safety and patient satisfaction of reducing lower eyelid
           convexities or &quot;bags&quot; and/or malar crescents (festoons) with catheter-based injectable
           RF (InMode AccuTite) and variable depth Fractional RF Microneedle skin rejuvenation
           (InMode Morpheus8).

        2. To determine the relative effectiveness of dual-modality treatment (AccuTite + Morphues8
           initial treatment followed by two consecutive Morpheus8 treatments 1 month apart) versus
           single modality treatment (AccuTite only)

    <textblock>
      This prospective study is intended to evaluate the efficacy of radio frequency energy in
      reducing lower eyelid convexities or &quot;bags&quot; and/or malar crescents (festoons) with RFAL
      (InMode AccuTite) and variable depth Fractional RF resurfacing skin rejuvenation (InMode
      Morpheus8).

        1. 15 patients will receive AccuTite treatment only (7-8 patients per arm at each of the
           two study sites)

        2. 15 patients will receive AccuTite and Morpheus8 treatment and additional 2 monthly
           Morpheus8 treatments (7-8 patients per arm at each of the two study sites) Treatment
           areas include: periorbital zones with Morpheus8/Lower Eyelid with Accutite
