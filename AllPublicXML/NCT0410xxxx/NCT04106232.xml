  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to evaluate the microbiome of chronically constipated patients as compared
      to those with a non-constipated gastrointestinal system.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Biogeographically accurate microbiome sampling using the HyGIeaCare platform and an
      evolutionary biology informed learning platform will allow an improved discovery of
      bacterially derived novel molecular entities with therapeutic potential for chronic
      constipation. This approach intends to enhance our ability to understand the gut microbiome
      and use it towards developing therapeutic solutions, in comparison to traditional collection
      methods and taxonomic-based data analysis approaches.

      Overall, we expect to enroll 20 subjects. Each volunteer or patient will provide a
      traditional stool sample (&quot;spot sample&quot;), collected in their home. During the HyGIeaCare
      prep, we will collect up to 3 samples from each patient (unless we will need an &quot;initial&quot; one
      from the constipated population).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient's age is between 18 and 80 years old.

          2. For the healthy population - Indication for age-appropriate colorectal cancer
             screening colonoscopy

          3. Adequate capacity to consent to study

          4. Patient does not have any known health issues, except for chronic constipation for the
             &quot;chronic constipation&quot; population.

          5. Patient has not taken antibiotics within the last three (3) months.

          6. For chronically constipated patients - &gt;3 months of symptomatic constipation with
             first onset of constipation more than 6 months ago.

        For chronically constipated patients - Diagnosis of functional constipation by Modified
        Rome IV Diagnostic Criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has functional bowel disorders characterized by alternating bowel habits
             (diarrhea/constipation).

          2. Patient has any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, may
             adversely affect the compliance or safety of the patient or would limit the patient's
             ability to complete the study.

          3. Current, or recent (within three months) antibiotic usage

             Patient has any of the contraindications listed below:

          4. Cardiac: Congestive heart failure (NYHA class III or IV or EF &lt;50%)

          5. GI: Intestinal perforation, carcinoma of the rectum, fissures or fistula, severe
             hemorrhoids, abdominal hernia, recent colon or rectal surgery, or abdominal surgery

          6. GU: Renal insufficiency (CC &lt; 60 ml/min/173m2), cirrhosis with ascites

          7. Abdominal surgery within the last 6 months

          8. Pregnancy
