  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genetic differences in taste are believed to play an important role in food selection,
      especially for strong-tasting foods and beverages. The overall goal of this project is to
      better understand how genes that control food preferences differ among people and whether
      saliva composition and oral health are related to these differences.

      This study examines the effects of a daily cranberry extract oral rinse on salivary protein
      responses and the oral microbiome (as a proxy measure of oral health). The study will be
      conducted in healthy adults who are presumably at high-risk (non-tasters of PROP; homozygous
      recessive for tas2R38 gene) or low-risk (super-taster of PROP; homozygous dominant for
      tas2R38 gene) of oral disease.

      The specific aims are to determine if the use of cranberry polyphenol extract rinse will:

        1. alter the oral microbial profile

        2. induce changes in the salivary protein response

        3. be associated with changes in taste and flavor perception

      Participants will be screened for good overall and oral health (see inclusion/exclusion
      criteria below). Each subject's period of participation will be 2 weeks. Days 1-3 of the
      study is a run-in period. Subjects rinse with spring water 2-times/day (after brushing their
      teeth in the morning and evening). During days 4-14, subjects will rinse in a similar manner
      with a solution of cranberry-derived polyphenol extract (CPE) in spring water. Saliva will be
      collected from subjects in a brief session (10 min) on Days 3 and Day 14. Saliva samples will
      be analyzed for salivary proteins and microbial profile analysis. The purpose of this
      analysis is to measure the relative ratios of beneficial vs. disease-causing microbes in the
      mouth using 16S RNA sequencing. On each of the testing days, subjects will also evaluate food
      samples for standard taste and flavor attributes.

    <description>Taste and Flavor intensity ratings of cranberry juice samples will be collected 3 days after control intervention and then at the end of the experimental intervention.

    <description>Saliva will be collected 3 days after control intervention and then at the end of the experimental intervention. Samples will be analyzed via LCMS to establish proteomic composition before and after the intervention. Specifically, area of the ion current peaks (XIC peaks) generated will be used as a relative quantity of the salivary protein levels. The XIC peaks are proportional to the concentration of salivary proteins under constant conditions and will be used to understand the effect of the intervention on salivary protein levels.</description>

    <description>Salivary samples will be collected 3 days after control intervention and then at the end of the experimental intervention. Samples will be analyzed for microbial composition via 16S rRNA sequencing and data used to understand changes in microbial diversity before and after the intervention. Specifically operational taxonomic units will be identified and classified at the genera level.</description>
