        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Is scheduled to undergo a unilateral open inguinal herniorrhaphy with mesh under
             general anesthesia

          -  Has an American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status of I, II, or III

          -  Female subjects are eligible only if not pregnant, not lactating, not planning to
             become pregnant during the study, sterile,or using acceptable contraceptives.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Had any prior inguinal hernia repair

          -  Has a planned concurrent surgical procedure

          -  Has other pre existing concurrent acute or chronic painful physical/restrictive
             condition expected to require analgesic treatment in the postoperative period for pain

          -  Has a contraindication or a known or suspected history of hypersensitivity or
             clinically significant idiosyncratic reaction to required study medications

          -  Has known or suspected daily use of opioids for 7 or more consecutive days within the
             previous 6 months.

          -  Has taken any NSAIDs within least 10 days prior to the scheduled surgery

          -  Has taken opioids within 24 hours prior to the scheduled surgery (3 days for
             long-acting)

          -  Has been administered bupivacaine within 5 days prior to the scheduled surgery.

          -  Has initiated treatment with medications within 1 month prior to study drug
             administration that can impact pain control.

          -  Has been administered systemic steroids within 5 half-lives or 10 days prior to
             administration of study drug

          -  Has a medical condition such that, in the opinion of the Investigator, participating
             in the study would pose a health risk to the subject or confound the postoperative
             assessments

             Hepatitis C

             surgery, or a recent history of alcohol abuse. Note: Subjects with a positive drug
             screen who are taking an allowed, prescribed medication that is known to result in a
             positive drug test (eg, amphetamine and dextroamphetamine for
             attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, benzodiazepine for anxiety disorder) may be
             eligible for participation in the study. Subjects taking medical marijuana are not
             allowed to participate in the study.

          -  Received an investigational product or device in a clinical trial within 30 days or
             within 5 elimination half-lives

          -  Has undergone 3 or more surgeries within 12 months
