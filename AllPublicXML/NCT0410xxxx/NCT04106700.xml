  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interventional, no-randomized, open-label, and single arm multicentre study of apixaban for
      the prevention of thromboembolic events during induction therapy in transplant-eligible
      patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who receive bortezomib, thalidomide, and
      dexamethasone (VTD) during the induction phase of therapy prior to autologous stem cell
      transplantation (ASCT). The current study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      apixaban during the induction period. Efficacy will be defined as a composite endpoint of
      acute symptomatic proximal and distal deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, VTE related
      deaths, and acute ischemic stroke.

      This study is designed to test the efficacy and safety of the oral anti factor Xa apixaban
      2.5 mg given twice daily as a prophylaxis of VTE in transplant-eligible patients with
      multiple myeloma during the induction therapy with VTD.

      Induction therapy prior to ASCT will consist in no less than 4 and no more than 6 cycles of
      VTD, depending on treatment response. Duration of each cycle is 4 weeks if there is not any
      disease or treatment-related complication; therefore, treatment duration will be around 4-6
      months. Daily Prophylaxis with apixaban will continue up to a maximum of 14 days after the
      last dose of thalidomide. In addition, there will be an additional observation period of 14
      (Â± 7) days, starting the day after the last dose of study medication (until 28 days after the
      end of the last cycle of VTD).
