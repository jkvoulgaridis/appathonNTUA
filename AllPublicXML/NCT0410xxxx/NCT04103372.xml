  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicentre, prospective, randomised, feasibility trial aims to change UK practice by
      enabling more patients with early rectal cancer to safely undergo local excision rather than
      major surgery thus maintaining quality of life without compromising survival outcomes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The national bowel cancer screening programme (BCSP) has shown an increase in detection rates
      of early rectal cancer (ERC). This is treated effectively with radical surgery, offering
      excellent oncological outcome, but has a major impact on patient quality of life. The
      diagnosis of early stage rectal cancer, allows an opportunity for effective oncological
      treatment, with preservation of the rectum avoiding the deleterious effects of unselective
      use of radical surgery and unselected use of radiotherapy. Our previous work has led to
      High-Spatial-Resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the established modality for
      providing reliable information about extramural disease prior to radical surgery.

      This trial will use a new MRI staging protocol to identify more patients with early rectal
      cancer to enable accurate mapping for more precise patient selection for local excision.
      Improved success with local excision will result in greater rates of organ preservation.

          -  Rectal lesion as defined on MRI/Endoscopy. (If patients are registered at endoscopy
             and later found, on MRI, not to have a rectal ERC, they should be withdrawn from the
             study)

          -  Over 18 years of age

          -  Of adequate performance status to be able to undergo surgery if necessary

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  are requiring neoadjuvant therapy for MRI-staged advanced rectal cancer

          -  have metastatic disease

          -  have a second malignancy where there is &lt;95% certainty of survival from the treated
             disease

          -  are unable to consent or withhold consent

          -  have biopsy-proven malignancy which is not adenocarcinoma (Patients do not need to
             have had a biopsy prior to registration. However, if after excision the ERC is found
             to either not be an adenocarcinoma or be benign, the patient should be withdrawn from
             the study.)
