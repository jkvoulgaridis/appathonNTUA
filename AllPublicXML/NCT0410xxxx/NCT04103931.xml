  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will evaluate the impact of a patient decision aid created by the American
      College of Cardiology for patients considering treatment of aortic stenosis. The decision aid
      describes surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) surgery and transcatheter valve
      replacement surgery (TAVR).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pilot trial will enroll patients who are coming in to see a valve specialist (cardiac
      surgeon or interventional cardiologist) to discuss treatment options for aortic stenosis. The
      study will recruit approximately 120 patients at Massachusetts General Hospital or at the
      UCHealth Heart and Vascular Center, Anschutz Medical in Denver, Colorado and randomly assign
      them to usual care arm or decision aid arm. The decision aid will be given to the participant
      in clinic at the time of their appointment. Patient participants in both arms will be asked
      to complete a short survey after the visit. The survey will assess knowledge, treatment
      preference, shared decision making (SDM), and decisional conflict. Analyses will compare the
      two arms on these outcomes to generate preliminary data on impact of the intervention.
