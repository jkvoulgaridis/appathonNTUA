  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve our understanding of the experience of music therapy
      by cancer patients with delirium, and the experience of music therapists working with these
      patients. The researchers are focusing on patients with delirium because of the challenging
      symptoms of this condition.

      At MSK, music therapy is routinely used in patients with cancer. Music therapy sessions are
      done at the patient's bedside, where the music therapist plays live music on a guitar,
      keyboard, harp, or percussion instrument, sometimes as accompaniment to singing.
