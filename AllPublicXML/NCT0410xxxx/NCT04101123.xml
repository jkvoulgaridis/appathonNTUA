      Aim of this study is to investigate the influence of social factors on participation and
      activity among children and adolescents aged 10-18 years with leukemia, brain tumors, and
      sarcomas. Furthermore personal and treatment-related factors and their impact on
      participation will be explored

      Background: About 2000 children and adolescents under the age of 18 develop cancer each year
      in Germany. Because of more differentiated diagnostics and standardized treatment protocols,
      a high survival rate can be reached for many types of the disease. Nevertheless, patients
      face a number of long-term effects related to the treatment. As a result, physical and
      psychological consequences have increasingly become the focus of research in recent years.
      Social dimensions of health have rarely been investigated in pediatric oncology so far. Yet,
      there are no robust results that allow an estimation of whether and to what extent the
      disease and treatment impair the participation of children and adolescents and which factors
      mediate this effect. Social participation is of great importance especially because
      interactions with peers and experiences in different areas of life are essential for the
      development of children and adolescents.

      Methods: Data are collected in a longitudinal, prospective, observational multicenter study.
      For this purpose, all patients and their parents who are being treated for cancer in one of
      the participating clinics throughout Germany will be interviewed within the first month after
      diagnosis (t1), after completion of intensive treatment (t2) and half a year after the end of
      intensive treatment (t3) using standardized questionnaires. Analysis will be done by
      descriptive and multivariate methods.

      Recruitment: Patients will be consecutively recruited in one of the participating clinics
      throughout Germany.
