      The hypothesis of this clinical investigation is that in a population of men and women
      affected by periocular wrinkles, lip contour wrinkles or deep facial wrinkles, will
      cross-linked hyaluronic acid (Janesse) significantly decrease the appearance of facial
      wrinkles, results observed after 4, 8 and 12 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Janesse®'s action is to increase the volume of dermal-epidermal tissue based on the natural
      ability of hydrophilic hyaluronic acid molecules to bind to an amount of water many times
      greater than their weight. This allow to fill the intradermal spaces and integrate the
      intercellular matrix, conferring turgidity to the tissues. The cross-linking of the
      hyaluronic acid contained in the product has the effect of more stable and durable filling
      over time.

      The Research Question of the present study is the following: in a population of men and women
      affected by periocular wrinkles, lip contour wrinkles or deep facial wrinkles, will
      cross-linked hyaluronic acid (Janesse®) significantly decrease the appearance of nasolabial
      wrinkles, results observed after 12 weeks?
