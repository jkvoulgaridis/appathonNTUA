    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about possible changes in cognitive (mental) abilities,
      such as memory skills and concentration, and in brain anatomy (structure) and function, in
      people with lymphoma receiving CAR-T therapy.

    <description>correlations of neurocognitive scores with the FACIT-FS (fatigue) scale score The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue Subscale, Version 4 (FACITFS V-4 56, is a 13-item questionnaire designed to assess symptoms and concerns specific to the QOL of patients with fatigue [66]. The questionnaire asks respondents to indicate the extent to which each item applied to them over &quot;the past 7 days&quot; using a 5-point Likert-type response format ranging from &quot;0 - Not at all&quot; to &quot;4 - Very much&quot;. The 13 items produce the Fatigue Subscale (FS) score (range 0 - 52).</description>

             lymphoma, and primary mediastinum B-cell lymphoma

          -  Planned treatment with commercially approved CD19-specific CART cells (e.g.

             brain MRI, either at the time of enrollment or during the study period.
