  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary intake of galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) may have beneficial effects on host health
      by affecting the microbiota composition and -activity. So far studies focused on analyses in
      fecal samples, while the primary site of carbohydrate fermentation is the proximal colon. To
      date, no studies have been performed in humans on the more proximal microbiota and the impact
      of fermentable carbohydrates. Further insights on the more proximal colonic microbiota would
      aid to targeted approaches to improve intestinal health. Therefore, we aim to study the
      effect of GOS on the intestinal microbiota composition and -activity in healthy adults, by
      sampling the more proximal human colon in a physiological condition. The primary objective of
      this study is to investigate the impact of four weeks GOS supplementation on intestinal
      microbiota composition and -activity, by sampling the proximal part of the human colon in a
      physiological condition. Furthermore, this study has four secondary objectives: First, to
      compare the intestinal microbiota composition and -activity of the proximal colon vs. distal
      colon at baseline and after four weeks GOS supplementation. Second, compare the luminal
      microbiota composition vs. mucosa adherent microbiota composition of the proximal vs. distal
      colon at baseline and after four weeks GOS supplementation. Third, monitor the effects of
      four weeks GOS supplementation on gastrointestinal symptoms. The study conforms to a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design. Study population includes
      healthy human volunteers (male and female), 18-50 years of age. One intervention arm will
      include 7.2 grams of Vivinal® GOS Powder three times daily for four weeks. The other
      intervention arm subjects will receive placebo product (7.2 grams maltodextrin) three times
      daily for four weeks. At the start and end of the intervention period, several measurements
      will take place. The main study parameter is the change in microbial composition and
      -activity induced by GOS intervention.

    <measure>Microbial composition, as determined by state of the art (e.g. HiSeq) sequencing of 16S rRNA genes in colonic luminal/fecal samples and biopsies.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to four weeks supplementation</time_frame>
    <description>Total DNA will be extracted from fecal, small intestinal fluid and biopsy samples using the repeated bead-beating method. This method has been optimized and standardized for the extraction of total bacterial DNA from human fecal samples. Isolated DNA will be used for amplification of the V4 region of the collective 16S rRNA genes using barcoded primers, while fecal and intestinal DNA as target. Afterwards, the NG-Tax pipeline will be used for microbiota profiling. A variety of programs, such as R, and in house scripts will be used for bioinformatics analyses and multivariate statistics.</description>

    <measure>Microbial activity as determined by metatranscriptomics using RNA in colonic luminal samples and biopsies.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to four weeks supplementation</time_frame>
    <description>Microbiota activity profiling will be performed by metatranscriptomics. In short, RNA will be isolated from the luminal samples, followed by removal of rRNA and subsequent conversion of residual RNA into cDNA. The cDNA will serve as target for paired-end HiSeq sequencing. Obtained sequence reads will be phylogenetically and functionally annotated as described before. Dedicated R-scripts as well as programs such as iPath will be used for bioinformatic analyses, including metabolic mapping, and interpretation to determine which bacterial group is performing what activities. In addition, key metabolites of saccharolytic and protein fermentation (such as (branched) chain fatty acids) will be assessed by High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).</description>
