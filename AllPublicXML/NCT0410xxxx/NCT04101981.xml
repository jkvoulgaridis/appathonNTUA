  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possible application of metabolomics
      to identify follicular fluid changes in cancer patients undergoing fertility preservation.
      Although metabolomics have been applied already in cancer studies, this is the first
      application on follicular fluid of cancer patients.

      Methods: The investigators selected for the study 10 patients with breast cancer and lymphoma
      who resorted to oocyte cryopreservation to preserve fertility and 10 healthy women undergoing
      in vitro fertilization treatments. Follicular fluid was collected at the time of oocytes
      retrieval. Metabolomic analysis of follicular fluids was performed by 1H NMR spectroscopy in
      combination with multivariate analysis to interpret the spectral data. Univariate statistical
      analysis was applied to find correlations between patients' features and metabolites
      identified by NMR.

    <description>The oocytes retrieval was performed after 34-36 hours from hCG administration . The collection of cumulus-oocyte complexes and FFs were performed via transvaginal ultrasound-guided aspiration with a needle of 18 gauge of diameter. The three major diameter follicles were identified by intraoperative ultrasound and FF of each follicle was collected in its own test tube.</description>
