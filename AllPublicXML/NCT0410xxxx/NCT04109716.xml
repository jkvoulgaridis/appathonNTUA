    <textblock>
      This school-based randomized controlled trial will: a) examine the effectiveness of school
      counselor-delivered Interpersonal Psychotherapy-Adolescent Skills Training (IPT-AST), an
      evidence-based depression prevention program, as compared to services as usual (SAU) on
      social processes and emotional and school outcomes, b) examine moderators and mediators of
      intervention effects, and c) assess the costs, cost-effectiveness, acceptability,
      feasibility, fidelity, and sustainability of IPT-AST.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial that will take place in local high schools. Counselors
      within each school will be randomly assigned to deliver Interpersonal
      Psychotherapy-Adolescent Skills Training (IPT-AST), or services as usual (SAU). IPT-AST
      counselors will be trained to deliver IPT-AST and will receive ongoing consultation to
      promote intervention fidelity. Adolescents with elevated depressive symptoms will be
      identified and randomly assigned to IPT-AST or SAU. The research team will use longitudinal
      data collection with adolescents, parents, and counselors, and will collect data from
      teachers and school records to achieve study objectives.

      Participants will be 240 racially and ethnically diverse students in the 9th and 10th grades
      between the ages of 14 and 17 with elevated symptoms of depression and their parents.
      Counselors in local high schools will also be study participants. A subset of counselors,
      teachers, and administrators will also participate in a qualitative interview as part of an
      implementation study.

      Adolescent participants will be randomly assigned to IPT-AST, an evidence-based depression
      prevention program, or SAU which may include supportive counseling and/or referral for
      services.

      Standardized measures for adolescents, parents, and teachers and school records will be used
      to examine emotional outcomes (e.g., depression and anxiety symptoms, depression diagnoses)
      and school outcomes (e.g., school engagement, grades). Investigators will utilize
      standardized measures to assess social processes (e.g., interpersonal conflict, social
      functioning) that may mediate the effects of the intervention on these emotional and school
      outcomes. Investigators will also collect data on services received in IPT-AST and SAU,
      techniques utilized in both conditions, and feasibility, acceptability, fidelity,
      sustainability, and costs of IPT-AST using session logs, time diaries, standardized measures,
      counselor- and consultant-rated fidelity checklists, and qualitative interviews.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Interpersonal Psychotherapy-Adolescent Skills Training (IPT-AST) is an indicated group depression prevention program. In IPT-AST, adolescents learn communication (e.g., using I statements, striking while the iron is cold) and interpersonal problem-solving strategies and apply these strategies to their relationships to decrease conflict, increase social support, and improve overall social functioning. IPT-AST consists of 2 individual pre-group sessions, 1 mid-group session, 8 weekly group sessions, and up to 6 individual booster sessions. Parents are invited to attend the mid-group session so the adolescents can apply the interpersonal strategies in a conversation with a parent. The purpose of the booster sessions is to monitor symptoms and apply the interpersonal strategies to current stressors. These sessions are designed to help solidify the interpersonal skills and address current problems before they result in a worsening of symptoms.</description>

    <description>Investigators anticipate that counselors in SAU will see youth in the study for brief, periodic sessions and/or will refer youth for treatment in the community. Counselors will be permitted to see the adolescents as often as they would like throughout the course of the study (up to 15-months post-baseline). Investigators will ask counselors to complete a form each time they see a teen, noting the length of the session, whether the session was scheduled or not, and the topics discussed.</description>
