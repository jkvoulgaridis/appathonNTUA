  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, controlled, open-label, prospective, single-center phase II
      clinical study. Target population is patients with stage II and IIIA resectable non-small
      cell lung cancer who had not received systemic chemotherapy. Study objective is to evaluate
      the major pathologic response of SHR-1210 + carboplatin + paclitaxel-albumin in subjects with
      resectable non-small cell lung cancer. SHR-1210 is a humanized anti-PD1 IgG4 monoclonal
      antibody.

      In this study, eligible subject will be randomized into study arm or control arm to accept
      study treatment. Subjects who randomized into control will have the opportunity to receive
      the treatment of carboplatin + paclitaxel-albumin therapy after confirmed disease
      progression. Treatment cycles of chemotherapy will be 2.
