  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: lupus is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease with autoantibodies formation. Lupus
      nephritis carries the worst prognosis. C1q deficiency correlates with activity and renal
      involvement and may help in its evaluation. Therapies include plasma exchange, immune
      adsorption and recently under evaluation, hemodiafiltration with on-line endogenous re
      infusion (HFR), in addition to traditional immunosuppressive therapies. Aim: is to evaluate
      the role of HFR in improving signs and symptoms of SLE activity and laboratory parameters not
      responding to traditional immune suppressive therapy
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Settings and design: A controlled clinical study was conducted on group A, sixty patients
      with lupus in activity subdivided into cases 1, 47 patients, who received traditional medical
      treatment and cases 2 group, 13 patients, who underwent HFR in addition to medical treatment.
      And group B that consisted of two subgroups, control 1, 20 healthy age and sex matched
      volunteers and control 2, 10 cases with different glomerular diseases other than lupus.

      Methods and materials: Serum c1q was done before and after the HFR as well as induction by
      medical treatment. Disease activity assessed using SLEDAI-2K with responder index - 50,
      quality of life assessed using SLEQOL v2, and HFR was performed for the non-responder group.

      The study will be conducted in Alexandria University Hospitals in compliance with the
      Declaration of Helsinki; the ethical committee of the investigator's faculty will be
      requested to approve the protocol and the patients will be requested to give informed
      consent.
