  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Linear growth failure, a manifestation of chronic undernutrition in early childhood, is a
      recalcitrant problem in resource constrained settings. The underlying causes of growth
      failure are multifactorial, but persistent and recurrent infection and inflammation of the
      gastrointestinal tract and immune activation, a condition commonly referred to as
      environmental enteropathy, is an important contributor. A highly enriched 13C-Sucrose Breath
      Test, a measure of sucrase-isomaltase activity, will be evaluated as a non-invasive biomarker
      of environmental enteropathy, and more specifically of intestinal brush border enzyme
      activity in 6 resource poor countries (Bangladesh, India, Jamaica, Kenya, Peru and Zambia) in
      100 volunteers aged 12-15 months (total n=600) and evaluated relative to the lactose rhamnose
      test and linear and ponderal growth over a 3-6 month period following biomarker assessment.
      Field usability will also be assessed.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Environmental enteropathy is associated with linear and ponderal growth shortfalls in young
      children in resource constrained settings. However, the physiological alterations of
      intestinal function that accompany both the demonstrable evidence of inflammation and
      architectural changes seen in biopsies from effected children have yet to be elucidated, and
      this knowledge gap limits the development of effective strategies to optimally manage the
      condition. Furthermore, a limited number of non-invasive assays exist with which to assess
      the presence of environmental enteropathy in low resource settings. This study aims 1) to
      determine if sucrose-isomaltase enzyme is altered in children with environmental enteropathy
      by using a 13C-Sucrose breath test 2) to determine if the test is able to be employed in
      resource limited settings.
