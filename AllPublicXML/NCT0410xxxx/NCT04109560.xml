  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) enables delivering humidified gas at high-flow rates
      controlling the oxygen inspired fraction (FiO2). Its efficacy has been demonstrated in
      hypoxemic acute respiratory failure. However, little is known about its use in hypercapnic
      acute respiratory failure (ARF). Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effect of using HFNC
      through &quot;Precision Flow&quot; equipment as first line of ventilatory support for COPD patients
      with hypercapnic acute respiratory failure.

    <description>Discomfort related to the high flow oxygen therapy and related to the degree of humidification will be assessed by using a numerical rating scale from 1 (no discomfort) to 5 (maximum imaginable discomfort). Patients will be asked to rate their discomfort with the used device and discomfort symptoms will be determined for the dryness of the delivered oxygen (dryness of the mouth, throat, nose, difficulty to swallow and throat pain).</description>
