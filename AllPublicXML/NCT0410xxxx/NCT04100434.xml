  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is an open-label, multicenter, and randomized study(five hospitals).The purpose of
      this study is to assess the differences in the effects of the evolocumab added to
      moderate-intensity statin therapy and the moderate-intensity statin only therapy on the
      regulation of LDL-C levels in patients with acute phase acute coronary syndrome after four
      weeks of treatment, and to evaluate the major cardiovascular adverse events (death,
      cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for ACS recurrence,
      hospitalization for heart failure, coronary revascularization and stroke) in patients with
      ACS for 4 weeks and 1 year.
