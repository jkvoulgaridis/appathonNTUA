  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute cerebral infarction is a common type of ischemic stroke, causing brain dysfunction in
      patients with high morbidity and disability. With the changes in people's diet, lifestyle
      patterns and population aging, the incidence of acute cerebral infarction has increased year
      by year, which has become an important cause of disability and death in middle-aged and
      elderly patients. Therefore, it is of great significance to society and individuals to carry
      out in-depth research on new ideas for the treatment of cerebral infarction and to reduce the
      disability and mortality of patients.Acute cerebral infarction leads to damage of the
      corticospinal tract, which can cause severe limb paralysis, seriously affecting the patients'
      prognosis and daily activities, and imposing a heavy burden on the patients' family and
      society.According to current research, TK plays a neuroprotective role in ischemic and
      hypoxic brain cells, and promotes the survival of nerve cells and improves the prognosis of
      patients with clinical ischemic stroke. Kallikrein is a human urokininogenase, which has been
      proven to be effective in acute ischemic stroke. Kallikrein can selectively dilate the
      arterioles in the ischemic area through the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS), reduce the infarct
      size, increase the density of blood vessels around the infarct, improve collateral
      circulation, and significantly improve the symptoms of neurological deficits in patients.
      However, to date, there is no direct evidence that Kallikrein can mediate neuroprotection and
      regeneration under conditions of ischemic injury.

      In this study, the investigators used primary cortical neuronal cells of CD-1 mice treated
      with ischemia and hypoxia, C57 black mice with MCAO, and patients with clinical acute
      ischemic stroke to try to prove the effect of Kallikrein's direct evidence on neuroprotection
      and regeneration of acute ischemic injury.

      The investigators collected 80 patients with acute cerebral infarction from July 2007 to
      March 2019 in the Department of Neurology, Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University. They
      were randomly divided into Kallikrein+standard treatment group and standard treatment group.
      And both groups were treated for 14 ± 5 days. Blood samples were collected from patients
      within 3 days of onset and after 14±5 days of treatment. Serum nerve growth markers NEFH,
      MBP, and VEGF were detected by ELISA, and two diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans were
      performed. Growth markers and imaging indicators FA and ADC values were used to evaluate the
      effect of Kallikrein on motor function recovery in clinical patients.
