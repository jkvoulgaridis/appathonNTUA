      A total of (90) patients involved in this study a randomized sampling use. The adult patient
      between (17) and (50) years of age complaining of lower back pain; and or radiculopathy and
      neurological symptoms, whom failed to respond to a (6-8) weeks period of conservative therapy
      (life style modification, NSAIDs, and physiotherapy). They are operated by Microscopic
      assisted discectomy and were followed by ODI and VAS for back pain and leg pain for 4 months
      after surgery

      A total of (90) patients involved in this study a randomized sampling use. The adult patient
      between (17) and (50) years of age complaining of lower back pain; and or radiculopathy and
      neurological symptoms, whom failed to respond to a (6-8) weeks period of conservative therapy
      (life style modification, NSAIDs, and physiotherapy). The diagnosis carried out using
      history, physical examination, MRI done for the patient to confirm the diagnosis and the
      level of disc herniation and know the direction and extend of disc herniation.Population
      excluded from study were the age group above or less the ones whom involved in the study, any
      other type of disc herniation apart from L3-L4, L4-L5, L5-S1, multilevel pathology, patients
      with spondylolisthesis, spondylolysis, patients with scoliosis and kyphosis, patients with
      cauda equina syndrome, patients with previous back surgery, and with no local infection.All
      the patients discharged on the same day of operation or a day after, mobilized soon as they
      were ready. Patient were reviewed in intervals of (2) weeks (2) months and (4) months after
      surgery using VAS for low back pain and leg pain and Oswestry disability index.

    <measure>Visual analogue score for back and leg pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Visual analogue score was assessed in all patients preoperatively and then assessed postoperatively at 2 weeks , 2 months and 4 months which showed that there is changes after operation which indicates improvement by Microdiscectomy</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analogue score for back pan and leg pain is measurement of patient feeling of pain which can be from 0 (no pain) to 10 ( severe pain )</description>

    <measure>Oswestry disability index</measure>
    <time_frame>Oswestry disability index was assessed preoperatively and postoperatively at 2 weeks , 2 months and 4 months and showed there is improvement in this index after surgery which indicates improvement with microdiscecetomy</time_frame>
    <description>Oswestry disability index is low back pain questionnaire as followingFor each section the total possible score is 5: if the first statement is marked the section score = 0; if the last statement is marked, it = 5. If all 10 sections are completed the score is calculated as follows:
Example: 16 (total scored) 50 (total possible score) x 100 = 32% If one section is missed or not applicable the score is calculated: 16 (total scored) 45 (total possible score) x 100 = 35.5% Minimum detectable change (90% confidence): 10% points (change of less than this may be attributable to error in the measurement)</description>
