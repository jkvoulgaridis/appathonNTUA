      In this study, the investigator aims to perform cortical stereo electroencephalogram (sEEG)
      recordings during simultaneous anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) recording and
      stimulation to better understand the following: 1) how the ANT is involved in various seizure
      types; 2) which cortical regions are modulated by established ANT stimulation patterns; and
      3) how novel ANT stimulation patterns modify epileptogenic cortical activity. Together, this
      knowledge will advance ANT deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy by providing a physiologic
      basis for patient selection for ANT DBS, while identifying brain signals and stimulation
      patterns that can be used to develop novel methods for ANT DBS. Up to 15 adult patients (18
      and older) who present to Duke Neurosurgery for routine seizure localization using sEEG will
      be asked to enroll in this pilot study of ANT recording and stimulation. In the course of
      surgical epilepsy treatment, patients routinely undergo surgical placement of sEEG electrodes
      for the purposes of seizure localization. During this procedure, 2 additional leads will be
      placed in the ANT. These patients remain hospitalized for 7-14 days after sEEG placement,
      during which time their seizure medications are tapered. Concurrent video monitoring is
      performed while continuous neural recordings are made through the sEEG electrodes.
      Additionally, continuous recordings will be performed through the electrodes placed in the
      thalamus. Periodically, standard intermittent high-frequency stimulation (130 Hz, 90-ms pulse
      width, and 2 mA intensity) will be performed with a 60-s on and a 300-s off cycle after
      surgery. These standard ANT stimulation parameters are employed clinically. Data will include
      the sEEG recordings marked for ANT stimulation, any side effects, medications, past medical
      history (PMH), and tests/procedures during the hospital stay. Risks involved are as described
      for the standard depth electrode surgery with the addition of the possible side effects from
      the stimulation which include sensations of numbness and tingling, and possibly increased
      seizure activity.

      The purpose of this research is to examine the physiologic underpinnings of deep brain
      stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT), a method reducing seizures in
      adults diagnosed with medically refractory epilepsy. In this study, the investigator aims to
      perform cortical stereo electroencephalogram (sEEG) recordings during simultaneous ANT
      recording and stimulation to better understand the following: 1) how the ANT is involved in
      various seizure types; 2) which cortical regions are modulated by established ANT stimulation
      patterns; and 3) how novel ANT stimulation patterns modify epileptogenic cortical activity.
      Together, this knowledge will advance ANT DBS therapy by providing a physiologic basis for
      patient selection for ANT DBS, while identifying brain signals and stimulation patterns that
      can be used to develop novel methods for ANT DBS.

      Approximately 3 million people in the United States experience epilepsy. Despite medical
      therapy, up to 30% of these patients continue to experience recurrent seizures. In this
      medically refractory population, tissue resection or ablation offer a high likelihood of
      seizure freedom, if a single epileptogenic focus can be precisely identified. For patients
      who are not candidates for resection or ablation, or those who continue to have seizures
      after these treatments, neuromodulation represents an alternative therapeutic option. One
      such therapy, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been approved for around 5 years in Europe and
      was recently approved in the United States as a treatment for medically refractory epilepsy.

      A number of potential DBS targets are being investigated, particularly, the ANT, which
      consists of the anteroventral, anterodorsal, and anteromedial nuclei. The ANT was recognized
      as a potential target because of its central connectivity to cortical regions where seizures
      often originate. Several pilot studies and recent trials have demonstrated 5-year efficacy
      and safety outcomes for ANT DBS. In a large randomized controlled study of ANT stimulation
      with long-term follow-up, there was a 56% median seizure reduction at the 2 year, and a 69%
      median and seizure reduction at the 5 year, in patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.
      This study also suggested that patients with temporal lobe epilepsy achieved greater benefit
      than those with extra-temporal or multifocal seizures. Since these pivotal trials, DBS of the
      ANT has emerged as a promising therapy for focal drug resistant epilepsy, however, its basic
      mechanism of action is unclear. One study which examined cortical local field potentials
      recordings during high-frequency ANT stimulation (130 Hz), has suggested that epileptic
      network desynchronization is a potential mechanism of DBS of the ANT.

    <description>Up to 15 adult patients who present to Duke Neurosurgery for routine seizure location using sEEG will be asked to enroll in this pilot study of ANT recording and stimulation. Once enrolled in the trial, subjects will have additional placement of two thalamic electrodes during the course of standard sEEG placement surgery. Patients routinely remain hospitalized for 7-14 days after sEEG placement, during which time their seizure medications are tapered. Continuous neural recordings are made through the sEEG electrodes for the purposes of seizure localization during the entire time the depth electrodes are in place. Up to three times daily, standard intermittent high-frequency stimulation [130 Hertz (Hz), 90-millisecond pulse width, and 2 milliamps (mA) intensity] will be performed with a 60-seconds on and a 300-seconds off cycle following surgery up to the entire length of sEEG monitoring.</description>
