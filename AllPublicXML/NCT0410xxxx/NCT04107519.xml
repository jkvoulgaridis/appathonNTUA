  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to test a pilot study that teaches resilience skills to former
      football players who experience chronic pain. The purpose of this study is to see if learning
      resilience skills makes a difference in how former players manage chronic pain. This pilot
      study may advance methods to improve the well-being and quality of life of former players
      affected by pain.

    <textblock>
      This pilot study seeks to test the efficacy of a resilience skills training intervention for
      former football players who experience chronic pain. Chronic pain threatens quality of life,
      and the culture of elite athletes is poorly adapted to the chronic condition of pain.
      Innovative strategies that are both culturally acceptable and effective are needed to address
      the needs of players who may have a reluctance to engage traditional treatment approaches.

      The overarching goal is to strengthen the capacity for former football players to maintain
      adaptive engagement in valued activities despite chronic pain. Responding to recent findings
      from the Harvard Football Player Health Study (HFPHS) that identified pain as a significant
      challenge, we propose a pilot study that tests a resilience skills training intervention with
      former football players who currently experience chronic pain.

      This proposed study builds on previous work conducted at Morehouse School of Medicine
      engaging retired professional football players and ongoing resilience intervention research
      involving veteran and community-based populations. The specific aim of this study is to test
      an intervention to decrease chronic pain and co-morbid symptoms and improve a broader
      adaptive level of functioning through Goal-Directed Resilience Training (GRIT) for chronic
      pain in a sub-sample of Atlanta-based former players.

      The investigators hypothesize the following:

        1. GRIT training intervention versus control training will be associated with reduced
           chronic pain and related symptoms of insomnia, anxiety, depression, improved emotional
           functions, and improved neurocognitive functions.

        2. Improved self-reported physical health, quality of life, personal relationships, and
           personal growth will be evident for intervention versus control participants.

      This pilot study has the potential to advance strategies to improve the well-being and
      functional status of former players impacted by pain.

Total range: There is no total range, just individual test ranges. Individual test range: individual test scores are frequency counts of correct responses or length of time taken for one subtest. There is no range.
Higher correct performance scores are better. Higher scores for taking more time are worse.
Several tests from this battery are used. These stand alone:
List Learning, Story Memory, Digit Span, Coding, List Recall, List Recognition, Story Recall. For each test the raw performance is summed and recorded and a scaled score that is found in the manual is also recorded.</description>

Total range: There is no total range, just individual test range. Individual test range: individual test range is the frequency counts of correct responses. Also counted are perseverative errors. There is no range.
Higher value of summed correct responses is better. Higher value of perseverative errors is worse. One sub-test is used from this battery: Word Generation. It stands alone. Total sub-test score is the number of correct words generated. Perseverative errors are total number of errors committed.</description>

    <measure>Resilience Resources for the Unpredictability of Chronic Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in pre-to-post scores among intervention versus control group. This scale consists of two subscales that measure the unpredictability of pain and resilient responses to pain comprised of engagement in activities, cultivating social relations, and pursuing self-growth.
Unpredictability of Chronic Pain covers inability to predict when the person will be in pain, how long it will last, how much person could not plan his activities, how much it interfered in relationships. The size of the score on this subscale will indicate the size of unpredictability of pain Resilience Resources cover three domains: (1) engagement with interest, curiosity, appreciation, noticing beauty in activities despite pain (2) pursuing relationships in showing empathy, helping, friendship, compassion (3) self-growth to pursue excellence, to grow as a person, to learn new skills to improve oneself.</description>

    <description>Time Measure of Walking. The Six minute walk test is a practical simple test that requires a 100-ft hallway but no exercise equipment or advanced training for technicians. This test measures the distance that a patient can quickly walk on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 minutes. It evaluates the global and integrated responses of all the systems involved during exercise, including the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems, systemic circulation, peripheral circulation, blood, neuromuscular units, and muscle metabolism.</description>

    <description>Changes in pre-to-post scores for blood pressure among intervention versus control group. The auscultatory method of BP measurement with a properly calibrated and validated instrument will be used. Patients will be seated quietly for at least 5 minutes in a chair rather than on an examination table, with feet on the floor and arm supported at heart level. An appropriate-sized cuff (cuff bladder encircling at least 80% of the arm) will be used to ensure accuracy. At least 2 measurements will be made. Systolic BP is the point at which the first of 2 or more sounds is heard (phase 1) and diastolic BP is the point before the disappearance of sounds (phase 5).</description>

    <description>This pilot study seeks to test the efficacy of a resilience skills training intervention for former football players who experience chronic pain. Between 20 to 48 eligible and consented participants from the Atlanta area will be identified (with a goal of 40 completing the study). They will undergo a pre-training test session and will then be randomized to either the Immediate GRIT (ImT) training intervention or the Delayed Training (DeT) control. The immediate (ImT) group will be trained for 4 weeks with 2 biweekly sessions. At the end of GRIT training they will be post-tested. The delayed (DeT) group wait during these 4 weeks and do not receive training. At the end of the 4-week waiting period, they will also be post-tested. At this point, they will be offered GRIT training for 4 weeks with 2 biweekly sessions. At the end of their training, they will be given a second post-testing. This process will then be repeated for two additional groups of 5-12 lmT and 5-12 DeT participants.</description>
