  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution is an established risk factor for
      cardiovascular (CV) morbidity.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled (sham filtration) 3-way crossover trial
      comparing the effectiveness of two strategies (bedroom-only portable indoor air filtration
      units [AFUs] use vs. 2-room AFU use) to reduce personal PM2.5 exposures and improve
      cardiometabolic health. The health benefits (primary outcome: resting BP) of both active AFU
      strategies will be evaluated over acute (4-day) and long-term (4-week) periods in 50
      nonsmoking elderly adults living in a senior facility impacted by near-roadway pollutants.
