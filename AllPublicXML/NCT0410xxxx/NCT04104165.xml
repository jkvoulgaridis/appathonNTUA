    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate what is the most effective catheterization duration to
      resolve covert and overt postpartum urinary retention following vaginal delivery and
      caesarean delivery, with the highest patients' satisfaction.

      1. Women who are unable to micturate for more than 6-8 hours following vaginal delivery or
           within six to eight hours following removal of an indwelling catheter after cesarean
           delivery (overt postpartum urinary retention), or women with postvoid residual bladder
           volume of at least 150 mL (covert postpartum urinary retention) will be randomized into
           2 groups: one group will include women who are catheterized intermittently every 6-8
           hours up to a total time of 48 hours. If at any time, post voiding residual volume is
           less than 150cc (assessed by ultrasound or by catheterization), no additional
           catheterization is needed. The second group will include women which will have an
           indwelling catheter inserted for 24 hours. The catheter will be removed 24 hours
           following its insertion and post voiding residual volume will be assessed 6 hours
           following the catheter removal (by ultrasound or by catheterization). In cases of post
           voiding residual volume more than 150 cc or women are unable to micturate spontaneously,
           an indwelling catheter will be inserted for additional 24 hours.

        2. After 48 hours from postpartum urinary retention diagnosis, an indwelling catheter will
           be inserted for additional time that will be set at every center by its common protocol.
