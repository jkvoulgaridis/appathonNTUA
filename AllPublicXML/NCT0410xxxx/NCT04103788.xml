  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to evaluate the comparative effects of direct analysis of serum
      samples versus pre-treatment with enzymatic hydrolysis in split samples obtained from dosing
      with a highly absorbed curcumin emulsion product that is commercially available as BIOCURC.

      When curcumin is absorbed by the body, it is primarily found in the bloodstream as curcumin
      glucuronide (C-gluc) and curcumin sulfate (C-SO4) metabolites. Traditionally bioavailability
      studies have performed an enzymatic hydrolysis pre-treatment of serum samples with both a
      glucuronidase and a sulfatase enzyme in order to produce free curcumin for analysis via HPLC.
      In subsequent years, standards have become available for the metabolites (C-gluc &amp; C-SO4)
      that make it possible to determine these compound levels directly in serum samples using
      HPLC-MS-MS. Initial pilot work had indicated that enzymatic hydrolysis was producing falsely
      elevated results for bioavailability. We wanted to evaluate this in a more formal setting.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or Female subjects must be 21-75 years of age at the time of screening.

             a. Female subjects must agree to use one of the following medically acceptable
             contraceptive methods from the Screening visit (unless otherwise stated) through the
             End of Study (EOS) visit. Acceptable methods include: abstinence, same-sex partner,
             double barrier (condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap with spermicidal foam, gel, or
             cream), bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy; intrauterine
             device (IUD) with or without hormones in place or hormonal contraception (oral,
             injectable, implantable, transdermal, or vaginal) used consecutively for at least 3
             months prior to the Screening visit; vasectomized partner or bilateral insertion of
             Essure® implants for at least 6 months prior to the Screening visit; or postmenopausal
             status with amenorrhea (no menses) for at least 1 year prior to the Screening visit.

          2. Subjects must be willing to refrain from consuming the spice turmeric or any dietary
             supplements containing turmeric or curcumin (except for the study products) throughout
             the entire study.

          3. Subjects must be available for and willing to attend all evaluation visits.

          4. Subjects must be able and willing to give informed consent.

          5. Subjects participating in prior studies evaluating BIOCURC® or curcumin can
             participate in the present study so long as they are not currently taking a curcumin
             containing supplement (including turmeric) and have not done so for 14 days prior to
             screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is currently receiving therapy with remission-inducing drugs (i.e.
             methotrexate, TNF biologics, etc.), immunosuppressive drugs (i.e. corticosteroids,
             transplantation medications, etc.).

          2. Subjects must not have taken turmeric- or curcumin-containing dietary supplements
             within 14 days prior to screening evaluation.

          3. Subject has been diagnosed with any clinically significant confounding metabolic
             disease or condition that would interfere with the study evaluation, as judged by the
             clinical investigator (slow or fast metabolism resulting from hypo- or
             hyper-thyroidism, Cushing's Syndrome, Diabetes (except for fully resolved gestational
             diabetes), etc.) or any conditions that would affect absorption in the GI tract (i.e.
             inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, Behçet's Syndrome, systemic sclerosis,
             etc.).

          4. Subject has known allergy to any of the investigational products, including but not
             limited to turmeric, curcumin, coconut or coconut oil. If any subject becomes
             sensitive during the study, they will immediately be excluded from continuing in the
             study.

          5. Subject's body weight is greater than 300 pounds (136.1 kg) at the time of Screening.

          6. Subject is involved in any other research study involving an investigational product
             (drug, device or biologic) or a new application of an approved product, within 30 days
             of the first baseline evaluation.

          7. Pregnant and/or breastfeeding women, or women who intend to become pregnant during the
             course of the study.

          8. Subject has a history or positive test result of HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C.
