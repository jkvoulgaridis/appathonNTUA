  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study we want to learn more about the character of neutrophils that are
      present in the blood of children with sepsis. Sepsis is a severe type of infection, affecting
      various parts of the body. Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell that are part of the
      body's immune system. Even though neutrophils are important in getting rid of germs, they
      also may be harmful to parts of the body by causing injury in organs in patients with sepsis.
      Neutrophils can change their character in sepsis. Because of this, it is important for
      doctors to know what kind of neutrophils are in the blood of children with sepsis so that
      they can work to develop therapies to prevent these cells from being harmful.

        We will enroll pediatric patients with sepsis in an ICU at Boston Children's Hospital and
        patients without sepsis presenting for an elective surgical procedure at Boston Children's
        Hospital.

        Inclusion criteria Patients will be eligible for enrollment as septic patients if they

          -  Are &lt; 18 years old

          -  Meet the definition of sepsis described in the study design section above. Patients
             will be eligible for enrollment as control patients if they

          -  Are &lt; 18 years old

          -  Are scheduled for an elective surgical procedure and need preoperative blood draw or
             will have an intravenous catheter placed for the purpose of their surgical procedure.

        Exclusion criteria Patients will be ineligible for enrollment in either control or sepsis
        group if any of the followings is present or anticipated

          -  Congenital cardiac disease

          -  On chronic immunosuppressive drugs such as chronic corticosteroid use, or preexisting
             immunodeficiency diseases
