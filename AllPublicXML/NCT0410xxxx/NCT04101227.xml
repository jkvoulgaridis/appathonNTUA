  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, multi-center, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study. Eligible
      subjects will be randomized to receive either 0.33 mg AD04 or placebo orally twice-daily for
      24 weeks in conjunction with brief psychological counseling. Randomization will be stratified
      by gender and level of alcohol consumption prior to enrollment in the study
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Target enrollment of subjects with AUD who regularly engage in risk alcohol consumption (i.e.
      &gt;6/day or more heavy alcohol consumption in the 4 weeks preceding the screening visit), and
      have selected genotypes (LL/TT genotype and/or 1, 2 or 3 of the SNPs on the genes for the
      5-HT3 receptor subunits: rs1150226-AG or rs1176713-GG in the gene that encodes the 5-HT3A
      receptor subunit, and rs17614942-AC in the gene that encodes the 5-HT3B receptor subunit),
      and who are eligible to participate in the study based on meeting the remaining study
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive either 0.33 mg
      AD04 or placebo BID for 24 weeks.

      The trial will have a 16-week grace period to enable medication effects to be optimal for
      comparison with placebo. The grace period starts immediately after beginning of study drug
      treatment, in which consumption of alcohol is not counted as a failure. All primary and
      secondary efficacy endpoints will be assessed during the last 8 weeks of treatment (i.e.
      weeks 17-24). The primary measure of efficacy, incidence risk alcohol consumption, will be
      assessed over the last 8 weeks of treatment. To enhance study feasibility, subjects will be
      evaluated every week during the first 8 weeks of treatment and every other week for the
      remaining 16 weeks of the treatment period.
