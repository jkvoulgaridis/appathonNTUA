    <textblock>
      Auralya® is a sterile, injectable, non-pyrogenic, re-absorbable medical product made of
      reticulated hyaluronic acid of non-animal origin, produced via bacterial fermentation.

      To evaluate the overall safety of the medical device and performance of Auralya® dermal
      filler in terms of absolute change of WSRS score (Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale) assessed by
      Investigator at 8 and 12 weeks after the initiation of treatment, compared to Baseline Visit
      (day 0).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Minimally invasive procedures (injectable dermal fillers) are among the techniques preferred
      by an increasing number of specialists in Aesthetics due to their clinical performance
      regarding volume restoration, and favourable safety profile.

      During January - March 2018, it was performed a review of the scientific literature to find
      similar investigations to determine the minimal clinical significant difference between
      Baseline and a period of 30 days after the end the treatment.

      In a similar dermal filler study, Takanobu Mashiko et al used a 5-grade WSRS and showed that,
      at 4 weeks after treatment, they achieved a 1.7 ± 0.5 (mean ± SD) improvement between those
      visits.

      Considering the exploratory nature of this study and the fact that this investigation is
      first in-human, we choose to take a 0.5 WSRS decrease, at 90 days from the treatment start,
      as a minimal clinically significant difference. The standard deviation considered for the
      sample size calculation was set at 0.8 WSRS points.

      By using a one-sided Wilcoxon Signed-rank test (matched pairs), a significance level of 0.05
      and a power of 0.95 (probability of finding an effect when there is one), we calculated a
      total sample size of 31 subjects.
