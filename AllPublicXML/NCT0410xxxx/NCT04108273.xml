  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Organizational, time management and planning (OTMP) skills deficits are impairing features of
      developmental disorders, such as Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD), which
      compromise school performance and family relations. The manualized Organizational Skills
      Training program (OST) was designed to target children's specific OTMP deficits. However, the
      brain mechanisms of treatment-induced changes remain unknown. The current study combines a
      training intervention (OST) with non-invasive MRI imaging in a pre-/post-design in a
      randomized two-arm (treatment vs. waitlist) trial to address this question.

    <description>The Children's Organizational Skills Scale quantifies how children (ages 8-13) organize their time, materials, and actions to accomplish important tasks at home and school. The Parent report consists of 66 questions, each using a 4-point Likert-type scale. T-scores can range between 40 and 90</description>
