      DURANCE is a two part, phase Ib/II, multi-centre study to assess the safety and activity of
      S-488210/S-488211 in combination with durvalumab, in patients with non-muscle invasive
      bladder cancer (NMIBC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DURANCE is a registered, phase Ib/II study in patients with surgically debulked bacillus
      Calmette-Guerin (BCG) unresponsive (resistant or relapsing) non-muscle invasive bladder
      cancer (NIMBC). Patients will receive up to 24 weeks of durvalumab (a PD-L1 immune checkpoint
      inhibitor) in combination with S-488210/S-488211 (a 5-peptide cancer vaccine).

      Durvalumab will be given as 1500 mg IV infusion every 4 weeks for up to 7 doses, in
      combination with S-488210/S-S488211 which will be administered as two subcutaneous injections
      of S-488210/Montanide and S-488211/Montanide starting the day after the first durvalumab
      dose, then weekly for 6 doses and every 2 weeks for a further 9 doses (up to a maximum of 16
      doses).

      The phase Ib part of the DURANCE study will look to assess the safety and tolerability of the
      treatment combination of durvalumab + S-488210/S-488211 by reviewing Dose Limiting Toxicities
      (DLTs) which have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to the trial treatments
      (durvalumab and/or S-488210/S-488211). Up to 14 patients will be registered into the phase Ib
      and provided the DLTs do not exceed the DLT thresholds defined in the trial protocol, the
      trial will proceed to the expansion phase of the study (phase 2). In phase 2 the trial will
      look to assess the disease free survival rate at 1 year following start of treatment.
