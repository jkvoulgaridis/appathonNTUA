      This is a single-site, 4-visit, contralateral, dispensing, open-label, randomized study. Each
      eligible subject will be randomized into one of two sequence groups to wear two lens types
      contralaterally (Test on the right eye and Control on left eye or vice versa).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Potential subjects must satisfy all of the following criteria to be enrolled in the
             study.

               1. The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and
                  receive a fully executed copy of the form.

               2. Appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in this clinical
                  protocol.

               3. Between 18 and 45 (inclusive) years of age at the time of screening.

               4. Be a current spherical soft contact lens wearer in both eyes with a minimum of 6
                  hours/day and 5 days/week wear time over the last 30 days by self-report.

               5. Have a pair of spectacles with corrected vision of 20/40 or better in each eye or
                  uncorrected vision is 20/40 or better in each eye

               6. The subject's vertex-corrected spherical equivalent distance refraction must be
                  in the range of -1.00 through -6.00 D in each eye.

               7. The subject has a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/25 or better in each eye.

                  Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Potential subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from
             participating in the study.

               1. Currently pregnant or breastfeeding.

               2. Any ocular or systemic allergies or diseases that may interfere with contact lens
                  wear.

               3. Any autoimmune disease or use of medication, which may interfere with contact
                  lens wear. Habitual medications used by successful soft contact lens wearers are
                  considered acceptable.

               4. Any ocular abnormalities such as entropion, ectropion, extrusions, chalazia,
                  recurrent styes, history of recurrent corneal erosions.

               5. Any previous, or planned, ocular or interocular surgery (e.g., radial keratotomy,
                  PRK, LASIK, etc.).

               6. Multifocal, toric or extended wear contact lens correction.

               7. Participation in any contact lens or lens care product clinical trial within 14
                  days prior to study enrollment.

               8. History of binocular vision abnormality or strabismus.

               9. Any infectious disease (e.g., hepatitis, tuberculosis) or contagious
                  immunosuppressive diseases (e.g., HIV) by self-report.

              10. Employee or immediate family member of an employee of clinical site (e.g.,
                  Investigator, Coordinator, Technician).

              11. Any ocular infection.

              12. Any Grade 3 or greater slit lamp findings (e.g., edema, corneal
                  neovascularization, corneal staining, tarsal abnormalities, conjunctival
                  injection) on the EFRON scale (Appendix G), any previous history or signs of a
                  contact lens-related corneal inflammatory event (e.g., past peripheral ulcer or
                  round peripheral scar), or any other ocular abnormality that may contraindicate
                  contact lens wear.

              13. Any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable
                  contact lens wear.
