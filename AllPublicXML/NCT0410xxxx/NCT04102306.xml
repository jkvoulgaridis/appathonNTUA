  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is the symptomatic expression of a muscular or an articular
      impairment at the manducatory tract. TMD affects between 30 to 65% of the population with a
      higher prevalence for young women. The patients with DTM report a decrease of their personal,
      social and professional quality of life. Treatment usually relies on physical therapy. Among
      the different technics that can be used in physical therapy, there is growing evidence
      advocating the efficacy of using motor imagery (i.e. imagining a movement with no concomitant
      physical execution) during rehabilitation. It has also been shown that the benefits of
      practicing motor imagery depend on the ability (i.e., the higher the ability, the greater the
      benefits). However, there is no investigation of the motor imagery ability of the tongue and
      mouth movements conditioning the use of motor imagery during TMD rehabilitation. The
      objective of the study is to investigate the ability of imagining tongue and mouth movements
      using the Tongue and Mouth Imagery Questionnaire (TMIQ) as compare to the gold-standard
      Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire (KVIQ - Malouin et al., 2007).

      Principal objective:

      Assess the validity construct of the Tongue and Mouth Imagery Questionnaire (TMIQ) as compare
      to the gold-standard Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire (KVIQ - Malouin et al.,
      2007), both measuring the motor imagery vividness.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. Assess the reliability of the TMIQ using a test-retest.

        2. Assess the temporal coupling (i.e., the ratio between imagined and physically practiced
           movement) and compare these ratios for the TMIQ and KVIQ.

        3. Investigate the effect of TMD by comparing the vividness scores of TMIQ for respectively
           subject with and with no TMD.

        4. Investigate the effect of TMD by comparing the vividness scores of KVIQ for respectively
           subject with and with no TMD.

        5. Investigate the effect of TMD by comparing the temporal coupling scores of TMIQ for
           respectively subject with and with no TMD.

        6. Investigate the effect of TMD by comparing the temporal coupling scores of KVIQ for
           respectively subject with and with no TMD.
