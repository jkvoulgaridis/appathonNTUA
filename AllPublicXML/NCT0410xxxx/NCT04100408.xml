  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal is to define the mechanisms of pathogenesis underlying Langerhans cell
      histiocytosis (LCH). The overall objectives of the current study are to characterize the role
      of SMAD6 inherited genetic variation on LCH susceptibility and identify germline genomic
      regions associated with LCH somatic mutations. Building from preliminary data, the central
      hypotheses are: (1) causal genetic variants in SMAD6 underlie susceptibility to LCH, and (2)
      differences in LCH-related somatic activating mutations by race/ethnicity are related to
      Amerindian (i.e., Native American) genetic ancestry. The Central hypothesis will be tested by
      pursuing the specific aims.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To comprehensively characterize germline variants in SMAD6 and their association with LCH.

      II. To identify novel germline variants associated with LCH.

      III.To determine the role of genetic ancestry on LCH-related somatic mutations.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To integrate clinical and epidemiologic questionnaire data with genetic risk factor data
      from the Primary Aims to more comprehensively elucidate LCH susceptibility.

      OUTLINE:

      Case identification and recruitment followed by questionnaires and specimen processing.

    <measure>Characterized germline variants in SMAD6 and their association with Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will re-sequence SMAD6 among LCH case-parent trios to characterize the association between SMAD6 inherited genetic effects and LCH susceptibility using targeted next-generation sequencing. We will also analyze de novo single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy-number variants (CNVs), and insertions/deletions(INDELs) obtained through SMAD6 sequence data generated from the biologic samples of the CCRN/PEC LCH case-parent trios.</description>

    <measure>The frequency of de novo mutations and systematic assessment of the underlying genetic makeup of LCH</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will use the maximum number of LCH case-parent trios enrolled utilizing the CCRN/PEC with viable biologic samples to conduct genome-wide SNP genotyping. This methodology will identify new genes and pathways associated with LCH susceptibility. We will also determine the prevalence of novel de novo mutations associated with LCH in these case-parent trios. This will provide a systematic assessment of the underlying genetic makeup of LCH in a large sample of families.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The difference in LCH-related somatic mutations by race/ethnicity due to underlying genetic ancestry</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Genetic ancestry will be determined using germline genome-wide SNP array data generated from CCRN/PEC LCH cases in Aim 2. In parallel, we will determine patient somatic mutational profiles using a custom, targeted 91-gene panel. We will then conduct a genome-wide admixture-mapping scan to identify LCH-related loci that are associated with specific LCH somatic mutational profiles.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>The role of genetic ancestry on LCH-related somatic mutations</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>The analysis of data generated in this outcome measure will be primarily descriptive in nature. the objective will be to characterize LCH case-parent trios based on demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical characteristics. Findings from primary outcome measures findings will be validated and will assess if the frequency of validated inherited genetic variants differs by these characteristics.</description>
