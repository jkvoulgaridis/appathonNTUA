      The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of molar incisor hypo mineralization among
      children who have been treated with asthmatic drugs early in their lives.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The term Molar incisor hypo mineralization (MIH) was first introduced in 2001 as a
      developmental disorder of enamel characterized by hypo mineralization -of systemic origin -
      affecting the enamel of first permanent molars (PFM) ,frequently associated with affected
      permanent incisors.

      The prevalence of MIH varies widely, ranging from 2.4 % to 40.2% in different populations.
      This wide variation may be due to differences in diagnostic criteria and methodologies used
      by the authors. Concerning the etiology of MIH it is mostly related to pre natal, perinatal,
      and post natal illness.

      Asthma and asthmatic drugs have been proposed to be one of the etiological factors of
      MIH,Internationally, the mean prevalence of pediatric asthma is 10%.

    <description>- Clinical examination will be carried out by the principle investigator using mirror and probe to examine all surfaces of each first permanent molar &amp;permanent incisors following the diagnostic criteria of MIH set by the European Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (EAPD)as following :Demarcated opacities:
Enamel disintegration:
