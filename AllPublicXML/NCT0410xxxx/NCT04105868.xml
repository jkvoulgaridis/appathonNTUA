  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rates of depression increase rapidly during adolescence, especially for girls, and, thus,
      research is needed to spur the development of novel interventions to prevent adolescent
      depression. This project seeks to determine if a novel visuocortical probe of affect-biased
      attention (i.e., steady-state visual evoked potentials derived from EEG) can 1) be used to
      prospectively predict depression using a multi-wave repeated measures design and 2) modify
      affect-biased attention and buffer subsequent mood reactivity using real time neurofeedback.
      This work could ultimately lead to improved identification of adolescents who are at high
      risk for depression and directly inform the development of mechanistic treatment targets to
      be used in personalized intervention prescriptions for high-risk youth.

    <description>To measure affect-biased attention, steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) will be derived from EEG and will be used to index the amount of stimulus-driven attention to the negative distractors relative to goal-directed attention toward task-relevant stimuli. Larger SSVEPs indicate more attention to that stimulus. Affect-biased attention will be measured both before and after the real time SSVEP neurofeedback training to assess changes in affect-biased attention pre- to post-intervention.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in sadness after laboratory stressor, which follows neurofeedback</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and following laboratory stressor (~30 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete a laboratory stressor following real time SSVEP neurofeedback training to assess how well it buffers sadness reactivity. To assess sadness reactivity, girls will report state sadness before and after the stressor using Visual Analog Scales. Participants will mark how they are feeling between neutral to very sad on a scale measuring 100 millimeters, with higher scores indicating greater state sadness.</description>
