  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      FLORA is a longitudinal intervention study with a randomized, parallel group design. Primary
      objective is to improve metabolic health through gut microbiota modulation by means of a
      retailer-driven personalized dietary intervention in a real-life setting. Four hundred
      Flemish pre-metabolic adults will be randomly divided into a control and treatment arm, each
      comprising 200 participants. The study period is divided into three phases: a four weeks
      characterization, a twelve weeks intervention, and a four weeks post-intervention phase.
      During the intervention phase, control participants' online Collect&amp;Go shopping carts are
      adjusted in accordance with Flemish food-based dietary guidelines. Based on the same
      guidelines, participants are provided with personalized dietary advice considering their
      usual dietary pattern and level of food literacy. In the treatment arm, a similar
      intervention will be applied using guidelines based on a microbiota modulation diet (MMD).
      During intervention, all participants can contact a dietician helpline for additional advice
      on study-related dietary issues. Over the five months, saliva and fecal samples will be
      collected on a regular basis, with an intensive sampling period of seven consecutive days at
      the end of each study phase. A GP consult consisting of a short medical exam, blood
      withdrawal and medical questionnaire takes place each month. Further, online questionnaires
      on lifestyle, health and well-being will be sent by e-mail and each five days, participants
      complete a food diary through their smartphone. Fecal, saliva, blood samples and meta-data
      will be analysed to detect changes in metabolic health.

    <description>During the three months intervention period, participants within this arm will do their groceries through the online Collect&amp;Go platform of Colruyt Group. Dietitians will adjust their shopping carts by changing food products by healthier alternative ones taking into account the Flemish food-based dietary guidelines. Based on participants' dietary pattern and level of food literacy, personalized dietary advice will be provided and a dietitian helpline will be available for further nutrition-related questions.</description>

    <description>The Collect&amp;Go shopping carts of the 400 participants will be adapted by replacing food products by healthier alternative ones based on the Flemish food-based dietary guidelines and the microbiota modulation diet guidelines for the control and study arm respectively. Based on these guidelines, and the habitual dietary pattern and level of food literacy of the participant, personalized dietary advice will be provided. A dietitian helpline will be available for further nutritional issues as well.</description>
