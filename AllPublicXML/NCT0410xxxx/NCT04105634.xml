  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research study is being conducted to test how two different types of Positron Emission
      Tomography (PET/CT) scans could be used to image a type of heart disorder called amyloidosis
      (AL). There will be two groups in the study. One group will have PET/CT scans using an
      imaging drug called 18F-NOS and the other group will have PET/CT scans using a drug called
      Florbetaben. subject will be assigned to one of the groups when she/he agrees to be in the
      study.

    <description>The imaging drug used for this group is called 18F-NOS, it is an experimental imaging drug that has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use except in a research study. Subject will not receive the results or feedback from the study participation, the images may be reviewed with subject or her/his doctor upon request but will not be used to make decisions about subject medical care.</description>

    <description>The imaging drug used for this group is called Florbetaben, it is an FDA approved radioactive PET tracer used to image amyloid plaques in the body. Although not yet FDA approved for this purpose, it has already been used clinically to image amyloid in other parts of the body. Subject will not receive the results or feedback from the study participation, the images may be reviewed with subject or her/his doctor upon request but will not be used to make decisions about subject medical care.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants will be at least 18 years of age

          2. Have an established diagnosis of AL amyloidosis based on standard criteria and
             planning to start systemic therapy.

          3. Have cardiac involvement as defined by all of the following:

               -  Past documented or presently noted clinical signs and symptoms supportive of a
                  diagnosis of heart failure in the setting of a confirmed diagnosis of AL
                  amyloidosis in the absence of an alternative explanation for heart failure

               -  Either an endomyocardial biopsy demonstrating AL amyloidosis or an echocardiogram
                  demonstrating a mean left ventricular wall thickness at diastole &gt;12mm in the
                  absence of other causes (e.g. severe hypertension, aortic stenosis), which would
                  adequately explain the degree of wall thickening

               -  NT-proBNP ≥ 650 pg/mL

          4. Participants should fall into 1 of the following 2 categories:

               1. Treatment-naïve or have completed no more than 1 cycle of initial therapy, OR

               2. Relapsed after 1 or more prior therapies, and at least 6 months from last
                  treatment

          5. Have serum free light chain (FLC) differential (defined as amyloid-forming FLC minus
             non-amyloid-forming FLC) ≥ 50 mg/L.

          6. Participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and be
             willing to provide written informed consent and participate in this study in
             accordance with institutional and federal guidelines prior to study-specific
             procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Females who are pregnant or breast feeding at the time of the PET/CT scan will not be
             eligible for this study; a urine pregnancy test will be performed in women of
             child-bearing potential before the injection of radiotracer.

          2. Inability to tolerate imaging procedures in the opinion of an investigator or treating
             physician

          3. Any current medical condition, illness, or disorder as assessed by medical record
             review and/or self-reported that is considered by a physician investigator to be a
             condition that could compromise participant safety or successful participation in the
             study

          4. Less than 6 months life expectancy as deemed by a treating physician
