    <textblock>
      This study is a phase 2, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of a Traditional Chinese Medicine decoction, the modified Xiang Bei Yang
      Rong Tang, in alleviating cancer related fatigue in cancer survivors.

    <textblock>
      Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a distressing, persistent and subjective sense of physical,
      emotional, or cognitive tiredness related to cancer or its treatment. Currently there is a
      lack of effective conventional pharmacological intervention for treating this condition.
      Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) could be alternative therapy for managing CRF.

      This study is a phase 2, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to examine the
      efficacy and safety of a TCM decoction, the modified Xiang Bei Yang Rong Tang (XBYRT) in
      alleviating CRF in cancer survivors. Study participants recruited from National Cancer Centre
      Singapore (NCCS) will be randomized to receive either the XBYRT or placebo decoction.
      Participants will take their assigned decoction daily for a duration of 8 weeks and will be
      assessed using patient reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires. PROs used are the European
      Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ
      30) for QOL, the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory Short Form (MFSI-SF) for fatigue
      and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog) Version 3 for
      cognitive abilities. The changes in scores measured by these assessment tools will be
      compared between the XBYRT intervention and placebo groups. Blood biomarkers such as
      inflammatory cytokines, mitochondrial DNA and oxidative stress markers will also be evaluated
      in the study participants. Additionally, adverse events or serious adverse events in
      participants will be monitored for safety.

      Results from this study will provide a better understanding on the role of TCM in managing
      CRF.

    <time_frame>4, 8 and 10 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Difference in MFSI-SF scores between XBYRT interventional and placebo arms. THE MFSI-SF consists of 30 items and has 5 subscales, each with 6 items: general fatigue, physical fatigue, emotional fatigue, mental fatigue, and vigour. The MFSI-SF measures different dimensions of fatigue, which can be combined to obtain an overall score. A higher score represents worse fatigue (total score ranges from -24 to 96)</description>

    <description>Difference in FACT-Cog V3 scores between XBYRT interventional and placebo arms. FACT-Cog v.3 will be used to assess subjective cognitive disturbances. These disturbances are assessed via 33 items in the domains of concentration, functional interference, mental acuity, memory, multitasking and verbal fluency (total score ranges from 0-148). A lower score represents worse cognitive function.</description>

The EORTC QLQ-C30 consists of 30 items across functional domains, symptoms domains and a global health status domain. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high score for a functional scale represents a high level of functioning. A high score for a symptom scale represents a high level of problems.</description>
