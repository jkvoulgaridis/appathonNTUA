    <textblock>
      Catheter ablation is an established cornerstone of therapy for patients with symptomatic
      atrial fibrillation (AF) who wish to avoid anti-arrhythmic drug therapy or for whom
      anti-arrhythmics have proven ineffective. Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), in which
      circumferential ablation is performed around the ostia of the pulmonary vein - left atrial
      junctions, is the standard ablation approach internationally. Single-procedure success rates
      (1y, freedom from AF, off anti-arrhythmics) for patients with paroxysmal AF is roughly 70%,
      and even worse (roughly 50%) for patients with persistent AF.

      A number of strategies have been developed to improve outcomes in patients undergoing AF
      ablation, particularly in patients with persistent AF. Unfortunately, large prospective
      randomized trials (including STAR-AF II, published in NEJM in 2015) have demonstrated a
      failure of ancillary ablation techniques to improve AF ablation outcomes relative to PVI
      alone.

      In a collaborative effort between the Cardiology electrophysiology group and the Trayanova
      laboratory (Biomechanical Engineering), investigators have developed a strategy of
      patient-specific modeling to identify pro-arrhythmic sites in AF patients that may be
      amenable to ablation. In this approach, patients undergo a pre-ablation cardiac MRI with late
      gadolinium enhancement, to delineate regions of healthy atrial tissue and regions of scar
      (this scan is clinically indicated, and performed currently in patients undergoing PVI for
      AF). A novel in silico modeling to determine regions supporting electrical reentry in the
      atrium, driving ongoing AF, has been developed by the Trayanova lab. In preliminary studies,
      investigators have demonstrated the ability to identify and target these regions with
      catheter ablation in patients undergoing PVI.

      Investigators would like to conduct a prospective, randomized clinical trial in patients
      undergoing ablation for symptomatic persistent AF. All patients enrolled would undergo
      standard pre-procedure imaging (LGE-MRI) prior to the day of procedure. Investigators have
      developed methodology termed OPTIMA (OPtimal Target Identification via Modeling of
      Arrhythmogenesis) to determine, based on non-invasive patient-specific anatomic and tissue
      data from late gadolinium enhancement cardiac MRI (LGE-CMR) and simulation of cardiac
      electrical function, personalized ablation targets for persistent AF in patients with
      fibrotic remodeling.. Patients would be randomized to receiving PVI only versus PVI + OPTIMA
      ablation at the time of ablation. Patients would then be followed in standard clinical
      fashion at 3m, 6m, and 12m to assess for ablation efficacy and for procedural complications.

      Investigators postulate a 20% improvement in freedom from AF with PVI + OPTIMA ablation form
      50% to 70% (compared to PVI alone), investigators anticipate that in 1:1 randomization, a
      sample size of 80 patients in each arm will yield a power calculation of 80% with an alpha of
      0.05. Investigators anticipate that enrollment and 1y clinical follow-up for 160 patients
      (total) undergoing AF ablation will require a 4y timeline.

    <textblock>
      Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most commonly encountered clinical arrhythmia.
      Symptoms arising from AF are common, and may include palpitations, fatigue, exertional
      intolerance, and angina. Relief of symptoms is achieved by rhythm control strategies
      including drug therapy and catheter ablation for AF. Catheter ablation is more effective than
      drug therapy, is the preferred method of rhythm control for patients in whom drug therapy has
      been ineffective or intolerable, and is increasingly used as first-line therapy. However,
      success rates for AF control after catheter ablation are imperfect, with AF recurrence rates
      between 30 - 50% at 1 year. Currently, catheter ablation focuses almost exclusively on
      electrical isolation of the pulmonary vein (PV) ostia (PV isolation; PVI), to eliminate
      triggering activity from ectopic foci in the PVs that, in the vast majority of patients,
      initiate AF. A number of strategies have been developed to improve outcomes in patients
      undergoing AF ablation, particularly in patients with persistent AF. Unfortunately, large
      prospective randomized trials (including STAR-AF II, NEJM 2015) have demonstrated a failure
      of ancillary ablation techniques to improve AF ablation outcomes relative to PVI alone. The
      failure of PVI and ancillary ablation techniques to deliver reasonable outcomes is
      exacerbated in patients with persistent AF (PsAF), who develop fibrosis in the atria. These
      patients have AF ablation outcomes that are demonstrably worse than those seen in patients
      with persistent AF. Investigators have recently developed methodology (termed OPTIMA, OPtimal
      Target Identification via Modeling of Arrhythmogenesis) to determine, based on non-invasive
      patient-specific anatomic and tissue data from late gadolinium enhancement cardiac MRI
      (LGE-CMR) and simulation of cardiac electrical function, personalized ablation targets for
      persistent AF in patients with fibrotic remodeling. These targets, which are determined off
      line pre-procedure, are then used to steer patient treatment. This technology is intended to
      make the procedure accurate and efficacious in persistent AF patients with fibrosis, and to
      eliminate the need for repeat ablations, offering long-term freedom from AF.

      Hypothesis: In patients undergoing ablation for the treatment of persistent AF, using the
      OPTIMA approach and performing PV isolation during ablation for AF will improve outcomes
      compared to performing PV isolation alone.

      Importance: In United States, Center for disease control estimates that 2.7-6.1 million
      people suffer with AF and expects this number to increase with the aging population. Ablation
      for AF is performed at increasing rates, and in certain population (eg patients with
      paroxysmal AF) is moderately effective. Even in optimal patients, however, the rate of AF
      recurrence following apparently successful PV isolation is high (2017 Heart Rhythm Society
      (HRS) Consensus statement on AF ablation). Strategies to improve AF ablation outcomes should
      result in improved patient health (symptom elimination), lower patient risk (reduction of the
      number of patients undergoing redo ablation procedures), and reduced economic burden from
      healthcare costs (reducing post-ablation treatment for AF, including redo ablation
      procedures). Furthermore, demonstration of the arrhythmogenic propensity of fibrotic
      remodeling in patients with persistent AF will add to investigators' collective understanding
      of the fundamental mechanisms underlying AF initiation and perpetuation.

      Objectives: The goal of this study is to test the efficacy of the OPTIMA approach for
      determining the optimal ablation targets in patients with persistent AF and fibrosis, and to
      demonstrate that elimination of AF-perpetuating sources in the fibrotic substrate, in
      conjunction with PVI, during AF ablation improves rate of AF-free survival at 1 year compared
      to patients undergoing standard PVI alone.

      Study Procedures

      This study is a prospective, randomized, single-blind study of patients undergoing either
      standard PV isolation or PVI+OPTIMA ablation for the treatment of symptomatic persistent AF.
      Patients referred for ablation for symptomatic persistent AF will be considered for
      enrollment. Patients will have cardiac function and anatomy assessed by echocardiography in
      the six-month window prior to ablation (routine care). Patients will have a baseline rhythm
      assessment with Ziopatch to quantify pre-ablation AF burden. All patients will undergo
      pre-procedure LGE-CMR to delineate atrial anatomy (routine care). MRI scan will be obtained
      in sinus rhythm; patients will be cardiovertered before MRI if the patients are in atrial
      fibrillation. All patients will be anticoagulated according to standard clinical guidelines.
      Patients with a CHADS VASc score of 2 or greater will be systemically anticoagulated in the
      pre-, peri-, and post-procedural periods. Patients not otherwise requiring long-term systemic
      anticoagulation will be anticoagulated during the peri- and post-procedural intervals
      (minimum of 2 months systemic anticoagulation following ablation). Finally, any patient
      undergoing cardioversion to facilitate MRI acquisition will receive systemic anticoagulation
      for a minimum of three weeks prior to cardioversion and/or have a Transesophageal
      Echocardiography (TEE) performed prior to cardioversion. After CMR acquisition, patients will
      be randomized to PVI versus PVI+OPTIMA ablation. Pre-procedural TEE is not required for
      patients presenting in Sinus rhythm and on uninterrupted anticoagulation for at least 3
      weeks, regardless of CHADS VASC score. Patients presenting either in atrial fibrillation or
      not on uninterrupted anticoagulation will undergo a pre-procedural TEE, again independent of
      CHADS VASC score. All patients will undergo AF ablation with PVI (routine care). At the
      outset of the procedure, electroanatomical mapping of the Left Atrium (LA) will be performed
      to facilitate clinical ablation, with typically 1000 datapoints captured in the LA. PVI will
      be performed in all patients. In the PVI+OPTIMA arm, sites identified as targets by
      pre-procedure modeling will subsequently be targeted for ablation (research procedure, during
      routine ablation procedure). Additional ablation of other atrial targets (lines, complex
      fractionated electrograms) will be discouraged in both arms, but ultimately targeting such
      areas will be left to the discretion of the operator. In both arms, PV isolation will be
      assessed by entrance block. OPTIMA lesions will be assessed by both minimum of 50 percentage
      reduction in all local Electrograms (EGM), as well as non-capture by high output pacing at
      the site of target ablation. Operator will have the discretion not to ablate certain OPTIMA
      targets for safety reasons including but not limited to avoid critical structures and patient
      hemodynamic status. Operator will document the reason for not ablating all OPTIMA targets in
      the case report forms. Patients will be maintained on anti-arrhythmic drugs during the
      healing phase (3m) following ablation, with medication changes (cessation, up-titration, or
      drug changes) made at the discretion of the treating physician. All patients will be followed
      clinically after ablation in the standard fashion (routine care), including visits at 3, 6,
      and 12 months, with AF burden assessment with Zio patch at each visit.

      Study duration and number of study visits required of research participants.

      Investigators anticipate that this study will take 3 years for enrollment and 1 year clinical
      follow-up. Patient encounters include a pre-procedure clinical assessment and rhythm
      assessment(zio patch) in outpatient Electrophysiology (EP) Clinic; cardiac MRI in the week
      prior to ablation; the ablation procedure itself; overnight monitoring in the hospital
      following ablation; clinical assessment at 3, 6 and 12 months after ablation, including
      rhythm assessment with Ziopatch at each visit. Additional rhythm assessment with Ziopatch
      will be performed for patients with clinical symptoms of atrial fibrillation. Of note, these
      encounters are all part of current clinical practice in patients undergoing AF ablation.

      Blinding, including justification for blinding or not blinding the trial, if applicable.

      Patients will be blinded to the ablation strategy (PVI only versus PVI+OPTIMA ablation).
      Operators by necessity cannot be blinded to the ablation strategy, as patients are performing
      the ablations.

      Risks

      All patients in the study will undergo standard PVI, with its attendant risks. These risks
      include those related to general anesthesia, risk of stroke, risk of cardiac puncture, risk
      of esophageal injury, risk of other cardiac damage, and risk related to vascular access.
      Patients randomized to Re-entrant Driver (RD) ablation will undergo standard PVI (with risks
      listed above). During ablation, operators will target additional sites for lesion delivery.
      This is anticipated to lead to increases in procedure time, left atrial dwell time, number of
      lesions delivered, and increased radiation exposure.

      Investigators anticipate that the additional risk to patients undergoing OPTIMA ablation (in
      addition to PVI) will be minimal. Typical PVI involves lesion delivery at 50-60 sites. In
      investigators early experience, patients have between 2-5 AF sources in the fibrotic
      substrate that OPTIMA targets. Thus, the additional ablation in each patient is likely to be
      a small component of the total ablation lesion set; additional risks are a function largely
      of time manipulating catheters and ablating in the left atrium. This added time will be
      minimal.

      Radiation exposure Patients undergoing standard ablation procedure is estimated to be
      estimated to have 0.700 rems of radiation exposure due to fluoroscopy. Patients undergoing
      optima ablation are estimated to be exposed to additional 0.14 rems of radiation.

      Risks of ECG patch monitor Clinical trials have so far shown the Zio XT is well-tolerated in
      the overall population. The risks associated with Zio patch include mild discomfort and/or
      allergic reaction to sticky pads used to attach the Zio patch.

      There is a possibility that while reviewing one's patch monitor results investigators may
      detect a heart rhythm abnormality that investigators did not expect to find. Investigators
      will contact the patient and inform the patient and his/her clinical cardiac
      electrophysiologist regarding the result. The costs for any care that may arise in reaction
      to this incidental finding will not be covered by this research study.

      Steps taken to minimize the risks.

      Currently investigators employ a number of risk mitigation strategies, including the use of
      electroanatomical mapping systems to minimize radiation exposure, the use of systemic
      anticoagulation to minimize Cardiovascular Accident (CVA) risk, the use of ultrasound guided
      vascular access to minimize vascular complication rates. All of these strategies will be
      employed for all study participants. In addition following monitoring procedures will be
      followed during the study.

        -  Data quality will be monitored routinely and reviewed monthly for missing data,
           inconsistent data, data outliers, and potential protocol deviations.

        -  All adverse events and protocol deviations will be notified to PI.

        -  In order to minimize risks to patients enrolled in the study all adverse events will be
           discussed in the monthly cardiac electrophysiology complications conference. This
           conference will serve as the Global safety monitoring committee.

        -  All Attending physicians participating in this study including David Spragg MD, Ronal
           Berger MD, Hugh Calkins, MD, Joseph Marine, MD and Hiroshi Ashikaga MD, PhD attend this
           conference.

        -  All adverse events will be assessed in terms of relationship to device, relationship to
           procedure, severity, subsequent intervention required, and resolution status.

      Benefits

      Strategies to improve AF ablation outcomes should result in improved patient health (symptom
      elimination), lower patient risk (reduction of the number of patients undergoing redo
      ablation procedures), and reduced economic burden from healthcare costs (reducing
      post-ablation treatment for AF, including redo ablation procedures). Furthermore,
      demonstration of the importance of elimination of the arrhythmogenic propensity of the
      fibrotic substrate in patients with PsAF will add to investigators collective understanding
      of the fundamental mechanisms underlying AF initiation and perpetuation.
