  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND:

      One in eight women will develop breast cancer in their lifetime. With improved screening and
      treatment techniques, more women are surviving breast cancer. However, women live with
      physical and emotional side effects secondary to treatment for years after cancer treatments
      have ended. Exercise can help to manage these side effects, however, less than 30% of this
      population takes part in regular exercise. The objective of this trial is to determine the
      feasibility and effectiveness of a novel exercise and education program for women with breast
      cancer during chemotherapy.

      METHODS:

      Participants in this study include women with a diagnosis of stage 1 - 3 breast cancer
      undergoing chemotherapy. Women will be divided into three groups. The first group will
      include 8 sessions of exercise and self-management education during their chemotherapy
      treatment. The second group will receive self-management education only, and the third group
      will receive usual care. Outcomes will be compared between groups at baseline,
      post-intervention, and at 6- and 12- month follow up. Outcomes to be assessed include
      exercise level, functional mobility, muscle strength, quality of life, health status, and use
      of health care services.

      EXPECTED OUTCOMES:

      Women with breast cancer are among the least active segment of the Canadian population. It is
      well known that inactivity can lead to physical and psychological side effects, cancer
      recurrence, and an increase in comorbid conditions. This proposed project addresses a
      long-standing need to help women with breast cancer become and stay more active by
      implementing a novel exercise and education program.

    <description>Exercise component: Aerobic exercise, using recumbent bikes, delivered within the cancer institution. Participants will take part in up to 30-minutes of moderate intensity (50-70% HRmax or 4-6/10 on Rate of Perceived Exertion scale)6 exercise for eight sessions during chemotherapy. An exercise specialist with experience in cancer rehabilitation will supervise the exercise component.</description>

    <intervention_name>Self-Management</intervention_name>
    <description>Eight SM modules will be delivered to participants. They will be viewed on an iPad prior to or after the exercise component. The goal of these modules is to aid participants in developing physical activity goals and action plans to continue with between sessions, with an overarching goal of helping them reach exercise guidelines for cancer survivors and the Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines</description>

    <intervention_name>Booster Sessions</intervention_name>
    <description>Four booster sessions will be provided to participants in this group. These will occur at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months post intervention completion. An assessor trained in behavioural counselling will provide booster sessions by phone and will discuss the individuals physical and emotional condition, current exercise level, accomplishment of previously set goals and action plans, and perceived barriers to participation in exercise. The assessor will use facilitation strategies to aid participants in devising strategies to overcome barriers and set realistic goals and action plans.</description>
