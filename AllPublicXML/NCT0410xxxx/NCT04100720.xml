Class II - Mild symptoms (mild shortness of breath and/or angina) and slight limitation during ordinary activity.
Class III - Marked limitation in activity due to symptoms, even during less-than-ordinary activity, e.g. walking short distances (20—100 m).Comfortable only at rest.
Class IV - Severe limitations. Experiences symptoms even while at rest. Mostly bedbound patients.</description>

    <description>Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) - 23 subjective quality of life questions. Assessed before and after implantation. Scores are transformed to a range of 0-100, in which higher scores reflect better health status.
There are 3 subscales: Symptom Burden - range 0-100; Physical Limitation - range 0-100; Quality of Life - range 0-100; The total KCCQ score represents the mean (average) of the three subscale scores.</description>
