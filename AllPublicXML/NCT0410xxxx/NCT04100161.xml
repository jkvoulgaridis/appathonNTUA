  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle strain injuries are a particularly frequent type of sports injury in soccer,
      athletics, badminton/ tennis and cross-fit fitness, thereby affecting a broad range of
      popular leisure time activities. Depending on severity, sports-active individuals may
      experience long-term functional impairment and pain. Additionally, individuals having
      sustained one strain injury have a substantially increased risk of injuring the same muscle
      again. Strain injuries lead to long-term, potentially permanent, loss of muscle mass, thereby
      weakening the muscle. Muscle atrophy is likely a major factor in the high re-injury risk.
      Further, strain injuries are associated with a long-term inflammatory response.

      In the current study, the investigators seek to study interventions to prevent the loss of
      muscle mass and elaborate on strategies to address the prolonged inflammation observed at the
      site of the injured muscle.

      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the effect of protein supplementation on the
      reduction of muscle atrophy following a severe muscle strain injury in comparison to a
      carbohydrate supplement. As a second purpose, this study aims to elaborate on findings of
      prolonged inflammation intra-/ intermuscular by large-scale protein analysis and the
      characterization of cells active at the site of injury.

      The study includes the following hypotheses:

        1. Protein supplementation administered in combination with a gradually increasing loading
           regime (rehabilitation with weekly progression in load/ intensity) will be effective in
           reducing the injury-related loss of muscle mass.

        2. The environment at the site of injury is not only pro-inflammatory, but contains
           proteins associated with proteolysis.

        3. Cells belonging to the group of fibro-adipogenic progenitors will be accumulating intra-
           and inter-muscularly.
