  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral small vessel disease is a common cause of cognitive impairment. Remote ischemic
      pre-conditioning (RIC) is a technique to induce brief periods of limb ischemia-reperfusion
      that is hypothesized to increase tolerance of the brain to hypoperfusion and increase
      cerebral blood flow. Patients with cognitive impairment, preserved basic activities of daily
      living, and brain computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of
      confluent white matter hyperintensities or multiple brain infarcts will be randomized to
      either RIC performed once a day on one arm, or twice per day on one arm, for 30 days, to test
      tolerability and effects on MRI markers of blood flow.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) accounts for 20-25% of all strokes and is the most
      common cause of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) as well as a major contributor to mixed
      dementia, potentially interacting with Alzheimer's disease. Remote ischemic pre-conditioning
      (RIC) is a technique to induce brief periods of limb ischemia-reperfusion that is
      hypothesized to increase tolerance of the brain to hypoperfusion. This is a prospective,
      open-label randomized controlled clinical trial with blinded endpoint assessment (PROBE).
      Participants that complete a 14-day run-in period will be randomized to 30 days of either: a)
      RIC performed once per day on one arm, or b) RIC performed twice per day on one arm. Each RIC
      session will consist of 4 cycles of unilateral upper arm ischemia for 5 minutes followed by
      reperfusion for another 5 minutes, administered by modified blood pressure monitor (under an
      Investigational Trail Authorization from Health Canada). The primary outcome is tolerability,
      defined as the proportion in each trial arm that complete 80% or more of the assigned RIC
      sessions. Secondary outcomes will include pain scores, cognition, and MRI markers of cerebral
      blood flow and white matter integrity.
