  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open label Phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of apatinib combined with irinotecan and S-1 (ApaIRIS) in treating Patients with metastatic
      pancreatic cancer after chemotherapy with albumin-bound paclitaxel plus gemcitabine regimen
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While AG (albumin-bound paclitaxel + gemcitabine) is one of the preferred first-line
      chemotherapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer, we have to investigate possible therapeutic
      options after AG regimen. In this single arm, open-label clinical trial, metastatic
      pancreatic cancer patients will be received apatinib, irinotecan and S-1. Treatment repeats
      every 4 weeks until the disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity, death or begin a novel
      therapeutic.

      The efficacy and safety data will be assessed through PFS, OS, ORR and adverse effects as
      graded by CTC-AE 5.0.

Continuous chemotherapy until the criteria for discontinuation of the drug are met (eg, progression of the disease, intolerance of adverse reactions, or withdrawal of informed consent by the patient).
Because the toxicity of apatinib or irinotecan or tigeol in the chemotherapy regimen meets the withdrawal criteria, the drug can be discontinued alone and the exact duration of the trial treatment recorded.</description>
