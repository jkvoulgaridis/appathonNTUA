  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigated the use of Tai Chi as a feasible form of physical activity for women
      with morbid obesity utilizing an instructional digital video disc (DVD). Two groups of women
      with morbid obesity (body mass index of &gt;40) were placed into the Tai Chi intervention group
      or the control group. Initial function was assessed with a series of tests and then repeated
      after 8 weeks. During the 8 weeks, the Tai Chi intervention group met once a week for 45
      minutes to participate in a group exercise class. The control group was asked to continue
      their regular activity. At the end of the 8 weeks, both groups were reassessed with the same
      tests from the start of the study. The investigators hypothesized that the Tai Chi group
      would show more improvement in their functional scores for strength, balance and quality of
      life than the control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate an alternative approach to physical activity in
      people who are morbidly obese to improve their overall health, functional mobility, and
      quality of life. Although physical activity is recommended in most weight management
      programs, the type of physical activity that results in the most successful outcomes has not
      been determined. Walking programs are among the most common forms recommended, however few
      parameters or guidelines are provided, and well-controlled comparisons to other types of
      exercise are lacking. Compliance with exercise programs is also a factor that impacts
      success, therefore offering solutions that improve compliance would be beneficial as well.
      This study investigated the use of home-based exercise enhanced with DVDs along with weekly,
      supervised group sessions to compare Tai Chi to a walking program in participants who are
      morbidly obese.

      The participants were recruited from the community with the requirement that they have a body
      mass index of &gt;40 and have a diagnosis of morbid obesity. A falls risk screening, the Four
      Square Step Test (FSST), was performed on which they must score as a low fall risk. A battery
      of physical and paper tests will be completed prior to starting the study to assess balance,
      endurance, functional lower extremity strength, and quality of life. Both groups completed a
      self-report of their weekly physical activity that was submitted on an Activity Log. Those
      who were designated to be in the control group did not have any additional interaction with
      the study until week 10 when they returned for post-testing. The Tai Chi intervention group
      met one time per week as a group to practice Tai Chi with the DVD as the guide. Physical
      therapy students and faculty were present at each session to modify and supervise as needed.
      The intervention group also followed the DVD in the home setting for 2 additional sessions
      each week. Following the 8 weeks of structured classes and home activity, the participants
      returned the following week for the post-testing session.

    <intervention_model_description>Pretest-posttest control group design: The groups were determined by convenience sample due to the time-sensitive need to form the exercise groups. There were two arms of the study that aligned with two concurrent academic years. The first six participants to express interest were placed in the first Tai Chi intervention group. The next three participants were in the first control group. The second arm of the study had five participants who made contact before the second exercise group began. The second control group had three participants.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Four square step test</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Three-quarter inch diameter plastic tubing was placed on the ground to form a plus sign. The participant was required to step as fast as possible starting in square 1 in a clockwise direction and then returning counterclockwise making full contact in each square with both feet and not touching the tubing. The participants were required to complete the FSST in 15 seconds or less in order to be included in the study based on the research that a time longer than 15 seconds is predictive of multiple falls. The results were compared at the conclusion of the study as an indicator of balance.</description>

    <measure>Zeno Walkway analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to walk along the gait mat for a total of four passes. A piece of tape was placed one meter before and after the gait mat. Participants were instructed to turn around once they reached the piece of tape to decrease the effects of acceleration and deceleration on the gait mat. Data collected on the protokinetics Zeno Walkway included the participants' gait speed, step length, step width, double limb support time, single limb support time and gait cadence.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>36-item short form health survey (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 was used to measure how each participant viewed their physical and mental health. The questionnaire contained sections that covered vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health. Overall, the SF-36 has the ability to measure the well-being of older adults . Scores on the SF-36 range from 0-100, with a lower score identifying greater disability and a higher score suggesting less disability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rapid assessment of physical activity (RAPA)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The RAPA is a subjective questionnaire assessing the participant's level of physical activity including flexibility and strength. The instructions for the RAPA contain a brief description of light, moderate, and vigorous activity. The score ranges from 1 (lowest score) to a maximum of 7. In addition, there is a score of 1 for strengthening exercises and a score of 2 for flexibility. The scores are summed up (maximum score 10) for the final score, which provided information on the participant's self-reported activity level. The RAPA was used as part of this study because it is easily understood by most patients, takes only minutes to complete, and gives valuable information on adults' self-assessment of activity level.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Six minute walk test (6MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 6MWT is a submaximal test of endurance measuring total distance walked in six minutes. A 100 foot walking path was measured down a level, hard surfaced hallway. The participant was asked to repeatedly walk the complete length of the 100 foot walking path as many times as possible in six minutes at a comfortable pace. The participant was allowed to rest during this test, however, the timer did not stop until the six minute time frame had been completed. The total distance upon completion of the 6MWT was documented.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>30 second sit to stand</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 30 Second Sit to Stand is a test of lower extremity functional strength. This test consists of rising from a standard height chair and returning to sitting as many times as the person is able to within 30 seconds without the use of their upper extremities. It is a measure of lower extremity functional strength.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed up and go test</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed Up and Go test (TUG) begins with the participant seated in an armchair. The participant is instructed to stand up and walk at a comfortable pace to a mark three meters in front of the chair, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down. The test is timed, and participants are allowed to use the arms of the chair and an assistive device if they choose. This assessment correlates with fall risk and functional mobility.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Single leg stance test</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Single Leg Stance test (SLS) test measures static balance while standing on one leg, with a longer time indicating better balance ability. A participant would stand on one leg and hold the position as long as they could up to 30 seconds. Participants were required to perform 3 trials with eyes open and 3 trials with eyes closed on both limbs. The longest of the three trials was used for data analysis. The timer was stopped in the following situations: (1) the foot of the non-stance leg touched the floor, (2) the lower extremities made contact with each other, (3) the participant exceeded 30 seconds of single leg stance, or (4) the participant opened their eyes on the eyes closed trial.</description>
