      Evaluation of the effects of the parental support intervention &quot;For our children's sake&quot; on
      positive parenting outcomes when conducted with incarcerated parents in prisons in Sweden.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children of incarcerated parents comprise a greatly disadvantaged group in society with
      elevated risk of ill-health, behavioural problems, and own delinquency and unemployment later
      in life. Positive parenting comprise an important factor for children's positive and healthy
      development. Incarcerated parents may have difficulties to engage in positive parenting due
      to disadvantaged situations affecting parenting negatively such as drug addiction, poverty,
      or lack of experience of positive parenting in their own childhood. Previous research has
      suggested that interventions to prevent the intergenerational effect of criminality should be
      targeting family factors where positive parenting has been emphasised. Internationally
      developed parenting interventions for incarcerated parents suggest an impact on parenting
      outcomes such as positive parent-child interaction, parenting knowledge, empathy, parent
      stress, increased child contact and active parenting, However, the majority of the programmes
      evaluated to date have been conducted in the US, with a prison and probation context with
      limited generalisability to the Swedish system. In Sweden, the parenting programme for
      incarcerated parents, &quot;For our children's' sake&quot; (FOCS) was developed in 2012-2014 with the
      aim to support positive parenting for the child's healthy development and is currently
      delivered in Swedish prisons. The aim of this project is to evaluate the effects of the FOCS
      parenting programme on parenting outcomes through a controlled trial with a parallel
      implementation process evaluation.

          -  Serving a sentence at any of the included prisons

             and 13-18 years will not be included in the primary outcome measure, as the measure is
             not developed for these age groups. These parents will be included in the mediator
             measurements.

          -  Are in contact with their child/children in any form. If not, these parents are
             included in the mediator measurements, as the primary outcome: relationship quality,
             is not applicable.

          -  Having the legal right to contact the child

          -  Not committed either a crime against the child or any violent crime against the other
