  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to evaluate clinical and radiographical outcome of using a
      standardized platelet-rich plasma (PRP) biomembrane following endodontic surgery and its
      correlation with the growth factors content in this concentrate.

    <textblock>
      15 healthy patients of both genders, between 20 and 45 years of age, presenting with 22
      anterior/premolar teeth in need of endodontic surgery were recruited. Teeth presented with
      failed non-surgical root canal therapy and periapical radiolucency of ≥ 1cm in size. Patients
      were randomly divided following surgery into two groups, with 11 teeth each.

    <description>The PAI is a 5-point scale radiographic interpretation designed to determine the absence, presence, or transformation of a disease state. Each of the roots was categorized as: (1) Normal periapical structure; (2) small changes in bone structure; (3) changes in bone structure with some mineral loss; (4) periodontitis with well-defined radiolucent area; and (5) severe periodontitis with exacerbating features. Each category used in the PAI represents a step on an ordinal scale of registration of periapical infection.</description>

    <measure>degree of periapical inflammation using CBCT periapical index (CBCTPAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>CBCTPAI is a 6-point (0 -5) scoring system .The scores were calculated by analysis of the lesion in 3 dimensions, with CT slices being obtained in mesiodistal, buccopalatal, and diagonal directions. The score was determined by the largest extension of the lesion. The measurement of lesion depth in a CBCT image added the variables expansion of cortical bone (E) and destruction of cortical bone (D) usually detected starting from score 2.</description>
