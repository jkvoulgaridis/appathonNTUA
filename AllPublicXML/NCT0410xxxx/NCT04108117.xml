  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Robotic mastectomy and immediate reconstruction have been introduced by Toesca et al. in
      2015. Since then, several studies reported the safety and feasibility of robotic
      nipple-sparing mastectomy and immediate reconstruction. However, most studies were conducted
      by single centers and enrolled in small samples. Furthermore, there is a lack of studies
      comparing surgical and oncologic outcomes between robotic nipple-sparing mastectomy and
      conventional nipple-sparing mastectomy. For this reason, this study evaluates surgical and
      oncologic outcomes of robotic nipple-sparing mastectomy and immediate reconstruction using
      international multicenter data.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an international multi-center pooled analysis using prospective or
      retrospective studies to evaluate surgical and oncologic outcomes of robotic nipple-sparing
      mastectomy and immediate reconstruction.

      Raw data for robotic or conventional nipple-sparing mastectomy from Severance Hospital,
      European Institute of Oncology, Changhua Christian Hospital, and Gustave Roussy is collected.
      Among them, Severance Hospital takes the leading at performing analysis from its researchers
      and,as such, storage and disposal of patient records is managed by its researchers. In the
      analysis process, although the collaborators request records form Severance Hospital if
      necessary, they are only supposed to be provided computerized data which were originally
      clinical data from patients who already ended up treatments. The thing is ,in this case,
      individual data and medical records are not shown.

      Clinicopathologic variables including operation times, hospital stay, medical history,
      smoking history, family history, BMI, menopausal status, specimen weight, TNM stage, grade,
      histological type, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER2, Ki 67, and perivascular
      involvement are analyzed. Postoperative complications in 30 days are collected and classified
      by the Clavien-Dindo grade. Locoregional recurrence-free survival and local and systemic
      recurrences are examined. Patients whose data have been retrospective for at least one month
      are to be examined. Patient's and surgeon's satisfaction using Breast Q is evaluated.

      Categorical variables are examined using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test if
      indicated.

      Continuous variables are examined using the independent t-test or ANOVA if indicated.

      The estimated sample size from the four institutions is about 300 cases for robotic
      nipple-sparing mastectomy and matched cases for conventional nipple-sparing mastectomy.

Robotic nipple-sparing mastectomy should be performed using robotic surgical systems. Robotic surgical systems include da Vinci S,Si, X, Xi, and SP systems. Axillary or lateral incisions are used for this procedure. Immediate reconstruction includes tissue expander insertion, direct-to-implant, latissimus dorsi flap, transverse abdominis rectus muscle flap, or deep inferior epigastric perforators flap. Cases with robotic mastectomy without immediate reconstruction are excluded.

Conventional nipple-sparing mastectomy should not be performed using robotic or endoscopic surgical systems. Axillary or lateral incisions that are similar to incisions in robotic nipple-sparing mastectomy are not allowed. Other than axillary or lateral incisions can be performed for this procedure. Immediate reconstruction includes tissue expander insertion, direct-to-implant, latissimus dorsi flap, transverse abdominis rectus muscle flap, or deep inferior epigastric perforators flap.
