  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      80% of people who have had an amputation still feel pain in the limb that has been amputated
      - Phantom limb pain (PLP). Sensory retraining is a form of treatment for PLP where a special
      form of electrical stimulation is delivered to the residual limb.

      The theory is that this stimulation changes activity in the brain that helps to reduce the
      person's pain. Two new types of sensory retraining device for the treatment of phantom limb
      pain have been developed. One type requires the user to interact with the device while the
      other is a non-interactive device. Both devices are new so it is unknown as to how well they
      may work, or which is best, therefore both will be tested in this study.

      This study will compare the effect of both devices for pain and safety. Ninety-seven people
      with PLP will be recruited from the NHS and the general public and randomised to receive
      either the interactive or non-interactive device. A physiotherapist will train the research
      participants how to use their device. Participants will then use their device at home for 3
      weeks. To ensure that they are using their devices as required, the researcher will keep in
      contact through two visits, weekly phone calls and daily texts. Pain, function and body image
      will be measured at before treatment, after treatment and at a 3 month follow-up. Twelve
      participants will also be invited to a one-to-one interview to give their experience of the
      acceptability and usability of their device.

    <measure>Change in - Overall Pain: Visual Analogue Scale (100mm).</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 3 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to rate their phantom limb pain over the last week using a pain visual analogue scale consisting of a 100mm line with anchor statements of 0 representing no pain and 100 the worst pain imaginable. The participant will be asked to place a mark through the line to represent their pain. On the same sheet participants will be asked to record the number of phantom limb pain episodes they have experienced over the past week and the average duration of these episodes.</description>

    <measure>The short form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 3 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The short from McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ-2) is a commonly used questionnaire to assess pain levels in a range of pain conditions. Twenty words which describe pain across the sensory, affective, evaluative and miscellaneous domains are presented to the participant who is asked to choose which word best describes their pain in the last week and to rate how intense that descriptor of pain was on a 0-10 scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trinity Amputation and prosthetic evaluation scale (modified) (TAPES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 3 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire records information about the participant's amputation history, their levels of pain and their level of functioning. The TAPES has been modified in that it only asks about issues specific to phantom limb pain, residual limb (or stump) pain, and phantom sensations. Additional questions will be asked upon completion of the TAPES questionnaire. These yes/no questions will identify if the patient experiences telescoping, which is a phenomenon where the phantom limb is perceived as shrunken so that the foot/hand feels like it is attached directly to the end of the residual limb, and further questions to exclude PLP caused by Neuroma (Ortiz-Catalan, 2018) and establish if the participant feels that they have active control of the phantom limb or if it is frozen. There are 22 questions in total.</description>

    <measure>EQ5D</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 3 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>A brief easy to use validated measure of quality of life. The EQ5D contains five items related to mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and anxiety/depression. It also contains a visual analogue scale for rating general health.</description>

    <measure>Study Diary (medication use/device use/pain levels)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 3 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to report on their daily medication usage over the duration of the trial in a study diary. When SO visits the patient for the first time to collect baseline data, the participant will be provided with a pain diary and guidance on how to complete it over the coming three weeks (until the post treatment data collection occurs). The SO will also ask participants to retrospectively report their pain medication use over the preceding week. The frequency, dosage and class of medication taken each day will be recorded. In addition patients will be asked to rate their phantom limb pain on a scale from 0-10 each day and to record how many minutes they used the device each day</description>

    <measure>Participant satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 3 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>

    <measure>Usability</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 3 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>

    <measure>Concordance with Protocol</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 3 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>

    <measure>Limb Laterality Recognition Task (LLRT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 3 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are shown an image of a left or right hand or foot (see images below). They are then asked to say if it is a left or right hand/foot. If the amputated limb is a foot, images of feet will be presented and if it is a hand, images of hands will be presented.
Participants will be assessed using a computer version of the LLRT. They will be presented with images of hands/feet on a computer screen that vary in their laterality, view, orientation and rotation; and asked to respond as quickly and as accurately as possible (by pressing one of two keys on a computer keyboard). Presentation of stimuli (images) and resulting data (accuracy and response time) will be controlled and logged using customized software (E-Prime, www.pstnet.com).This test takes approximately 10 minutes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Credibility of Devices</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 3 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>To investigate how credible participants perceived both devices they will be asked to make a judgement, after completing the second set of outcome measures, regarding how well was your device functioning? With response categories ranging from 'I am certain my device was working properly' to 'I am certain my device was not working properly'.</description>

    <description>The interactive device is a sensory retraining device. A band consisting of twelve equally spaced electrodes is placed over the residual limb. This band is connected to a handheld device which delivers an electrical current to the electrodes. The type of electrical current is similar to a TENS device. The device stimulates the skin via one of the electrodes, with either a single, or a rapid burst of pulse(s). The device touch screen then presents the questions, Which electrode (location) was stimulated? Was a single continuous or a rapid burst of pulses given (stimulation type)? The user responds via the screen and is told if they are correct. If correct, a new stimulus is delivered (different location and type) and the process repeated. If incorrect, the user is informed of the correct response, the same stimulation (location and type) is repeated once before moving onto to a new stimulus.</description>
