        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy male or non-pregnant female aged ≥ 18 years with a clinical diagnosis of
             facial papulopustular rosacea.

          2. Subjects must have provided IRB approved written informed consent.

          3. Subjects must have at least 15 and not more than 50 inflammatory facial lesions (i.e.,
             papules/pustules) at screening and baseline visits. For the purposes of study
             treatment and evaluation, these lesions should be limited to the facial treatment area
             including those present on the nose. Lesions involving the eyes, and scalp will be
             excluded from the count.

          4. Subjects must have no more than 2 nodulocystic lesions on the face at Screening and
             Baseline visits.

          5. Subjects must have a definite clinical diagnosis of facial papulopustular rosacea
             severity grade 3 or 4 as per the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) (per Table 1
             below) at screening and baseline visits.

          6. Subjects must have persistent erythema on the face with moderate (2) score or higher
             (per table 2 below) at screening and baseline visits.

          7. Subjects must have a mild (1) to moderate (2) score for telangiectasia on the face.
             (per table 3 below) at screening and baseline visits.

          8. 8. Subjects must be willing to minimize external factors that might trigger rosacea
             flare-ups (e.g., spicy foods, thermally hot foods and drinks, hot environments,
             prolonged sun exposure, strong winds and alcoholic beverages)

          9. Subjects must be willing to refrain from using all other topical medications for
             rosacea during the 12-week treatment period, other than the investigational product.

         10. Female Subjects of childbearing potential (excluding women who are or premenarchal,
             surgically sterilized (by hysterectomy) or postmenopausal for at least 1 year prior to
             screening), in addition to having a negative urine pregnancy test, must be willing to
             use an acceptable form of birth control during the study from the day of the first
             dose administration to 30 days after the last administration of study drug. For the
             purpose of this study the following are considered acceptable methods of birth
             control: oral or injectable contraceptives, contraceptive patches, Depo-Provera®
             (stabilized for at least 3 months prior to screening), NuvaRing® (vaginal
             contraceptive), Implanon™ (contraceptive implant), double-barrier methods (e.g. condom
             and spermicide), IUD, or abstinence with a 2nd acceptable method of birth control
             should the Subject become sexually active. Subjects on hormonal contraception must be
             stabilized on the same type for at least three months prior to screening and must not
             change the method during the study. A sterile sexual partner is NOT considered an
             adequate form of birth control.

         11. All male Subjects must agree to use accepted methods of birth control with their
             partners, from the day of the first dose administration to 30 days after the last

             the protocol, including attendance at the required study visits.

         14. Subjects must be in good health and free from any clinically significant disease,
