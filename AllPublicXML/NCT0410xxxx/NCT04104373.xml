      The Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative (ONDRI) is a province-wide
      collaboration studying dementia and how to improve the diagnosis and treatment of
      neurodegenerative diseases including:

        -  Alzheimer's disease (AD)

        -  Parkinson's disease (PD)

        -  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease)

        -  frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTD)

        -  vascular cognitive impairment, resulting from stroke (VCI)

      The Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative (ONDRI) is a research program
      designed to investigate similarities and differences of dementia among five diseases that
      will improve the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegeneration. The focus is on diseases that
      are associated with dementia: Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment, Parkinson's
      disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease), frontotemporal lobar
      degeneration, and vascular cognitive impairment (resulting from stroke).

      ONDRI is a province-wide collaboration between more than 50 of Ontario's world-class
      neurodegenerative disease researchers and clinicians, four patient advocacy groups, the
      industrial sector, and more than 20 clinical, academic and research centres carried out in
      partnership with the Ontario Brain Institute (OBI).

      Instead of only studying what's unique, our long-term observational study is seeking out the
      common early indicators and risk factors of the five diseases.

      Our mandate is to ensure that the findings from the data collected are transformed into new
      diagnostic methods that will help detect diseases earlier, improved clinical practice that
      puts patients first, and eventually new effective treatments that will slow the diseases from
      progressing or even prevent the disease so people can continue to enjoy the later years of
      their lives.

      More than 600 participants will be followed for up to three years and will complete
      assessments for genomics, gait and balance, eye measurements, neuropsychology, and
      neuroimaging and will donate their data to a comprehensive integrated data management system
      called Brain-CODE.

    <description>Blood samples will be drawn by LifeLabs Medical Laboratory Services located in London, Ottawa, Toronto, Kingston, Thunder Bay, and Hamilton. Under extenuating circumstances, an appointment may be made with LifeLabs to have the blood samples drawn at home or in a residential facility.Samples must be drawn from Monday to Wednesday to allow for weekday shipping and receipt of samples at the OBI Biobank Sample Reception at Robarts Research Institute in London, Ontario (ON). LifeLabs standardized protocols for collection and overnight shipping will be followed. Subsequently, DNA aliquots for NeuroX microarray will be sent to Dr. Ekaterina Rogaeva at the University of Toronto in Toronto, ON. DNA aliquots for the OBI Neurodegeneration Re-sequencing Panel will remain with Dr. Robert Hegele at Robarts Research Institute in London, ON.</description>
