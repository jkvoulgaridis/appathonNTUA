  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A monocenter, non-randomized interventional investigation in 3 panels of adult patients
      undergoing elective colorectal surgery who are at risk to develop postoperative ileus.

      The feasibility to use the VIPUN Gastric Monitoring System prototype 0.3 will be explored in
      this population for the first time.

    <intervention_model_description>Non-randomized investigation in three panels with different eligibility criteria and study procedures.
The target population in each arm consists of 10 'completers'. Completers are defined as: Panel 1: A successful gastric motility recording of at least 6 hours
Panel 2: Patients who develop POI (estimated to be 10% of enrolled subjects) and in who gastric motility was recorded successfully for at least 6 hours
Panel 3: Patients who develop POI, who completed questionnaires for at least 2 days (with a questionnaire completion rate â‰¥50%).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Composite endpoint comprising: procedural success (absence of protocol deviations with regard to motility measurement), tolerability of the device (non-validated questionnaire on nasopharyngeal discomfort and the incidence of intolerance resulting in early removal of the investigational device) and device-related safety (incidence of adverse device effects related to the use of the device).</description>

    <measure>In hospital quality of life (EQ-5D-3L questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 until completion study procedures (maximum 14 days)</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D-3L questionnaire consists of 2 pages: EQ-5D descriptive system and an EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS).
EQ-5D-3L (not an acronym) descriptive system comprises the following five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, and extreme problems. The five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state. EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labelled 'Best imaginable health state' and 'Worst imaginable health state'.</description>
