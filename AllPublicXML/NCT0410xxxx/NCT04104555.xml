  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a child grows the shape of their foot changes and most develop an arch in their foot. For
      some, however, the arch does not fully form or it might be flat against the ground. When this
      happens, it is known as having flat feet which can cause pain in the feet, legs, or back. At
      the moment, we are not sure what the best treatment for flat feet is, so the purpose of this
      research is to conduct a trial to compare three of the most common treatments that are used
      today. Two of the treatments are different types of insoles, which are put inside the shoe.
      The third treatment is some exercises and advice about which types of shoes might help.

      Participants will receive their treatment as part of their normal National Health System
      care. We would like 1055 children and young people aged between six and 16 years old to take
      part in the study. Everyone will receive advice about the type of shoes to wear, ankle
      exercises and things to look out for when children have painful flat feet. In addition to
      this, 422 of the participants will receive an insole that is individually customised for
      them, whilst another 422 will receive a pre-made insole that is the right size. We will ask
      for their help for 12 months. During this time, we will track their progress by sending them
      three questionnaires in the post to fill in and weekly text messages to find out how painful
      their feet are during the first few months. We also want to learn more about the problems
      that flat feet cause, and children's experiences of the treatments delivered as part of this
      clinical trial. We will explore this through in-depth conversations with children and their
      parent(s) or the person who looks after them. Once we have finished the trial, we will work
      with the people who took part in the trial, and clinicians, to make sure that our results can
      be used by as many people as possible.

      In addition to the main OSTRICH study we will run three additional studies. The first will
      find out if including a pen and having information about the study in the form of a video in
      addition to information in a paper booklet will increase the number of participants who take
      part in the study. The second will find out if sending participants a birthday card will
      increase the number of questionnaires returned to the study team. The third study will take a
      3D impression of the participant's foot and see if it changes over the course of the study.

      The aim of the study is to undertake a large, pragmatic, multi-armed, randomised controlled
      trial to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of custom-made and prefabricated orthoses
      in addition to exercises and advice compared with exercises and advice alone on the physical
      functioning of children with symptomatic flat feet. We will aim to recruit 1055 children with
      flat feet. They will be allocated to one of three groups, in a 2:2:1 ratio to either (a)
      custom orthoses plus exercises and footwear advice, (b) prefabricated orthoses plus exercises
      and footwear advice or (c) exercises and footwear advice only. We will follow the
      participants up for 12 months after randomisation to assess their physical functioning,
      levels of pain and quality of life. We will undertake qualitative interviews with
      approximately 30 children and their parents, to find out about their experiences of having
      flat feet, and of being in the trial.

      In addition to the main OSTRICH study we will undertake two additional trial methodological
      Studies within a Trial (SWAT) and a sub-study.

      The pen and signposting to multimedia trial information SWAT: This SWAT will evaluate the
      effectiveness of including a pen and/or signposting to multimedia trial information in the
      patient information sheet, which is sent to participants in their recruitment pack.

      The birthday card SWAT: This SWAT will evaluate the effectiveness of sending a birthday card
      to participants on response rates to postal questionnaires.

      Foot scan sub-study: This embedded observational sub-study will assess the capability of a 3D
      scanning approach to identify and stratify severity of pes planus and to assess change in
      foot shape over the duration of the trial. We will investigate the associations between
      aspects of foot shape and score on the physical domain scale of the OxAFQ-C.

    <measure>Physical domain subscale of the Oxford Ankle Foot Questionnaire for Children (OxAFQ-C) over the 12 month follow-up period.</measure>
    <time_frame>For the primary comparison the physical domain subscale will be compared between the groups using a linear covariance pattern mixed model to estimate the effect over the whole 12 month followup, incorporating data from all available time points</time_frame>
    <description>The OxAFQ-C is a self-report health status measure questionnaire for child patients (aged 5-16) affected by foot and ankle conditions that are considered important to children. There are three domains, whose domain scores are reported separately (ie there is no total score). For the primary outcome however, we will just use the physical domain subscale. There are 6 items on the 'Physical' domain. The response options to each item are on a 5-point scale rated from never (4), rarely (3), sometimes (2), very often (1) to always (0), where the number in brackets represents the value that should be applied to each response. The total 'physical domain score' is divided by the maximum for the domain ie 24. This score can then be transformed to a percentage scale (0-100) to aid interpretation. A higher score for a domain represents better functioning. This will be rated by the child (participant) and their parent/legal guardian using a proxy version.</description>

    <time_frame>Collected at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months post randomisation</time_frame>
    <description>The OxAFQ-C is a self-report health status measure questionnaire for child patients (aged 5-16) affected by foot and ankle conditions that are considered important to children. This item was added to reflect the concern by many children that they can or cannot wear the footwear they prefer. It is a 5-point scale rated from never (4), rarely (3), sometimes (2), very often (1) to always (0), where the number in brackets represents the value. It is reported as a single item with higher score representing better functioning. This will be rated by the child (participant) and their parent/legal guardian using a proxy version.</description>

    <measure>EuroQoL-Five Dimension Youth</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected at baseline, 3,6 and 12 months post randomisation</time_frame>
    <description>The EuroQoL-5 Dimension Youth (EQ5DY) is a child friendly, generic quality of life measure. Health status is measured in terms of 5 domains: &quot;mobility&quot;, &quot;looking after myself&quot;, &quot;doing usual activities&quot;, &quot;having pain or discomfort&quot; and &quot;feeling worried, sad or unhappy&quot;. Each dimension has 3 levels ranging from 1 no problems, 2 some problems and 3 a lot of problems. The respondent is asked to indicate their health state by ticking in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions. From these 5 dimensions an EuroQoL-5 Dimension Youth (EQ5DY) value is calculated. This measure also includes a Visual Analogue Scale on how good or bad the participant's health is &quot;today&quot;, on a vertical scale of 0 to 100. The endpoints of the scale are labelled &quot;100 The best health you can imagine&quot; and &quot;0 The worst health you can imagine.&quot; This will be rated by the child (the participant) and their parent/legal guardian (using a proxy version).</description>

    <measure>Child Health Utility 9D (CHU9D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected at baseline, 3,6 and 12 months post randomisation</time_frame>
    <description>The Child Health Utility 9D (CHU9D) is a paediatric self-reported generic quality of life measure. It consists of nine dimensions; &quot;worried&quot;, &quot;sad&quot;, &quot;pain&quot;, &quot;tiredness&quot; &quot;annoyed&quot;, &quot;school work/homework&quot;, &quot;sleep&quot;, &quot;daily routine&quot; and &quot;able to join in activities&quot;. The measure is rated on a five point scale on which the participants rate the level to how they are feeling, with a &quot;don't&quot; sentence linked with no problems (e.g. I don't feel sad today) and &quot;very&quot; with the participant experiencing a lot of problems (e.g. I feel very sad). Calculation of an universal score is supported by a specific scoring algorithm, with 1 representing 'full health' and 0 'death'. In this study the CHU9D is rated by the child (the participant) and their parent/legal guardian (using a proxy version).</description>
