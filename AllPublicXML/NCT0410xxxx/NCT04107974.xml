      Percutaneous (through the skin) radiologic (x-ray guided) gastrostomy (to the stomach) (PRG)
      is a common procedure performed to help provide supplemental nutrition for those for who have
      difficulty swallowing their food. This population typically includes patients receiving
      radiation therapy for cancers of the mouth or throat, patients who have had a stroke or other
      neurologic disorders. It involves making a small incision in the skin on the belly to insert
      a feeding tube directly into the stomach. PRG has been well established as a safe and
      effective procedure for many years now. Although known to be safe, there is still debate
      regarding the best way to perform the procedure. Some doctors believe it is necessary to
      stitch the stomach wall against the wall of the belly before inserting the tube, this is
      called gastropexy. They argue that this decreases the risk of the tube being positioned
      incorrectly and prevents leakage of stomach content in the first few weeks after the
      procedure. Other doctors feel that these risks are very small and this step is not required
      as it can cause the patient more pain in the days following the procedure since the stomach
      is fixed against the body wall and cannot move naturally. To this day, the procedure is
      performed safely both ways, depending on the hospital.

      The purpose of this research study is to compare these two methods and determine if one
      technique gives better results, meaning less pain and fewer complications for patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When percutaneous radiological gastrostomy (PRG) first emerged as an alternative method to
      surgical or endoscopic techniques, gastropexy was considered an essential step. This consists
      of using sutures and &quot;T-fasteners&quot; to fix the anterior gastric wall to the anterior abdominal
      wall and many variations are described in the literature. It was postulated that this step is
      necessary to avoid tube misplacement and peritonitis caused by early leakage of gastric
      content around the site of tube insertion. It is still considered imperative in some groups
      of patients at high risk of gastric leakage (i.e. patients with ascites, steroid treatment,
      and/or severe malnourishment). However, in other patients its use has become subject of
      debate.

      Experiments with animal models have shown no evidence of gastric leakage following insertion
      of a 14 French tube, even when the tube is subsequently removed and the defect left
      unrepaired. Furthermore, several groups have had success without the use of gastropexy and
      some have described complications caused by performing this step such as peristomal
      infection, increased post-procedural pain, persistent leakage, and gastrocutaneous fistulas.
      Other large series of patients who underwent gastrostomy with gastropexy did not experience
      gastropexy-related complications, further complicating the matter. To date, the guidelines
      for transabdominal gastrostomy published by the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) and
      American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) acknowledge both techniques but have no
      official recommendation on the use of gastropexy reflecting the lack of clear evidence
      regarding advantage with or without its use.

      The investigators hypothesize that the use of gastropexy for PRG does not significantly
      decrease complications.

      The investigators also hypothesize that the use of gastropexy is associated with increased
      post procedural pain.

      At the investigators' institution (University Health Network) PRG without gastropexy is
      regularly performed first-line for gastrostomy. There is a high volume of requests for PRG
      and thus establishing which method is superior will help to reduce the number of
      complications and revisions. In doing so, the investigators hope to be able to establish an
      optimal evidence-based protocol for PRG for future patients as well as improving patient
      safety and satisfaction.

Midazolam and fentanyl are administered for conscious sedation. Lidocaine for local analgesia. The stomach is insufflated with air after insertion of an OG or NG tube. Two T-fasteners are inserted into the stomach approximately 4cm apart. A needle is inserted into the stomach and an Amplatz wire is then inserted into the stomach. The tract is dilated with an 18Fr peel away sheath. A 14 Fr balloon retention gastrostomy tube is inserted. The balloon is inflated and bolster set as appropriate.
