    <textblock>
      Background: Although patients' education programs improve health-related knowledge that
      promote individual capacity to understand basic health information, there is a scarcity in
      the studies that address cardiac educational programs for patients with coronary artery
      diseases in Jordan and their impact on patients` health outcomes.

      Aim: the aims of this study are to assess the level of knowledge and satisfaction of patients
      with coronary artery disease and to evaluate the effect of implementing a cardiac educational
      program on patient's level of knowledge and satisfaction.

      Methods: This study will be carried out using a true experimental two groups pre and post-
      test. The necessary information will be collected from 138 patients with CAD in the north of
      Jordan using the Coronary Artery Disease Education Questionnaire (CADE-Q) and the Patient
      Satisfaction Scale (PSS).

      The expected outcomes include establishing foundational knowledge about the effectiveness of
      cardiac educational program on patient health related out comes. Evidence on the effect of
      cardiac educational program will help patients to recover from a heart attacks, prevent
      future heart problems, hospital stays and death related to heart problems as well as making a
      necessary life style changes.

      Keywords: coronary artery disease, educational program, patient satisfaction, patient
      knowledge.

    <description>level of knowledge using The Coronary Artery Disease Education Questionnaire Short Version (CADE- Q SV) . The CADEQ-SV was designed to be a true/false/I do not know questionnaire, with 20 items (4 in each domain). The CADE- Q SV was divided into four subscales. These include the following: firstly, items number 1, 3, 6,11 and 15 are related to the first part which covers the medical condition. Secondly, items number 2, 12, 16, and 18 are related to the second part which covers the risk factors. Thirdly, items number 5,9,14, and 20 deal with the third part which covers the nutrition. Fourthly, items number 4, 18, 13, and 17 deal with the fourth part which covers the physical exercise. Finally, items number 7, 10, and 19 are concerned with the fourth part which covers the psychological factors. Each correct answer equals
1 point; therefore, the maximum score possible is 20 overall</description>

    <description>Patient Satisfaction Scale (PSS) to measure the satisfaction level in likert scale (strongly disagree, disagree, not sure agree, and strongly agree).The PSS was designed to evaluate patients' attitudes towards nurses and nursing. It is a 25 items Likert- type summated rating scale with three dimensions of patient satisfaction: technical- professional care, educational relationship, and trusting relationship. Both positive and negative items were included in each subscale. Each question was assessed on a five-point Likert measurement scale ranging from &quot;Strongly agree&quot; (=5) to &quot;Strongly disagree&quot; (=1). The higher the PSS score is, the higher is the patient satisfaction with the nursing care provided (Hinshaw and Atwood 1982).</description>

    <description>&quot;Love your Heart&quot; is a Heart Foundation program (2016), the Arabic version will be used as the educational program in this study. The programme has been adopted from relevant articles in the evidence- based literature. The program is a guide to support recovery and good heart health. It includes the following: anatomy and physiology of the heart, causes, symptoms and risk factors of CAD, healthy diet, physical activity, weight management, and risk factors management.</description>
