    <textblock>
      The current available treatments for PTSD are not fully effective for cognitive symptoms of
      PTSD and have high drop-out and poor engagement, two factors found to be most indicative of
      overall return to functioning for patients with PTSD. The proposed study directly addresses
      this knowledge gap by conducting a pilot, fixed-dose, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, and cross-over trial using atomoxetine (ATX) as an add-on medication to
      other therapies to testing the efficacy of ATX in reducing ADHD cognitive symptoms among
      veterans with comorbid ADHD/PTSD. Successful completion of this pilot clinical trial may
      build a platform for future large scale double-blind, placebo-controlled studies using either
      atomoxetine or other cognitive enhancing medications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Combat Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often show cognitive impairments in
      attention, working memory, executive functions, and inhibitory control, a cluster of symptoms
      resembling symptoms of ADHD. The presence of comorbid ADHD cognitive symptoms is often
      associated with greater PTSD clinical severity and poorer treatment outcomes. While
      treatments for the avoidance, arousal, and re-experiencing symptoms associated with PTSD for
      military personnel are readily available, substantial gaps exist in the treatment of the
      cognitive deficits associated with PTSD. As a result, untreated co-occurring ADHD cognitive
      symptoms in PTSD may have severe negative impacts on patients' functional recovery, treatment
      outcome, and quality of life. The proposed study directly addresses this knowledge gap by
      testing the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of atomoxetine (ATX) in treatment of ADHD
      cognitive symptoms among those with comorbid ADHD/PTSD. This is a small prospective, 10-week,
      fixed-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and cross-over trial of ATX as an
      add-on medication to other therapies in Veterans with comorbid ADHD/PTSD. Primary outcome
      measures will be ADHD cognitive symptom reduction and quality of life improvement as measured
      by the Adult ADHD Rating Scales-Self-Report: Short Version (CAARS-S:S) and the Adult ADHD
      Quality of Life-29 (AAQoL-29). Secondary outcome measures will be PTSD and depressive
      symptoms reduction as measured by the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), the Hamilton
      Depression Scale (HAM-D). In addition to subjective measures, the response inhibition task
      Go/NoGo (GNG) will be used as objective assessments to measure ATX treatment outcomes. The
      proposed work is innovative; it applies novel therapeutic agent to treat cognitive symptoms
      in PTSD. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply a SNRI to address an often
      overlooked PTSD-cognitive deficit. This study is directly responsive to the mission of
      RR&amp;D-SPiRE &quot;to maximize functional recovery&quot; of cognitive function in PTSD. The outcome of
      the proposed research will be significant, because it provides a knowledge base to help
      determine who is at risk for developing treatment resistance among PTSD patients, thereby
      allowing for development of early intervention strategies. More importantly, this clinical
      trial may immediate benefit Veterans by enhancing their cognitive function, reducing ADHD
      symptoms related disability, and further improving quality of life for veterans suffer from
      comorbid ADHD/PTSD.

    <description>Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales-Self-Report: Short Version (CAARS-S:S, Conner et al, 1999): The CAARS-S:S is a 26-item questionnaire that assesses symptoms of ADHD in persons aged 18 years or older. T-scores above 65 indicate a likelihood of moderate to severe ADHD symptoms and impairment. The range for the CAARS-S:S is from 0 to 78. A score of 78 would resemble the worst symptoms of ADHD with a score 0 having no symptoms.</description>

    <description>The Adult ADHD Quality of Life-29 (AAQOL-29, Brod et al, 2006): AAQoL-29 is a 29-item questionnaire designed to assess quality of life and was a secondary efficacy measure in this trial. It is a participant-reported outcome measure used to examine disease specific functional impairments and quality of life for adults with ADHD. The AAQoL is scored as an overall total score, measuring Life Productivity, Psycholofical Health, Relationship, and Life Outlook. Each item is rated by patients on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;Not at all/Never&quot; (1) to &quot;Extremely/Very Often&quot; (5). To derive overall scores, item scores are transformed to a 0-100-point scale (1=0; 2=25; 3=50; 4=75; 5=100). Then, the item scores are summed up and divided by item count to generate overall scores. The score range from 0 to 100. A higher score indicates greater QoL and better functioning.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Veterans age 20 to 60 with PTSD and significant ADHD symptoms (CAARS-S:S &gt; 65);

          -  Good physical health.

          -  Evidence of combat as defined by:

               -  Trauma exposure sufficient to meet Category A of PTSD criteria (Breslau and
                  Kessler 2001)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age younger than 20 or greater than 60.

          -  Known sensitivity to ATX

          -  Presence of disorders that could conceivable be exacerbated by atomoxetine
             (specifically, narrow angle closure glaucoma, urinary outflow obstruction,
             hypertension, and neurological disorders, particularly tics and Tourette's syndrome,
             or a history of epilepsy or seizures).

          -  Use of concomitant medication that could potentially interact with atomoxetine
             including monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), antihypertensive medication, or any
             concomitant medication that was a cytochrome 2D6 inhibitor (CYP2D6), since
             atomoxetine's elimination involves the CYP2D6 system.

             otherwise specified. The project will allow presence of depressive disorders if the
             depressive episodes are secondary to PTSD.

          -  Current substance dependence and abuse (within 3 month).

          -  Females who are pregnant.

          <description>The CAARS-S:S is a 26-item questionnaire that assesses symptoms of ADHD in persons aged 18 years or older. T-scores above 65 indicate a likelihood of moderate to severe ADHD symptoms and impairment. The range for the CAARS-S:S is from 0 to 78. A score of 78 would resemble the worst symptoms of ADHD with a score 0 having no symptoms. This measurement can be used for both diagnostic and symptoms severity evaluations. Therefore it is used both in screening and follow up visits.</description>

        <description>The Adult ADHD Quality of Life-29 (AAQOL-29, Brod et al, 2006): AAQoL-29 is a 29-item questionnaire designed to assess quality of life and was a secondary efficacy measure in this trial. It is a participant-reported outcome measure used to examine disease specific functional impairments and quality of life for adults with ADHD. The AAQoL is scored as an overall total score, measuring Life Productivity, Psycholofical Health, Relationship, and Life Outlook. Each item is rated by patients on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;Not at all/Never&quot; (1) to &quot;Extremely/Very Often&quot; (5). To derive overall scores, item scores are transformed to a 0-100-point scale (1=0; 2=25; 3=50; 4=75; 5=100). Then, the item scores are summed up and divided by item count to generate overall scores. The score range from 0 to 100. A higher score indicates greater QoL and better functioning.</description>
