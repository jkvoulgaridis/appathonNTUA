  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of two portions: The first portion- Phase 1, or dose-escalation portion,
      that will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of venetoclax in combination with
      low-dose cytarabine (LDC), define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and generate data to
      support a recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) in treatment-naïve participants with Acute
      Myelogenous Leukemia (AML). Second portion, initial Phase 2 that will evaluate if the RPTD
      has sufficient efficacy and acceptable toxicity to warrant further development of the
      combination therapy. Subsequently, Phase 2 Cohort C, will evaluate the overall response rate
      (ORR) for participants allowed additional supportive medications (strong Cytochrome P450 3A
      (CYP3A )inhibitors) if medically indicated.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assessed each event as either having a reasonable possibility or no reasonable possibility of being related to the use of study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent events (TEAEs) are defined as any event that began or worsened in severity after the first dose of study drug.</description>
