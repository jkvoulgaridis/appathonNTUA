  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the effect of an ankle foot orthoses (AFO) on
      the primary outcome of peak walking time (PWT) in patients with peripheral artery disease
      (PAD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will test the hypothesis that PAD patients using an AFO during a graded
      exercise test will demonstrate a greater PWT compared to PWT assessed without the use of an
      AFO. Secondary hypotheses include evaluation of the effect of an AFO on: 1) calf muscle
      function, 2) claudication onset time, 3) functional ability, 4) peak oxygen consumption, and
      5) patient-reported outcomes. We will also examine the effects of the AFO on outcomes
      following 12 weeks of community walking.

    <measure>Change in WIQ Distance Subscore</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In the Walking Impairment Questionnaire distance subcategory, participants are asked to rate the degree of difficulty walking specific distances on a scale from 0 to 4. A score of 0 indicates the inability to walk the distance specified by the question while a score of 4 represents no difficulty. The graded sub-score is multiplied by a pre-specified weight for each sub-category: distance, speed, and number of flights of stairs. The products of these subscores are summed and divided by the maximum possible score to obtain a percent score, ranging from 0 (inability to perform item) to 100 (no difficulty in performing item).</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In the Walking Impairment Questionnaire speed subcategory, participants are asked to rate the degree of difficulty walking one block at specific speeds, ranging from walking slowly to jogging, on a scale from 0 to 4. A score of 0 indicates the inability to walk the distance specified by the question while a score of 4 represents no difficulty. The graded sub-score is multiplied by a pre-specified weight for each sub-category: distance, speed, and number of flights of stairs. The products of these subscores are summed and divided by the maximum possible score to obtain a percent score, ranging from 0 (inability to perform item) to 100 (no difficulty in performing item).</description>

    <description>In the Walking Impairment Questionnaire stair-climbing subcategory, participants are asked to rate the degree of difficulty climbing a specified number of stair flights, ranging from 1 to 3 stair flights, on a graded scale of 0 to 4. A score of 0 indicates the inability to climb the flights specified by the question while a score of 4 represents no difficulty. The graded sub-score is multiplied by a pre-specified weight for each sub-category: distance, speed, and number of flights of stairs. The products of these subscores are summed and divided by the maximum possible score to obtain a percent score, ranging from 0 (inability to perform item) to 100 (no difficulty in performing item).</description>

These subscores are weighted sums of the questions in each section. Scores range from 0 - 100. Lower scores = more disability, higher scores = less disability.</description>

        <title>Change in WIQ Distance Subscore</title>
        <description>In the Walking Impairment Questionnaire distance subcategory, participants are asked to rate the degree of difficulty walking specific distances on a scale from 0 to 4. A score of 0 indicates the inability to walk the distance specified by the question while a score of 4 represents no difficulty. The graded sub-score is multiplied by a pre-specified weight for each sub-category: distance, speed, and number of flights of stairs. The products of these subscores are summed and divided by the maximum possible score to obtain a percent score, ranging from 0 (inability to perform item) to 100 (no difficulty in performing item).</description>
