  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ASP2151 is an experimental treatment for herpes. Patients undergoing organ and tissue
      transplantation may be prescribed ciclosporin to suppress their immune system to give the
      transplant an increased chance of not being rejected. A patient with a compromised immune
      system is more susceptible to infections such as herpes, which will require treatment.

             medicine within the previous 3 months.

          -  Loss of more than 400 mL blood during the 3 months before the trial, eg as a blood
             donor.

          -  Presence or history of drug or alcohol abuse, or intake of more than 21 units of
             alcohol weekly or more than 5 cigarettes daily.

          -  Evidence of drug abuse on urine testing.

          -  Positive test for hepatitis B antigen (HBsAg); or positive test for hepatitis B core
             antibody (HBcAb).

          -  Positive test for hepatitis C, HIV1, HIV2, or active and latent tuberculosis.

          -  Blood pressure and heart rate in seated position at the screening examination outside
             the ranges 90-140 mm Hg systolic, 40-90 mm Hg diastolic; heart rate 40-100 beats/min.

          -  Possibility that the volunteer will not cooperate with the requirements of the
             protocol.

          -  Objection by General Practitioner (GP) to volunteer entering trial.

      <recruitment_details>Participants took part in the study at one investigative site in United Kingdom from 06-October 2014 to 10-February 2015
Each participant was randomised to 2 groups. One group was received ASP 400mg in first intervention and 1200mg in other group. There was a washout of at least 2 weeks between the interventions.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants received a single dose of 400mg or 1200mg ASP2151 on Days 1 and 7, 100 mg ciclosporin twice daily on Days 3–9, and once in the morning of Day 10. Two participants were withdrawn during the washout period, in the second intervention, another participants were replaced.</pre_assignment_details>
