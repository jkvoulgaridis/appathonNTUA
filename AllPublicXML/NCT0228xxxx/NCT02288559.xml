  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, randomized, single-masked, sham injection-controlled study will investigate
      the exposure-response and safety of lampalizumab administered intravitreally every 2 weeks
      (Q2W) or every 4 weeks (Q4W) for 24 weeks in participants with geographic atrophy (GA)
      secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). A safety run-in assessment will be
      conducted prior to initiating enrollment in the randomized study.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Geographic Atrophy (GA) Area, as Assessed by Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>GA or the death of photoreceptors and surrounding cells in the retina, is a common condition in participants with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The death of these photoreceptors results in lesions that cause vision loss. The change in GA lesion area was measured by FAF and analysis of FAF images was performed by the central reading center. A positive change from baseline indicates an increase in size of geographic atrophy lesion area (worsening; disease progression). BCVA=best corrected visual acuity; ETDRS=Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Scale.</description>

    <measure>Serum Concentrations of Lampalizumab (Q2W)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1, predose and postdose), Weeks 2,4,8,16 and 24, early termination, unscheduled predose and postdose</time_frame>
    <description>Lower than reportable (LTR) results on pre-dose sample were set to 0, and LTR results on post-dose sample were set to half of lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) (0.5 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL)).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serum Concentrations of Lampalizumab (Q4W)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1, predose and postdose), Weeks 4,8,16 and 24, early termination</time_frame>
    <description>LTR results on pre-dose sample were set to 0, and LTR results on post-dose sample were set to half of LLOQ (0.5 ng/mL).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Ocular Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to approximately 30 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether considered related to the medicinal product, any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease, recurrence of an intermittent medical condition, or any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test. Ocular AEs are the events which are localized in the ocular region.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Systemic (Non-ocular) Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to approximately 30 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether considered related to the medicinal product, any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease, recurrence of an intermittent medical condition, or any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test. Non-ocular AEs were the systemic events.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Anti-Lampalizumab Antibodies</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to approximately 30 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Having treatment-induced anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) was defined as being ADA-negative at baseline and ADA-positive at any post-baseline timepoint. Having treatment-enhanced ADAs was defined as being ADA-positive at baseline with titer values increased by 0.6 titer units at any post-baseline timepoint.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 332 participants were screened and 92 participants were randomized out of which 3 participants from one site were removed from the randomized population due to serious good clinical practice (GCP) noncompliance. Out of 89, 4 participants were excluded from the randomized population as they did not have any post-baseline measurement.

          <title>Geographic Atrophy Area, as Assessed by Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF)</title>
          <description>GA or the death of photoreceptors and surrounding cells in the retina, is a common condition in participants with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The death of these photoreceptors results in lesions that cause vision loss. The change in GA lesion area was measured by FAF and analysis of FAF images was performed by the central reading center.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Geographic Atrophy (GA) Area, as Assessed by Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF) at Week 24</title>
        <description>GA or the death of photoreceptors and surrounding cells in the retina, is a common condition in participants with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The death of these photoreceptors results in lesions that cause vision loss. The change in GA lesion area was measured by FAF and analysis of FAF images was performed by the central reading center. A positive change from baseline indicates an increase in size of geographic atrophy lesion area (worsening; disease progression). BCVA=best corrected visual acuity; ETDRS=Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Scale.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
        <population>Modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population included participants who were randomly assigned to study treatment and had at least one post-baseline GA area measurement. Number analyzed is the number of participants with data available for analysis at the given time-point.</population>
