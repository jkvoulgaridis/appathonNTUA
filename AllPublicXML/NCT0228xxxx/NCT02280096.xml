  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Twenty four relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients over the age of 18, with
      similar degree of disability, and with an evolution of at last 6 months, who are in
      first-line immunomodulatory therapy and have a stable disease (no more than one outbreak per
      year) will be included in the present study. Patients will be administered a
      neuropsychological test battery selected for this study and divided into two sessions of one
      and a half-hour each. Emotional state will be assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory in
      a different session. Cognitive impairment is defined as the alteration of two or more
      neuropsychological tests. Patients will be divided randomly into two groups where one will
      receive placebo and the other one 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP) for a period of 22 weeks in
      increasing doses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consecutive patients with stable multiple sclerosis are being recruited from the neurological
      services of Social Security Mexican Institute (IMSS) at the National Medical Center (CMN)
      &quot;Siglo XXI&quot; Specialties Hospital over the period of 1 year. Of those meeting inclusion
      criteria, 24 will be selected for the study. After signing an informed consent, they will be
      randomized into 12 for the intervention arm and 12 for the placebo arm. All patients will
      receive capsules for daily consumption according to their assignment, with no visible
      difference between capsules. Dosage will be 6.5-7.5 mg/kg to a limit of 50 mg. These capsules
      will be taken for a period of 22 weeks. A battery of neuropsychological tests will be
      administered at baseline, after 22 weeks, and after an additional 22 weeks of follow-up to
      assess cognitive performance and motor function. Emotional state will be assessed with the
      Beck Depression Inventory at each of the three afore mentioned points.

      After the follow-up period, all test results will be analyzed and compared to determine the
      efficacy and safety of 4-aminopyridine on the cognitive performance and motor function of
      patients. Mann-Whitney U will be used for statistical analysis.

    <measure>Five Digit Test (FDT). Processing Speed</measure>
    <time_frame>8-10 min</time_frame>
    <description>Processing speed information (which includes reading, count, and alternation speed). Cards with a different number of stimuli are shown to the patient, who has to read, count, and respond to a change of instructions (alternation). Reading speed (min 12, max 31+ seconds), counting speed (min 14, max 28+ seconds), and alternation speed (min 26, max 56+ seconds) are recorded. Less speed corresponds to a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST)</measure>
    <time_frame>10-15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Is used primarily to assess perseveration and abstract thinking, allows the clinician to assess the following 'frontal' lobe functions: strategic planning, organised searching, utilising environmental feedback to shift cognitive sets, directing behaviour toward achieving a goal. WCST measures abstract reasoning and ability to alter problem solving strategies. Patients are given 128 response cards and 4 stimulus cards and asked to match each stimulus card to 1 pile of response cards. The patient is not told how to match the cards, only &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; to each placement. The examiner may change matching rules during the test. Perseveration errors occur when subject repeats the same error no matter how many times they are told the placement is wrong. Higher scores indicate a worse cognitive performance (min=0-3, max=58-126)</description>

    <measure>Tower Of London (TOL). Total Moves and Total Correct Moves</measure>
    <time_frame>25-30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Measures higher order problem-solving ability. The information it provides is not only useful when assessing frontal lobe damage, but also when evaluating attention disorders and executive functioning difficulties. The administrator arranges red, green, and blue beads on a peg board to match the configuration in the diagram. The patient is asked to replicate the configuration on a second peg board. Scores are calculated for Total Correct Moves and Total Moves. Total moves: higher scores indicate a worse cognitive performance (min= 0, max=58+); Total correct higher scores indicate a better cognitive performance (min=0, max=10).</description>

    <measure>Tower Of London (TOL). Execution Time and Problem-solving Time</measure>
    <time_frame>25-30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Measures higher-order problem-solving ability. The information it provides is not only useful when assessing frontal lobe damage, but also when evaluating attention disorders and executive functioning difficulties. The administrator arranges red, green, and blue beads on a peg board to match the configuration in the diagram. The patient is asked to replicate the configuration on a second peg board. Scores are calculated for Total Execution Time (since the patient performs the first move until he ends the test), Total Problem-Solving Time (the sum of planning and execution times). Total execution time higher scores indicate a worse outcome (min= 0-78, max=564+ seconds), Total problem-solving time higher scores indicate a worse outcome (min= 0-56, max=500+ seconds).</description>

    <measure>Improved Physical Capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>15-20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is a method of quantifying disability in multiple sclerosis and monitoring changes in the level of disability over time. It is widely used in clinical trials and in the assessment of people with MS. The EDSS scale ranges from 0 to 10 in 0.5 unit increments that represent higher levels of disability. Scoring is based on an examination by a neurologist. The first levels 1.0 to 4.5 refers to people with a high degree of ambulatory ability and the subsequent levels 5.0 to 9.5 refers to the loss of ambulatory ability. It also provides eight subscale measurements called Functional System (FS) scores. The levels of function within each category refer to the eight FS affected by MS: The FS are scored on a scale of 0 (low level of problems) to 5 (high level of problems) to best reflect the level of disability observed clinically.</description>

    <measure>Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) is one of the most frequently used inventories for measuring fatigue in people with chronic illnesses. The FSS questionnaire is comprised of nine statements inquiring about the examinee's sleep habits over the preceding week. Ratings are on a 7-point Likert scale, where higher scores indicate how strongly the patient agrees with the nine statements.Scale. Scoring using a bimodal response system or a Likert score with weights assigned to each response choice. Likert or bimodal rating scales with 4 response options. For the Likert Scale: better than usual= 0, no more than usual= 1, worse than usual= 2, much worse than usual= 3. For the bimodal scale: better than usual= 0, no more than usual= 0, worse than usual= 1, much worse than usual= 1. Sum all items for a total score. Score range. Range is 0 -11 for bimodal response format. Interpretation of scores. Higher score indicates more fatigue. Self report scale</description>

    <measure>Walk</measure>
    <time_frame>5-10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Timed 25 Foot Walk Test (T25-FW). The T25-FW is a quantitative mobility and leg function performance test based on a timed 25-walk. The patient is directed to one end of a clearly marked 25-foot course and is instructed to walk 25 feet as quickly as possible, but safely. The time is calculated from the initiation of the instruction to start and ends when the patient has reached the 25-foot mark. The task is immediately administered again by having the patient walk back the same distance. Patients may use assistive devices when doing this task. TIME LIMIT PER TRIAL (2) 3 minutes (180 seconds) per trial.</description>

        <title>Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST)</title>
        <description>Is used primarily to assess perseveration and abstract thinking, allows the clinician to assess the following 'frontal' lobe functions: strategic planning, organised searching, utilising environmental feedback to shift cognitive sets, directing behaviour toward achieving a goal. WCST measures abstract reasoning and ability to alter problem solving strategies. Patients are given 128 response cards and 4 stimulus cards and asked to match each stimulus card to 1 pile of response cards. The patient is not told how to match the cards, only &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; to each placement. The examiner may change matching rules during the test. Perseveration errors occur when subject repeats the same error no matter how many times they are told the placement is wrong. Higher scores indicate a worse cognitive performance (min=0-3, max=58-126)</description>

        <title>Tower Of London (TOL). Total Moves and Total Correct Moves</title>
        <description>Measures higher order problem-solving ability. The information it provides is not only useful when assessing frontal lobe damage, but also when evaluating attention disorders and executive functioning difficulties. The administrator arranges red, green, and blue beads on a peg board to match the configuration in the diagram. The patient is asked to replicate the configuration on a second peg board. Scores are calculated for Total Correct Moves and Total Moves.

        <description>The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is a method of quantifying disability in multiple sclerosis and monitoring changes in the level of disability over time. It is widely used in clinical trials and in the assessment of people with MS. The EDSS scale ranges from 0 to 10 in 0.5 unit increments that represent higher levels of disability. Scoring is based on an examination by a neurologist. The first levels 1.0 to 4.5 refers to people with a high degree of ambulatory ability and the subsequent levels 5.0 to 9.5 refers to the loss of ambulatory ability. It also provides eight subscale measurements called Functional System (FS) scores. The levels of function within each category refer to the eight FS affected by MS: The FS are scored on a scale of 0 (low level of problems) to 5 (high level of problems) to best reflect the level of disability observed clinically.</description>

        <description>Safety surveillance will be done every two weeks from the beginning of the study, intentionally searching for adverse events (AE). EEG (Diffuse or focal cerebral dysfunction through demonstration of background slowing or presence of epileptiform activity assessed by a neurophysiologist) and laboratory tests (Presence of values higher of the normal value established by local laboratory and related to the administration of treatments), blood and urine samples: creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, total cholesterol, triglycerides, total direct, and indirect bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine kinase, lactic acid dehydrogenase, amylase and lipase. A complete blood cell count with differentials and a routine urinalysis and urine culture also obtained at each visit, will be done before the patients take 40, 50 and 60 mg/day.
