    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Orthopedic procedures are common in the United States. These include joint replacement and
      spine surgeries. Researchers want to study data about these procedures over time. They want
      to see if treatment has gotten better. They also want to find ways to change the care that
      people get before and after they have these procedures. These changes may lower the risk of
      problems people can have during and after treatment. They may also improve people s results.

      Objectives:

      - To study a series of questions about surgery, medicine, treatments, and outcomes for
      orthopedic procedures.

      Eligibility:

      - Data from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from 1999 to 2015.

      Design:

        -  Researchers will look at data for people ages 20-100.

        -  No new participants will be used in this study.

        -  The study will last 6 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major orthopedic procedures, including total joint replacement and spine surgeries, are among
      the most common procedures in the population. Learning about how often these surgeries are
      performed can give indications of whether the treatment of arthritis and other
      musculoskeletal conditions has been improving over time. Learning about the complications
      associated with these surgeries can give indications about ways to alter the care of patients
      before and after surgeries that may decrease the risk of complications and improve patient
      outcomes. We will analyze Medicare and Medicaid data from 1999 to 2015 to examine a series of
      questions, including whether the use of joint replacement surgery has changed over time among
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, to see if rheumatoid arthritis
      medications are associated with some types of surgical complications, to see if
      anticoagulation medication after joint replacement is associated with the risk of
      complications, to see if regional differences in surgery rates can be explained by
      differences in patient characteristics, and to determine the surgical treatment for hip
      fractures that is associated with the fewest long-term complications. From the Framingham
      Heart Study Cohort, we will study the changes in the incidence of hip fractures and the risk
      factors for osteoporosis over time.

        -  Subjects will be either Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries with available claims from
             1999 to 2014. For projects requiring detailed medication information, inclusion will
             be limited to those with Part D claims from 2006 to 2014. Eligibility for each project
             will be based on claims for the appropriate disease (e.g. RA) or procedure (e.g. hip
             arthroplasty).

        Medicare beneficiaries will be excluded (or censored) if they do not have both Part A and
        Part B coverage, or enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans (Part C), as detailed claims for
        these beneficiaries are not available. We will also exclude dual-eligible (Medicare and
        Medicaid recipients) as these subjects have distinct clinical conditions (e.g. blindness)
        that distinguishes them from most Medicare beneficiaries. There will be no exclusions based
        on gender, race, ethnicity, or cognitive impairment.
