      This study aims to develop and validate a test for diagnosing ovarian and endometrial cancers
      early. It relies on detecting somatic mutations that are associated with these cancers in a
      biofluids sample taken from the cervix and the uterine cavity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For women in high-income countries, ovarian/fallopian tube and endometrial cancers are within
      the top four cancers in terms of incidence, death and healthcare expenditure. The deaths
      associated with these cancers are largely caused by stage III/IV disease, for which cure
      rates have not changed in three decades, despite escalating costs of treatment. Attempts at
      early diagnosis have been ineffective in reducing mortality, because the high-grade subtypes,
      which account for the majority of deaths, metastasize while the primary cancer is still
      small, has not caused symptoms, and is undetectable by imaging or blood tumour markers.

      In recent years, the recognition that somatic mutations are early steps in carcinogenesis has
      led to a shift from tests such as imaging and non-specific blood tumour markers to technology
      that detects cancer-associated mutations in cervical, uterine, or blood samples. Several
      DNA-tagging technologies have been shown to be capable of identifying small amount of cancer
      DNA among thousands of normal cells, the proverbial needle in a haystack.

      This investigation aims to develop and validate an in-house developed DNA tagging technology
      'DOvEEgene-Haloplex' for the early diagnosis of endometrial and ovarian cancers. The assay
      pipeline for barcoding and agnostic testing of the biofluids must lend itself to automation
      and high throughput testing. It must have good sensitivity and more importantly very high
      specificity, as the only way to corroborate a positive test is to remove the uterus, tubes
      and ovaries.

        The participating hospitals run multiple weekly routine gynecology and gynecologic oncology
        clinics. The cases include women scheduled to undergo surgery for tumor removal, for either
        proven or suspected upper genital tract cancer. The controls include women scheduled to
        have a hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy (removal of the fallopian tubes) with/without
        bilateral oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) to treat benign conditions.
