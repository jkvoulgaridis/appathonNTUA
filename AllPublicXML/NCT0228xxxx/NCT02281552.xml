      This is a 12 week study that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the 11 mg tofacitinib
      modified release tablet taken once a day in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who continue
      taking methotrexate. Results for the modified release tablets will be compared to the
      efficacy and safety of the 5 mg tofacitinib immediate release tablets taken twice a day in
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis who continue taking methotrexate.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28 is a measure of disease activity in participants with rheumatoid arthritis. DAS28-4 (CRP) was calculated from swollen joint count (SJC) and tender/painful joint count (TJC) using 28 joints count, CRP (milligrams per liter [mg/L]) and patient global assessment of disease activity on a 100 millimeter (mm) visual analog scale (VAS: scores ranging from 0 mm [very well] to 100 mm [extremely bad], higher scores indicate worse health condition). Total DAS28-4 (CRP) score range: 0 (none) to 9.4 (extreme disease activity), higher score indicated more disease activity. DAS28-4 (CRP) [less than or equal to] &lt;= 3.2 implied low disease activity and greater than (&gt;) 3.2 to &lt;=5.1 implied moderate disease activity, &gt;5.1 implied high disease activity, and DAS28-4 (CRP) less than (&lt;) 2.6 implied remission.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints Using 4 Variables (DAS28-4) (C-Reactive Protein [CRP]) at Week 12</title>
        <description>DAS28 is a measure of disease activity in participants with rheumatoid arthritis. DAS28-4 (CRP) was calculated from swollen joint count (SJC) and tender/painful joint count (TJC) using 28 joints count, CRP (milligrams per liter [mg/L]) and patient global assessment of disease activity on a 100 millimeter (mm) visual analog scale (VAS: scores ranging from 0 mm [very well] to 100 mm [extremely bad], higher scores indicate worse health condition). Total DAS28-4 (CRP) score range: 0 (none) to 9.4 (extreme disease activity), higher score indicated more disease activity. DAS28-4 (CRP) [less than or equal to] &lt;= 3.2 implied low disease activity and greater than (&gt;) 3.2 to &lt;=5.1 implied moderate disease activity, &gt;5.1 implied high disease activity, and DAS28-4 (CRP) less than (&lt;) 2.6 implied remission.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 12</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI assesses the degree of difficulty a participant has experienced during the past week in 8 categories of daily living activities: dressing/grooming; arising; eating; walking; reach; grip; hygiene; and other activities over past week. Each activity category consisted of 2-3 items. Each item scored on 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered.

        <description>SF-36 is a participant reported standardized survey designed to assess generic health related quality of life. It consisted of 36 items evaluating 8 aspects of functional health and well-being: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, social functioning, mental health, role emotional, vitality, and general health. The score range for each of the 8 health aspects was from 0 (poor health) to 100 (better health), higher scores indicating good health condition. Scores of 8 health aspects were aggregated to derive the two component scores (physical component scores [PCS], mental component scores [MCS]) ranging from 0 (worst) to 100 (best), where higher scores indicated good health condition.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D was a participant completed instrument designed to assess impact on quality of life in terms of a single utility score in five domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression with 3 possible answers for each item (1=no problem, 2=moderate problems, 3=severe problems). The 5-dimensional systems are converted into a single index utility score between 0 and 1, where higher score indicated a better health state.</description>

        <description>An Adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent AEs were events between first dose of study drug and up to 12 weeks that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included both serious and non- serious adverse events.</description>
