    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Medtronic
      hybrid closed-loop (HCL) system utilizing the proportional-integral-derivative algorithm with
      insulin feedback (PID-IFB) optimized to function in a hybrid mode with closed-loop control
      operating during the day and night.

    <textblock>
      Study participants will be asked to use the CGM and the study insulin pump provided for
      approximately 4 to 5 days prior to initiation of the HCL PID-IFB system in a hotel setting
      for another 4 to 5 days. All participants with diabetes and the parent/ guardian of
      participants &lt; 18 years of age will be asked to stay overnight in a hotel while the HCL
      PID-IFB system is on and to remain close to Stanford University during the day. For
      participants &gt; 18 years of age, designated remote monitors will be asked to receive alerts
      for low/ high glucose levels.

      Enrolled participants will be asked to complete evaluations to describe their user
      experience/ evaluation of the system.Each participant had a companion (parent/ legal guardian
      of participants &lt; 18 years of age, or the designate remote monitor for participants &gt; 18
      years of age) who will consent to monitor the participant and complete an evaluation, but
      will not be considered enrolled in the study.

            <description>In part 1, participants used the system with Android interface running the algorithm; in part 2, participants used the integrated system which ran the algorithm on the pump.
Medtronic Hybrid Closed-Loop System used by adults for five days in open-loop (algorithm off; sensor augmented pump) and five days in closed-loop (algorithm on). Algorithm was the PID-IFB (proportional-integral-derivative insulin feed-back) algorithm.</description>
