    <textblock>
      In the majority of patients with the chronic urticaria, the etiology is unclear, leading to
      difficulties in treatment and high rates of recurrence. According to the International
      EAACI/GA2LEN/EDF/WAO Guidelines (the Dermatology Section of the European Academy of
      Allergology and Clinical Immunology(EAACI), the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network
      (GA2LEN), the European Dermatology Forum (EDF) and the World Allergy Organization (WAO) in
      Urticaria, using the Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire in a routine management
      is the key for a better treatment outcome. To translate this questionnaire into Thai is
      essential in our subject of interest in order to effectively apply it to local patients. The
      Thai-version questionnaire will encourage enhanced as well as impactful therapeutic options
      for Thai chronic urticaria patients.

      1. Adaption of the Cu-Q2oL questionnaire into Thai version by using forward-backward
           translation that is independently performed by two bilingual translators. The original
           Italian version is translated into Thai by two Thai native speakers, then the study team
           reviews the Thai-version Cu-Q2oL questionnaire for items comprehensibility and
           integrates the first consensus version which re-translated into Italian by an Italian
           native speaker afterwards. The comparison between the backward Italian version Cu-Q2oL
           questionnaire and the original Cu-Q2oL is carried out to find out whether there are any
           misconception and mistranslation in the intermediary forward version of questionnaire.
           After that, the second consensus version will be tested on 15 chronic urticaria patients
           to detect any misunderstanding points based on patients' comments. Finally, this
           Thai-version of CU-Q2oL questionnaire will be used to investigate the validity,
           reliability, interpretability and minimal clinical important difference.

        2. To investigate the validity, reliability and interpretability of Thai-version of Chronic
           Urticaria Quality of Life Questionaire (CU-Q2oL), the severity of chronic urticaria
           symptoms will be assessed by investigators and patients using the Urticaria Activity
           Score (UAS7), the DLQI and CU-Q2oL questionnaire.

    <description>Cross-cultural validity is the degree to which the performance of the Thai CU-Q2oL items can adequately reflect the performance of the original CU-Q2oL items. Exploratory factor analysis was used to determine scales with proper item division of the Thai CU-Q2oL. Principal component analysis with varimax rotation was employed. An eigenvalue ≥ 1 was chosen as the criterion to retain domains. Each item was classified into the domain when loading with a domain loading ≥ 0.5.</description>

    <measure>Mean Total Score and Domain of Thai CU-Q2oL Scores From the Thai Version to Investigate Reliability of Thai-Version CU-Q2oL</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>- The CU-Q2oL Questionnaire is a 23-item HRQoL questionnaire. It measures three dimensions (scales) of HRQoL: domain I (sleep, leisure, concentration), domain II (symptom, eating limits), and domain III (mental status, looks, impact on life activities) The scores of domain I of CUQ2oL range between 0 and 26. The scores of domain II of CUQ2oL range between 0 and 39.The scores of domain III of CUQ2oL between 0 and 35.
The minimum possible score is 0 and the maximum possible score is 100 for total scale.
-The DLQI scores range from 0-30. Domain I (leisure), Domain II (symptoms and feeling), and Domain III (daily activities, work, school, and personal relationships). Meaning of DLQI Scores: 0-1 = no effect, 2-5 = small effect, 6-10 = moderate effect, 11-20 = very large effect, 21-30 = extremely large effect.
The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired for both the CUQ2oL and the DLQI.</description>

    <description>The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and area under the curve (AUC) are acceptable as the units of measure for assess the ability of a questionnaire to changes in patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) impairment over time that represents to responsiveness to change and minimal clinical important difference (MCID).
The AUC of the ROC analysis of 1, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7 and 0.5 were considered perfect, excellent, good, fair, and no better than chance, respectively.</description>

The UAS7 scores were recorded by the patient themselves seven days prior to each visit.</description>

It comprises 10 questions corresponding to six domains: Symptoms and feeling, Daily activities, Leisure, Work and school, Personal relationships, and Treatment. The total DLQI score ranges from 0 to 30. Dr. Finlay previously gave formal permission to the first author to validate and use the Thai version of the DLQI questionnaire. The DLQI Scores of 0-1, 2-5, 6-10, 11-20, and 21-30 mean no effect, small effect, moderate effect, very large effect, extremely large effect on quality of life.</description>

For each item, patients were asked to choose between five response values (scored 0–4) indicating the intensity of each item in the last 2 weeks. A total summed score across all items was calculated and transformed into scores ranging from 0 to 100, with a score of 100 indicating the worst HRQoL impairment.</description>

        <title>Cross-Cultural Validity of Thai-version CU-Q2oL</title>
        <description>Cross-cultural validity is the degree to which the performance of the Thai CU-Q2oL items can adequately reflect the performance of the original CU-Q2oL items. Exploratory factor analysis was used to determine scales with proper item division of the Thai CU-Q2oL. Principal component analysis with varimax rotation was employed. An eigenvalue ≥ 1 was chosen as the criterion to retain domains. Each item was classified into the domain when loading with a domain loading ≥ 0.5.</description>

        <title>Mean Total Score and Domain of Thai CU-Q2oL Scores From the Thai Version to Investigate Reliability of Thai-Version CU-Q2oL</title>
        <description>- The CU-Q2oL Questionnaire is a 23-item HRQoL questionnaire. It measures three dimensions (scales) of HRQoL: domain I (sleep, leisure, concentration), domain II (symptom, eating limits), and domain III (mental status, looks, impact on life activities) The scores of domain I of CUQ2oL range between 0 and 26. The scores of domain II of CUQ2oL range between 0 and 39.The scores of domain III of CUQ2oL between 0 and 35.
The minimum possible score is 0 and the maximum possible score is 100 for total scale.
-The DLQI scores range from 0-30. Domain I (leisure), Domain II (symptoms and feeling), and Domain III (daily activities, work, school, and personal relationships). Meaning of DLQI Scores: 0-1 = no effect, 2-5 = small effect, 6-10 = moderate effect, 11-20 = very large effect, 21-30 = extremely large effect.
The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired for both the CUQ2oL and the DLQI.</description>
