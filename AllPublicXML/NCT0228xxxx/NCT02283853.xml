    <textblock>
      The main objectives of Part 1 are as follows: To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      efficacy of BG00012 in pediatric subjects with RRMS, as compared with a disease-modifying
      treatment and to assess health outcomes and evolution of disability. The primary objective of
      Part 2 is to evaluate the long-term safety of BG00012 in subjects who completed Week 96 in
      Part 1 of Study 109MS306. The secondary objective of Part 2 is to describe the long-term MS
      outcomes of BG00012 in subjects who completed Week 96 in Part 1 of Study 109MS306.

The range of main categories include (0) = normal neurologic exam; to (5) = ambulatory without aid or rest for 200 meters; disability severe enough to impair full daily activities; to (10) = death due to MS.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have a body weight of ≥30 kg.

          -  Must have a diagnosis of RRMS (consensus definition for pediatric RRMS [Krupp 2007]).

          -  Must be ambulatory with a baseline EDSS score between 0 and 5.5, inclusive.

          -  Must have experienced at least 1 of the following 3 conditions: a) at least 1 relapse
             within the last 12 months prior to Day 1 with a prior brain MRI demonstrating lesions
             consistent with MS; b) at least 2 relapses within the last 24 months prior to Day 1,
             with a prior brain MRI demonstrating lesions consistent with MS; c) evidence of
             Gd-enhancing lesions of the brain on an MRI performed within the 6 weeks prior to Day
             1.

          -  Must be neurologically stable, with no evidence of relapse within 50 days prior to Day
             1 and no evidence of corticosteroid treatment within 30 days prior to Day 1.

          -  Subjects of childbearing potential who are sexually active must be willing to practice
             effective contraception during the study and be willing and able to continue
             contraception for at least 30 days after their final dose of study treatment.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary progressive, secondary progressive, or progressive relapsing MS (as defined by
             [Lublin and Reingold 1996]). These conditions require the presence of continuous
             clinical disease worsening over a period of at least 3 months. Subjects with these
             conditions may also have superimposed relapses but are distinguished from
             relapsing-remitting subjects by the lack of clinically stable periods or clinical
             improvement.

          -  Disorders mimicking MS, such as other demyelinating disorders (e.g., acute
             disseminated encephalomyelitis), systemic autoimmune disorders (e.g., Sjögren disease,
             lupus erythematosus), metabolic disorders (e.g., dystrophies), and infectious
             disorders.

          -  History of premalignant or malignant disease. Subjects with basal cell carcinoma that
             has been completely excised prior to screening will remain eligible.

          -  History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions, or known drug hypersensitivity
             to DMF, fumaric acid esters, or interferon beta-1a (IFN Beta-1a).

          -  History of abnormal laboratory results indicative of any significant endocrinologic,
             hematologic, hepatic, immunologic, metabolic, urologic, renal, and/or any other major
             disease that would preclude participation in a clinical study.

          -  History of clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, GI, dermatologic, growth,
             developmental, psychiatric (including depression), neurologic (other than MS), and/or
             other major disease that would preclude participation in a clinical study.

             -.History of human immunodeficiency virus.

          -  An MS relapse that has occurred within 50 days prior to Day 1 AND/OR the subject has
             not stabilized from a previous relapse prior to Day 1.

          -  Other unspecified reasons that, in the opinion of the Investigator or Biogen Idec,
             make the subject unsuitable for enrollment.

          -  For the PD/PK subset of subjects: subjects unable to swallow the BG00012 capsule
             whole.

        Key Treatment history

          -  Any previous treatment with Fumaderm (fumaric acid esters) or BG00012.

          -  Prior treatment with any of the following: total lymphoid irradiation, cladribine,
             T-cell or T-cell receptor vaccination, any therapeutic monoclonal antibody, with the
             exception of rituximab or natalizumab.

          -  Prior treatment with any of the following medications within the 12 months prior to
             Day 1: mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, rituximab.

          -  Prior treatment with any of the following medications or procedures within 6 months
             prior to Day 1: fingolimod; teriflunomide; natalizumab; cyclosporine; azathioprine;
             methotrexate; mycophenolate mofetil; laquinimod; intravenous (IV) immunoglobulin;
             plasmapheresis or cytapheresis

          -  Treatment with any of the following medications within 30 days prior to Day 1:
             steroids (IV or oral corticosteroid treatment, including agents that may not act
             through the corticosteroid pathway [e.g.low dose naltrexone]), 4-aminopyridine or
             related products (except subjects on a stable dose of controlled-release fampridine
             for 3 months)
