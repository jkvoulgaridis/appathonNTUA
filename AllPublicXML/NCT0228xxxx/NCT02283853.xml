    <textblock>
      The main objectives of Part 1 are as follows: To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      efficacy of BG00012 in pediatric subjects with RRMS, as compared with a disease-modifying
      treatment and to assess health outcomes and evolution of disability. The primary objective of
      Part 2 is to evaluate the long-term safety of BG00012 in subjects who completed Week 96 in
      Part 1 of Study 109MS306. The secondary objective of Part 2 is to describe the long-term MS
      outcomes of BG00012 in subjects who completed Week 96 in Part 1 of Study 109MS306.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have a body weight of ‚â•30 kg.

          -  Must have a diagnosis of RRMS (consensus definition for pediatric RRMS [Krupp 2007]).

          -  Must be ambulatory with a baseline EDSS score between 0 and 5.5, inclusive.

          -  Must have experienced at least 1 of the following 3 conditions: a) at least 1 relapse
             within the last 12 months prior to Day 1 with a prior brain MRI demonstrating lesions
             consistent with MS; b) at least 2 relapses within the last 24 months prior to Day 1,
             with a prior brain MRI demonstrating lesions consistent with MS; c) evidence of
             Gd-enhancing lesions of the brain on an MRI performed within the 6 weeks prior to Day
             1.

          -  Must be neurologically stable, with no evidence of relapse within 50 days prior to Day
             1 and no evidence of corticosteroid treatment within 30 days prior to Day 1.

          -  Subjects of childbearing potential who are sexually active must be willing to practice
             effective contraception during the study and be willing and able to continue

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary progressive, secondary progressive, or progressive relapsing MS (as defined by
             [Lublin and Reingold 1996]). These conditions require the presence of continuous
             clinical disease worsening over a period of at least 3 months. Subjects with these
             conditions may also have superimposed relapses but are distinguished from
             relapsing-remitting subjects by the lack of clinically stable periods or clinical
             improvement.

          -  Disorders mimicking MS, such as other demyelinating disorders (e.g., acute
             disseminated encephalomyelitis), systemic autoimmune disorders (e.g., Sj√∂gren disease,
             lupus erythematosus), metabolic disorders (e.g., dystrophies), and infectious
             disorders.

          -  History of premalignant or malignant disease. Subjects with basal cell carcinoma that
             has been completely excised prior to screening will remain eligible.

          -  History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions, or known drug hypersensitivity
             to DMF, fumaric acid esters, or interferon beta-1a (IFN Beta-1a).

          -  History of abnormal laboratory results indicative of any significant endocrinologic,
             hematologic, hepatic, immunologic, metabolic, urologic, renal, and/or any other major
             disease that would preclude participation in a clinical study.

          -  History of clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, GI, dermatologic, growth,
             developmental, psychiatric (including depression), neurologic (other than MS), and/or
             other major disease that would preclude participation in a clinical study.

             -.History of human immunodeficiency virus.

          -  An MS relapse that has occurred within 50 days prior to Day 1 AND/OR the subject has
             not stabilized from a previous relapse prior to Day 1.

          -  Other unspecified reasons that, in the opinion of the Investigator or Biogen Idec,
             make the subject unsuitable for enrollment.

          -  For the PD/PK subset of subjects: subjects unable to swallow the BG00012 capsule
             whole.

        Key Treatment history

          -  Any previous treatment with Fumaderm (fumaric acid esters) or BG00012.

          -  Prior treatment with any of the following: total lymphoid irradiation, cladribine,
             T-cell or T-cell receptor vaccination, any therapeutic monoclonal antibody, with the
             exception of rituximab or natalizumab.

          -  Prior treatment with any of the following medications within the 12 months prior to
             Day 1: mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, rituximab.

          -  Prior treatment with any of the following medications or procedures within 6 months
             prior to Day 1: fingolimod; teriflunomide; natalizumab; cyclosporine; azathioprine;
             methotrexate; mycophenolate mofetil; laquinimod; intravenous (IV) immunoglobulin;
             plasmapheresis or cytapheresis

          -  Treatment with any of the following medications within 30 days prior to Day 1:
             steroids (IV or oral corticosteroid treatment, including agents that may not act
             through the corticosteroid pathway [e.g.low dose naltrexone]), 4-aminopyridine or
             related products (except subjects on a stable dose of controlled-release fampridine
             for 3 months)
