  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a new type of vaccine as a possible treatment for patients
      with glioblastoma. This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of
      an investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the
      intervention to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is
      being studied and that research doctors are trying to find more about it. It also means that
      the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the Personalized NeoAntigen
      Cancer Vaccine for any use in patients, including people with glioblastoma.

      The purpose of the initial study cohort (Cohort 1) is to determine if it is possible to make
      and administer safely a vaccine against glioblastoma by using information gained from
      specific characteristics of the participants tumor. It is known that glioblastomas have
      mutations (changes in genetic material) that are specific to an individual patient's tumor.
      These mutations can cause the tumor cells to produce proteins that appear very different from
      the body's own cells. It is possible that these proteins used in a vaccine may induce strong
      immune responses, which may help the body fight any tumor cells that could cause the
      glioblastoma to come back in the future.

      Three additional cohorts (1a, 1b, &amp; 1c) were added to the study following completion of
      accrual to the original study cohort (cohort 1). Each new cohort receives NeoVax and
      radiation therapy as administered to cohort 1 and will also receive pembrolizumab: cohort 1a
      patients will start pembrolizumab w/in 2 weeks after start of RT, and continue every 3 weeks
      for up to 2 years; cohort 1b patients will start pembrolizumab 2-4 weeks after completion of
      NeoVax priming, and continue every 3 weeks for up to 2 years; cohort 1c patients will receive
      a single dose of pembrolizumab administered within 2 weeks after start of RT, re-start 2-4
      weeks after completion of NeoVax priming, and continue every 3 weeks for up to 2 years. The
      rationale for adding these new cohorts is: 1) to assess the safety and feasibility of NeoVax
      when administered with pembrolizumab; and 2) to determine if the timing of anti-PD-1
      administration impacts the immunogenicity of NeoVax.

      An additional sub-study cohort (1d) is being added for patients whose tumor is
      MGMT-methylated. Cohort 1d will enroll patients with tumors for which the MGMT status is
      methylated or partially methylated; patients on cohort 1d will receive standard daily
      temozolomide during radiation and as adjuvant therapy for up to six cycles following
      completion of radiation therapy. The rationale for adding cohort 1d is to determine the
      safety and feasibility of NeoVax when administered with pembrolizumab and temozolomide.

      It is known that glioblastomas have mutations that are specific to an individual patient's
      tumor. These mutations can cause the tumor cells to produce proteins that appear very
      different from the body's own cells. It is possible that these proteins used in a vaccine may
      induce strong immune responses, which may help the body fight any tumor cells that could
      cause glioblastoma to recur.

      Methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) is a DNA repair protein which can be increased in some
      cancers, including glioblastoma. MGMT works to repair the DNA of cancer cells that are
      damaged by treatment. If a tumor is found to be &quot;unmethylated&quot;, it means there is more MGMT
      present in the tumor than one that is &quot;methylated&quot;.

      Methylation of MGMT is believed to make tumor cells more responsive to drugs like
      temozolomide. Studies have shown that temozolomide provides a very small improvement in
      outcome for many patients whose glioblastoma is MGMT-unmethylated.

      Patients with glioblastoma usually receive six weeks of radiation with a daily chemotherapy
      called temozolomide after their surgery, followed by six to twelve months of additional
      temozolomide. In this study, only participants whose tumors are MGMT-methylated will receive
      temozolomide; those participants whose tumors are MGMT-unmethylated will not receive
      temozolomide, as studies have shown that temozolomide provides a very small improvement in
      outcome for many patients whose glioblastoma is MGMT-unmethylated.

      On this trial, an initial cohort of participants (Cohort 1) will receive the Personalized
      NeoAntigen Vaccine (5 priming doses and 2 booster doses over ~ 20 weeks) after having
      completed six weeks of standard radiation. The study will examine the safety of the vaccine
      when given at several different time points and will examine the participant blood cells for
      signs that the vaccine induced an immune response.

      Three additional cohorts (1a, 1b, &amp; 1c) were added to the study following completion of
      accrual to the original study cohort (cohort 1). Each new cohort receives NeoVax and
      radiation therapy as administered to cohort 1 and will also receive pembrolizumab: cohort 1a
      patients will start pembrolizumab w/in 2 weeks after start of RT, and continue every 3 weeks
      for up to 2 years; cohort 1b patients will start pembrolizumab 2-4 weeks after completion of
      NeoVax priming, and continue every 3 weeks for up to 2 years; cohort 1c patients will receive
      a single dose of pembrolizumab administered within 2 weeks after start of RT, re-start 2-4
      weeks after completion of NeoVax priming, and continue every 3 weeks for up to 2 years.

      The rationale for adding cohorts 1a, 1b and 1c is: 1) to assess the safety and feasibility of
      NeoVax when administered with pembrolizumab; and 2) to determine if the timing of anti-PD-1
      administration impacts the immunogenicity of NeoVax.

      An additional sub-study cohort (1d) is being added for patients whose tumor is
      MGMT-methylated. Cohort 1d will enroll patients with tumors for which the MGMT status is
      methylated or partially methylated; patients on cohort 1d will receive standard daily
      temozolomide during radiation and as adjuvant therapy for up to six cycles following
      completion of radiation therapy. The rationale for adding cohort 1d is to determine the
      safety and feasibility of NeoVax when administered with pembrolizumab and temozolomide.

             or intracavitary treatment, brachytherapy, Novo-Tumor Treating Fields (Optune), or
             investigational therapeutic agents. (Cohort 1d participants may have already initiated
             or completed their RT with concomitant TMZ, and may have initiated their adjuvant TMZ
             at the time of study entry as long as they do not have evidence of progressive disease
             and have undergone a leukopheresis with adequate mononuclear cell collection.)

          -  History of severe allergic reactions attributed to any vaccine therapy for the
             prevention of infectious diseases;

          -  Active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease or immunosuppressive conditions that
             has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease
             modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs) with the exception of
             vitiligo, type 1 diabetes, residual autoimmune-related hypothyroidism requiring
             hormone replacement, or psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment. Replacement
             therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy
             for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic
             treatment.

          -  Known chronic infections with HIV, hepatitis B (HBV) or C (HCV), Hepatitis B virus DNA
             and testing for HCV RNA must be undetectable.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection requiring treatment, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia;

          -  Any underlying medical condition, psychiatric condition or social situation that in
             the opinion of the investigator would compromise study administration as per protocol
             or compromise the assessment of AEs;

          -  Planned major surgery;

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because personalized neoantigen peptides
             and poly-ICLC are agents with unknown risks to the developing fetus. Because there is
             an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with personalized neoantigen peptides and poly-ICLC, nursing
             women are excluded from this study;

          -  Individuals with a history of an invasive malignancy are ineligible except for the
             following circumstances; a) individuals with a history of invasive malignancy are
             eligible if disease-free for at least 3 years and are deemed by the investigator to be
             at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy; b) individuals with the following
             cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated - carcinoma in situ of the breast, oral
             cavity or cervix and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin;

        Coh 1a/1b/1c/1d Exclusions:

               -  Note: Subjects with less than or equal to Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to
                  this criterion and may qualify for the study.

               -  Note: If subject received major surgery, subject must have recovered adequately
                  from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting
                  therapy.

               -  Note: Cohort 1d participants may have already received their radiation therapy
                  with concomitant temozolomide, and may have initiated their adjuvant
                  temozolomide, at the time of study entry as long as they do not have evidence of
                  progressive disease and have undergone a leukopheresis with adequate mononuclear
                  cell collection.

          -  Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)

          -  Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate proved
             the disease is stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four
             weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have
             returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are
             not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does
             not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical
             stability;

          -  Has known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis.

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Examples
             of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps,
             rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BDG, and Typhoid vaccine.

               -  Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu
                  vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist)
                  are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed
