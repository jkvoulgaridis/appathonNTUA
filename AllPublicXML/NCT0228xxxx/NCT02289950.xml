  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MORAb-003-011 is a global, multicenter, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled study to
      assess the safety and efficacy of farletuzumab in combination with standard chemotherapy in
      subjects with low CA125 platinum sensitive ovarian cancer in first relapse.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be enrolled into 1 of 2 chemotherapy treatment arms at the investigator's
      discretion: carboplatin plus paclitaxel or carboplatin plus Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin
      (PLD), and then randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive weekly farletuzumab 5 mg/kg or placebo
      (ie, Test Article). All subjects will receive a loading dose for the first 2 weeks of 10
      mg/kg Test Article (farletuzumab or placebo). Subjects will be stratified at randomization by
      individual chemotherapy treatment regimen (targeted 1:1 ratio) and platinum-free interval
      following first-line therapy (6 to 12 months vs greater than 12 to 36 months).

    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS) based on the investigators' radiographic assessments utilizing RECIST 1.1 criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 50 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization to the date of the first observation of progression or date of death, whatever the cause. If progression or death is not observed for a subject, the PFS time will be censored at the date of last tumor assessment without evidence of progression prior to the date of initiation of further antitumor treatment or the cut-off date, whichever is earliest.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 77 months</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death, due to all causes. If death is not observed for a subject, the overall survival (OS) time will be censored at the last date known to be alive or the cut-off date, whichever is earliest.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Length of First vs Second Platinum-Free Interval</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 77 months</time_frame>
    <description>Length of first platinum-free interval is defined as the period of time (in months) from the date of completion of previous platinum based chemotherapy until date of first relapse, as recorded on the eCRF. The date of first relapse is the progression date based on a radiographic assessment. Similarly, length of second platinum-free interval is defined as the period of time (in months) from the date of completion of platinum based chemotherapy (last dosing date) during the study until the date of progression based on the investigator's radiographic assessment (RECIST 1.1).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tumor Response: Objective Response (OR) per RECIST 1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 77 months</time_frame>
    <description>OR is defined as either a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) using RECIST 1.1 criteria. Tumor assessments performed up to the initiation of further anti-tumor treatment will be considered.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tumor Response: Time to Response (TTR) per RECIST 1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 77 months</time_frame>
    <description>TTR is defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization to the date of first observation of response (PR or CR).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tumor Response: Duration of Response (DR) per RECIST 1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 77 months</time_frame>
    <description>DR is defined as the time (in months) from the date of first observation of response (PR or CR) to the date of the first observation of progression based on the investigator's radiographic assessment (RECIST 1.1), or date of death, whatever the cause.</description>
