    <textblock>
      The central goal of this study is to determine and compare the similarities and differences
      in regional brain uptake of [18F]T807 in patients with typical Alzheimer's Disease (AD),
      Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA), and Logopenic Variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia
      (lvPPA). The investigators will correlate patterns of [18F]T807 binding with magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI)-based regional volumetric and cortical thickness measures. If
      cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) samples are not available, patients may be asked to get an
      optional lumbar puncture (LP) for additional comparisons. The investigators will recruit 20
      participants, 45-70 years old, with clinical evidence of young onset focal dementia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants will be 45 - 70 years of age

          2. MMSE &gt; 10 at screening visit.

          3. Participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and provide
             written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines prior
             to study-specific procedures. If the patient is unable to provide informed consent,
             the patient's legal representative may consent on behalf of the patient but the
             patient will be asked to confirm assent.

          4. Participants must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits and imaging
             procedures.

          5. A brain MRI is required. If a brain MRI has been performed within 6 months of
             enrollment to this study and of adequate quality that scan may be used for the study
             analysis, subjects who do not have a brain MRI will undergo a brain MRI either as a
             part of this study

          6. Participants must identify a study partner who is willing to accompany the patient to
             study visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Females who are pregnant or breast feeding at the time of screening scan will not be
             eligible for this study, urine or serum pregnancy test will be performed in women of
             child-bearing potential at the time of screening

          2. Inability to tolerate or contraindication to imaging procedures (PET/CT or MRI) in the
             opinion of an investigator or treating physician

          3. QTc &gt; 450 msec on screening ECG.

          4. Any medical or psychological conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             would compromise the subject's safety or successful participation in the study (e.g.
             moderate to large stroke or history of moderate or severe traumatic brain injury
             (TBI)).
