    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is:

      - To assess the efficacy and safety of dose regimens of ALX-0061 monotherapy administered
      subcutaneously (s.c.) to subjects with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To assess the effects of ALX-0061 on quality of life, the pharmacokinetics (PK),
           pharmacodynamics (PD), and immunogenicity of ALX-0061 and to explore potential dose
           regimens for ALX-0061 monotherapy, based on safety and efficacy, for further clinical
           development.

        -  To obtain parallel descriptive information concerning the efficacy and safety of
           tocilizumab (TCZ) s.c. in the same clinical trial RA population.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline until Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ-DI is a 20-question instrument which assesses the degree of difficulty the subject had in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas over the previous week. The 8 areas are: dressing and grooming, hygiene, arising, reach, eating, grip, walking, common daily activities. Within each area, subjects report the amount of difficulty they have in performing the specific items. There are 4 response options ranging from: 0 = No Difficulty, 1 = With Some Difficulty, 2 = With Much Difficulty, 3 = Unable to Do. The 8 areas are each given a single score equal to the maximum value of their component activities (0, 1, 2, or 3). The sum of the area scores is then divided by the number of areas answered to obtain the final HAQ score (rounded to the nearest value evenly divisible by 0.125). The final HAQ-DI score ranges from 0 to 3. A high score means a high degree of disability (=worse outcome).
Missing values were imputed with the last non-missing observation.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Physical and Mental Component Scores of Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline until week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) consists of 36 items that can be summarized into 8 domains: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems (role-physical), bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems (role-emotional), and mental health. Two summary measures, the physical component summary and the mental component summary, can be derived based on these domain scores. Each score is directly transformed into a 0-100 score on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. Low score indicates greater disability.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue (FACIT-F) Subscale at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline until Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The FACIT Measurement System is a collection of health-related quality of life questionnaires that assess multidimensional health status in people with various chronic illnesses. The FACIT Fatigue Scale is a short, 13-item, easy to administer tool that measures an individual's level of fatigue during their usual daily activities over the past week. The level of fatigue is measured on a four point Likert scale (4 = not at all fatigued to 0 = very much fatigued). To score the FACIT-fatigue, all items are summed to create a single fatigue score with a range from 0 to 52. Items are reverse scored when appropriate to provide a scale in which higher scores represent better functioning or less fatigue.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 251 subjects were recruited at 58 sites located in Europe (42 sites; 199 subjects), Latin America (6 sites; 36 subjects) and North America (10 sites; 16 subjects). Consent was obtained from the first subject on 18 Mar 2015; the last subject completed the final visit in on 19 Jul 2016.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of the 599 subjects screened, 348 were screen failures and 251 subjects were randomly assigned to treatment (Intent-to-treat population). All subjects enrolled received study treatment and were included in the safety population. All subjects who received at least one dose of ALX-0061 were included in the pharmacokinetic (PK) population.</pre_assignment_details>

20% improvement in swollen joint count (SJC; 66 joints) relative to Week 0 AND
20% improvement in 3 of the following 5 areas relative to Week 0:
Subject's Assessment of Pain (100 mm - visual analogue scale [VAS])

Subject's assessment of physical function as measured by Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI)

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 12</title>
        <description>The HAQ-DI is a 20-question instrument which assesses the degree of difficulty the subject had in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas over the previous week. The 8 areas are: dressing and grooming, hygiene, arising, reach, eating, grip, walking, common daily activities. Within each area, subjects report the amount of difficulty they have in performing the specific items. There are 4 response options ranging from: 0 = No Difficulty, 1 = With Some Difficulty, 2 = With Much Difficulty, 3 = Unable to Do. The 8 areas are each given a single score equal to the maximum value of their component activities (0, 1, 2, or 3). The sum of the area scores is then divided by the number of areas answered to obtain the final HAQ score (rounded to the nearest value evenly divisible by 0.125). The final HAQ-DI score ranges from 0 to 3. A high score means a high degree of disability (=worse outcome).
Missing values were imputed with the last non-missing observation.</description>

        <description>The Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) consists of 36 items that can be summarized into 8 domains: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems (role-physical), bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems (role-emotional), and mental health. Two summary measures, the physical component summary and the mental component summary, can be derived based on these domain scores. Each score is directly transformed into a 0-100 score on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. Low score indicates greater disability.</description>

        <description>The FACIT Measurement System is a collection of health-related quality of life questionnaires that assess multidimensional health status in people with various chronic illnesses. The FACIT Fatigue Scale is a short, 13-item, easy to administer tool that measures an individual's level of fatigue during their usual daily activities over the past week. The level of fatigue is measured on a four point Likert scale (4 = not at all fatigued to 0 = very much fatigued). To score the FACIT-fatigue, all items are summed to create a single fatigue score with a range from 0 to 52. Items are reverse scored when appropriate to provide a scale in which higher scores represent better functioning or less fatigue.</description>
