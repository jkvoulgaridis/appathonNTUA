  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo controlled, multicentre
      study of 52 weeks treatment duration. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy(on
      endogenous insulin secretion), safety and tolerability of weekly albiglutide (a glucagon-like
      peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist) versus placebo when added to insulin therapy in subjects
      with new-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus (NOT1DM) and residual insulin production..
      Approximately 68 eligible subjects will be randomised in a 3:1 ratio such that 51 subjects
      receive albiglutide 30 milligram (mg) once weekly (with increase to 50 mg once weekly at Week
      6 if the 30-mg weekly dose is tolerated) added-on to insulin therapy and 17 subjects receive
      placebo once weekly added-on to insulin therapy. The total duration of a subject's
      participation will be approximately 72 weeks (up to 8 weeks of Screening, 52 weeks of
      treatment and 12 weeks of Post-treatment Follow-up)

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Participants (parts) had a balanced diet consistent with dietitian's advice and made no major changes in exercise regimens. Evening before the MMTT, participants had a full meal then fasted from 9 post meridiem (pm) until MMTT was completed. Water, black coffee or tea without sugar or artificial sweeteners was allowed. Plasma glucose was measured prior to the finger-stick test and MMTT was performed only if in range &gt; 3.9 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) [70 mg/deciliter (dL)] and &lt;= 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL). Baseline was defined as the last non-missing value with assessment date on or before the 1st day of study medication. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from Week 52 value. Intent-to-treat (ITT) Population comprised of all randomly assigned participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication with at least 1 post-Baseline assessment of the primary endpoint.</description>

             cirrhosis, known biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or
             asymptomatic gallstones). [Chronic stable hepatitis B and C are acceptable if subject
             otherwise meets entry criteria and are not on active antiviral treatment (e.g.,
             presence of hepatitis B surface antigen or positive hepatitis C test result within 3
             months of screening)]

          -  Any clinically significant co-morbidity or abnormality (including psychiatric
             disorder, any other autoimmune endocrinopathy e.g., primary autoimmune hypothyroidism,
             hyperadrenalism, coeliac disease etc) that in the opinion of the Investigator, may
             pose additional risk in administering study medication or trial participation

          -  Female subject is pregnant (confirmed by laboratory testing) or lactating

          -  Known allergy to any GLP-1 analogue, insulin, or excipients of albiglutide

          -  Treatment with any oral anti-diabetic medication within the prior 30 days or 5 half
             lives of that medication, whichever is longer.

          -  Use of immunosuppressants, intravenous immunoglobulin, oral or systemically injected
             glucocorticoids within the 3 months before randomisation or high likelihood of a
             requirement for prolonged treatment (&gt;1 week) in the year following randomisation.
             However, short courses of oral steroids (single dose or multiple doses for up to 7
             days) may be permitted provided these cases are discussed with the medical monitor.
             Inhaled, intra-articular, and small quantities of non-potent topical corticosteroids
             are allowed

          -  Receipt of any investigational drug within the 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is
             longer, before Screening, a history of receipt of an investigational anti-diabetic

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This was a multicenter study conducted at 29 sites in Europe (Spain 10, United Kingdom (UK) 9, Germany 4, France 3 and Italy 3). A total of 67 participants with New-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus (NOT1DM) were randomized.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Study was terminated early as part of the decision to withdraw albiglutide for commercial reasons. Study stopped after 67 participants were randomized instead of 68 as per protocol. Impact of early termination was minimal and did not affect the interpretation of results.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Participants (parts) had a balanced diet consistent with dietitian's advice and made no major changes in exercise regimens. Evening before the MMTT, participants had a full meal then fasted from 9 post meridiem (pm) until MMTT was completed. Water, black coffee or tea without sugar or artificial sweeteners was allowed. Plasma glucose was measured prior to the finger-stick test and MMTT was performed only if in range &gt; 3.9 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) [70 mg/deciliter (dL)] and &lt;= 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL). Baseline was defined as the last non-missing value with assessment date on or before the 1st day of study medication. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from Week 52 value. Intent-to-treat (ITT) Population comprised of all randomly assigned participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication with at least 1 post-Baseline assessment of the primary endpoint.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were taken to assess levels of glucagon at: 10 minutes before Time 0 (-10 minutes), immediately before the participant started drinking the nutritional drink (Time 0) and 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after Time 0. Mean change from Baseline in time normalized plasma glucagon AUC (from MMTT) at Week 16, 28, 52 and 64 was reported. Baseline was defined as the last non-missing value with an assessment date on or before the first day of study medication. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the specified time point value.</description>

        <title>Number of Events of Participant-reported Significant Hypoglycemia, Occurring &gt; Week 24 and &lt;= Week 52</title>
        <description>Significant hypoglycemia was defined as an event with plasma glucose level &lt;= 3.9 mmol/L (&lt;= 70 mg/dL) and/or requiring third party intervention. This corresponds to American Diabetes Association (ADA) category definitions of severe, documented symptomatic, and asymptomatic hypoglycemia. The time period was defined as: &gt; Week 24 to &lt;= Week 52 = Day 169 to Day 364. Number of Events were defined as the total number of significant hypoglycemic events at each level of summarization. Number of events of hypoglycemia with confirmed self plasma glucose monitoring &lt;=3.9 mmol/L and/or requiring third party intervention (i.e., severe, documented symptomatic and asymptomatic hypoglycemic events) occurring &gt;Week 24 and &lt;=Week 52 are presented.</description>

At each visit, only evaluable participants, defined as those with &gt;= 4 non-missing glucose values or &gt;= 1 hyperglycemic excursions were included. Greatest hyperglycemic excursion was calculated as the largest recorded glucose level during the 7-point glucose profile (before breakfast, 2 hours after breakfast, before lunch, 2 hours after lunch, before dinner, 2 hours after dinner, at bedtime) minus 10.0 mmol/L. If a participant had data recorded at that visit, but does not have a value &gt; 10.0 mmol/L, their greatest hyperglycemic excursion would be 0 mmol/L for that visit. Baseline was defined as the last non-missing value with an assessment date on or before the first day of study medication.</description>
