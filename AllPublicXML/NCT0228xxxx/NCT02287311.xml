  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The subject has a type of cancer or lymph gland disease associated with a virus called
      Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), which has come back, is at risk of coming back, or has not gone
      away after standard treatments. This research study uses special immune system cells called
      LMP, BARF-1 and EBNA1- specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (MABEL CTLs).

      Some patients with Lymphoma (such as Hodgkin (HD) or non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL)),
      T/NK-lymphoproliferative disease, or CAEBV, or solid tumors such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma
      (NPC), smooth muscle tumors, and leiomyosarcomas show signs of a virus called EBV before or
      at the time of their diagnosis. EBV causes mononucleosis or glandular fever (&quot;mono&quot; or the
      &quot;kissing disease&quot;). EBV is found in the cancer cells of up to half the patients with HD and
      NHL, suggesting that it may play a role in causing Lymphoma. The cancer cells (in lymphoma)
      and some immune system cells (in CAEBV) infected by EBV are able to hide from the body's
      immune system and escape destruction. EBV is also found in the majority of NPC and smooth
      muscle tumors, and some leiomyosarcomas. We want to see if special white blood cells (MABEL
      CTLs) that have been trained to kill EBV infected cells can survive in your blood and affect
      the tumor.

      In previous studies, EBV CTLs were generated from the blood of the patient, which was often
      difficult if the patient had recently received chemotherapy. Also, it took up to 1-2 months
      to make the cells, which is not practical when a patient needs more urgent treatment. To
      address these issues, the MABEL CTLs were made in the lab in a simpler, faster, and safer
      way. The MABEL CTLs will still see LMP proteins but also two other EBV proteins called EBNA-1
      and BARF. To ensure these cells are available for use in patients in urgent clinical need, we
      have generated MABEL CTLs from the blood of healthy donors and created a bank of these cells,
      which are frozen until ready for use. We have previously successfully used frozen T cells
      from healthy donors to treat EBV lymphoma and virus infections and we now have improved our
      production method to make it faster.

      In this study, we want to find out if we can use banked MABEL CTLs to treat HD, NHL,
      T/NK-lymphoproliferative disease, CAEBV, NPC, smooth muscle tumors or leiomyosarcoma. We will
      search the bank to find a MABEL CTL line that is a partial match with the subject.

      MABEL CTLs are investigational and not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A healthy donor has given blood to make LMP/BARF1/EBNA-1 MABEL CTLs in the lab. We made the
      cells by first growing a special type of cells called activated T cells to stimulate the T
      cells. We then added specially produced mixtures of proteins that include the LMP, EBNA1 and
      BARF proteins. These were used to stimulate T cells. As the T cells grew, we added some of
      the healthy donor cells expressing these proteins to stimulate them. We also added a cell
      called K562 that has had new genes put inside it so it expresses proteins that stimulate the
      immune system to encourage the T cells to grow. K562 cells are cancer cells that have been
      treated with radiation so they cannot grow. This stimulation trained the MABEL CTLs to kill
      cells with EBV proteins on their surface. These cells were grown and frozen.

      For the subject's treatment, the MABEL CTLs will be thawed and infused into the subject over
      1-10 minutes. Initially, two doses of MABEL CTLs will be given two weeks apart. Subjects may
      be eligible to receive additional doses of the MABEL CTLs up to 6 times.

      All of the treatments will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas
      Children's Hospital or Houston Methodist Hospital.

      Medical tests before treatment:

      Before being treated, the subject will receive a series of standard medical tests:

      Physical exam; Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function; Tumor
      measurements by routine imaging studies: Computer Tomogram (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      (MRI), or Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT); Pregnancy test for females who are able to
      have children.

      Several studies suggest that the infused T cells need room to be able to proliferate and
      accomplish their functions and that this may not happen if there are too many other T cells
      in circulation. Because of that, if the patient's level of circulating T cells is relatively
      high, s/he may require treatment with cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) and fludarabine before s/he
      receives MABEL CTLs.

      Medical tests during and after treatment:

      Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function; Imaging study 8 weeks after
      the 1st CTL infusion. If the subject receives additional doses they will also have an imaging
      study at 1 to 3 months after their final dose.

      Subjects will either be seen in the clinic or will be contacted by research staff yearly for
      5 years.
