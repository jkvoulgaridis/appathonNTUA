  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient reported outcomes (PRO) have become an important endpoint assessed in clinical
      trials. It is important to understand the relationship between medication and patients'
      symptomatology, quality of life and well-being. We predict levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel
      (LCIG; Duodopa) will significantly improve quality of life and emotional well-being compared
      to baseline in patients with advance Parkinson disease (APD) not well controlled with
      conventional treatment.

        <description>The PDQ-39 contains 39 items: mobility (items 1-10), activities of daily living (items 11-16), emotional well-being (items 17-22), stigma (items 23-26), social support (items 27-29), cognitions (items 30-33), communication (items 34-36), and bodily discomfort (items 37-39). Participants are asked to indicate the frequency of each event by selecting one of 5 options (score 0 to 4 on a Likert scale). The global score was calculated by expressing summed item scores as a percentage score ranging between 0 and 100. The lower scores indicate a better perceived health status and higher scores are associated with more health problems.</description>

          <description>The PDQ-39 contains 39 items grouped in 8 domains: mobility (items 1-10), activities of daily living (items 11-16), emotional well-being (items 17-22), stigma (items 23-26), social support (items 27-29), cognitions (items 30-33), communication (items 34-36), and bodily discomfort (items 37-39). Participants are asked to indicate the frequency of each event by selecting one of 5 options (Likert scale): never, occasionally, sometimes, often, always or cannot do at all, scoring 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, respectively. The stigma domain score was calculated by expressing summed item scores as a percentage score ranging between 0 and 100. The lower scores indicate a better perceived health status and higher scores are associated with more health problems.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Non-Motor Symptom Scale (NMSS) Global Score at Month 6</title>
        <description>The NMSS measures the frequency and severity of a range of non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's Disease. It consists of 30 questions grouped into 9 domains: cardiovascular including falls (items 1-2), sleep/fatigue (items 3-6), mood/cognition (items 7-12), perceptual problems/hallucinations (items 13-15), attention/memory (items 16-18), gastrointestinal tract (items 19-21), urinary (items 22-24), sexual function (items 25-26), and miscellaneous (pain, taste/smell, weight change, excessive sweating; items 27-30). Severity is rated on a scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe) and frequency is rated on a scale from 1 (rarely) to 4 (very frequent). The global score was calculated summing the score of each item (severity x frequency), ranging from 0 to 360, with a lower score indicating fewer symptoms. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement in symptoms.</description>

        <description>The NMSS measures the frequency and severity of a range of non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's Disease. It consists of 30 questions grouped into 9 domains: cardiovascular including falls (items 1-2), sleep/fatigue (items 3-6), mood/cognition (items 7-12), perceptual problems/hallucinations (items 13-15), attention/memory (items 16-18), gastrointestinal tract (items 19-21), urinary (items 22-24), sexual function (items 25-26), and miscellaneous (pain, taste/smell, weight change, excessive sweating; items 27-30). Severity is rated on a scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe) and frequency is rated on a scale from 1 (rarely) to 4 (very frequent). The attention/memory domain score ranges from 0 to 36 with a lower score indicating fewer symptoms. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement in symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Norris/Bond-Lader Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Mean Global Score at Month 6</title>
        <description>The Norris/Bond-Lader VAS measures emotional well-being status with a 16-item visual analogue mood rating scale. The VAS consisted of 16 visual analogue items each representing opposite extremes of mood, with the following labels at each end: alert/drowsy, calm/excited, strong/weak, muzzy/clear-headed, well-coordinated/clumsy, lethargic/energetic, contented/dreamy, incompetent/proficient, happy/sad, antagonistic/amicable, interested/bored, withdrawn/gregarious. These scales loaded on 3 domains (alert, strong, clear-headed, well-coordinated, energetic, quick-witted, attentive, proficient, interested); (contented, tranquil, happy, amicable, gregarious); (calm, relaxed).

          <description>The Norris/Bond-Lader VAS measures emotional well-being status with a 16-item visual analogue mood rating scale. The VAS consisted of 16 visual analogue items each representing opposite extremes of mood, with the following labels at each end: alert/drowsy, calm/excited, strong/weak, muzzy/clear-headed, well-coordinated/clumsy, lethargic/energetic, contented/dreamy, incompetent/proficient, happy/sad, antagonistic/amicable, interested/bored, withdrawn/gregarious. These scales loaded on 3 domains (alert, strong, clear-headed, well-coordinated, energetic, quick-witted, attentive, proficient, interested); (contented, tranquil, happy, amicable, gregarious); (calm, relaxed). For each individual scale, a line was drawn between each mood state and its opposite and participants rated their current mood by placing a vertical mark on the line. Scores (global, and for each domain) ranged from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating more positive mood.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) Questionnaire: Mean Percentage of Work Time Missed (Absenteeism) at Month 6</title>
          <description>Absenteeism, presented as the mean percentage of work time missed due to caregiving (as reported on the WPAI), and calculated as: 100*number of hours of work missed due to caregiving / (number of hours of work missed due to caregiving + number of hours worked). WPAI is a questionnaire used to evaluate lost productivity; scores are presented as percentages (multiplying the scores by 100), with 0% representing no impact on productivity and 100% representing complete impact on productivity.</description>

        <title>Correlation Between Participants' Quality of Life (PDQ-39) and Different Questionnaires at Baseline</title>
        <description>Spearman correlation statistics were calculated for the quality of life of the participants (Global PDQ-39, see Outcome Measure 1) and the following scales: UPDRS-III (see Outcome Measure 10), UPDRS-IV (see description below), NMSS (see Outcome Measure 11), BAI (see Outcome Measure 28), BDI-III (see Outcome Measure 27), AS (see Outcome Measure 26), PFS (see Outcome Measure 25), Norris Bond-Lader (NBL) Alertness-Sedation (A-S; see Outcome Measure 22), NBL Contented-Discontented (C-D; see Outcome Measure 23), NBL Calm-Relaxed (C-R; see Outcome Measure 24), ZBI (see Outcome Measure 40), GADS-Anxiety (see Outcome Measure 43), and GADS-Depression (see Outcome Measure 42).
The UPDRS-IV contains 11 items, each scored in a Likert scale from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe); or a 2-point scale (yes/no format), with 1 point for &quot;yes&quot; and 0 for &quot;no.&quot; The global score was calculated summing the score of each item, ranging from 0 to 23, where higher scores are associated with more disability.</description>

        <title>Correlation Between Participants' Quality of Life (PDQ-39) and Different Questionnaires at Month 6</title>
        <description>Spearman correlation statistics were calculated for the quality of life of the participants (Global PDQ-39, see Outcome Measure 1) and the following scales: UPDRS-III (see Outcome Measure 10), UPDRS-IV (see description below), NMSS (see Outcome Measure 11), BAI (see Outcome Measure 28), BDI-III (see Outcome Measure 27), AS (see Outcome Measure 26), PFS (see Outcome Measure 25), Norris Bond-Lader (NBL) Alertness-Sedation (A-S; see Outcome Measure 22), NBL Contented-Discontented (C-D; see Outcome Measure 23), NBL Calm-Relaxed (C-R; see Outcome Measure 24), ZBI (see Outcome Measure 40), GADS-Anxiety (see Outcome Measure 43), and GADS-Depression (see Outcome Measure 42).
The UPDRS-IV contains 11 items, each scored in a Likert scale from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe); or a 2-point scale (yes/no format), with 1 point for &quot;yes&quot; and 0 for &quot;no.&quot; The global score was calculated summing the score of each item, ranging from 0 to 23, where higher scores are associated with more disability.</description>

        <title>Correlation Between Caregivers' Quality of Life (SQLC) and Different Questionnaires at Baseline</title>
        <description>Spearman correlation statistics were calculated for the quality of life of the caregivers (Global SQLC, see Outcome Measure ) and the following scales: ZBI (see Outcome Measure 40), GADS-Anxiety (see Outcome Measure 43), and GADS-Depression (see Outcome Measure 42), NBL A-S (see Outcome Measure 22), NBL C-D (see Outcome Measure 23), NBL C-R (see Outcome Measure 24), Global PDQ-39 (see Outcome Measure 1), UPDRS-III (see Outcome Measure 10), UPDRS-IV (see description below), and Global NMSS (see Outcome Measure 11).
The UPDRS-IV contains 11 items, each scored in a Likert scale from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe); or a 2-point scale (yes/no format), with 1 point for &quot;yes&quot; and 0 for &quot;no.&quot; The global score was calculated summing the score of each item, ranging from 0 to 23, where higher scores are associated with more disability.</description>

        <title>Correlation Between Caregivers' Quality of Life (SQLC) and Different Questionnaires at Month 6</title>
        <description>Spearman correlation statistics were calculated for the quality of life of the caregivers (Global SQLC, see Outcome Measure ) and the following scales: ZBI (see Outcome Measure 40), GADS-Anxiety (see Outcome Measure 43), and GADS-Depression (see Outcome Measure 42), NBL A-S (see Outcome Measure 22), NBL C-D (see Outcome Measure 23), NBL C-R (see Outcome Measure 24), Global PDQ-39 (see Outcome Measure 1), UPDRS-III (see Outcome Measure 10), UPDRS-IV (see description below), and Global NMSS (see Outcome Measure 11).
The UPDRS-IV contains 11 items, each scored in a Likert scale from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe); or a 2-point scale (yes/no format), with 1 point for &quot;yes&quot; and 0 for &quot;no.&quot; The global score was calculated summing the score of each item, ranging from 0 to 23, where higher scores are associated with more disability.</description>
