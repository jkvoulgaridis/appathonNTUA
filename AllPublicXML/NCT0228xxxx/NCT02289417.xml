  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      apremilast (30 mg twice daily [BID] and 40 mg BID), compared with placebo, in participants
      with active Ulcerative Colitis (UC).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 165 participants (55 subjects per arm) will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to
      receive oral apremilast (30 mg BID or 40 mg BID), or identically appearing placebo BID for up
      to 12 weeks, followed by 40 weeks of blinded treatment with apremilast (30 mg BID or 40 mg
      BID).

      At the end of the Blinded Active-treatment Phase (Week 52), participants who have a Mayo
      endoscopy score ≤ 1 will have the opportunity to participate in the Extension Phase.
      Participants enrolled in the Extension Phase will receive apremilast for an additional 52
      weeks (Weeks 52 to 104). With the implementation of Amendment 4, participants entering the
      Extension Phase will receive apremilast 30 mg BID. Subjects currently in the Extension Phase
      who are receiving apremilast 40 mg BID will be switched to 30 mg BID at the next scheduled
      visit.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Clinical Remission by Total Mayo Score (TMS) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission was defined as a total Mayo score ≤ 2 points, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point. The TMS is an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. The Mayo score ranges from 0 to 12 points. It consists of 4 subscores, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease.
Stool Frequency Subscore (SFS)
Rectal Bleeding Subscore (RBS)
Endoscopy Subscore

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Clinical Response by Total Mayo Score and the Reduction in the Rectal Bleeding Subscore at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response was defined as a decrease from baseline in the TMS of at least 3 points and at least 30%, along with a reduction in the rectal bleeding subscore (RBS) of at least 1 point or an absolute RBS of ≤ 1. The TMS is an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. The Mayo score ranges from 0 to 12 points. It consists of 4 subscores, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease.
Stool Frequency Subscore (SFS)
Rectal Bleeding Subscore
Endoscopy Subscore
Physician's Global Assessment (PGA)
Rectal bleeding (subscore 0-3) was defined as:
0 = No blood seen
= Streaks of blood with stool less than half the time

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved an Endoscopic Remission at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>An endoscopic remission was defined as a Mayo endoscopic subscore (MES) of 0 at Week 12.
The MES subscore findings were defined as:
0 = Normal or inactive disease
= Mild Disease (erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability)
= Moderate Disease (marked erythema, lack of vascular pattern, friability erosions)
= Severe Disease (spontaneous bleeding, ulceration)
The endoscopy subscores consisted of findings that were centrally read through proctosigmoidoscopy, graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. Two-sided 95% CIs for the within-group percentage were based on the Wilson score method.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Clinical Remission in the Modified Mayo Subscore (MMS) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission was defined as a modified Mayo score of ≤ 2, with no individual subscore &gt; 1, at Week 12. The MMS was based on a modification of the total Mayo score (TMS) which included the stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and endoscopic subscores of the TMS and excluded the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) subscore, since this was a global measure that is subjective in nature. The MMS ranges from 0 to 9 points with higher scores indicating greater disease severity. The endoscopy subscores was centrally reviewed. Two-sided confidence intervals for the within-group percentage were based on the Wilson score method.</description>

    <description>Clinical response in the MMS was defined as a decrease from baseline in the MMS of at least 2 points and at least 25%, along with a reduction in the RBS of at least 1 point or an absolute RBS ≤ 1. The MMS was based on the stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and endoscopic subscores of the TMS and excluded the PGA subscore. The MMS ranges from 0 to 9 points with higher scores indicating greater disease severity.
The RBS was measured as:
0 = No blood seen

    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission in the partial Mayo subscore was defined as a PMS of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore &gt;1. The PMS is a discrete ordinal scale ranging from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 9 (severe disease) and is a composite of 3 subscores:
Stool Frequency Subscore, Rectal Bleeding Subscore, and Physician's Global Assessment Subscore, each of which ranges from 0 (normal) to 3 (severe disease).
Two-sided 95% CI for the within-group proportions are based on the Wilson score method.</description>

In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors. If not approved, a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel will arbitrate and make the final decision. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement.

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Clinical Response by Total Mayo Score and the Reduction in the Rectal Bleeding Subscore at Week 12</title>
        <description>Clinical response was defined as a decrease from baseline in the TMS of at least 3 points and at least 30%, along with a reduction in the rectal bleeding subscore (RBS) of at least 1 point or an absolute RBS of ≤ 1. The TMS is an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. The Mayo score ranges from 0 to 12 points. It consists of 4 subscores, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease.

Rectal bleeding (subscore 0-3) was defined as:

        <description>Clinical remission was defined as a modified Mayo score of ≤ 2, with no individual subscore &gt; 1, at Week 12.

The MMS ranges from 0 to 9 points with higher scores indicating greater disease severity. The endoscopy subscores was centrally reviewed.

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Clinical Remission in the Partial Mayo Subscore (PMS) With no Individual Subscore &gt;1 at Week 8</title>
        <description>Clinical remission in the partial Mayo subscore was defined as a PMS of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore &gt;1. The PMS is a discrete ordinal scale ranging from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 9 (severe disease) and is a composite of 3 subscores:
Stool Frequency Subscore, Rectal Bleeding Subscore, and Physician's Global Assessment Subscore, each of which ranges from 0 (normal) to 3 (severe disease).
Two-sided 95% CI for the within-group proportions are based on the Wilson score method.</description>

        <title>The Number of Participants Who Discontinued Apremilast Due to Treatment Emergent Adverse Events During the Placebo-Controlled Period</title>
        <description>A TEAE was defined as any AE occurring or worsening on or after the first treatment of apremilast and up to 28 days after the last apremilast dose or the last follow-up date, whichever occurred earlier. A serious AE = any AE which results in death; is life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; constitutes an important medical event. The severity of AEs was assessed by the investigator and based on the following scale: Mild = asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; Moderate = Symptoms cause moderate discomfort; Severe (could be non-serious or serious) = symptoms causing severe discomfort/pain.</description>
