  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an international multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of
      single-agent intralesional PV-10 versus systemic chemotherapy or intralesional oncolytic
      viral therapy to assess treatment of locally advanced cutaneous melanoma in patients who (1)
      are not candidates for targeted therapy and (2) are not candidates for an immune checkpoint
      inhibitor. Subjects in the comparator arm will receive the Investigator's choice of
      dacarbazine (DTIC), temozolomide (TMZ) or intralesional talimogene laherparepvec as
      determined by Investigator preference and standard of care in the Investigator's country or
      region. Effectiveness will be assessed by comparison of progression-free survival (PFS)
      between all intent-to-treat (ITT) subjects in the two study treatment arms.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be randomized using a 2:1 treatment allocation (i.e. two-thirds of the subjects
      will receive PV-10).

      Subjects in the comparator arm who have completed at least 1 cycle of study treatment and who
      meet the study protocol definition of disease progression but do not have evidence of
      visceral metastases will be eligible to enter the crossover portion of the study and receive
      PV-10. Subjects crossing over must meet all study inclusion and exclusion criteria for
      clinical laboratories, thyroid function, concurrent or intercurrent illness and pregnancy at
      the time of crossover.

      Assessment of progression will be performed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC) based on
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) ver. 1.1 criteria. Events signaling
      progression include increase in size and/or number of lesions, distant or nodal disease
      progression, or death. All secondary endpoints involving disease response and progression
      will be based on the IRC determination.

      An interim assessment of efficacy and safety will be performed by the IRC when 50% of the
      events required for the primary endpoint have occurred.
