  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ebola virus has infected and killed people, mostly in Africa. In 2014, the Zaire ebolavirus
      (ZEBOV) has affected several thousand people. There is no approved effective way to treat or
      prevent Ebola. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine for it. This is a study of the
      anti-Ebola vaccine vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) ZEBOV (V920; BPSC-1001) to see if it is
      safe and to see how it affects people's immune system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between 1994 and the present, there have been many Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreaks affecting
      mostly central Africa. However, the 2014 West African outbreak significantly exceeds all
      previous outbreaks in geographic range, number of individuals affected and in disruption of
      typical activities of civil society.

      This is a Phase 1 safety and tolerability study to evaluate a novel vaccine to Ebola using a
      live VSV replacing the gene encoding the G envelope glycoprotein with the gene encoding the
      envelope glycoprotein from the Zaire strain of Ebola (VSVΔG-ZEBOV also known as V920 and
      BPSC-1001).

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study vaccine. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study vaccine or a protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the study drug or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the study vaccine or protocol-specified procedure is also an AE. An unsolicited AE was an AE other than those specifically designated local or systemic. The percentage of participants that experienced at least 1 unsolicited AE was summarized.</description>

    <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the study vaccine, whether or not considered related to the use of the study vaccine. An SAE is an AE that results in death, is life-threatening, results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity, results in or prolongs an existing hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or is another important medical event.

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study vaccine. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study vaccine or a protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the study drug or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the study vaccine or protocol-specified procedure is also an AE. An unsolicited AE was an AE other than those specifically designated local or systemic. The percentage of participants that experienced at least 1 unsolicited AE was summarized.</description>

The solicited systemic AEs for this study were the following: redness, swelling, or pain at site of injection, subjective and objective fever, chills, sweats, myalgia, arthralgia, fatigue, headache and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and/or diarrhea). All AEs were assessed for severity by the investigator according to the Food and Drug Administration(FDA's) Guidance &quot;Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials&quot; and were classified into 4 categories: Mild (Grade 1), Moderate (Grade 2), Severe (Grade 3) and Potentially Life-Threatening (Grade 4). The percentage of participants that experienced at least 1 solicited systemic AE were summarized by grade.</description>

All AEs were assessed for severity by the investigator according to the Food and Drug Administration(FDA's) Guidance &quot;Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials&quot; and were classified into 4 categories: Mild (Grade 1), Moderate (Grade 2), Severe (Grade 3) and Potentially Life-Threatening (Grade 4).
