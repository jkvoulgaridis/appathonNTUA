  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tooth brushing for patients with breathing tubes is routinely provided by the bedside nurse
      as part of clinical care. The purpose of this study is to determine how often tooth brushing
      should occur for adult patients with breathing tubes (mechanical ventilation), balanced with
      equivalence and safety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 345 adult subjects who are intubated and require mechanical ventilation will be
      randomly assigned to one of the three different tooth brushing frequency groups: once a day,
      twice a day or three times a day, up to a maximum of seven days. Teeth will be brushed with a
      soft child size toothbrush will take approximately 2 minutes. Following tooth brushing, the
      mouth will be rinsed with alcohol-free mouthwash and oral fluids will be removed with an oral
      suction tip. Moisturizing gel will be gently applied. The complete intervention requires
      approximately 15 minutes.

      Information will be collected will include clinical condition, medications, age, gender, and
      smoking status. Once every day, digital pictures will be taken of each tooth (takes
      approximately five minutes) using a small intraoral camera to be evaluated for plaque by a
      dental hygienist that is blinded to frequency group assignment. Once every day, gingival
      crevicular fluid samples (takes 30 seconds) to look for factors that predict infection.

      Gingival crevicular fluid samples and digital pictures of the teeth will also be collected on
      day 1, day 3 and day 5 after extubation.
