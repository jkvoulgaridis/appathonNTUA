    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of pioglitazone at 24 months compared
      with placebo on cognitive decline in high-risk participants who have completed the
      AD-4833/TOMM40_301 study [NCT01931566] with an adjudicated diagnosis of mild cognitive
      impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called pioglitazone. This study is designed to further
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of pioglitazone on cognitive function in participants
      who have completed the AD-4833/TOMM40_301. This study will look at the effectiveness of
      pioglitazone on cognitive decline in high-risk participants who have completed the
      AD-4833/TOMM40_301 study with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD).

      The study enrolled 40 participants, but is dependent on how many decide to continue treatment
      in an extension phase after completing the main (301) study. Participants will continue to
      receive the same study medication they received during the pivotal AD-4833/TOMM40_301 study,
      either:

        -  Pioglitazone 0.8 mg tablets or

        -  Placebo (this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient).

      All participants will be asked to take one tablet at the same time each day throughout the
      study.

      This multi-centre trial, like its precedent pivotal trial, will be conducted worldwide. The
      overall time to participate in this study is minimum 2 years and a maximum of 7 years
      depending on when participants roll over from the 301 study. Participants will make
      approximately 2 visits per year to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 3 months
      after each treatment visit for a follow-up assessment, and 2 weeks after the final visit.

    <measure>Change From Extension Study Baseline in Composite Score of a Broad Cognitive Test Battery at Month 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>Composite scores were derived from the test battery. Each test in the battery falls into 1 of the following cognitive domains: Episodic Memory (California Verbal Learning Test - 2nd Edition [CVLT-II], Brief Visuospatial Memory Test - Revised [BVMT-R]), Executive Function (Trail Making Part B, Digit Span Backwards), Language (Animals, Lexical/Phonemic Fluency), Attention (Digit Span Forward, Trail Making Part A), and Visuospatial (Clock Drawing, BVMT-Copy). Only the domains of episodic memory, executive function, language, and attention were used for the calculation of composite score (i.e., Clock Drawing, BVMT-Copy, and the Multilingual Naming Test (MINT), which do not allow generation of standard z scores, were only used for diagnostic purposes and were excluded from the calculation of the composite score). To form the composite, z-scores were calculated for each test, each z-score for the domain were averaged, and then all relevant domains were averaged to form the composite.</description>

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received, an opportunity for the primary publication of the research has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com/Approach for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>

        <title>Change From Extension Study Baseline in Composite Score of a Broad Cognitive Test Battery at Month 24</title>
        <description>Composite scores were derived from the test battery. Each test in the battery falls into 1 of the following cognitive domains: Episodic Memory (California Verbal Learning Test - 2nd Edition [CVLT-II], Brief Visuospatial Memory Test - Revised [BVMT-R]), Executive Function (Trail Making Part B, Digit Span Backwards), Language (Animals, Lexical/Phonemic Fluency), Attention (Digit Span Forward, Trail Making Part A), and Visuospatial (Clock Drawing, BVMT-Copy). Only the domains of episodic memory, executive function, language, and attention were used for the calculation of composite score (i.e., Clock Drawing, BVMT-Copy, and the Multilingual Naming Test (MINT), which do not allow generation of standard z scores, were only used for diagnostic purposes and were excluded from the calculation of the composite score). To form the composite, z-scores were calculated for each test, each z-score for the domain were averaged, and then all relevant domains were averaged to form the composite.</description>
