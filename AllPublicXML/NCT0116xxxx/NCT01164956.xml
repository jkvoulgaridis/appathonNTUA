  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this pilot study is to conduct a combined N-of-1 trial (N-1-T) of MPH
      (methylphenidate) for amelioration of fatigue in children with cancer, and to evaluate the
      N-1-T design both for individual clinical decision making and for clinical trials in symptom
      management in pediatric oncology patients. Because no one knows which of the study options
      are best, participants will receive liquid MPH on some days and a placebo on other days. We
      will compare how the participant feels on MPH days with how they feel on placebo days to
      determine whether MPH makes a difference.

      I. To assess the N-1-T as a study design to evaluate a symptom-directed intervention in
      children with cancer

      Primary objective

      -To evaluate the feasibility of conducting an N-1-T to evaluate MPH for cancer-related
      fatigue in children as a group

      Secondary objectives

        -  To evaluate the ability of the N-1-T to assess efficacy of MPH for an individual subject
           statistically and clinically definite answer (regarding the ability of MPH to reduce
           fatigue)

        -  To explore subject/family and oncologist perspectives on N1T participation

        -  To examine in a preliminary fashion whether there are patient, family, disease or
           study-related factors that are associated with attrition to help guide future
           large-scale N1Ts

      II. To evaluate MPH for treatment of cancer-related fatigue and related symptoms in children

      Primary objective

      -To evaluate the effect of MPH on cancer-related fatigue in children based on various
      assessments including pedsFACIT-F and a unidimensional single-item Likert scale for measuring
      fatigue

      Secondary objective

      -To assess the side effect profile of MPH for fatigue in children with cancer

      III. To evaluate fatigue assessment tools Primary objective

      -To evaluate correlation between fatigue scores

    <measure>Rate of Receiving Clinically Definite Answer Regarding the Ability of Experimental Treatment to Reduce Fatigue Using the N-1-T Design</measure>
    <time_frame>18 days</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy of the N-1-T design is defined as patient providing a clinically definite answer regarding the ability of MPH to reduce fatigue.Based on the definition of the outcome being evaluated, aggregation of data for all participants is appropriate.</description>

    <measure>Change Over Treatment Pairs in pedsFACIT-F Score</measure>
    <time_frame>The pedsFACIT-Fwas administered at baseline and at the end of each treatment pair (TP) and related change in score was calculated for each period: baseline to end of TP 1 (day 6); end of TP 1 to end of TP 2 (day 12); end of TP 2 to end of TP 3 (day 18).</time_frame>
    <description>The pediatric Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (pedsFACIT-F) is an 11-item instrument derived from a comprehensive pediatric item bank that assesses fatigue. (Lai et al. Pediatr Hematol Oncol 2007) Measuring fatigue over the past 7 days in a population of pediatric cancer patients, the pedsFACIT-F instrument has a score ranging from 0-44, with a higher score meaning more fatigue. A minimally important difference (MID) was established as 4.7 points.</description>

        <description>The pediatric Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (pedsFACIT-F) is an 11-item instrument derived from a comprehensive pediatric item bank that assesses fatigue. (Lai et al. Pediatr Hematol Oncol 2007) Measuring fatigue over the past 7 days in a population of pediatric cancer patients, the pedsFACIT-F instrument has a score ranging from 0-44, with a higher score meaning more fatigue. A minimally important difference (MID) was established as 4.7 points.</description>
        <time_frame>The pedsFACIT-Fwas administered at baseline and at the end of each treatment pair (TP) and related change in score was calculated for each period: baseline to end of TP 1 (day 6); end of TP 1 to end of TP 2 (day 12); end of TP 2 to end of TP 3 (day 18).</time_frame>
