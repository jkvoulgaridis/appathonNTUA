  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the
      PresVIEW™ Scleral Implant (PSI) for the improvement of near visual acuity in presbyopic
      patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical investigation of the PresView™ Scleral Implant (PSI) is a prospective
      multicenter clinical trial in which a total of 330 subjects were enrolled and implanted with
      the PSI and followed for a period of 24 months at up to 14 clinical sites.

      An additional randomized sub-study was performed on 48 subjects with the PSI Second
      Generation PresView™(SGP) implant, model number SGP-046. A 2:1 randomization was used to
      determine the 32 subjects assigned to be implanted and the 16 subjects assigned to the
      observation/deferred implantation control arm. Subjects randomized to the deferred
      implantation control arm were eligible to receive the PSI after completion of the 6 months of
      observation in the study.

      All subjects interested in participating in the study were screened for eligibility, and
      informed consent was obtained from those who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Eligible
      subjects were examined preoperatively to obtain a medical history and baseline ocular data.

      Effectiveness: The following tests/measurements used to evaluate the effectiveness of the PSI
      procedure will be included in the study protocol:

        -  Near visual acuity of the operated eye/eyes as compared with baseline (uncorrected and
           distance corrected)

        -  Reading acuity of the operated eye/eyes as compared with baseline (uncorrected and
           distance corrected)

      The PSI procedure will be defined as successful if a logMar equivalent to Snellen 20/40 or
      better (logMar 0.3) is achieved in ≥ 75% of patients or if 75% of patients realize an
      improvement ≥ 2 lines in distance corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA). For most patients,
      this will translate into the ability to read the majority of newspaper and magazine print
      without a near optical aid.

      Safety: Primary safety outcomes for safety will include:

        -  Incidence of anterior segment ischemia

        -  Decrease in Best Corrected Distance Visual Acuity (BCDVA) of more than 2 lines from
           baseline at 1-month or more postoperatively

        -  Decrease in best distance corrected near acuity (with add) of more than 2 lines from
           baseline at 1-month or more postoperatively

        -  Intraocular Pressure (IOP) increase &gt; 10mm Hg over baseline or IOP &gt; 25mm Hg after 1 Day
           postoperative

        -  Signs of chronic inflammation (e.g. uveitis or chronic conjunctival hyperemia) at 2
           months or more postoperatively

        -  Increase in axial length of ≥ 0.20mm accompanied by a &gt; 0.5 diopter myopic shift in
           manifest spherical equivalent distance refraction.

        -  Incidence of adverse events: total not to exceed 5%, and the incidence of each event
           should not exceed 1-2%

Data for primary eyes that missed the 24 month visit, were lost to follow-up, or withdrew consent prior to the 24 month visit were not imputed. Per protocol, primary outcome analysis must be performed on the primary eye only. Fellow eye data is used for safety outcomes and summarized separately.</population>
