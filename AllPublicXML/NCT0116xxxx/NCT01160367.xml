      Specific Aims and Hypotheses:

      Aim 1: To test the effect of the &quot;Trial of Ascertaining Individual preferences for Loved
      Ones' Role in End-of-life Decisions&quot; (TAILORED) Intervention on family decision-making
      self-efficacy at 8 weeks both with respect to the patient's present situation and in a
      hypothetical situation in which the patient lacks decision-making capacity.

      Hypotheses 1a: Family decision-making self-efficacy will be greater at 8 weeks in pairs that
      have undergone the TAILORED Intervention than in pairs receiving the standard information on
      advance directives in the patient's present situation.

      Hypotheses 1b: Family decision-making self-efficacy will be greater at 8 weeks in pairs that
      have undergone the TAILORED Intervention than in pairs receiving the standard information on
      advance directives in the hypothetical situation in which the patient lacks decision making
      capacity.

      Aim 2: To test the effect of the TAILORED Intervention on family psychological outcomes
      (depression, caregiver burden, decision making distress).

      Hypotheses 2a: Depression will be less at 8 weeks in family members who have undergone the
      TAILORED Intervention than in family members who have received the standard information on
      advance directives.

      Hypotheses 2b: Caregiver burden will be less at 8 weeks in family members who have undergone
      the TAILORED Intervention than in family members who have received the standard information
      on advance directives.

      Hypotheses 2c: Decision-making distress will be less at 8 weeks in family members who have
      undergone the TAILORED Intervention than in family members who have received the standard
      information on advance directives.

      Aim 3: To test the effect of the TAILORED Intervention on patient and family satisfaction
      with family decision-making involvement.

      Hypothesis 3a: Patient satisfaction with family decision involvement will be greater at 8
      weeks in patients who have undergone the TAILORED Intervention than in patients receiving the
      standard information on advance directives.

      Hypothesis 3b: Family member satisfaction with decision involvement will be greater at 8
      weeks in family members who have undergone the TAILORED Intervention than in family members
      receiving the standard information on advance directives.

      Aim 4: To explore family decision-making self-efficacy and perceptions of the TAILORED
      Intervention.

      Enhanced patient-family health care decision making is essential to improving the overall
      quality of end-of-life care (NIH State of the Science Conference Statement on Improving
      End-of-Life Care, 2004). Although most terminally ill patients desire shared family decision
      making, few family members are prepared for this and many report high levels of distress, and
      even the inability to make such decisions (Nolan, et al., 2005). Factors positively
      influencing the surrogates are: 1) previous experience with surrogate decision making, 2)
      knowing the patient's preferences, and 3) receiving positive reinforcement about decision
      making. The last two are amenable to change in &quot;Trial of Ascertaining Individual preferences
      for Loved Ones' Role in End-of-life Decisions&quot; (the &quot;TAILORED&quot; study). The TAILORED
      intervention is a simple clinic- based protocol involving an assessment of the confidence
      (self-efficacy) of family members for making health care decisions with or for a terminally
      ill loved one. Clinicians then tailor their guidance to patients and families about issues to
      discuss at home to better prepare family members for the desired decision-making role. This
      randomized clinical trial will include 132 patient-family dyads from two diagnostic groups: a
      group expected to retain (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) or lose decisional capacity
      (advanced gastro-intestinal malignancy). A nurse will deliver the TAILORED intervention in
      the clinic at baseline and will call the family member in 4- weeks to encourage ongoing
      patient-family discussion. Outcomes will be assessed at 8-weeks. A subgroup of family members
      whose loved one has died will be interviewed in-depth about their end-of-life decision making
      and the impact of the TAILORED Intervention. Aim 1: To test the effect of the TAILORED
      intervention on family decision-making self-efficacy at 8 weeks both with respect to the
      patient's present situation and in a hypothetical situation in which the patient lacks
      decision-making capacity. Aim 2: To test the effect of the TAILORED intervention on family
      psychological outcomes (depression, caregiver burden, decision making distress). Aim 3: To
      test the effect of the TAILORED intervention on patient and family satisfaction with family
      decision-making involvement. Aim 4: To explore family decision-making self-efficacy and
      perceptions of the TAILORED intervention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although most terminally
      ill patients prefer to share health care decision making with family and want family to make
      decisions for them if they are too ill to do so, few family members are prepared for this
      role and many report high levels of distress and even the inability to make such decisions.
      &quot;Trial of Ascertaining Individual preferences for Loved Ones' Role in End-of-life Decisions&quot;
      (the &quot;TAILORED&quot; study) tests a simple clinic-based protocol that allows clinicians to assess
      the confidence (self-efficacy) of family members for making health care decisions with or for
      a terminally ill loved one. Clinicians then tailor their guidance to patients and families
      about what issues to discuss to better prepare family members for the decision making role
      desired by the patient.
