    <textblock>
      The proposed study will recruit 60 women with breast cancer who finished undergoing treatment
      who complain of persistent insomnia problems that began with onset of their cancer diagnosis.
      The eligible women would be randomized and stratified by sleep problems to two arms:
      (Acupuncture Arm vs. Sham Acupuncture) with a goal of having 48 patients complete the study
      (we anticipate about 20% attrition rate). The study interventions will begin after patients
      completed their treatment. The placebo control for acupuncture will be a validated sham
      acupuncture control Assessments will be made with daily diaries and with weekly
      questionnaires. PSG data will be collected on the subsample of the population. Data will be
      gathered via pencil-and-paper measures before, during, immediately following, one month
      following the completion of treatment and six months after the conclusion of treatment. In
      addition, actigraphy data (objective sleep continuity data) will be acquired prior to and
      following treatment

    <description>Quality of life in breast cancer survivors after acupuncture will be measured through questionnaire using 28 item scale of functional assessment of chronic illness therapy- fatigue subscale (FACIT-F) version 4. Total score ranges from 0 to 108. A higher score indicates better quality of life.</description>
