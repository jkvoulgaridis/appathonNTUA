  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is working towards gaining a better understanding of the genetic and environmental
      factors involved in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), which includes autism, pervasive
      developmental disorder (PDD), and Asperger's syndrome. The investigators hope that
      information gained from this study will lead to new ways of diagnosing and treating ASDs.

      Participation generally takes less than 2 hours to complete and travel to Children's Hospital
      Boston is not required. Participants are asked some questions about their medical and family
      history. The investigators also request permission to review medical records related to the
      ASD diagnosis. Finally, the investigators obtain a small blood or saliva sample in order to
      search for genes that may be important in understanding ASD. The investigators can arrange
      for the blood draw through a participant's physician or a clinical laboratory and saliva
      samples can be obtained through the mail. The study questions are answered via telephone or
      mailed questionnaires. There is no cost to participate.
