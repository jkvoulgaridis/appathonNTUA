    <textblock>
      This study consisted of the Core Study and the Extension Part A and B. The Core Study
      consisted of 2 phases: Prerandomization and Randomization. The Prerandomization Phase lasted
      up to 1 week, during which participants were assessed for their eligibility to participate in
      the study. The Randomization Phase consisted of 3 periods: Titration (6 weeks), Maintenance
      (13 weeks), and Follow-up (4 weeks; only for those participants not rolling over into the
      Extension Phase). During the Core Study Titration and Maintenance Periods, participants were
      randomized into perampanel (2 to 12 mg per day) or placebo treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio
      within each of the age-matched categories (ie, greater than or equal to 12 to less than 15
      and greater than or equal to 15 to less than 18).

      The extension phase consisted of part A (Conversion Period - 6 weeks and Maintenance period -
      25 weeks) and Part B (Optional Extension Phase -52 weeks). The maximum duration for
      participation in Part B was 52 weeks.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 19 in Cognition Drug Research (CDR) System Global Cognition Score (Core Study)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Visit 2/Week 0 Evaluation) and Week 19 LOCF (last observation carried forward)</time_frame>
    <description>The CDR System Global Cognitive score was derived from the average of 5 CDR System cognitive domain scores (Power of Attention, Continuity of Attention, Quality of Episodic Memory, Quality of Working Memory, and Speed of Memory). The domain scores were normalized to mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10 before taking the average. The scale ranged from 0 - 100. An increase in the Global Cognitive Score indicates improvement, while a decrease indicates worsening in cognitive function.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline at Week 19 in the Power of Attention T-score in the Randomization Phase (Core Study)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 19</time_frame>
    <description>The Power of Attention domain (one of the 5 CDR System cognitive domains) was a measure of focused attention and information processing, comprised of the 3 CDR System attention tasks: the simple reaction time, choice reaction time and digit vigilance tasks. Z-scores were calculated for each domain by subtracting each participant's domain score from the normative population mean of that domain and dividing the result by the standard deviation (SD) of the normative population mean. Z-scores were converted into T-scores by multiplying by 50 and adding 50. Power of Attention were also multiplied by -1, so that for all domains, greater T-scores reflected superior cognitive function. T-scores ranged from 0 to 100, with a mean of 50 and an SD of 10. The CDR System Global Cognition score was created by adding the T-scores for the five domains. A decrease in the score of Power of Attention indicated improvement in cognitive function and a negative change reflects impairment from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline at Week 19 in the Continuity of Attention T-score in the Randomization Phase (Core Study)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 19</time_frame>
    <description>The Continuity of Attention domain (one of the 5 CDR System cognitive domains) was a measure of sustained attention, comprised of the accuracy scores from 2 of the CDR System attention tasks: choice reaction time and digit vigilance. Z-scores were calculated for this domain using normative data from the CDR System database for the age range of the study population. Specifically, Z-scores were calculated by subtracting each participant's domain score from the normative population mean of that domain and dividing the result by the SD of the normative population mean. Z-scores were converted into T-scores by multiplying by 50 and adding 50. Greater T-scores reflected superior cognitive function and a negative change from baseline reflects impairment compared to baseline. T-scores ranged from 0 to 100, with a mean of 50 and an SD of 10.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline at Week 19 in the Quality of Episodic Secondary Memory T-score in the Randomization Phase (Core Study)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 19</time_frame>
    <description>The Quality of Episodic Secondary Memory domain was a measure of the capability of individuals to encode, store, and subsequently retrieve verbal and nonverbal information in episodic (or declarative) memory; what was meant by memory in everyday terminology. This measure was derived by summing the scores from the 4 tasks: immediate and delayed word recall, word recognition, and picture recognition. Z-scores were calculated by subtracting each participant's domain score from the normative population mean of that domain and dividing the result by the SD of the normative population mean. Z-scores were converted into T-scores by multiplying by 50 and adding 50. Greater T-scores reflected superior cognitive function. T-scores ranged from 0 to 100, with a mean of 50 and an SD of 10. A high score reflects a good ability to store, hold and retrieve information of an episodic nature (i.e. an event or a name) and a negative change from baseline reflects impairment compared to baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline at Week 19 in the Quality of Working Memory (Short Term) T-score in the Randomization Phase (Core Study)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 19</time_frame>
    <description>The Quality of Working Memory domain (one of the 5 CDR System cognitive domains) was a measure of reflecting how well individuals can hold numeric and spatial information 'on line' in working memory. Z-scores were calculated by subtracting each participant's domain score from the normative population mean of that domain and dividing the result by the SD of the normative population mean. Z-scores were converted into T-scores by multiplying by 50 and adding 50. Greater T-scores reflected superior cognitive function. T-scores ranged from 0 to 100, with a mean of 50 and an SD of 10. A higher score reflects a good working memory and a negative change from baseline reflects impairment compared to the baseline assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline at Week 19 in the Speed of Memory T-score in the Randomization Phase (Core Study)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 19</time_frame>
    <description>The Speed of Memory domain (one of the 5 CDR System cognitive domains) was a measure, which reflects the time taken to accurately retrieve information from working and episodic memory. Z-scores were calculated for this domain using normative data from the CDR System database for the age range of the study population. Specifically, Z-scores were calculated by subtracting each participant's domain score from the normative population mean of that domain and dividing the result by the SD of the normative population mean. Z-scores were converted into T-scores by multiplying by 50 and adding 50. Speed of Memory were also multiplied by -1, so that for all domains, greater T-scores reflected superior cognitive function and a negative change from baseline reflects impairment compared to the baseline assessment. T-scores ranged from 0 to 100, with a mean of 50 and an SD of 10.</description>

    <description>The COWAT test measured the executive function of the frontal lobe and consisted of examinations of category/meaning fluency and letter/phoneme fluency. It consisted of 2 parts which included the Letter Fluency task and the Category Fluency task. For the Letter Fluency task, the participant was given one minute to list as many words as they could which began with a given letter from the following set of 3 letters: F, A, and L. The number of correct words from the 3 sets comprised the Letter Fluency score. For the Category Fluency task, the participant was given one minute to list as many words as they could which belonged to a given category. The number of correct words comprised the Category Fluency score. Total score was calculated as sum of acceptable words generated. The scale ranged from 0-90, with higher scores indicating improvement in language.</description>

    <description>The LGPT test measured visuomotor skills. This test was a manipulative dexterity test that consisted of a metal matrix of 25 holes with randomly positioned slots. The participant was required to insert 25 grooved pegs into the holes. The task was completed once for each hand; firstly, using the dominant hand followed by the non-dominant hand. The task was timed and the scores were the time taken for the participant to complete all 25 pegs for each hand. If the test cannot be completed within 300 seconds, 300 seconds were recorded for the time. An increase in score (longer time) indicated worsening of visuomotor skills. The time to complete test is presented as mean seconds +/- SD.</description>

             normal interictal EEGs were allowed provided that the subject met the other diagnosis
             criterion (ie, clinical history).

          6. Had a brain imaging (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] scan or computed
             tomography [CT]) within the 5 years prior to Visit 1 that ruled out a progressive
             cause of epilepsy.

          7. Had at least 1 partial-onset seizure during the 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 despite a
             stable regimen of 1 to 3 concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).

          8. Were currently being treated with stable doses of 1-3 AEDs. Only 1 inducer AED (either
             carbamazepine or phenytoin) out of the maximum of 3 AEDs was allowed.

          9. Were on a stable dose of the same concomitant AED(s) for at least 4 weeks prior to
             Visit 1; in the case where a new AED regimen was initiated for a subject, the dose
             must have been stable for at least 8 weeks prior to Visit 1.

         10. Female subjects of childbearing potential must had a negative serum human chorionic
             gonadotropin (beta-hCG) at Visit 1 and a negative urine pregnancy test prior to
             randomization at Visit 2. Female subjects of period of at least 60 days following
             administration of the last dose of study medication to commit to the consistent and
             correct use of a medically acceptable method of birth control (e.g., a double-barrier
             method [condom + spermicide, condom + diaphragm with spermicide]). Abstinence was
             considered an acceptable method of contraception on a case by case basis upon prior
             approval by the Medical Monitor.

         11. Had an intelligence quotient (IQ) of greater than or equal to 70, using the Kaufman
             Brief Intelligence Test, second edition (KBIT-2).

         12. Provided written informed consent signed by the legal guardian and a written assent
             from the subject prior to entering the study or undergoing any study procedures.

        Extension Phase:

        Had completed all scheduled visits up to and including Visit 8 in the Core Study
        Randomization Phase.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Had a diagnosis of primary generalized epilepsies or seizures such as absences and/or
             myoclonic epilepsies.

          2. Had current or a history of pseudo-seizures (psychogenic non-epileptic seizures
             [PNES]) within approximately 5 years prior to Visit 1.

          3. Had a diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

          4. Had seizure clusters where individual seizures could not be counted.

          5. Had a history of status epilepticus that required hospitalization during the 12 months
             prior to the Visit 1.

          6. Had an unstable psychiatric diagnosis that could confound the investigator's ability
             to conduct the study or that could prevent completion of the protocol specified tests
             (e.g., significant suicide risk, including suicidal behavior and ideation 6 months
             prior to Visit 1, current psychotic disorder, or acute mania).

          7. Had any concomitant illnesses/co-morbidities (e.g., autism, attention deficit
             hyperactivity disorder [ADHD]) at Visit 1 that could severely affect cognitive
             function during the course of the study.

          8. Had previously participated in a clinical trial involving perampanel.

          9. Had chronically or routinely use benzodiazepines and who have not discontinued the use
             at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1.

        <description>The Power of Attention domain (one of the 5 CDR System cognitive domains) was a measure of focused attention and information processing, comprised of the 3 CDR System attention tasks: the simple reaction time, choice reaction time and digit vigilance tasks. Z-scores were calculated for each domain by subtracting each participant's domain score from the normative population mean of that domain and dividing the result by the standard deviation (SD) of the normative population mean. Z-scores were converted into T-scores by multiplying by 50 and adding 50. Power of Attention were also multiplied by -1, so that for all domains, greater T-scores reflected superior cognitive function. T-scores ranged from 0 to 100, with a mean of 50 and an SD of 10. The CDR System Global Cognition score was created by adding the T-scores for the five domains. A decrease in the score of Power of Attention indicated improvement in cognitive function and a negative change reflects impairment from baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline at Week 19 in the Quality of Episodic Secondary Memory T-score in the Randomization Phase (Core Study)</title>
        <description>The Quality of Episodic Secondary Memory domain was a measure of the capability of individuals to encode, store, and subsequently retrieve verbal and nonverbal information in episodic (or declarative) memory; what was meant by memory in everyday terminology. This measure was derived by summing the scores from the 4 tasks: immediate and delayed word recall, word recognition, and picture recognition. Z-scores were calculated by subtracting each participant's domain score from the normative population mean of that domain and dividing the result by the SD of the normative population mean. Z-scores were converted into T-scores by multiplying by 50 and adding 50. Greater T-scores reflected superior cognitive function. T-scores ranged from 0 to 100, with a mean of 50 and an SD of 10. A high score reflects a good ability to store, hold and retrieve information of an episodic nature (i.e. an event or a name) and a negative change from baseline reflects impairment compared to baseline.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline at Week 19 in the Quality of Episodic Secondary Memory T-score in the Randomization Phase (Core Study)</title>
          <description>The Quality of Episodic Secondary Memory domain was a measure of the capability of individuals to encode, store, and subsequently retrieve verbal and nonverbal information in episodic (or declarative) memory; what was meant by memory in everyday terminology. This measure was derived by summing the scores from the 4 tasks: immediate and delayed word recall, word recognition, and picture recognition. Z-scores were calculated by subtracting each participant's domain score from the normative population mean of that domain and dividing the result by the SD of the normative population mean. Z-scores were converted into T-scores by multiplying by 50 and adding 50. Greater T-scores reflected superior cognitive function. T-scores ranged from 0 to 100, with a mean of 50 and an SD of 10. A high score reflects a good ability to store, hold and retrieve information of an episodic nature (i.e. an event or a name) and a negative change from baseline reflects impairment compared to baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline at Week 19 in the Quality of Working Memory (Short Term) T-score in the Randomization Phase (Core Study)</title>
        <description>The Quality of Working Memory domain (one of the 5 CDR System cognitive domains) was a measure of reflecting how well individuals can hold numeric and spatial information 'on line' in working memory. Z-scores were calculated by subtracting each participant's domain score from the normative population mean of that domain and dividing the result by the SD of the normative population mean. Z-scores were converted into T-scores by multiplying by 50 and adding 50. Greater T-scores reflected superior cognitive function. T-scores ranged from 0 to 100, with a mean of 50 and an SD of 10. A higher score reflects a good working memory and a negative change from baseline reflects impairment compared to the baseline assessment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline at Week 19 in the Speed of Memory T-score in the Randomization Phase (Core Study)</title>
        <description>The Speed of Memory domain (one of the 5 CDR System cognitive domains) was a measure, which reflects the time taken to accurately retrieve information from working and episodic memory. Z-scores were calculated for this domain using normative data from the CDR System database for the age range of the study population. Specifically, Z-scores were calculated by subtracting each participant's domain score from the normative population mean of that domain and dividing the result by the SD of the normative population mean. Z-scores were converted into T-scores by multiplying by 50 and adding 50. Speed of Memory were also multiplied by -1, so that for all domains, greater T-scores reflected superior cognitive function and a negative change from baseline reflects impairment compared to the baseline assessment. T-scores ranged from 0 to 100, with a mean of 50 and an SD of 10.</description>

        <description>A responder was a participant who experienced a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency per 28 days from pre-perampanel. The percentage of responders from Week 1 of perampanel treatment through successive 13-week intervals (Weeks 1 to 13 for subjects with any data, Weeks 1 to 26 for subjects with exposure of more than 13 weeks, Weeks 1 to 39 for subjects with exposure of more than 26 weeks, and Week 1 to 52 for subjects with exposure of more than 52 weeks) are presented. The perampanel exposure duration starts from the first perampanel dose (in the Core Study for subjects previously randomized to perampanel or Extension Phase for subjects previously randomized to placebo) to the last perampanel dose in the Extension Phase.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to End of Treatment in Cognition Drug Research (CDR) System Global Cognition Score (Extension Phase)</title>
        <description>The CDR System Global Cognitive was derived from the average of 5 CDR System cognitive domain scores (Power of Attention, Continuity of Attention, Quality of Episodic Memory, Quality of Working Memory, and Speed of Memory). Domain scores were normalized to mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10 before taking the average. The scale ranged from 0 to 100. An increase in the Global Cognitive Score indicates improvement, while a decrease indicates worsening in cognitive function. The perampanel exposure duration starts from the first perampanel dose (in the Core Study for subjects previously randomized to perampanel or Extension Phase for subjects previously randomized to placebo) to the last perampanel dose in the Extension Phase.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline by Visits in CDR System Domain T-Scores (Extension Phase)</title>
        <description>The Cognitive measure scores are presented as T-Scores. T-Scores were normalized standard scores with mean of 50 and SD of 10 with an absolute range of 0-100. The T-Scores are based on the norms from healthy age-matched controls from the CDR System database. Cohen's d-effect sizes were used to estimate the clinical relevance of a change in a parameter. A change in a score of 0.2 SD was defined by Cohen as a small effect size, 0.5 SD a medium effect size and 0.8 SD was considered a large effect size. An increase in the T-scores indicates improvement while a decrease in T-scores indicates worsening. Wk = Week and EOT=End of Treatment. The perampanel exposure duration starts from the first perampanel dose (in the Core Study for subjects previously randomized to perampanel or Extension Phase for subjects previously randomized to placebo) to the last perampanel dose in the Extension Phase.</description>

            <description>During the Extension phase, participants previously assigned to perampanel arm (Core Study) continued taking study medication at the dose achieved at the end of the Core Study once daily. Participants previously assigned to a placebo arm (Core Study) started perampanel dose at 2 mg/day and up-titrated weekly in 2-mg increments up to a maximum dose of 12 mg/day.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in CDR System Domain T-Score Over Time: Power of Attention (Extension Phase)</title>
        <description>The Cognitive measure scores are presented as T-Scores at specific intervals (Week 9 for subjects with exposure of more than 9 weeks, Week 19 for subjects with exposure of more than 19 weeks, Week 30 for subjects with exposure of more than 26 weeks, Week 39 for subjects with exposure of more than 39 weeks, and Week 52 for subjects with exposure of more than 52 weeks). T-Scores were normalized standard scores with mean of 50 and SD of 10 with an absolute range of 0-100. The T-Scores are based on the norms from healthy age-matched controls from the CDR System database. Cohen's d-effect sizes were used to estimate the clinical relevance of a change in a parameter. A change in a score of 0.2 SD was defined by Cohen as a small effect size, 0.5 SD a medium effect size and 0.8 SD was considered a large effect size. An increase in the T-scores indicates improvement while a decrease in T-scores indicates worsening.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in CDR System Domain T-Score Over Time: Continuity of Attention (Extension Phase)</title>
        <description>The Cognitive measure scores are presented as T-Scores at specific intervals (Week 9 for subjects with exposure of more than 9 weeks, Week 19 for subjects with exposure of more than 19 weeks, Week 30 for subjects with exposure of more than 26 weeks, Week 39 for subjects with exposure of more than 39 weeks, and Week 52 for subjects with exposure of more than 52 weeks). T-Scores were normalized standard scores with mean of 50 and SD of 10 with an absolute range of 0-100. The T-Scores are based on the norms from healthy age-matched controls from the CDR System database. Cohen's d-effect sizes were used to estimate the clinical relevance of a change in a parameter. A change in a score of 0.2 SD was defined by Cohen as a small effect size, 0.5 SD a medium effect size and 0.8 SD was considered a large effect size. An increase in the T-scores indicates improvement while a decrease in T-scores indicates worsening.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in CDR System Domain T-Score Over Time: Quality of Episodic Secondary Memory (Extension Phase)</title>
        <description>The Cognitive measure scores are presented as T-Scores at specific intervals (Week 9 for subjects with exposure of more than 9 weeks, Week 19 for subjects with exposure of more than 19 weeks, Week 30 for subjects with exposure of more than 26 weeks, Week 39 for subjects with exposure of more than 39 weeks, and Week 52 for subjects with exposure of more than 52 weeks). T-Scores were normalized standard scores with mean of 50 and SD of 10 with an absolute range of 0-100. The T-Scores are based on the norms from healthy age-matched controls from the CDR System database. Cohen's d-effect sizes were used to estimate the clinical relevance of a change in a parameter. A change in a score of 0.2 SD was defined by Cohen as a small effect size, 0.5 SD a medium effect size and 0.8 SD was considered a large effect size. An increase in the T-scores indicates improvement while a decrease in T-scores indicates worsening.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in CDR System Domain T-Score Over Time: Quality of Working Memory (Short Term) (Extension Phase)</title>
        <description>The cognitive measure scores are presented as T-Scores at specific intervals (Week 9 for participants with exposure of more than 9 weeks, Week 19 for participants with exposure of more than 19 weeks, Week 30 for participants with exposure of more than 26 weeks, Week 39 for participants with exposure of more than 39 weeks, and Week 52 for participants with exposure of more than 52 weeks). T-Scores were normalized standard scores with mean of 50 and SD of 10 with an absolute range of 0-100. The T-Scores are based on the norms from healthy age-matched controls from the CDR System database. Cohen's d-effect sizes were used to estimate the clinical relevance of a change in a parameter. A change in a score of 0.2 SD was defined by Cohen as a small effect size, 0.5 SD a medium effect size and 0.8 SD was considered a large effect size. An increase in the T-scores indicates improvement while a decrease in T-scores indicates worsening.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in CDR System Domain T-Score Over Time: Speed of Memory (Extension Phase)</title>
        <description>The Cognitive measure scores are presented as T-Scores at specific intervals (Week 9 for subjects with exposure of more than 9 weeks, Week 19 for subjects with exposure of more than 19 weeks, Week 30 for subjects with exposure of more than 26 weeks, Week 39 for subjects with exposure of more than 39 weeks, and Week 52 for subjects with exposure of more than 52 weeks). T-Scores were normalized standard scores with mean of 50 and SD of 10 with an absolute range of 0-100. The T-Scores are based on the norms from healthy age-matched controls from the CDR System database. Cohen's d-effect sizes were used to estimate the clinical relevance of a change in a parameter. A change in a score of 0.2 SD was defined by Cohen as a small effect size, 0.5 SD a medium effect size and 0.8 SD was considered a large effect size. An increase in the T-scores indicates improvement while a decrease in T-scores indicates worsening.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to End of Treatment in Controlled Oral Word Association Test Scores (COWAT) (Extension Phase)</title>
        <description>The COWAT test measured the executive function of the frontal lobe and consisted of examinations of category/meaning fluency and letter/phoneme fluency. It consisted of 2 parts which included the Letter Fluency task and the Category Fluency task. For the Letter Fluency task, the participant was given one minute to list as many words as they could which began with a given letter from the following set of 3 letters: F, A, and L. The number of correct words from the 3 sets comprised the Letter Fluency score. For the Category Fluency task, the participant was given one minute to list as many words as they could which belonged to a given category. The number of correct words comprised the Category Fluency score. Total score was calculated as sum of acceptable words generated. The scale ranged from 0-90, with higher scores indicating improvement in language.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to End of Treatment in Time to Complete Lafayette Grooved Pegboard Test (LGPT) (Extension Phase)</title>
        <description>The LGPT test measured visuomotor skills. This test was a manipulative dexterity test that consisted of a metal matrix of 25 holes with randomly positioned slots. The participant was required to insert 25 grooved pegs into the holes. The task was completed once for each hand; firstly, using the dominant hand followed by the non-dominant hand. The task was timed and the scores were the time taken for the participant to complete all 25 pegs for each hand. If the test cannot be completed within 300 seconds, 300 seconds were recorded for the time. An increase in score (longer time) indicated worsening of visuomotor skills. The time to complete test is presented as mean seconds +/- SD.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to End of Treatment in Time to Complete Lafayette Grooved Pegboard Test (LGPT) (Extension Phase)</title>
          <description>The LGPT test measured visuomotor skills. This test was a manipulative dexterity test that consisted of a metal matrix of 25 holes with randomly positioned slots. The participant was required to insert 25 grooved pegs into the holes. The task was completed once for each hand; firstly, using the dominant hand followed by the non-dominant hand. The task was timed and the scores were the time taken for the participant to complete all 25 pegs for each hand. If the test cannot be completed within 300 seconds, 300 seconds were recorded for the time. An increase in score (longer time) indicated worsening of visuomotor skills. The time to complete test is presented as mean seconds +/- SD.</description>
