  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of study was to compare affective (i.e., highlighted emotional
      benefits), instrumental (i.e., highlighted other health benefits), and self-regulation (i.e.,
      demonstrated ways to plan, set goals, etc.) interventions in terms of their ability to
      motivate less sitting in the workplace. Research of this type is important because people sit
      for long periods of time at work which adversely affects their health and productivity.

      It was hypothesized that the affective and self-regulation groups would sit less than the
      instrumental and control groups based on evidence indicating that affective attitude (i.e.,
      emotional evaluation of the behavior) and self-regulation techniques tend to predict
      behavior.

    <description>Learned how to self-monitor their sedentary behavior and active breaks. They also learned how to create prompts/cues (e.g., sticky note reminder), problem solve to overcome barriers, action plan (i.e., specifying when, where, and how to do the behavior), and set goals in order to be less sedentary according to SMART (i.e., specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, time-oriented) principles. Received intervention following measurements at baseline, week 4, and week 8.</description>
