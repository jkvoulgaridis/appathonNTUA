  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The question proposed by this study, is one of patient outcomes. Does intraoperative
      injection of Exparel decrease postoperative use of opioid pain medications in patients
      undergoing thyroid and parathyroid surgery? The trial seeks to assess the effect that Exparel
      has on postoperative pain control.

      Patients will be identified in clinic as good candidates for surgical intervention based on
      current standard of care. Once participants are consented, they will be randomly placed into
      one of three categories. The first category being patients undergoing surgery with local
      injection of lidocaine and epinephrine as is current practice. The second category of
      patients will undergo surgery with local injection of bupivacaine HCL and epinephrine
      preincision. The third group will undergo surgery with local injection of lidocaine and
      epinephrine preincision and Exparel postincision. As stated above, all patients will undergo
      surgery as planned, which will be standard of care, with the exception of the local
      anesthetic and timing of the injection. Postoperatively, patient's pain scores and opioid
      usage will be evaluated. Patients will be monitored by either using the patient's electronic
      medical record or by a pain journal that will be provided to the patients. The patients will
      record their pain using a scale of 1-10 with the FACES scale, as well as medication usage.
      Patients will return to their first postoperative appointment to further discuss their pain
      levels as well as medication usage. An ANOVA test will be used to determine if there is a
      significant difference in the amount of opioids taken postoperatively, in oral morphine
      equivalents, between these three groups. Opioid usage will then be compared between
      participants in different categories of local anesthetic to determine if there is an effect
      of postoperative opioid usage between different anesthetics.

To help with the randomization, the study team will enter the needed patient information into www.randomizer.org, which will categorize the patients into the desired groups.</masking_description>
