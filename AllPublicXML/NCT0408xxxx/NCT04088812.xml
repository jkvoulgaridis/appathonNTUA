  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the satiating effects of a meat derivative and a
      satiating compound on overweight subjects (BMI ≥25 and &lt;30 kg / m2).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, parallel, controlled and double-blind pilot study with 3 study arms is being
      performed to evaluate the satiating properties of a meat derivate and a satiating compound in
      a group of healthy overweight subjects.

      The investigators included 20 participants between 18 and 65 years (BMI ≥25 and &lt;30 kg / m2).
      All volunteers will be randomized into 3 study groups, and participants will receive the 2
      study products during the 3 experimental phases.
