  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective clinical trial that will examine if contrast-enhanced mammography
      substantially improves breast cancer detection compared to mammography with tomosynthesis,
      with minimal increase in false-positives, in women with a personal history of breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators expect to show in a prospective clinical trial that, in women with a
      personal history of breast cancer, contrast-enhanced mammography substantially improves
      breast cancer detection compared to mammography with tomosynthesis, with minimal increase in
      false positives. The investigators expect a substantial increase in node-negative invasive
      cancers in particular. Because DBT will be interpreted first by one reader, and CEM will be
      interpreted first, and independently, by a second reader, there will also be an assessment of
      performance of tomosynthesis alone or CEM alone in this population.

    <description>Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) is a new FDA-approved exam that is similar to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in depicting breast cancers due to increased and leaky blood vessels. Contrast-enhanced mammography is used as an adjunct following mammography and/or ultrasound examinations to localize a known or suspected lesion.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        -Asymptomatic women, ages 30-85, with a personal history of breast cancer who have had at
        least one routine mammogram since treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with a history of prior iodinated contrast reaction

          -  Women with implant(s) in the breasts to be screened (as this creates artifacts and
             diagnostic performance of imaging in women with implants likely does not generalize to
             those without implants, and the sample size with implants would be too small to infer
             conclusions)

          -  Women who have had bilateral mastectomy

          -  Women with a history of kidney failure or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
             &lt; 60 mL/min

          -  Pregnancy or lactation

          -  Contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (if needed for biopsy guidance):
             Pacemaker, metallic implant near vital structure, history of reaction to
             gadolinium-based contrast; body habitus (typically weight &gt; 300 lbs) incompatible with
             scanner; hardware that would cause artifacts in the breasts (e.g. spinal fixation
             rods)

          -  Severe claustrophobia

          -  Women actively being treated for cancer of any type with chemotherapy.
