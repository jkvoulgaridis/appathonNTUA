      This study will develop and test a cognitive-behavioral intervention for adolescents with
      binge/loss-of-control eating.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Youth who engage in binge eating or loss-of-control eating are at high risk for physical and
      mental health impairment, as well as excess weight gain. As there are few evidence-based
      treatments for adolescents with binge/loss-of-control eating, assessment and treatment have
      received minimal attention for adolescent patients. Among adults, cognitive-behavioral
      therapy (CBT) has a strong evidence base for binge-eating disorder. Adolescents have unique
      social, cognitive and emotional needs because of their developmental stage; unique treatment
      approaches are essential to meet these unique needs. This study will develop a new CBT
      treatment for adolescents with binge eating or loss-of-control eating (modifying adult CBT
      for binge-eating disorder, conducting interviews with adolescents about aspects of treatment
      that need to be modified, conducting an open series of patients who receive the active
      treatment). This study will also test the efficacy of the newly-developed CBT for adolescents
      with binge/loss-of-control eating versus a control group in a randomized controlled trial.
