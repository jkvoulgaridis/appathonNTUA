  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of patients undergoing total knee replacement rely on opioids for postoperative
      analgesia. These medications have undesirable side effects and potential for abuse and
      addiction. The aim of this cohort study is to determine the incidence rate of patients who
      are able to maintain a low dose opioid regimen after TKR with the use of a multimodal
      approach that includes intraoperative auricular acupuncture protocol.

    <description>Neuraxial anesthesia (spinal or combined spinal epidural (CSE) with up to 4cc mepivacaine 1.5%) and 2 blocks for postoperative pain (IPACK and adductor canal peripheral nerve blocks). Sedation will be provided. Tranexemic acid (TXA) will be dosed per surgeon request.
A certified medical acupuncturist will perform ipsilateral Auricular Trauma Protocol (ATP) acupuncture at eight ear points (Hypothalamus, Amygdala, Hippocampus, Prefrontal Cortex, Point Zero, Shen Men, Insula, Vagus) with 30Hz electrostimulation at two of those points (Shen Men and Hypothalamus). Acupuncture needles will be left in place and stimulated for 60 min and then removed. If an epidural is placed, it may be redosed with lidocaine as needed (up to 100mg total) and will be removed prior to transfer to the recovery room.
A periarticular injection (PAI) will be placed by the surgeon during the surgery (timing at the discretion of the surgeon)</description>
