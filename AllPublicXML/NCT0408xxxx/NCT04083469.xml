  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research will explore the feasibility of leveraging social network analysis to identify
      6th grade opinion leaders to lead a school-based e-cigarette intervention. The project will
      be conducted for 6th graders in 8 schools in the Pittsburgh area.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim 1: Participants will be recruited from 8 Pittsburgh-area schools. The
      investigators will conduct a social network survey for all 6th graders in each school.
      Students will be asked to identify their closest peers based on several relationship
      dynamics: friendship, opinion leadership, academic support, and personal support.

      Specific Aim 2: The investigators will adapt modules from CATCH My Breath, an evidence-based,
      school-implemented e-cigarette intervention supported by University of Texas and MD Anderson
      Cancer Center. The 8 schools will be randomized to receive the intervention led by either (1)
      an adult content-expert or (2) a peer-nominated opinion leader to students who nominated them
      or (3) a peer-nominated opinion leader to students who did not nominate them. Surveys will be
      administered before and after the intervention. Primary outcomes will be acceptability and
      feasibility measures, including (1) recruitment and (2) retention rates. Secondary outcomes
      will include e-cigarette use, intention-to-use e-cigarettes, and knowledge about
      e-cigarettes.

    <intervention_model_description>Investigators will conduct a social network survey for 6th graders. Students will be asked to identify their close peers based on several dynamics: friendship, opinion leadership, academic support, and personal support. Social network analyses will identify opinion leaders based on network centrality measures. Surveys will be administered before and after the intervention.
Investigators will adapt modules from CATCH My Breath, an evidence-based e-cigarette intervention supported by University of Texas and MD Anderson Cancer Center. The 8 schools will be randomized to receive the intervention led by either (1)an adult content-expert or (2)a peer-nominated opinion leader to students who nominated them or (3)a peer-nominated opinion leader to students who did not nominate them. Primary outcomes will be acceptability and feasibility measures, including (1)recruitment and (2)retention rates. Secondary outcomes will include intention-to-use e-cigarettes and knowledge about e-cigarettes.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Acceptability of the intervention will be assessed via the follow-up survey administrated to students following the program.
Do you feel the lessons were appropriate for the subject?
Were you confident in the person conducting the lesson?
Questions will be measured in a 5 point Likert scale.</description>
