  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The readmission of Heart Failure (HF) patients for exacerbation HF within 30-day is unmet
      goal. The mail reason for readmission is excessive accumulation of fluid in patient's lung.
      According our data (1,2) around 40% of HF patient have excessive lung fluid at discharge from
      HF hospitalization (&quot;unacceptable&quot; residual congestion on discharge). In other words, around
      40% patients are discharged from HF hospitalization prematurely when they are not ready to be
      discharged. Only 60% of HF patients are discharged from HF admission with &quot;acceptable&quot; level
      of residual pulmonary congestion (2). There are some techniques to assess &quot;readiness&quot; of HF
      patients for discharge. Pulmonary congestion (lung fluid accumulation) may be assessed
      non-invasively by measurement Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP), (3,4), by lung ultrasound
      (LUS), (5-7) and by Lung Impedance (LI) method (1,2). LUS is operator depended technique. LI
      and BNP techniques are most reliable methods (2) and easy to use.

Only patients who are unsuitable for discharge according to the lung impedance assessment will be enrolled in the study. The interventional group (half of the patients) will continue anti-congestive treatment while hospitalized until achieving a suitable level of decongestion.</description>
