      The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a deep learning algorithm to realize
      automatic recognition of colonic segments under conventional colonoscopy. Then, evaluate the
      accuracy this new artificial intelligence(AI) assisted recognition system in clinic practice.

      Colonoscopy is recommended as a routine examination for colorectal cancer screening. Complete
      inspection of all colon segments is the basis of colonoscopy quality control, and furthermore
      improves the detection rates of small adenomas. Recently, deep learning algorithm based on
      central neural networks (CNN) has shown multiple potential in computer-aided detection and
      computer-aided diagnose of gastrointestinal lesions. However, there is still a blank in
      recognition of anatomic sites, which restricts the realization of AI-aided lesions detection
      and disease severity scoring. This study aim to train an algorithm to recognize key colonic
      segments, and testify the accuracy of each segments recognition as compared to endoscopic
      physicians.

    <description>The segmental recognition accuracy is the proportion of correctly recognized segments divided by the number of involved patients. The accuracy rate of ileocecal valve, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon and rectum will be separately calculated.</description>

    <measure>The accuracy of total colonic segments recognition with deep learning algorithm as compared to endoscopic experts group.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The total recognition accuracy is the proportion of correctly recognized images divided by the number of AI captured images. Then all AI captured images will be reviewed by experts group to give a human evaluating rate. Two rates will be compared by student t test to analyze the difference.</description>

    <description>After receiving standard bowel preparation regimen, patients go through colonoscopy under the AI monitoring device. The whole withdrawal process is monitored by AI associated recognition system. Key colonic segments include ileocecal valve, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon and rectum. When typical anatomic sites are detected, the AI device will automatically captured relevant images and report the name of each segment on the screen. The operating endoscopy expert will give the final answer and judge the performance of AI, which is set as a golden standard. Then all the AI captured images will be reviewed by human group, which consists of three to five experienced endoscopic physicians.</description>
