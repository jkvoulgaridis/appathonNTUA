  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an adaptive design study. During the first phase of the study, participants will be
      randomized in 2:1 ratio to receive either MNTX 450 milligrams (mg) once daily (QD) or
      placebo. An interim analysis will be performed for futility and at that point a higher dosage
      regimen may be utilized for the active treatment group if the futility criteria are met. For
      the second stage of the study, interim analyses will be conducted for futility and sample
      size reassessment.

    <description>Participants will receive methylnaltrexone bromide (MNTX) 450 mg (3 tablets of 150 mg each) QD orally. If the initial interim analysis suggests a lack of efficacy, subsequent participants will receive 450 mg MNTX twice daily (BID) or three times daily (TID). Treatment will continue until participant's death or early withdrawal from study or study completion at Day 168.</description>

          -  Current use of a peripherally Acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist.

          -  Be a pregnant or breast-feeding woman.

             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the Principal Investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for
             the study.
