  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will evaluate an e_Prescription intervention can be integrated into an electronic
      screening program, which together exploit: (i) reach - the adult population has 100% mobile
      phone ownership and 92% internet national coverage; and (ii) behavioral change - the
      intervention can teach verbally and visually, thus bypassing literacy challenges, to allow
      simple, low-cost, repetition messaging for habit reinforcement. Uptake of the program through
      the various stages will be evaluated in ~2000 adults of a large representative suburban
      district of Karachi: As well as before-and-after physiological measures, including blood
      pressure (BP) and blood glucose, a random sample of 30-40 participants will be invited for
      interview to assess success and failure of the program. This is a pragmatic feasibility
      intervention implementation study.

  <detailed_description>

      The goal of this pilot study is to demonstrate feasibility of a scalable , population-wide,
      approach to early detection and management of people at high-risk of CVD using electronic
      screening, referral, treatment and lifestyle modification based on health theory and
      considerable background research for local applicability.

      It is a mixed method, feasibility study based in Malir District of Karachi, the largest city
      in Pakistan, to demonstrate uptake, participation and response of our mHealth intervention.

    <description>Individuals will be screened via the telephone, using a mobile-based algorithm that prompts questions about hypertension, risk of Diabetes Mellitus, use of smokeless tobacco and smoking, level of physical activity, and main nutritional choices. These questions are based on tools that have been validated in studies undertaken in this population and will be directly administered by trained research staff of Aga Khan University. Screening will prompt triage into three categories: &quot;high‟ - referred to the conveniently located integrated medical center for a medical teleconsultation and fasting glucose test; &quot;medium‟ - receive fasting glucose test and BP measurement; and &quot;low‟ risk. All subjects in each category will be enrolled in an e_Prescription intervention for lifestyle change tailored to their individual risk profile.</description>

        districts of Karachi (population 120 million), with urban, urban slum, and rural urban
        areas, and includes all ethnicities and economic strata of Pakistan. In this location, the
