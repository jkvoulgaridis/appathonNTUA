  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose is to assess whether assisted infant toilet training during the first
      year of life can prevent functional gastrointestinal and urinary tract disorders up to 4 year
      of age. Healthy Swedish children will be randomized to start assisted infant toilet training
      at 0-3 months of age or at 9-11 months of age.

      The toilet training process will be descibed including mother-to-infant attachment and
      parental stress.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mastery of toilet training is an important developmental milestone for children and
      parents. The age at which children start toilet training has increased during the last
      decades in the Western world. 50 years ago most children were out of nappies by 1,5 years of
      age. Today, wearing nappies by 3-4 years of age is considered normal. Meanwhile an increase
      in functional gastrointestinal and urinary tract disorders and toileting problems is reported
      by health care professionals.

      A randomized multicenter intervention study is conducted at Child Health Care Centers in
      Sweden to investigate whether assisted infant toilet training initated during the first year
      of life can prevent functional bowel and bladder disorders.

    <description>Parents to Children randomized to group A will be instructed in how infant toilet training is performed by the investigators. They recive a book in Swedish concering infant toilet training and a breif summary of the book made by the investigators. The parents are encouraged to begin infant toilet training as early as possible, but no later than 3 months of age.
The parents of Children in group A will be invited to a special parental forum once a month. Participation is recommended but not obligatory.
The definition of adherence to the intervention is to perform at least one attempt a day of infant toilet training (without the requirement of a successful outcome) on at least 5 out of 7 days per week.</description>

    <description>The parents learn to sensitively respond to the child's routines and signals of elimination needs.The child's ability to convey the need for bowel and bladder evacuation is enhanced through responsive interaction so that a kind of assisted dryness is developed. The infant is held &quot;squatting&quot; over a potty or basin, while older children sit on the potty.</description>
