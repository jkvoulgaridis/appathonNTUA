      A study to assess changes in mental and physical symptoms in adolescent inpatients with
      anorexia nervosa, a severe eating disorder.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective controlled trial to assess changes in psycho-physiological parameters,
      including eating disorder features (drive for thinness, body dissatisfaction) and comorbid
      symptoms such as anxiety, depression and quality of life as well as heart rate variability,
      body warmth and BMI in adolescent inpatients with anorexia nervosa. Parameters were assessed
      at admission, six weeks after admission and three months thereafter and compared to reference
      values of healthy controls.
