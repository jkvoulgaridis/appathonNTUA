  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As yet the investigators do not understand if there are biomarkers of immune protection after
      the Flumist or Live Attenuated Flu Vaccine (LAIV). Here the investigators test the hypothesis
      that the T-bet expressing fraction of flu-specific B cells after live attenuated influenza
      vaccination also serves as an early biomarker of long-lived antibody responses after
      vaccination. In this study the investigators will be providing the LAIV to up to 10 healthy
      subjects and assaying their immune response and then providing the intramuscular influenza
      vaccination and testing to see if the immune protection after the LAIV also protects after
      the intramuscular influenza vaccination.

      Previously (1) the investigators established that a fluorochrome labeled reagent with the
      influenza antigen hemagglutinin accurately identified flu-specific B cells after inactivated
      influenza vaccination and we established that a subset of these flu-specfiic B cells that
      express the lineage defining master transcriptional regulator, T-bet, correlate with long
      lived antibody responses. As yet the investigators do not understand if there are biomarkers
      of immune protection after the Flumist or Live Attenuated Flu Vaccine (LAIV). Here the
      investigators test the hypothesis that the T-bet expressing fraction of flu-specific B cells
      after live attenuated influenza vaccination also serves as an early biomarker of long-lived
      antibody responses after vaccination. In this study the investigators will be providing the
      LAIV to up to 10 healthy subjects and assaying their immune response and then providing the
      intramuscular influenza vaccination and testing to see if the immune protection after the
      LAIV also protects after the intramuscular influenza vaccination.
