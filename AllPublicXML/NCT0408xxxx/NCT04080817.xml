  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to now there is proven evidence of traditional logopedic therapy in aphasia, but recent
      computer-based algorithms also showed their evidence so far. Due to small and heterogenous
      study populations further trials are urgently needed. This prospective, randomized, clinical
      &amp; experimental controlled noninvasive study is intended to provide data for the therapy of an
      individual approach in aphasia patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prospective, randomized, clinical &amp; experimental controlled noninvasive study (Lexi) is
      intended to start in 10/2019. Adult and German speaking patients suffering from aphasia after
      stroke who give informed consent and whose life expectancy is estimated above 1 year are
      included and will be followed up for 3 months. If informed consent is not available their
      legal guardian will have to provide written informed consent for their contribution.

      After Randomization participants are divided into two different groups:

      Patients receiving a standard logopedic speech treatment versus individuals working with a
      computer-based solution (Neolexon® App on mobile devices). Both groups will also have
      self-training and therefore frequency and intensity of this is also going to be analyzed as
      well as in the clinical surrounding.

      There will be three different major ward rounds in both groups during the trial period where
      scales scoring the severity of aphasia are collected and compared (i.e. AABT or LAST).

      Furthermore epidemiologic data and stroke scales (i.e. NIHSS, mRS) are evaluated. The last
      round will be the follow-up after 3 months. Lexi will provide new data to fill the gap of
      organizational barriers and structural problems. Our aim is to show modern alternative
      therapy algorithms that approach the individual problem to offer a potential tailored
      solution to patients.

    <description>NIHSS &quot;National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale&quot;. It is a Scoring System , which objectively quantifies severity of stroke based on weighted evaluation findings.
Scoring: https://www.stroke.nih.gov/documents/NIH_Stroke_Scale.pdf Calculating/Interpreting: Higher Scores predict poor outcome and high severity of stroke. Low Scores are associated with minimal mortality and good prognosis. The minimum score being 0, and the maximum score being 42. Subscales are summed to a total Score (high score means worse prognosis, low score indicates a good prognosis.</description>

Scoring http://www.strokecenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/modified_rankin.pdf
There is only one total score. The minimum possible score is 0 and the maximum possible score is 6. A high score means worse prognosis/dead, low score indicates a good prognosis.
It is summed.</description>

    <description>&quot;US 5-level EuroQol 5-dimensional questionnaire&quot; Its a scoring tool, which objectively quantfies life quality. It consists of two seperate parts.
2. I: Scoring the Descriptive System with five dimensions. Each dimension has 5 boxes. 1-5 are scored as 1-5.
-&gt; There should be only 1 response for each dimension, Missing values can be coded as '9'. Ambiguous values should be treated as missing values.
Each health state is referred to in terms of a 5 digit code 11111 (best health state), 55555 (worst health state)
II: Scoring the VAS (visual analogue scale): This scale is numbered from 0 to 100. (100 means the best health you can imagine. 0 means the worst health you can imagine.) An X should be marked in the scale and then the number into a box. (Missing values should be coded as '999'.) https://euroqol.org/docs/Sample_UK__English__EQ-5D-5L_Paper_Self_complete.pdf, https://apersu.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Measuring-and-valuing-health-using-the-EQ-5D.pdf</description>
