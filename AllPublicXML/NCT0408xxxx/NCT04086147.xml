    <measure>Barthel index</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Barthel index at 90 days. The Barthel Index is a scale that indicates the ability to perform a selection of activities of daily living. It comprises 10 items (tasks), with total scores ranging from 0 (worst mobility in activities of daily living) to 100 (full mobility in activities of daily living) and it has adequate clinimetric (quality of clinical measurements) properties in stroke rehabilitation. In the index, the 10 items have these scoring combinations: a) 0 and 5, b) 0, 5 and 10, or c) 0, 5, 10 and 15. These items in the Barthel Index address a patient's ability in feeding, bathing, grooming, dressing, bowel and bladder control, toileting, chair transfer, ambulation and stair climbing.</description>
