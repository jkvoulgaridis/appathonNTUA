    <textblock>
      Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a sign of diabetic retinopathy that affects central vision.
      It is also a leading cause of visual decline in younger patients, especially in developing
      countries like our Arab community. Intra-vitrreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial
      growth factor (AVEGF) in management of DME had significant improvement in the final logMAR
      Un-corrected Distant Visual Acuity ( UCDVA) and logMAR Best Corrected Distant Visual Acuity
      (BCDVA), as well as reduction in the central retinal thickness from baseline measurement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators randomly assigned four hundreds eyes of diabetic patients with central
      diabetic macular edema for intra-vitreal injection of AVEGF group I (200 patients eyes)
      received aflibercept 2.0 mg and group II (200 patients eyes) received ranibizumab 0.3 mg.
      Injection was at 4 weeks interval according to the used protocol. The primary outcome was
      measuring the mean change in visual acuity as functional outcome and the secondary outcomes
      were the mean change in central macular thickness, as anatomical outcome rather than safety
      and efficacy of those two anti-VEGF drugs.
