  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Left atrial catheter ablation including pulmonary vein isolation is a standard therapy in the
      management of symptomatic atrial fibrillation; however thermal esophageal injury is a known
      potential consequence of this procedure. Delivery of radiofrequency (RF) energy necessary to
      perform left atrial ablation has the potential to cause injury to the nearby esophagus
      including ulceration, hematoma, spasm, esophageal motility disorders, and, in the most
      extreme case, atrial-esophageal fistula.Esophageal mucosal lesions are the likely precursor
      to AEF, and esophageal mucosal lesions have been detected on post-ablation endoscopy after
      pulmonary vein isolation with an incidence ranging from 3% to 60%.

      Active esophageal cooling during RF ablation as a means of esophageal injury prevention has
      been investigated through mathematical models, pre-clinical studies, and in clinical trials.
      Existing data support the efficacy of this approach, but the practice has not been widely
      adopted due to lack of a commercially available device.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact on procedural efficiency of ablation
      procedures performed using esophageal heat transfer to warm the esophagus during left atrial
      cryoablation.

      This study is a prospective, pilot study using the Attune Medical ensoETM esophageal heat
      transfer device to actively warm the esophagus during cryoablation procedures. This design is
      appropriate to gather the data needed regarding overall procedural time, compare this to
      historical controls, and estimate a sample size for a larger study powered for statistical
      significance.

      Once patient consent is obtained, the subject will undergo preparation and anesthesia
      procedures following standard practice. Once the patient is intubated, the esophageal heat
      transfer device will be placed into the esophagus according to the IFU. The device will
      remain in place until the ablation procedure is completed and will be removed before
      extubation. Left atrial cryoablation using the standard approach will be performed with the
      ensoETM set at a temperature of 42 degrees C.

      All patients will be followed up in total for 6 weeks (Long Term FU visit) after the
      procedure to document any clinical complication related to thermal esophageal injuries if
      applicable.
