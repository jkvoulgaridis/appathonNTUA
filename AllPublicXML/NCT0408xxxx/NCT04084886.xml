  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic nephropathy is one of microvascular complications of diabetes mellitus. DN is a
      multifactorial disorder that occurs in one third of patients with long standing DM. DN is one
      of the most serious complications that being a major contributing factor to end-stage renal
      disease and death in diabetic patients. The earliest clinical indication of DN is the
      appearance of microalbuminuria. Detection of diabetic nephropathy as early as possible, is
      the best chance of delaying progression to ESRD. Thus, screening for microalbuminuria is
      recommended annually immediately after a diagnosis of diabetes. Transcription factor 7-like 2
      is a highly variable transcription factor, which is a key component of the Wnt-signaling
      pathway and plays a role in the regulation of insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells and
      the maintenance of glucose homeostasis. TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism is more associated with
      T2DM which mediated by decreased insulin secretion associated with defects in insulin
      processing, reduced effects of glucagon-like peptide-1, increased hepatic glucose production
      and insulin resistance. The mutant TT genotype and the T allele frequency was associated with
      diabetic patients who developed nephropathy. Advanced glycation end products are generated by
      the non-enzymatic reaction of amino groups in DNA and proteins with reducing sugars. AGEs
      accumulate in glomerular basement membrane. The AGEs-RAGE interaction is a causative factor
      for DN through activating a series of intracellular signal-cascade pathways which induce the
      generation of further signalling factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor,
      transforming growth factor B, nuclear factor-κβ. Those signalling factors cause mesangial
      expansion and glomerulosclerosis.
