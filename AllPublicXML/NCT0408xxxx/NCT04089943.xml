  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MicroRNA-210 (miR-210) can be a potential therapeutic target of patients with peripheral
      artery disease (PAD). Recent evidence suggests the role of miR-210 and oxidative stress in
      the pathophysiology of PAD and its association with mitochondrial function, oxidative
      metabolism, walking distances and quality of life. The protocol evaluates the mechanisms
      which miR-210 regulates oxidative stress and provides evidence of potential therapeutic
      strategies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will randomize 180 PAD patients that undergoing a revascularization
      operation in two groups: (1) an endovascular procedure or (2) an open bypass procedure. They
      are also planing to recruit 50 non-PAD healthy control subjects.

      The goal is to answer the main hypothesis that miR-210 gene expression is a master regulator
      of oxidative stress and is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative metabolism,
      walking function and quality of life.
