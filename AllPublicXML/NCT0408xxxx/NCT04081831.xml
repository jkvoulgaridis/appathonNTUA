  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, researchers want to learn more about the effect of Aspirin taken as low dose
      (75 - 300mg) in preventing stomach, colorectal and esophagus cancer. The researchers are
      interested in the effect by duration of aspirin use and the effect on the time since aspirin
      intake has been stopped in preventing stomach, colorectal and esophagus cancer. In addition,
      the study will also look into the time patients survived after being diagnosed (survival
      rate) with cancer and number of cancer patients who died (case fatality rate).

      The study will be based on an electronic database managed by the Health Authority in Hong
      Kong containing anonymized clinical information of patients living in Hong Kong.

        Patients aged â‰¥40 years who received low dose aspirin (75-300mg) or paracetamol between 1st
        January 2004 and 31st December 2008 will be identified from CDARS (Clinical Data Analysis
        and Reporting System). CDARS is an electronic clinical database which is managed by the
        Hospital Authority (HA). More than seven million Hong Kong citizens have access to public
        healthcare services provided by HA.
