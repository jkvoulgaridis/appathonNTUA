  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will utilize ultrasound image texture variables to construct an elastic net
      regularized, logistic regression model to differentiate between healthy and Fibromyalgia
      patients. The collected ultrasound data will be from participants who are healthy, and from
      participants who have Fibromyalgia. The predicted performance accuracy of the diagnostic
      model will be validated and this will confirm or deny the hypothesis that differentiation
      between the two cohorts is possible.

    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) diagnosis remains a challenge for clinicians due to a lack of objective
      diagnostic tools. One proposed solution is the use of quantitative ultrasound (US)
      techniques, such as image texture analysis, which has demonstrated discriminatory
      capabilities with other chronic pain conditions. The investigators propose the use of US
      image texture variables to construct an elastic net regularized, logistic regression model,
      for differentiating between the trapezius muscle in the healthy and FM patients. 162
      Ultrasound videos of the right and left trapezius muscle were acquired from healthy
      participants and participants with FM. The videos will then be put through a mutli-step
      processing pipe including converting them into skeletal muscle regions of interest (ROI). The
      ROI's will be then filtered by an algorithm utilizing the complex wavelet structural
      similarity index (CW-SSIM), which removes ROI's that are too similar to one another.
      Eighty-eight texture variables will be extracted from the ROI's, which will be used in nested
      cross-validation to construct a logistic regression model with and without elastic net
      regularization. The generalized performance accuracy of both models will be estimated and
      confirmed with a final validation on a holdout test set. Depending on the predicted,
      generalized performance accuracy it will be validated or not by the final, holdout test set
      (confirming the model construction is accurate). These models should then confirm or deny the
      hypothesis that a regularized logistic regression model built on ultrasound texture features
      can accurately differentiate between healthy trapezius muscle and that of patients with FM.

    <measure>Fibromyalgia Diagnostic Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This evaluates symptoms related to Fibromyalgia and determines a score to assess the severity. This score is comprised of the Widespread Pain Index(WPI), which quantifies the regions of pain, and the Symptom Severity Scale(SSS), which measures qualitative aspects of pain such as fatigue and cognitive symptoms. The WPI scale ranges from 0-19 (0- no areas of body pain, 19- all body regions have pain), whereas the SSS ranges from 0-12 (0-no qualitative aspects of pain, 12-many qualitative aspects of pain). This criteria was evaluated on each patient to determine which cohort they belong to. According to the Fibromyalgia Diagnostic Criteria, one is diagnosed with Fibromyalgia if they have a WPI score of 7 or higher, and a SSS score of 5 or higher. Fibromyalgia is also diagnosed with a score of 3-6 on the WPI score, and a score of 9 or higher on the SSS score.</description>

    <measure>Central Sensitization Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This is a self reported outcome measure designed to identify patients that experience central sensitization. It involves 25 questions which include symptomatic experiences. The subject must answer on a scale of 0(never) to 5(always) corresponding to how often they experience these. The maximum score is 100 and a score of more than 40 indicates the presence of Central Sensitization. This criteria was evaluated on each patient to determine which cohort they belong to.</description>
