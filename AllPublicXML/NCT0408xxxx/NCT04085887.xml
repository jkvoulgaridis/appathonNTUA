      Primary objective: is to assess safety of panitumumab-IRDye800 in pediatric patients
      undergoing brain surgery to remove suspected tumors.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To identify the optimal dose of panitumumab IRDye800 in pediatric patients

        -  To determine efficacy of panitumumab IRDye800 to detect microscopic disease and residual
           tumor during surgical resection of pediatric malignant brain tumors

      Pediatric subjects will undergo standard of care, histopathologically-based, surgical
      resection of tumor 1 to 5 days after infusion of Panitumumab-IRDye800. Intraoperative imaging
      will be performed using an intraoperative optical imaging devices and wide-field imaging
      devices.

      Back table imaging of the resection tissue (ex vivo) will be also performed with the
      wide-field device. Ex vivo imaging of the specimens prior to and during pathological
      assessment will be performed using the non-invasive, close field imaging device that does not
      violate or destroy the tissue. Additional imaging devices used solely on the back table are
      not included in this record, as the data is collected is not used for medical decisions and
      such devices are therefore not interventions.

      Pediatric subjects will be followed for 30 days following their study infusion with scheduled
      follow up visits on the day of surgery (Day 1 5), Day 15, and Day 30.

    <measure>Toxicities (related adverse events)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events related to the agent or procedure are considered toxicities, and is assessed as the number of Grade 2 or higher adverse events which have been determined to be clinically-significant and definitely, probably, or possibly-related to the study treatment or procedure. The outcome is reported by dose treatment group (cohort) as a number without dispersion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Panitumumab-IRDye800 Fluorescence Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days</time_frame>
    <description>Dosing of panitumumab-IRDye800 in the study participants will be assessed on the basis of fluorescence intensity, determined as the ratio of fluorescence intensity in tumor tissue to that of normal tissue. This is known as the tumor-to-background ratio (TBR). The outcome will be reported by dose treatment group (cohort) as the mean TBR with standard deviation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tumor-to-background Ratio (TBR) Sensitivity and Specificity for Optimal Dose Level</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The merit of Panitumumab-IRDye800 to identify pediatric tumors during surgery will be assessed as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (PPV), based on the actual histopathological diagnosis for the excised lesions.
Sensitivity is the &quot;true positive rate&quot; (by histopathology), expressed as a proportion (ratio)
Specificity is the &quot;true negative rate,&quot; expressed as a proportion
Positive predictive value (PPV) is the proportion of tumor-positive samples that were actually cancer;
Negative predictive value (NPV) is the proportion of tumor-negative samples that were not cancer.
Per protocol, the analysis is only conducted for those participants who were treated with the optimal dose level. Higher values indicate greater merit. The outcome will be reported per protocol for the optimal dose level as the sensitivity; specificity; PPV; and NPV, with 95% confidence interval.</description>
