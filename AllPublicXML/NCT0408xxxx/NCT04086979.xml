  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) have problems with making
      and keeping friends. The current study compared the efficacy of two 10-week behavioral
      interventions for improving the friendships of children with this disorder. Participants were
      children ages 6-11 with ADHD and their families, who were experiencing friendship problems.
      Outcome measures assessed friendship quality and friendship behaviors at baseline
      (pre-treatment), post-treatment, and 8-month follow-up.
