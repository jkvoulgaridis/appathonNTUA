    <textblock>
      Office hysteroscopy is the gold standard technique in the diagnosis of the intrauterine
      pathologies. Some interventions may also be carried out through the hysteroscopy. No-touch
      hysteroscopy technique confers several advantages in terms of patient discomfort over the
      traditional technique. Clinicians performing the hysteroscopy find their way from the vaginal
      introitus to the uterine cavity through direct visualization of the anatomic structures on
      their route. The investigators hypothesize that the utilization of the information derived
      from the 'light physics' would facilitate camera navigation during no-touch hysteroscopy and
      consequently ease reaching the uterus. This study aimed to compare the standard no-touch
      technique with the 'light physics' enhanced camera navigation in terms of patient comfort and
      procedural pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Office hysteroscopy is basically used in the diagnosis of the intrauterine pathologies. 'No
      touch' vaginal hysteroscopy does not require a speculum or tenaculum; thus, confers
      advantages in terms of patient discomfort over the traditional technique. The source of the
      pain in traditional hysteroscopy is the distention of the uterine cavity with the saline and
      the contact of the hysteroscopy equipment with the vagina and the cervical canal. The benefit
      in the pain obtained with the 'no-touch' technique is derived from the limitation of the
      contact of the hysteroscopy equipment with the vagina and the cervical canal. Clinicians
      performing the hysteroscopy find their way from the vaginal introitus to the uterine cavity
      through direct visualization of the anatomic structures on their route.

      Physics has been critical in the development of endoscopic techniques such as laparoscopy,
      cystoscopy, and hysteroscopy. The light source provides an illumined environment during the
      imagination with these techniques. During hysteroscopy, the light reflecting from the
      adjacent tissue appears bright, however, this reflection is weaker in farther tissue and
      these structures appear dark. With this in mind, the investigators hypothesize that the
      utilization of the information derived from the 'light physics' would facilitate camera
      navigation during no-touch hysteroscopy and consequently ease reaching the uterus. This study
      aimed to compare the standard no-touch technique with the 'light physics' enhanced camera
      navigation in terms of patient comfort and procedural pain.

    <description>This procedure will be performed by the gynecologists who are familiar to the rules of the 'lights physics' and are currently 'lights physics' rules in their clinical practice. The brightness or darkness of the tissue which reflects the distance between the light source and the surrounding tissue will be used to find the correct route from the vagina introitus to the uterine cavity.</description>

    <description>Patients in this arm of the study protocol will receive standard hysteroscopy with 'no-touch' technique without the utilization of the 'lights physics' rules. The gynecologist performing this procedure will find their route from the vagina introitus to the uterine cavity by the identification of the anatomical structures on their way.</description>
