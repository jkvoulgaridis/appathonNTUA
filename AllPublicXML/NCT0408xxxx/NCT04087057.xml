    <textblock>
      This trial studies the barriers associated with timely chemotherapy given after surgery
      (adjuvant) in patients with invasive breast cancer. Meeting with patients and asking
      questions may help doctors to learn about factors that can cause delays in the start of
      chemotherapy after surgery in patients with breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To comprehensively and qualitatively assess and identify the determinants of time to
      chemotherapy (TTC) delays in a vulnerable population using qualitative methods.

      Ia. To describe the health literacy/numeracy, social support and level of trust in physicians
      of the study participants. (Exploratory)

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete questionnaires and participate in an interview to answer questions about
      the information patients received before starting the chemotherapy, any medical problems
      after the surgery that could have been related to the start of the chemotherapy, how the
      chemotherapy affected patients' life, and anything else patients may remember between the
      time when the breast surgery ended and the first dose of chemotherapy started. Patients'
      medical records are also reviewed.
