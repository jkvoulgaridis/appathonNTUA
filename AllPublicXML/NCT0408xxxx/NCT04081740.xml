    <ipd_description>The general goal is to, in as much as possible, make the study data available to interested researchers as well as to provide proof of transparency for the study. Data (and an accompanying data dictionary) will be de-identified and potentially further cleaned or aggregated as the investigators deem necessary to protect participant anonymity. Due to conditions imposed by French law, data will be made available to the public upon request to the study sponsor and fulfilment of French legal requirements.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_time_frame>Requests for individual datasets can be made anytime following full publication of results.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Due to French law there are restrictions on publicly sharing the data of this study. Data requests may be submitted to the study sponsor and must be approved by the French data protection authority (la Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL)). French law requires that everyone who wishes to access clinical study data on humans must ask the CNIL for permission.
