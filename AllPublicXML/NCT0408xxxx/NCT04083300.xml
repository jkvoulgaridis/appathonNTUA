  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is a five-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial testing a stepped care
      stress management program. The main goal is to examining differences in long-term effects on
      cancer-related stress reactions and emotional reactivity between the intervention and control
      group. In addition, we want to investigate cancer patients experiences concerning follow-up
      and the transition from specialist health services to municipal health services. The
      consequences of cancer and its treatment over time, and the participants' own experiences
      with living an active and social life after cancer, e.g. related to physical activity and
      working life will also be investigated.

      Major improvements in cancer detection and treatment lead to longer life expectancy among
      cancer survivors. This may in turn lead to more late effects and many have to deal with
      long-term consequences of the disease and its therapy. Returning to work is often an
      important part of returning to normal life for patients in working age. Many cancer survivors
      have trouble with participation in working life, and cancer is a significant cause of absence
      from work, unemployment and early retirement. There is increasing knowledge around late
      effects, but there is still lack of knowledge concerning the life of those experiencing late
      effects. There is a need for more knowledge concerning late effects impact on work
      participation over time, and how employers and the social security offices (NAV) can
      facilitate for work participation in a better way. Official register data from the Norwegian
      Labour and Welfare Administration (the NAV administration) will provide us information about
      the work- and benefit situation through the whole follow-up period of five years. The
      register data include information about type of social benefits (sick-leave benefit, work
      assessment allowance (WAA), disability pension, unemployment benefit and retirement pension),
      as well as information about occupation, income and sick leave diagnosis. Focus group
      interviews will give us insight in the participants own experiences with the transition from
      the specialist health services to the primary health care and the follow-up in the
      municipalities, from employers and NAV, and information about their presence and efficiency
      at the workplace.

      Both quantitative and qualitative methods will be utilized to answer our research questions.
      Standardized questionnaires will be employed to investigate the relationship between the
      participants' health situation, quality of life and level of physical activity. The
      questionnaires contain questions about stress, subjective health complaints, diseases,
      anxiety, depression, fatigue, physical activity, education, income and work ability.
