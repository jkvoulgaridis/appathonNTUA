  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if walking biobehavioral intervention improves
      physical activity after dysvascular lower limb amputation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sedentary lifestyles and high levels of disability are relevant public and personal health
      issues resulting from the chronic comorbid condition of dysvascular lower limb amputation.
      This study examines the use of an evidence-based walking biobehavioral intervention to
      increase physical activity after dysvascular amputation. The proposed intervention leverages
      successes in conventional prosthetic rehabilitation, while addressing the complex health
      conditions and chronic sedentary behaviors that underlie dysvascular amputation, with the
      ultimate goal of improved physical activity self-management to minimize disability.

    <description>The EXP group will receive biobehavioral training that is integrated into the conventional outpatient training component and is delivered over 5 months. There will be 10 biobehavioral sessions, 1 of which will be a combined biobehavioral/conventional outpatient session and the other 9 being telehealth sessions.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Walking Biobehavioral Intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>Each walking biobehavioral training session includes self-monitoring, tailored feedback, identification of barriers and facilitators, problem solving, action planning and encouragement. Self-monitoring of walking behavior will occur with participant use of the FitBit sensor and software, reviewed with the interventionist at each session. Tailored feedback from the FitBit sensor, as well as feedback from the interventionist, will detail progress over time and be compared to baseline data. Barriers and facilitators of reaching activity goals will be discussed with emphasis on problem solving to take advantage of facilitators and minimize/remove participant-specific barriers. Action planning will be based on weekly step goals set collaboratively by the interventionist and participant, based the FitBit data. Finally, encouragement will be provided by the interventionist by putting progress or lack of progress in perspective of the efforts made by the participant.</description>

    <intervention_name>Attention Control</intervention_name>
    <description>Attention control sessions will include a brief review of the conventional home-exercises, a summary of all healthcare visits and falls, and interventionist-delivered education on safety topics (e.g., fall prevention, wound care, assistive device use). Outpatient therapists will provide home-based exercises to ensure that the participant receives adequate training and demonstrates safe performance prior to home use. The CTL interventionist will assess and discuss the safe performance of each home-based exercise with CTL group participants. Exercises in the CTL group will only be progressed by the outpatient physical therapist and not during the telehealth sessions.</description>
