  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous research has demonstrated that the food found in Quorn 'Mycoprotein' can lower the
      blood glucose response to a meal, which may be an important finding for the management of
      type 2 diabetes. However, it has never been investigated how this lower response occurs, and
      whether there is dose-dependent response with mycoprotein. The present study will include 12
      healthy young adults, who will visit the laboratory for 3 test days, with each day lasting 9
      hours. On each visit, separated by a washout period of at least 2 weeks, participants will
      ingest either a control drink with no mycoprotein, a drink containing 20g mycoprotein or a
      drink containing 40g mycoprotein. By intravenously infusing labelled glucose during each
      visit in combination with repeated blood sampling, investigators will determine if the lower
      blood glucose after mycoprotein ingestion is due to reduced glucose absorption from the gut
      or increased uptake into body tissues.
