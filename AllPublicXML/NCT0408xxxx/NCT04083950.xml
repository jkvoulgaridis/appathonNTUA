    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of an oral typhoid vaccine on disruption of the intestinal
      barrier and response of the immune system. Intestinal and whole-body responses will be
      measured in all participants before and after the vaccine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The licensed Ty21a vaccine strain of S. enterica Typhi is routinely used by travelers to
      countries where typhoid is common. It is not known whether the vaccine causes measurable
      changes in intestinal permeability and whether changes in permeability are correlated with
      the magnitude of the vaccine response. In the current study, gut permeability will be
      measured in participants at baseline and after an aspirin challenge, which is known to
      disrupt intestinal permeability, and after the first, second, and fourth doses of a the Ty21a
      vaccine. Intestinal permeability will be measured using a three-sugar absorption test
      composed of lactulose, mannitol, and sucralose and by several plasma markers. Vaccine
      response will be measured by quantitating T cells and newly developed IgG-or IgA-secreting
      plasma cells specific for Ty21a.
