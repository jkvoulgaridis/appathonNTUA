  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peri-operative opioid administration has long been one of the three pillars of 'balanced
      anaesthesia',over the span of just a few years,opioids were widely used in perioperative
      analgesia because of pain as the fifth vital sign.However, opioid administration is not
      without concern and is associated with many side-effects such as constipation, urinary
      retention, respiratory depression and postoperative nausea and vomiting .Cleft
      lip,palate,alveolus are common craniofacial abnormalities and usually require surgical
      repair.These patients have risks for various perioperative complications due to their young
      age and craniofacial abnormalities.

      This study was designed to compare the effects of opioid based anesthesia（OBA） and opioid
      free anesthesia(OFA )on perioperative complications in patients with in cleft
      lip,palate,alveolus surgery, including respiratory depression, postoperative nausea and
      vomiting, hemodynamic effects, etc.
