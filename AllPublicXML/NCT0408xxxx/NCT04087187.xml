  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to evaluate the AZD5718 pharmacokinetic (PK) doses in order to
      determine exposure in a new dose range and compare with previous results. This study will
      include 14 subjects in a single site in United Kingdom. Each subject will be involved in the
      study for 6 to 7 weeks.

    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-label, randomized, 3-period, 3-treatment, crossover study
      performed in healthy subjects at a single study center.

      A total of 14 healthy male and female subjects (of no childbearing potential) will be
      randomized to ensure that at least 12 subjects are evaluable. Each subject will receive 3
      different treatments at least 4 days apart and will be dosed following an overnight fast of
      at least 10 hours. The following treatments will be given:

        -  Treatment A: AZD5718 Dose A tablet

        -  Treatment B: AZD5718 Dose B tablet

        -  Treatment C: AZD5718 Dose C tablet

      The study will comprise:

        -  A Screening Period of maximum 28 days.

        -  Three Treatment Periods during which subjects will be resident from the day before first
           dosing with AZD5718 (Day -1) in Treatment Period 1 until at least 48 hours after last
           dosing with AZD5718 in Treatment Period 3 for collection of PK and safety samples.
           Subjects will be discharged on Day 3 of Treatment Period 3.

        -  A Follow up Visit, 5 to 7 days after the last dose of investigational medicinal product
           (IMP).

      There will be a minimum washout period of 4 days between each dose administration.

      Each subject will be involved in the study for 6 to 7 weeks. This study will be conducted in
      male and female subjects aged 18 to 55 years.
