  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For therapy of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in premature babies, there are several
      established options. An important therapeutic aspect is the tracheal administration of
      exogenous surfactant into the child's lung.

      In the recent years, several methods have been developed. The methods differ in the selected
      ventilation mode (intubation with mechanical ventilation vs. Continous Positive Airway
      Pressure (CPAP)-supported spontaneous breathing) and in the way in which the application of
      surfactant is technically conducted (via endotracheal tube, endotracheal catheter or
      nebulization).

      In selection of ventilation technique, there is an upcoming trend towards less invasive
      respiratory support via CPAP. While this may increase the rate of complications on the one
      side (i.e. pneumothorax), it shows much lower oxygen demand and a shorter need for mechanical
      ventilation on the other side.

      In the selection of the administration technique, different methods were repeatedly developed
      to adapt the surfactant administration to the CPAP therapy. In this study, a newly developed
      and in the European Community now certified (CE-Mark) application aid (Neofact) will be
      tested for the first time on preterm infants, to verify the feasibility.

    <time_frame>Administration of surfactant + 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility will be defined as a correct intratracheal position of the catheter (visually controlled via videolaryngoscope) OR responsiveness of the child to the surfactant administration (defined as decrease of the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of at least 0.05 within 30 minutes after the application OR FiO2 decrease to 0.21 with simultaneous improvement of the modified Silverman Andersen Respiratory Severity Score (RSS) ≥ 2 within 30 minutes after the application) without switching to a conventional LISA method
RSS in the modified version of McAdams RM et al. The RSS consists of 5 categories that assess the respiratory work of the child in a range from 0 to 2 in each category. This results in a summarized score of 0 to 10, in which 0 defines a healthy neonate without increased work of breathing and 10 a neonate with maximum respiratory distress.</description>
