  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well software-aided imaging works in confirming tumor
      coverage with ablation (the removal or destruction of a body part or tissue or its function)
      on patients with liver tumors. The current standard for targeting tumor cells and evaluating
      the outcome of a liver ablation procedure is a visual inspection of the pre- and
      post-procedure computed tomography (CT) scans. Software-aided imaging systems, such as
      Morfeus, may help to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of liver ablation.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate if the intra-procedure feedback of a biomechanical deformable registration
      volumetric image method during percutaneous ablation will increase the minimal ablation
      margins on a three-dimensional computed tomography-generated analysis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess whether applying the proposed method during percutaneous ablation improves local
      tumor progression-free survival (LTPFS) rates.

      II. Evaluate impact of software use on procedure workflow. III. Impact of software use on
      complication rates, quality of life, liver function.

      IV. Evaluate oncological outcomes (intra-hepatic and overall progression-free survivals, and
      overall survival).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo standard of care ablation.

      ARM II: Patients undergo standard of care ablation with software-aided imaging (Morfeus).

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months, and then at 1 and
      2 years.

    <description>Will assess whether applying biomechanical models increase the minimal margins of ablated lesions properly covered by ablation on a three-dimensional analysis. The average minimum ablation margins will be compared between two arms using a 2-sample t-test (or Wilcoxon rank-sum test).
