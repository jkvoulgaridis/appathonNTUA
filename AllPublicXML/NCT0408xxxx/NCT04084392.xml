    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine whether referral to the Bridge Clinic reduces overall index
      hospital length of stay when compared to direct referral to a long-term outpatient addiction
      provider for patients with active opioid use disorder (OUD) being considered for
      medications-for-addiction treatment (MAT).
