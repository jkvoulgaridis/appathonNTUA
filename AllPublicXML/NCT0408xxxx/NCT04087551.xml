  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first phase of the study aims to study the incidence of near-falls. The second phase will
      be to develop a scale which operationalize balance recovery confidence in the older adults.
      This study will determine the incidence of near-falls in a sample of community-dwelling older
      adults and will develop the Balance Recovery Falls-Efficacy scale (BRFES) for the
      community-dwelling older adults using the COSMIN method. This scale will be used to measure
      the confidence level of the community-dwelling older adults in their ability to execute
      balance recovery maneuvers in common, everyday functional activities to prevent a fall.

      This study will progress through two phases

      The first phase will recruit 30 older adults from ages of 65 and older living in the
      community. A study administrator will contact the participants daily over a 21-day period to
      obtain frequency and type of event experienced e.g. no fall, fall, near fall (hand),
      near-fall (leg) or near-fall (other). No other details of the event will be ascertained
      because this preliminary study will be to determine the incidence of near-falls in a sample
      of community-dwelling seniors.

      The second phase will be to develop a scale which operationalize balance recovery confidence
      in community-dwelling older adults. In the first stage of the study, twelve older adults will
      be recruited to develop a comprehensive list of relevant items for the scale. Purposive
      sampling will be used to invite participants from the earlier study. This approach will
      ensure sample representativeness of the population and to include participants who have had
      demonstrated an understanding of near-falls and balance recovery maneuvres in the previous
      study to develop the scale. An exhaustive list of scale items will be generated from two
      focus group formed by six participants using a nominal group technique. This consensus-based
      technique ensures that all items in the scale are relevant and comprehensible to the
      community-dwelling older adults to discriminate the confidence level in one's ability to
      perform balance recovery maneuvres. The scale will then be sent to a panel of 50 experts
      including healthcare professionals as well as a new group of community-dwelling older adults
      to determine the appropriateness of items ensuring that the scale is relevant, comprehensive
      and comprehensible. Delphi technique will be adopted as the method to obtain a consensus
      among experts to finalize the Balance Recovery Falls-Efficacy Scale (BRFES).

    <intervention_model_description>Phase 1 Participants will be requested to report the incidence of no fall, near-fall or a fall daily over the next 21-day period. There will be 3 options given to the participants: (1) a daily telephone call at a prearranged timing or (2) a daily text message given at a prearranged timing or both. A study administrator will contact the participant daily using the preferred mode of reporting. All information will be recorded in a logbook.
Phase 2 The development of the Balance Recovery Falls-Efficacy scale will be guided using the COSMIN methodology. This development is based on inputs from the community-dwelling older adults to ensure relevance, comprehensiveness and comprehensibility. The scale would then be validated with a group of healthcare professionals and another new group of community-dwelling older adults using the Delphi method.</intervention_model_description>

The construct measured is the confidence in one's ability to execute balance recovery manoeuvres in common, everyday functional activities to prevent a fall. The scale response option ranged from 1 to 10 with a higher score reflecting higher confidence. The scale would have 16 items indicating a total score range of 16 to 160. A higher total score value represent a better outcome.</description>

    <description>Two groups of six community-dwelling older adults will participate in a focus group session. Each focus group session will begin with a trained facilitator using a session guide welcoming the participants and introducing the participants in the group. The session will adopt a nominal group method which includes silent generation of ideas, sharing of an idea in a 'round robin' fashion, group discussion to clarify ideas and then completing the session with anonymous voting to include items into a list of items to be included in the Balance Recovery Falls-Efficacy Scale (BRFES).</description>

    <description>The finalized list of items will be discussed by two researchers who will combine similar items generated by the two focus groups to complete the Balance Recovery Falls-Efficacy Scale. The list of items has been developed by a group of community-dwelling older adults who had demonstrated an understanding of near-falls and will be able to articulate the use of balance recovery strategies used in near-fall experiences.</description>
