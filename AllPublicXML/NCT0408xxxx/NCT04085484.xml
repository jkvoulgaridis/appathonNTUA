    <textblock>
      A single-center retrospective observational study comparing two cohorts of very low birth
      weight (VLBW, birth weight &lt; 1500 grams) infants who received parenteral nutrition (PN)
      either before or after a concentrated PN regime was implemented into clinical use. Primary
      outcome is weight SDS at 28 days.

      This study is a single-center retrospective observational study comparing two cohorts of very
      low birth weight (VLBW, birth weight &lt; 1500 grams) infants who received parenteral nutrition
      (PN) either before or after a concentrated PN regime was implemented into clinical use. Both
      PN regimes were based on standardized PN solutions with the possibility to complement with
      additive nutritional products according to individual assessment by the attending physician.
      To meet recommended macronutrient intakes, in 2012 a concentrated parenteral nutrition regime
      was implemented into clinical use at the neonatal intensive care unit in Umeå University
      hospital, Sweden. However, there is a lack of data on how changes in nutrient intakes affect
      growth and electrolyte status in preterm infants. Recent studies have demonstrated an
      increased incidence of hypokalaemia, hypophosphatemia and hypercalcaemia in infants who
      received enhanced parenteral energy and protein intakes.

      This study is a single-center retrospective observational study comparing two cohorts of very
      low birth weight (VLBW, birth weight &lt; 1500 grams) infants who received parenteral nutrition
      (PN) either before or after a concentrated PN regime was implemented into clinical use. Both
      PN regimes were based on standardized PN solutions with the possibility to complement with
      additive nutritional products according to individual assessment by the attending physician.
