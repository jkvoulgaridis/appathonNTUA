  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of using
      nitrous oxide (N2O) sedation for intrauterine device (IUD) insertions for nulliparous
      adolescent and young adult women in a primary care clinic setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research study is to learn more about how to make the intrauterine
      device (IUD) insertion procedure more comfortable. IUDs are highly effective at preventing
      pregnancy and are also used to treat gynecological conditions such as endometriosis or heavy
      periods. Unfortunately, many adolescents and young adults do not get an IUD because the
      insertion procedure can be painful. Currently, there are no medications that successfully
      reduce pain during IUD insertion for adolescents in the outpatient clinic setting.

      We plan to study if nitrous oxide sedation is a feasible strategy for improving the IUD
      insertion experience for adolescents and young adult women. Although nitrous oxide is already
      used to manage pain and anxiety in other medical settings (such as for pain during labor or
      dental procedures), nitrous oxide sedation has not been rigorously studied for IUD insertions
      in teenagers and young adults.

      During phase one of our study (&quot;pre-implementation phase&quot;), study participants will receive
      current standard of care (ibuprofen) for managing pain during IUD insertions. In phase two
      (&quot;post-implementation phase&quot;), study participants will receive nitrous oxide sedation in
      addition to ibuprofen during IUD insertions. We will survey study participants to assess the
      feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of nitrous oxide sedation for IUD insertions in
      the primary care clinic setting.

      This study will help clinicians understand whether nitrous oxide could be a practical and
      effective way to manage pain and anxiety for adolescents during IUD insertion procedures.
      Ultimately, we hope this study will lead to increased satisfaction with the IUD insertion
      procedure and increased use of this highly effective method of contraception among
      adolescents.

    <description>Patients will be assigned to a &quot;pre-implementation&quot; (control) group or a &quot;post-implementation&quot; (treatment) group. The first twelve participants will be the control group and the next twelve participants will be the treatment group. The treatment group will receive inhaled N2O/O2. All participants will receive pre-procedural standard of care for IUD insertions, including 400-600 mg ibuprofen orally at least 20 minutes prior to insertion to reduce post-procedure pain. The N2O will be gradually up-titrated to a goal ratio of 70/30 N2O/O2. N2O/O2 will be administered per Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) N2O sedation protocol. Prior to speculum placement, treatment group participants will receive the inhaled gas until minimal sedation is achieved per BCH sedation guidelines, such that the patient is cooperative, oriented, and tranquil. Inhaled N2O will be administered throughout the duration of the procedure.</description>
