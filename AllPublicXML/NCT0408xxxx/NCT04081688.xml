  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects of atezolizumab, varlilumab, and radiation
      therapy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other places
      in the body (advanced) and cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). Immunotherapy with
      monoclonal antibodies such as atezolizumab may help the body's immune system attack the
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Immunotherapy
      with monoclonal antibodies such as varlilumab may induce changes in body?s immune system and
      may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Radiation therapy uses high
      energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving atezolizumab, varlilumab, and
      radiation therapy may increase the amount of time the disease is not active or does not
      spread to another part of the body.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of combined therapy with atezolizumab and varlilumab
      in combination with radiation in adult patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) who have progressed on prior PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine objective response rate (excluding the irradiated lesion) of therapy with
      atezolizumab and varlilumab in combination with radiation.

      II. To estimate clinical benefit rate of the combination. III. To estimate median
      progression-free survival of the combination. IV. To compare the frequency of immune-related
      adverse events (irAEs).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive varlilumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1 and atezolizumab IV
      over 30-60 minutes on day 2. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 1 year (18 cycles) in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning on day 8 of cycle 1,
      patients also receive 4 or 5 fractions of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) over
      15-30 minutes every 2 days over 1.5-2 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 3 months
      for up to 1 year.

          -  Must have signed and dated written informed consent form in accordance with regulatory
             and institutional guidelines

          -  Histological or cytological evidence of advanced, unresectable NSCLC

          -  Patients must be PD-1/PD-L1 experienced with disease progression documented either on
             therapy with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 or within 12 weeks of the last dose. Treatment should be
             initiated at least 4 weeks since last dose of PD-1/PD-L1 targeted therapy

          -  Patients must have progressed on at least one line of prior platinum-based
             chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. Subjects with unresectable stage III NSCLC who
             received platinum-based chemotherapy as part of chemoradiation or consolidation
             chemotherapy after chemoradiation are eligible if they progress within 6 months of
             last dose of chemotherapy. Treatment should be initiated at least 4 weeks since last
             dose of systemic therapy

          -  Subjects with an actionable molecular alteration (such as EGFR mutation, ALK or ROS1
             rearrangement, BRAF V600E mutation) are eligible only after failing standard-of-care
             targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Patients with a EGFR T790M
             resistant mutation must have failed a 3rd generation TKI such as osimertinib

          -  Must not have received any prior therapy with immune regulatory molecule (such as
             targeting OX-40, IDO-1, LAG-3) or anti-CD27 monoclonal antibody (including varlilumab)

          -  Must have at least one lesion that has not previously been irradiated (and is not
             within a previously radiated field) and for which palliative radiation is potentially
             indicated. The lesion to be irradiated must be in the lung. Patient must have at least
             one additional measurable lesion (other than the lesion being radiated) as per
             immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST) criteria.
             Patient must agree to undergo a mandatory biopsy of the non-irradiated lesion
             pre-treatment and post-treatment (after cycle 2). Pre-treatment tissue obtained by
             biopsy or resection performed according to standard of care may be utilized, provided
             tissue was obtained within 8 weeks of study entry, and subsequent to the last systemic
             anticancer therapy received

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential have a negative pregnancy test at baseline.
             Females of childbearing potential are defined as sexually mature women without prior
             hysterectomy or who have had any evidence of menses in the past 12 months. However,
             women who have been amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of
             childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy,
             anti-estrogens, or ovarian suppression

               -  Women of childbearing potential (i.e., menstruating women) must have a negative
                  urine pregnancy test (positive urine tests are to be confirmed by serum test)
                  documented within 14 days of treatment initiation

               -  Sexually active women of childbearing potential enrolled in the study must agree

                  control includes (a) intrauterine device plus 1 barrier method; (b) on stable
                  doses of hormonal contraception for at least 3 months (e.g., oral, injectable,
                  implant, transdermal) plus one barrier method; (c) 2 barrier methods. Effective
                  barrier methods are male or female condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides (creams
                  or gels that contain a chemical to kill sperm); or (d) a vasectomized partner

               -  For male patients who are sexually active and who are partners of premenopausal
                  women: agreement to use 2 forms of contraception as in criterion above during the
                  treatment period and for 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug
