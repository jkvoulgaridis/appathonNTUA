  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study ROR-PH-302, ADVANCE CAPACITY, is designed to evaluate the effects of ralinepag therapy
      on exercise capacity as assessed by change in peak oxygen consumption (VO2) derived from
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) after 28 weeks of treatment
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ROR-PH-302 is a 28-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
      Subjects who meet entry criteria will be randomly allocated 2:1 to receive ralinepag or
      placebo, in addition to their PAH-specific background therapy, as applicable. The primary
      endpoint is change from Baseline in peak VO2 (assessed by CPET) at Week 28. All subjects who
      complete the study on study drug through Week 28 will have the option to receive ralinepag in
      an open-label extension (OLE) study.

    <description>SF-36 was assessed at Baseline (prior to starting study drug) and Weeks 16 and 28. The SF-36 consisted of 36 questions in 8 health categories (Vitality, Physical Functioning, Bodily Pain, General Health Perception, Role Physical, Role Emotional, Social Functioning, and Mental Health). Responses to the questions were graded on a numerical scale, with 1 as the best score and higher numbers as worse scores. The raw scores from the subscales were converted and summed by the Investigator to a total score between 0 and 100 to measure functional health and well-being from the patient's point of view. The final score range was 0 (representing the lowest possible score; worst health state) to 100 (representing the highest possible score; best health state).</description>
