  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Circulating biomarkers are promising tools for the early diagnosis of aging-associated
      pathologies. Inflammation and immunity are associated with the risk of sarcopenia and frailty
      in elderly patients. The investigators investigate the effect of an adapted physical activity
      program on the metabolism and function of circulating immune cells and miRNA in frail and
      non-frail elderly subjects. Induced immune changes are analyzed together with that of motor
      abilities and of frailty status.

      Circulating biomarkers are promising tools for early diagnosis of pathologies associated with
      aging. Inflammation and immunity are associated with the risk of sarcopenia and frailty in
      elderly patients. The investigators investigate the effect of an adapted physical activity
      program on the metabolism and function of circulating immune cells and miRNA in frail and
      non-frail elderly subjects. The main objective is to establish the link between biological
      markers of aging (immune cells phenotypes and function, miRNA) and motor capacities
      alteration/improvement. The secondary objectives are: (1) to characterize the functional and
      immunometabolic dimensions of frailty from objective indicators; (2) to propose a management
      system through adapted and individualized physical activity, based on objective indicators;
      (3) to evaluate the clinical impact of both frailty and its preventative management through
      physical activity; and (4) to identified new biomarkers of frailty. A total of 100 patients
      categorized as frail, pre-frail, and non-frail after a standardized geriatric evaluation are
      included in a comparative and interventional study. Exercise intervention consists in a
      12-weeks physical activity program. Blood sample and physical/psychological functional
      measurements are performed before and after the 12-weeks physical activity program. ANOVA
      tests and correlational analysis will be performed. The finality of the study is to improve
      the medical prescription of physical activities in elderly patients.
