      The purpose of this Phase II study is to determine the efficacy of human umbilical cord
      tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hCT-MSC) for improving social communication
      abilities in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

      The purpose of this double blinded Phase II study is to determine the efficacy of human
      umbilical cord tissue-derived mesencymal stromal cells (hCT-MSC), administered in two
      different dosing strategies, in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

      This study will be enrolling children with ASD, aging 4-8 years of age. Qualifying subjects
      will undergo neuropsychological evaluation, EEG testing, eye tracking, CVA assessments, and
      infusion of study product. Subjects will be randomized to one of two study arms; 1) a single
      infusion of 6.0x106 cells/Kg at baseline, followed by a blinded placebo infusion at six
      months or, 2) Placebo infusion at baseline, followed by an intravenous dose of 6x106 cells/Kg
      at six months.

      The primary endpoint of this study is the change in social communication skill from baseline
      to six months, as measured by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale-Thirdy Edition (VABS-3).
      The potential risks associated with infusion of MSCs include a reaction to the product (rash,
      shortness of breath, wheezing, difficulty breathing, hypotension, swelling around the mouth,
      throat or eyes, tachycardia, diaphoresis), transmission of infection, and HLA sensitization.

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a phase II, prospective, randomized, blinded, cross over, clinical trial designed to assess the efficacy of intravenous dosing of hCT-MSC for improving social communication abilities in young children with ASD. All participants will ultimately be treated with hCT-MSC. Participants randomized to arm A will each receive a single intravenous dose of 6x106 hCT-MSC per kilogram at baseline, followed by a placebo infusion at six months. Participants randomized to arm B will each receive a placebo infusion at baseline, followed by an intravenous dose of 6x106 hCT-MSC per kilogram at six months.</intervention_model_description>

             *If remote cognitive testing reveals an IQ &gt; 70 but testing at the baseline visit
             reveals an IQ &gt;65, the patient will be deemed eligible. This is due to the margin of
             error that is present with this type of testing.
