      Over the last decade, suicide rates have risen within the military and have remained high.
      Converging evidence suggests that suicide prevention efforts may be enhanced by explicitly
      including family members in treatment. The study's objectives are to test the effect of the
      CCRP, a targeted single session couples intervention on suicide ideation among military
      service members and Veterans, and to understand how the use of the CCRP impacts suicide risk
      during the 6 months immediately postdischarge from a psychiatric inpatient unit.

      Over the last decade, suicide rates have risen within the military and have remained high.
      Converging evidence suggests that suicide prevention efforts may be enhanced by explicitly
      including family members in treatment, however no couple-bases suicide-specific interventions
      exist.

      The study's objectives are to test the effect of the Couples Crisis Response Plan (CCRP), a
      targeted single-session couples intervention, on suicide ideation among military service
      members and Veterans, and to understand how the use of the CCRP impacts suicide risk during
      the period of time immediately post-discharge from a psychiatric inpatient unit. The CCRP
      will be compared to an active control condition (mental health education).

      The primary aim is to compare the effect of the CCRP to an active control condition on
      suicide ideation in the 6 months following treatment among military service members and
      Veterans who have been psychiatrically hospitalized for acute suicide risk and their
      partners. The CCRP is specifically adapted for use with partnered service members at elevated
      risk for suicide. A secondary aim is to determine how use of the CCRP skills impacts suicidal
      ideation over time and identify the role partners play in encouraging use of the plan and
      managing suicide risk.

    <description>Self-report assessment of severity of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Items 1-19 are summed (range: 0-38) and higher scores indicate greater suicide severity. Measured at baseline, hospital discharge, and 1, 3, and 6 month follow ups.</description>

    <measure>Change in number of suicide attempts from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline and 1, 3 and 6-months follow ups</time_frame>
    <description>The change in number of suicide attempts from baseline will be assessed through participants' responses to the Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview. The Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview is a structured interview assessing history of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, including suicide attempt history (dates, methods, and severity (e.g., need for medical attention) of previous suicide attempts). An increased number of suicide attempts at any assessment is considered a worse outcome.</description>
