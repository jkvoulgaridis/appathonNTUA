      The aim of this project is to promote and evaluate a smoking cessation intervention through
      the &quot;Quit to Win&quot; Contest organised in correctional institutions in Hong Kong.

      The aim of this project is to promote and evaluate a smoking cessation intervention through
      the &quot;Quit to Win&quot; Contest organised in correctional institutions in Hong Kong. The specific
      objectives of the study are:

        1. To test the effectiveness of face-to-face brief cessation advice (AWARD) and video
           education for smoking cessation among current smokers at the correctional institutions
           in Hong Kong;

        2. To evaluate the process and outcome of the recruitment of smokers through qualitative
           interviews; and

        3. To conduct qualitative interviews with quitters and non-quitters to examine their
           experience on the intervention.

    <textblock>
      Although smoking prevalence is decreasing in Hong Kong, there are still 615,000 daily
      cigarette smokers in Hong Kong in 2017 and half will be killed by smoking [5] which accounts
      for over 7,000 deaths per year. Smoking is a highly addictive behavior and it is difficult
      for smokers with strong nicotine dependence to quit without assistance. Despite the low
      smoking rate in the general population, smoking prevalence remain high in the correctional
      institutions. Incarcerated prisoners suffer disproportionately from mental illness, substance
      use disorders and disease infections. They are in need of health care such as treatment or
      prevention for smoking. There is a lack of evidence on the effectiveness of smoking cessation
      intervention in the correctional setting. More work is required to provide smoking cessation
      assistance to these high risk and underserved population.

    <description>Educational videos on smoking and health will be developed to improve the knowledge of CSD smokers. Smoking cessation counselor from the School of Nursing will conduct health talks. CSD will provide venue for viewing the video and health promotion talks. Health talks (n=4) will be provided by small group format. This health talk aims to raise their awareness on these important health topics and acquire effective cessation methods. The effectiveness of the educational videos will be evaluated by pre- and post-tests through a self-administered survey that assess the changes in knowledge related to smoking hazards, benefits of quitting, and methods to quit smoking.</description>
