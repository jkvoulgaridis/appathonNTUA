      The goal of this study is to give gather more information on how safe and well Jivi works in
      patients with severe hemophilia A. Jivi has been approved by various regulatory agencies,
      including the FDA, Health Canada, Japanese Health Authority and the European Medicinal
      Agency. 25 patients will be enrolled and will stay for 1 to 2 years in this study depending
      on their treatment frequency. Researcher will monitor during the course of the study whether
      patients are developing antibodies (a protein made by the body in response to the drug)
      affecting the effectiveness of Jivi. In addition information on bleedings and patient's
      wellbeing will be collected.

    <ipd_description>Availability of this study's data will be determined according to Bayer's commitment to the EFPIA/PhRMA &quot;Principles for responsible clinical trial data sharing&quot;. This pertains to scope, timepoint and process of data access.
As such, Bayer commits to sharing upon request from qualified researchers patient-level clinical trial data, study-level clinical trial data, and protocols from clinical trials in patients for medicines and indications approved in the US and EU as necessary for conducting legitimate research. This applies to data on new medicines and indications that have been approved by the EU and US regulatory agencies on or after January 01, 2014.
Interested researchers can use www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com to request access to anonymized patient-level data and supporting documents from clinical studies to conduct research.
