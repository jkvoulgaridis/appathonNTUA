  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective validation study of a new hip and knee replacement-specific
      questionnaire that can be used to predict postoperative complications. The purpose of this
      study is to confirm the validity of a new hip and knee scoring system to be used as a
      clinical tool to predict potential complication rates in patients undergoing total hip or
      knee replacement surgery. This scoring system aims to stratify patients into specific risk
      categories based a standardized calculated score. Patients will be evaluated on health risk
      factors and severity of disease on radiographic imaging prior to surgery, associated to
      higher complication rates following surgery. The hopeful anticipated result of this study is
      a prospective validation of the scoring system with both statistical and clinical
      significance in predicting postoperative complication rates in patients with moderate to high
      health risk,

      This stratification system may prove meaningful by allowing these patients, especially those
      classified as High-Risk, to be incorporated into more appropriate healthcare bundle payment
      systems that account for their higher financial demands. Furthermore, the stratification may
      allow for preoperative counseling and a shift towards non-operative management, or
      surgeon-patient conversations regarding the need to modify a portion of their objective risks
      prior to surgical intervention. Predictive risk models such as the one presented in the
      current study will be essential tools as the number of total hip arthroplasty procedures
      performed each year continue to increase and both the numbers of procedures and associated
      complications impose a significant cost on the U.S. healthcare system.

    <description>A Scoring System Questionnaire with risk factors associated with increased risk of complications in patients undergoing total hip and knee arthroplasty will be collected
Risk factors collected include obesity, drug allergies, presence of osteophytes, soft tissue to patella thickness, flexion contracture, diabetes, chronic opioid use, co-morbidities, prior knee surgeries, etiology of arthritis, smoking status, and reported disability. Each are measured on a scale of -5 to 10, with 10 being the best outcome. All the risk factors are added together and that comprises the total score.</description>
