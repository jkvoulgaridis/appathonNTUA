          4. Subject with alcoholic cirrhosis should have been alcohol‐abstinent for at least 6
             months judged by psychiatrist with records for each month and willing to continue up
             to the completion of study.

          5. Subject with cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV) should be with HBV DNA &lt;
             2,000 IU/mL before enrollment.

             Note: HBV = hepatitis B virus, DNA = deoxyribonucleic acid. IU = International unit

          6. Subject with cirrhosis caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV) should have successfully
             completed treatment for HCV with HCV viral load in the blood undetectable for at least
             24 weeks since treatment cessation and with ALT within normal range.

          7. Provision of signed and dated informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. With inadequate coagulation function, as defined by: INR ≥ 1.5, aPTT ≥ 54.0 seconds,
             platelet count ≤ 60,000/mm3.

             Note: INR = international normalized ratio, aPTT = activated partial thromboplastin
             time

          2. With evidence of active autoimmune disease

          3. With a medical record of solid tumor within 5 years prior to screening, or diagnosed
             with solid tumor and currently receiving cancer treatment

          4. With BMI ≤ 15 kg/m2 Note: BMI = body mass index

          5. With inadequate hepatic function, as defined by: total bilirubin level &gt; 3.0 mg/dL;
             AST &gt; 92.5 U/L, ALT &gt; 112.5 U/L; gamma-GT &gt; 212.5 U/L, or ALP &gt; 340 U/L.

             Note: gamma-GT = gamma glutamyl transpeptidase

          6. With inadequate renal function, as defined by serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL

               2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

               3. Barrier methods of contraception: condom OR occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository

          8. Female subject with childbearing potential who is pregnant (confirmed by urine or
             serum pregnancy test) or lactating

          9. Having participated other investigational study within 4 weeks of entering this study

         10. Has a known allergy to study intervention or its excipients. If there is suspicion
             that the subject may have an allergy, the subject should be excluded.

         11. With ongoing infection requiring systemic treatment such as HIV, syphilis or acute
