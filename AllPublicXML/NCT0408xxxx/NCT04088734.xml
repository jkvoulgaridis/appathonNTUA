      Open-label, clinical trial of scAAV9.U1a.hSGSH injected intravenously through a peripheral
      limb vein
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single dose clinical trial. All participants will receive 3 X 10^13
      vg/kg of ABO-102 delivered one time through a venous catheter inserted into a peripheral limb
      vein. The target population includes MPS IIIA participants with a DQ lower than 60 in middle
      and advanced phases of the disease. Similar numbers of MPS IIIA participants with age
      equivalent above and below 18 months of age will be enrolled to ensure a representation of
      middle and advanced phases of the disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of MPS IIIA confirmed by the following methods:

               1. No detectable or significantly reduced SGSH enzyme activity by leukocyte assay
                  and

               2. Genomic DNA analysis demonstrating homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations
                  in the SGSH gene

          -  Cognitive Development Quotient (DQ) lower than 60 (calculated by Bayley Scales of
             Infant and Toddler Development - Third Edition)

          -  Must be ambulatory, though may receive assistance with ambulation

          -  Age range of 2 years up to 18 years (excluded)

          -  Inability to participate in the clinical evaluation as determined by Principal
             Investigator

          -  Identification of two nonsense or null variants on genetic testing of the SGSH gene

             anesthetics

          -  Active viral infection based on clinical observations

          -  Concomitant illness or requirement for chronic drug treatment that in the opinion of

             neurodevelopmental testing

          -  Any item (braces, etc.) which would exclude the participant from being able to undergo
             MRI according to local institutional policy

          -  Any other situation that precludes the participant from undergoing procedures required
             in this study

          -  Participants with cardiomyopathy or significant congenital heart abnormalities

          -  The presence of significant non-MPS IlIA related CNS impairment or behavioral
             disturbances that would confound the scientific rigor or interpretation of results of
             the study

          -  Abnormal laboratory values Grade 2 or higher as defined in CTCAE v4.03 for GGT, total
             bilirubin (except in subjects diagnosed with Gilbert's syndrome), creatinine,
             hemoglobin, WBC count, platelet count, PT and aPTT

          -  Female participant who is pregnant or demonstrates a positive urine or beta-hCG result
             at screening assessment (if applicable)

          -  Any vaccination with viral attenuated vaccines less than 30 days prior to the
             scheduled date of treatment (and use of prednisolone)

          -  Previous treatment by Haematopoietic Stem Cell transplantation

          -  Previous participation in a gene/cell therapy or ERT clinical trial

          -  Participants who are anticipated to undergo a procedure involving anesthesia within 6
             months post- drug administration

          -  Dysphagia present at Grade 3 or higher, as defined in CTCAE v4.03
