      Aim of the study is to compare prostate artery embolization (PAE) to the established surgical
      treatment for patient acceptance, morbidity, complications, and the functional outcomes. To
      compare length of stay, hospital costs and time for recovery. 140 patients will be randomized
      to PAE or surgery. Patients should suffer from lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), be
      candidates for both treatments and willing to undergo both procedures. Before randomization
      computed tomography angiography of the pelvic arteries is done to select eligible patients.
      Magnetic resonance imaging of prostate rules out possible cancer. The PAE is done in the
      angio suite in the radiology department injecting small particles into the prostate arteries.
      The surgery is done in the operation room in the urology department according to established
      procedures. Clinical follow-up include clinical visit after 3 months, 1 and 5 years. Acute as
      well as long term complications will be recorded.

      Background: Prostatic artery embolization (PAE) has recently been described as a promising
      alternative to surgery for treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to an
      enlarged, benign prostate. The treatment has not been implemented into international
      guidelines and has only been introduced to few patients in Norway.

      Purpose: To compare PAE to the established surgical treatment for patient acceptance,
      morbidity, complications, and the functional outcomes. To compare length of stay, hospital
      costs and time for recovery.

      Materials and Methods: 140 patients will be randomized to PAE or surgery. Patients should
      suffer from LUTS, be candidates for both treatments and willing to undergo both procedures.
      Before randomization computed tomography angiography of the pelvic arteries is done to select
      eligible patients. Magnetic resonance imaging of prostate rules out possible cancer. The PAE
      is done in the angio suite in the radiology department injection small particles into the
      prostate arteries. The surgery is done in the operation room in the urology department
      according to established procedures. All patients stay in the urology unit after the
      procedure. Clinical follow-up include clinical visit after 3 months, 1 and 5 years. Acute as
      well as long term complications will be recorded. The patients fill in the form of quality of
      life from urologic disease. Urodynamic examination will record functional outcome. Length of
      stay, procedure costs and recovery time will be recorded.

      Importance of the study: Contribute to establishment of new treatment and help to select the
      right patients for the alternative treatments. Randomized study will give important
      information to the international community. It is possible to run this study in Norway
      because it is still in limited use.
