  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether dinoprostone administered 10 hours before
      office hysteroscopy can relieve pain more effectively compared with dinoprostone administered
      3 hours before office hysteroscopy.

    <description>A small envelope including two labeled plastic bags (A &amp; B) (each bag containing either 1 dinoprostone tablet(3mg) or 1 identically appearing placebo tablet) will be packaged in sequentially numbered sealed envelopes. In long interval dinoprostone group, bag (A) contains dinoprostone tablet and bag (B) contains placebo tablet. After signing the informed consent, the sequentially numbered sealed envelopes will be opened (according to the sequence of attendance of the patient) by the study nurse. Tablets in bag (A) will be inserted 12 hours before office hysteroscopy and tablets in bag (B) will be inserted 3 hours before office hysteroscopy.</description>
