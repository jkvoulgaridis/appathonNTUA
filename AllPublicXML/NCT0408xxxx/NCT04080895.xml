    <textblock>
      This is an open-label pharmacokinetic study in 16 healthy Thai subjects. To assess the safety
      and tolerability and pharmacological interactions of the combination of
      artemether-lumefantrine and amodiaquine.

      This study will enroll 16 healthy subjects both male and female, aged 18-60 years, at the
      Clinical Therapeutic Unit, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University. Subjects will be
      healthy HIV-1, hepatitis B and C uninfected individuals who comprehend the purpose of the
      study and have provided written consent. All subjects will undergo screening assessments
      (visit 1). Screening assessments (visit 1) may be carried out over more than one day,
      provided that all required assessments are completed within the 14 days prior to visit 2. If
      the interval between screening (visit 1) and day -1 visit 2 is three days or less, the
      clinical laboratory screening test result and serum pregnancy test result can be used for
      enrolment evaluation on day -1 visit 2. In such cases, these tests would not need to be
      repeated at day-1 visit 2.

      Visit 1 (Screening visit): All laboratory assessments (chemistry, hematology, FBS and
      urinalysis) must be drawn in the fasting state (8 hours fast) including serum pregnancy
      testing (if appropriate)

      Visit 2-4: 16 healthy subjects who fulfill the eligibility criteria will be recruited and
      randomized to the study. All laboratory assessments (chemistry, hematology, FBS and
      urinalysis) must be drawn in the fasting state (8 hours fast). Results of these tests are to
      be available and reviewed prior to each subject receiving the study drug on day 0.

             from sexual intercourse with females of childbearing potential or lactating females;
             or is willing to use a condom/spermicide, during the study until completion of the

             until the completion of the follow-up procedure, unless in the opinion of
             investigator, the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or

             representative as necessary.

          8. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received a drug or a new
             chemical entity within 30 days or 5 x half-life, or twice the duration of the

         11. Subjects who have a history of allergy to the study drug or drugs of this class, or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             contraindicates participation in the trial. In addition, if heparin is used during
             pharmacokinetic sampling, subjects with a history of sensitivity to heparin or
             heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should not be enrolled.

         12. Lack of suitability for participation in this study, including but not limited to,
             unstable medical conditions, systemic disease manifested by tendency to
             granulocytopenia e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus that in the opinion
             of the investigator would compromise their participation in the trial.

         13. AST or ALT &gt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)

         14. Subjects with history of renal disease, hepatic disease, and/or cholecystectomy

         15. Abnormal methemoglobin level (more than 3 mg/dL).

         16. History of antimalarial drugs use including but not limited to mefloquine,
             chloroquine, primaquine, artesunate, piperaquine and pyronaridine treatment within 6
             months.
