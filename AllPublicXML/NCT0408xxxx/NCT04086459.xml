  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heroin addiction is a serious problem and the relapse rate of existing treatment methods is
      extremely high. Recently, international journals such as Science reported that repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can reduce the craving of addicts, alleviate
      depression and anxiety symptoms, and is expected to become an effective treatment. Our
      preliminary experiment using rTMS to stimulate the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of
      heroin addicts also showed similar effects, however, the mechanism is unclear. Previously,
      the investigators found that the functional connectivity between left executive control
      network and default mode network was negatively correlated relapse behavior, while the
      functional connectivity between salience network and default mode network was positively
      correlated with relapse behavior. Studies have shown that dopamine dysfunction in addicts and
      brain metabolism is the biological basis of network connectivity. It suggests that
      elucidating the relationship between the characteristics of large brain network connectivity
      and the level of dopamine receptor and relapse behavior in addicts is hopeful to further
      understand the neurological mechanism of rTMS treatment for addiction. In this project, the
      investigators intend to observe the changes of brain network connectivity, glucose metabolism
      and dopamine D2 receptor before and after rTMS treatment in addicts from the perspective of
      large brain network by combining PET/MRI with psychobehavioral approach. The relationship
      between rTMS and relapse behavior will be deeply analyzed to provide scientific basis for the
      development of effective treatment programs.
