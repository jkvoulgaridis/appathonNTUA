  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized controlled pilot to assess the feasibility and
      acceptability of an 8-session intervention (STRONGer Together) for children between 8 - 12
      years of age with asthma and anxiety/depressive symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is one of the leading chronic conditions in children and affects 6.1 million children
      in the United States. 5,15,16 It is one of the most common causes of school absenteeism and
      is a major public health issue, accounting for over $56 billion dollars annually in
      healthcare costs. 16 Children with asthma have increased odds ~ 3.13 of having co-morbid
      anxiety/depression, a lower quality of life, and higher morbidity and mortality rates.
      4,17-21 In recent years, the economic burden of asthma 22 and the level of impairment due to
      mental health concerns have increased for children and adolescents. 23 A study by Secinti,
      Thompson, Richards, and Gaysina (2017) highlights the association between childhood chronic
      physical conditions and adult emotional health, further emphasizing the critical need to
      address physical health as well as the emotional and mental health of children with asthma.
      24 More distally, asthma, anxiety, and depression cause inflammation. 25 Left unaddressed,
      adults with asthma and comorbid anxiety/depression may be at higher risk of cardiovascular
      disease. 25,26 Compounding potential health related complications of asthma and comorbid
      anxiety/depressive symptoms is the disproportionate effect of asthma for children from ethnic
      and racial minority populations 4,19 or from socioeconomically disadvantaged settings. 19
      Further, underserved populations are less likely to receive appropriate medical or mental
      health care for a variety of reasons such as transportation, neighborhood factors, a
      caregiver's inability to pay for needed medications or treatment, and healthcare provider
      bias. 20 Cost-related barriers were found to be most indicative of uncontrolled asthma in a
      recent study. 27 Clinicians, policy makers, and researchers must be responsive and provide
      interventions to ameliorate detrimental outcomes. Prior studies indicate that not only are
      children with asthma and anxiety/depression less likely to adhere to treatment guidelines,
      they are prone to misinterpretation of their symptoms leading to overuse of their
      quick-relief inhaler. 20 Symptoms of anxiety and asthma are often confused and psychological
      factors can be a trigger for an asthma attack. 25 Improvement in symptom interpretation,
      asthma self-efficacy, and asthma illness beliefs has been associated with better asthma
      control. 28 Children using skills to take care of their asthma, or asthma self-management, is
      a dynamic process. Self-efficacy contributes to one's to self-management behaviors. 29 While
      many factors contribute to managing one's asthma, the skills can be easily learned. However,
      children with asthma are frequently expected to manage their medications at a very young age
      and may not have the knowledge or skills yet to understand what actions to take and when. For
      example, a study by Orrell-Valente, Jarlsberg, Hill, and Cabana (2008) found that 20% of
      children aged 7 years were responsible for managing their asthma medications, and by age 11
      years, 50% of children are left to manage their asthma medications without caregiver
      assistance. 30 Bellin and colleagues (2017) interviewed children as young as six years of age
      that self-administered their medication. 31 Because of this, educating children about asthma
      is imperative so they can more accurately interpret their symptoms and treat themselves for
      optimal health, particularly since it is a lifelong condition. The proposed pilot RCT will
      determine the feasibility and acceptability of an 8-session educational and skills-building
      intervention in YMCA after-school programs in Orange, Chatham, and Durham counties in North
      Carolina.

    <measure>Asthma Management Self-Efficacy - Child</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to post-intervention (8-weeks) and at 16 weeks post-intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The Child Asthma Self-Efficacy (CASE) scale (14 items) measures children's perception of their own ability to manage asthma (e.g., &quot;...can tell when a serious breathing problem can be controlled at home&quot;) and assesses asthma symptoms, health status, and impact of the child's illness on the family (Bursch, Schwankovsky, Gilbert, &amp; Zeiger, 1999). Answers are scored 1 - 5; higher scores indicate greater self-efficacy.</description>

    <measure>Anxiety Measure (Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders [SCARED]) - Child</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 8 weeks (immediately post-intervention) and 16 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The SCARED measure assesses five factors including panic/somatic, general anxiety disorder, separation anxiety, social phobia, and school phobia; it has been validated with children and adolescents ages 8 - 19 years (Beidas et al., 2015; Hale, Crocetti, Raaijmakers, &amp; Meeus, 2011; Birmaher et al., 1999). Items are scored from 0 (not true or hardly ever true) to 2 (very true or often true; Birmaher et al., 1999). Higher scores indicate greater anxiety with a total score of 25 as having a potential anxiety disorder and 30 as more specific.</description>

    <measure>Depression Measure (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS]- Child Depression Short Form)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 8 weeks (immediately post-intervention) and 16 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Child Depression Short Form Assesses negative mood (e.g., sadness), decrease in positive affect (e.g., loss of interest), negative views of self (e.g., worthlessness), and negative social cognition (e.g., loneliness, interpersonal alienation; Assessment Center, n.d.). Items are scored from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). Higher scores indicate greater depressive symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma Illness Representations - Child Version (AIRS-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 8 weeks (immediately post-intervention) and 16 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The AIRS-C is a 17-item measure designed to identify barriers to and risk factors for under-utilization of controller medications. Higher scores indicate closer alignment with the professional model of asthma management.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAQLQ) - Child</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 8 weeks (immediately post-intervention) and 16 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The PAQLQ 14-item Likert-type scale is validated for children between ages 7 - 17 years (Juniper, Guyatt, Ferrie, &amp; Griffith, 1993) and measures the functional problems (symptoms, activity limitations, emotional function) that are troublesome to children with asthma (Juniper et al., 1993). Items are scored from 1 (extremely bothered) to 7 (not bothered at all) and the total score is the mean of items. Higher scores denote better QoL.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak Flow - Child</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 8 weeks (immediately post-intervention) and 16 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The child participants will be asked to complete peak flow assessments (blowing into the meter) during the study to evaluate lung function. A higher number indicates better lung function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pediatric Symptom Checklist - completed by the Parent/Caregiver</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 8 weeks (immediately post-intervention) and 16 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The PSC includes 17 Likert type questions to assess internalizing, attention, and externalizing problems (Murphy et al., 2016). Items are scored from 0 (never) to 2 (often; α = .89). Examples of questions include &quot;My child feels sad, unhappy&quot; and &quot;Daydreams too much.&quot; Higher scores indicate more symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma Control Test - Combined Child and Parent/Caregiver</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 8 weeks (immediately post-intervention) and 16 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The C-ACT consists of questions for children (ages 4-11 years; 4 items) and parents (3 items) and the ACT (for individuals 12 years and older) has similar questions which are self-administered. This instrument assesses interference with activities, asthma symptoms, and nighttime awakenings. The C-ACT (α = .79; Lui et al., 2007; Lui et al., 2010) classifies children as very poorly controlled, not well-controlled, or well controlled.</description>
