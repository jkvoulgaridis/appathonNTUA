  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves two parts: a randomised controlled trial, and a nested qualitative study.

      The main aim of the trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of a pharmacist-led,
      medications-focused patient counselling on reducing the frequency of hypoglycaemia in older
      adults diagnosed with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus within 12 weeks in Jordan.

      The study hypothesis is that individualised patient counselling which is provided by
      pharmacists and involves recommendations about anti-diabetic medications will reduce the risk
      of hypoglycaemia by preventing further episodes in the elderly Jordanians with type 2
      Diabetes Mellitus.

      The qualitative study aims at evaluating the experience of participants in both groups with
      the study (process evaluation). This involves exploring which components are effective and
      which are not with the reasons, the contextual factors affecting the delivery and
      implementation of the study and the intervention, and how the study and the intervention can
      be scaled up in the future.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypoglycaemia is the most serious adverse effect of diabetes treatment. Older adults are at
      the highest risk to develop hypoglycaemia. Several studies have established the important
      positive role of educational interventions on achieving glycaemic control and other clinical
      outcomes, however, there is still a lack in clinical trials that evaluate the impact of such
      type of interventions on hypoglycaemia risk, especially in older adults. Despite the
      increasing prevalence of chronic diseases such as diabetes in Jordan, pharmacists still
      provide traditional services rather than patient-centred services.

      The purpose of this research is to investigate the effect of pharmacist-led, individualised,
      and medications-focused patient counselling on reducing episodes of hypoglycaemia compared to
      the usual care in older Jordanians with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus within 12 weeks.

      This research is a prospective, open-label, randomised controlled trial that is conducted in
      the outpatient endocrinology and cardiology clinics at King Abdullah University Hospital in
      Jordan, with 204 elderly patients who had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Participants
      will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio into either the intervention (SUGAR Handshake) or the usual
      care groups. Each participant in the SUGAR Handshake group will receive a face-to-face
      individualised educational session with a pharmacist at the inclusion visit, a pictogram
      containing the main educational information, and a reinforcement of the educational session
      through a phone call at week 6 of the inclusion visit. They will also receive the usual care
      provided by the health care professionals at the outpatient clinics. On the other hand,
      patients in the usual care group will only receive the routine care provided at the
      outpatient clinics. The duration of the trial for each participant is 12 weeks.

      The qualitative study is performed through phone interviews with 8-12 participants of each
      group at week 6 of the inclusion visit. Participants are to be approached according to
      convenience sampling and the data will be analysed using content analysis.

    <description>The frequency of hypoglycemia will be calculated as the number of total hypoglycemic episodes/person/ 12 weeks. Total hypoglycemia is defined as the summation of severe, symptomatic, and asymptomatic episodes of hypoglycaemia.</description>

    <description>The frequency of severe hypoglycemia will be calculated as the number of severe hypoglycemic episodes/person/ 12 weeks. Severe hypoglycemia is defined as any event requiring the assistance of another person to administer carbohydrate and glucagon or take any other corrective actions, accompanied by neurological recovery after the corrective actions.
Participants will be provided with diaries to document severe episodes of hypoglycemia</description>

    <description>The frequency of asymptomatic hypoglycemia will be calculated as the number of asymptomatic hypoglycaemia episodes/person/ 12 weeks. asymptomatic hypoglycaemia is defined as an event not accompanied by typical symptoms of hypoglycemia but with a measured plasma glucose concentration ≤70 mg/dL (≤3.9 mmol/L).
Participants will be provided with diaries to document fasting blood glucose levels by which asymptomatic episodes will be diagnosed.</description>

    <description>The frequency of symptomatic hypoglycemia will be calculated as the number of symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes/person/ 12 weeks. Symptomatic hypoglycemia is defined as an event during which the patient experiences typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia (sweating, dizziness, light-headedness, tremor, hunger, headache) whether they are accompanied by a measured plasma glucose concentration ≤70 mg/dL (≤3.9 mmol/L) or not.

    <description>Participants assigned to the intervention group will receive an individualised, pharmacist-led patient counselling session (SUGAR Handshake package) at the inclusion visit.
Participants will also receive a pictogram with the main instructions for easy recall of the counselling contents.
They will also receive a glucometer and test strips with a demonstration on proper use, to measure their fasting blood glucose levels on a daily basis for 12 weeks.
At week 6, participants will receive a phone call to reinforce the intervention and to remind them of the study protocol. For the qualitative evaluation of the intervention, a number of participants are interviewed and asked questions through the sixth week-phone call.
Additionally, participants in this group will be provided with the usual care that is normally provided in the outpatient clinics at King Abdullah University Hospital.</description>

    <intervention_name>SUGAR Handshake</intervention_name>
    <description>An interactive patient counselling session delivered by a pharmacist which mainly focuses on medication-related instructions towards preventing hypoglycaemia in addition to recommendations about hypoglycemia early recognition, causes, and treatment. The SUGAR Handshake is individualised according to shared decision making and each participant's characteristics.
Components of the SUGAR Handshake intervention will be covered under five main domains:
Signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.
Understanding the underlying causes of hypoglycaemia such as misuse of anti-diabetic medications.
Good glycaemic control and self-monitoring, which mainly includes instructions on handling the anti-diabetic medications.
Acknowledgement by the patient
Recap and summary
