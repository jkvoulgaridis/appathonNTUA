  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel, game-based rehabilitation system,
      consisting a sensor-equipped knee sleeve and a mobile application, on rehabilitation outcomes
      after Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) surgery, when compared to conventional rehabilitation;
      where patients learn and perform rehabilitative exercises using printed brochures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial investigating the effectiveness of a novel, game-based
      rehabilitation system, consisting a sensor-equipped knee sleeve and a mobile application, on
      rehabilitation outcomes after Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA).

      All patients receiving TKA will be screened for eligibility. Patients who meet inclusion
      criteria and provide informed consent will be allocated to either intervention or control
      group using block randomization. A study team member blinded to subject characteristics will
      allocate subjects to either group.

      Subjects in the intervention group will be guided to do their post-TKA rehabilitation
      exercises using the investigator's game-based system, which includes the wearable sensor
      device and mobile application games. Subjects in the control group will be guided to do their
      post-TKA rehabilitation exercises using conventional, paper-based exercise brochures.

      From post-operative day 1, all subjects who are medically fit for physiotherapy will receive
      2 sessions of physiotherapy, daily; for at least the first 3 post-operative days. The first
      session consists of individualized physiotherapy that includes bed exercises and ambulation
      training. In the second session of physiotherapy, subjects will perform their bed exercises
      using the game-based system or paper-based exercise brochures. Upon discharge, subjects in
      the intervention group will continue home-based rehabilitation exercises using the game-based
      system, while those in the control group continue to use the exercise brochures.

    <description>Participants will use a mobile application paired to a knee sleeve with embedded inclinometer sensors. The sensor system will compute knee movement, and feed towards game-based rehabilitation exercises for Total Knee Arthroplasty rehabilitation. game-based and supported on mobile device running on Android or Inter-network Operating System platforms. The mobile apps is able to capture the angle and position data from the two inclinometers on smart knee sleeve.</description>
