  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate the effects of Virtual Reality (VR) as a
      treatment intervention to increase physical and cognitive function in stroke survivors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study, the objective is to determine if there is an increase in MoCA (Montreal
      Cognitive Assessment), MFRT (Modified Functional Reach Test), and FMA-UA (Fugl-Meyer
      Assessment Upper Extremity) scores of participants who receive the VR intervention in
      addition to traditional inpatient rehabilitation standard of care (experimental group) versus
      participants who receive the traditional standard of care (control group).

Measurements are the maximum distance the patient can reach forward while sitting in a fixed position. A score of 6 or less indicates a significant increased risk of falls.
