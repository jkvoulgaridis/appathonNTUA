    <measure>VAS(Visual Analog Scale score) for soreness or pain</measure>
    <time_frame>2weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will record their level of knee pain by drawing a vertical mark between the ends of a 10-cm horizontal line. The 0-cm end and the 10-cm end represented no pain and the most extreme pain, respectively. The distance from the 0-cm end to the drawn mark was recorded to the first decimal place.</description>

    <measure>FI (Fatugue Index)</measure>
    <time_frame>2weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A system called &quot;Just Jump&quot; by Probotics* will be used to induce DOMS. The goal of the jump is to create fatigue of the lower extremities which is a byproduct of decreased power. It will also create exercise induces DOMS. Using this system the next day will test the fatigue and power of the lower extremities to see if it has changed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>sleep quality measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>2weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Each subject will be provided with Sleep measurment device. The device captures sleep data via a sensor to monitor breathing, body movemement along with ambient light and temperature in the bedroom. The device is composed of six sleep parameters that combine to reflect the overall quality of sleep. It has objective sleep data, SleepScore (Objective Sleep Quality), MindScore (Objective REM Sleep Quality), BodyScore (Objective Deep Sleep Quality), Total Record Time, Time in Bed, Total Sleep Time, REM Sleep Time, Light Sleep Time, Deep Sleep time, Onset Time, WASO, Total Wake Time, Interruptions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>POMS (Profile of Mood States)</measure>
    <time_frame>2weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It will be used for mental alertness. It is short form containing 24 items and four scales. Used in sports science (along with other areas) to evaluate and access mood after exercise or a sporting event concerned the certain scales containing &quot;vigour&quot; and &quot;fatigue&quot;.</description>
