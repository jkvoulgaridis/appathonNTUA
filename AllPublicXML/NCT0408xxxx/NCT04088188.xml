      This trial studies the side effects and best dose of gemcitabine and cisplatin when given
      together with ivosidenib or pemigatinib in treating patients with cholangiocarcinoma that
      cannot be removed with surgery (unresectable) or has spread to other places in the body
      (metastatic). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and cisplatin, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Ivosidenib and pemigatinib may stop
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving
      gemcitabine and cisplatin with ivosidenib or pemigatinib may work better in treating patients
      with cholangiocarcinoma compared to gemcitabine and cisplatin alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended
      phase 2 dose, gemcitabine and cisplatin in combination with either ivosidenib or pemigatinib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate median and progression free survival (PFS) for 6 months per investigator
      assessment.

      II. To evaluate the rate of overall survival (OS) in patients treated with gemcitabine and
      cisplatin in combination with either ivosidenib or pemigatinib.

      III. To describe the overall toxicity and adverse events profile associated with gemcitabine
      and cisplatin in combination with either ivosidenib or pemigatinib.

      IV. To determine the best response profile per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) 1.1 criteria in patients treated with gemcitabine and cisplatin in combination with
      either ivosidenib or pemigatinib.

      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVE:

      I. To measure plasma 2-hydroxglutarate (2-HG) levels at baseline and after multiple doses of
      ivosidenib study.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose de-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A (IDH1 MUTATION): Patients receive ivosidenib orally (PO) on days 1-21, cisplatin
      intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 8, and gemcitabine IV on days 1 and 8. Cycles repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B (FGFR/FGF MUTATION): Patients receive pemigatinib PO on days 1-21, cisplatin IV on days
      1 and 8, and gemcitabine IV on days 1 and 8. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6
      months for up to 3 years.

    <measure>Incidence of significant toxicities</measure>
    <time_frame>At 27 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A significant toxicity is defined as a dose limiting toxicity that is possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment (ivosidenib or pemigatinib in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine). Toxicities will be assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of study therapy to death due to any cause, assessed up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is defined as the length of time from start of study therapy to death due to any cause. The distribution of overall survival for both arms of the study will be estimated separately using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of study therapy to documentation of disease progression, assessed up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival time is defined as the time from the start of study therapy to documentation of disease progression. Patients who die without documentation of progression will be considered to have had tumor progression at the time of death. Patients who are still alive and have not progressed will be censored for progression at the time of the last disease evaluation. The time-to-progression distribution will be estimated separately for both arms, using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The number and severity of all adverse events (overall, by dose-level, and by tumor group) will be tabulated and summarized in this patient population. The grade 3+ adverse events will also be described and summarized in a similar fashion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of toxicities</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The term toxicity is defined as adverse events that are classified as either possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment. Non-hematologic toxicities will be evaluated via the ordinal Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) standard toxicity grading. Hematologic toxicity measures of thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and leukopenia will be assessed using continuous variables as the outcome measures (primarily nadir) as well as categorization via CTC standard toxicity grading. Overall toxicity incidence as well as toxicity profiles by dose level, patient and tumor site will be explored and summarized. Frequency distributions, graphical techniques and other descriptive measures will form the basis of these analyses.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Best response</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence, assessed up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Best Response is defined to be the best objective status recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient?s best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 criteria will be used for tumor evaluation and patients will be re-evaluated every prior to treatment in cycle 3 and then in odd subsequent cycles. Responses will be summarized by simple descriptive summary statistics delineating complete and partial responses as well as stable and progressive disease in this patient population (overall and by tumor group).</description>

          -  Have a heart-rate corrected QT interval (using Fridericia?s formula) (QTcF) &gt;= 450
             msec or other factors that increase the risk of QT prolongation or arrhythmic events
             (e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of long QT interval syndrome)

               -  Note: Bundle branch block and prolonged QTcF interval are permitted with approval
                  of the medical monitor

          -  Taking medications that are known to prolong the QT interval, unless they can be
             transferred to other medications &gt;= 5 half-lives prior to registration or unless the
             medications can be properly monitored during the study

               -  Note: If equivalent medication is not available, QTcF should be closely monitored

          -  Known active hepatitis B (hepatitis B virus [HBV]) or hepatitis C (hepatitis C virus
             [HCV]) infections, known positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody results,

               -  Note: Subjects with a sustained viral response to HCV or immunity to prior HBV
                  infection will be permitted. Subjects with chronic HBV that is adequately
                  suppressed per institutional practice will be permitted

               -  NOTE: HBV, HCV, and/or HIV testing is not required prior to trial registration

          -  Any other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, including recent (=&lt; 12
             months of registration) or active suicidal ideation or behavior, or a laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this study

          -  Inability or unwillingness to swallow ivosidenib or pemigatinib or have significant
             gastrointestinal (GI) disorder(s) that could interfere with absorption, metabolism, or
             excretion

               -  Note: Gastroesophageal reflux disease under medical treatment is allowed
                  (assuming no drug interaction potential)
