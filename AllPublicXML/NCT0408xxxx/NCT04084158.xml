      This was a randomized, open label and multi-center phase II clinical study, which aimed to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of Triprizumab (JS001) injection induction immunotherapy,
      plus concurrent chemoradiation, and successive Triprizumab (JS001) injection maintenance
      immunotherapy relative to those of standardized concurrent chemoradiation for locally
      advanced esophageal squamous carcinoma patients that could not receive surgical treatment or
      refuse surgery. All patients conforming to the inclusion and exclusion criteria were assigned
      as the experimental arm and control arm at the ratio of 1:1 through the stratified block
      randomization method. Prior to concurrent chemoradiation, the experimental arm was given
      anti-PD-1 antibody Triprizumab (JS001) for 2 cycles, concurrent chemoradiation was initiated
      within 4 weeks after the induction immunotherapy, then patients were evaluated within 4 weeks
      after the completion of concurrent chemoradiation. Those who had not achieved PD were given 2
      cycles of consolidation chemotherapy, and Triprizumab (JS001) was continued to at most 1 year
      or to identified disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or the subjects asked to withdraw
      initiatively, or researchers judged that the subjects should withdraw from the study. The
      control arm was given concurrent chemoradiation alone, with sequential consolidation
      chemotherapy for 2 cycles. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS), Secondary
      end points include objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), duration of response
      (DoR), time to distant metastasis (TTDM).
