  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an observational study. Investigate the relationship of oxgenation and lung
      regional ventilation and perfusion assessed by the indicator based-EIT method in the
      critically ill patients in ICU

      1. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients or next of kin before data were
           included in the study.

        2. When the research team was available, adult patients within 1w, who were sequentially
           admitted to the Department of Critical Care Medicine and required central venous
           catheters for resuscitation were eligible for the study.

        3. Information collected at enrollment included demographic characteristics such as age,
           sex, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (APCHEII); . The global
           hemodynamic, respiration condition and PaO2 were measured. At the same time, the lung
           regional ventilation and perfusion assessed by the indicator based-EIT method(injection
           10%NaCL).

        4. The 10%NaCL was injected by the central venous catheter.
