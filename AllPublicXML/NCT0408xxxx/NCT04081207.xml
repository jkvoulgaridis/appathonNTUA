  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The currently available interventions only partially restore language abilities in patients
      with post-stroke aphasia; preventing successful reintegration into society. This study will
      increase our knowledge of how we can use assistive technology interventions to help people
      with aphasia restore language function. Further, this project will help us identify regions
      of the brain responsible for these changes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In aphasia rehabilitation, usual care is focused on helping people recuperate as much of
      their pre-stroke language capacity as possible.Typically, usual care is a non-standardized
      therapy that is tailored to the specific needs of the person with aphasia.Once a person
      reaches a plateau in language recovery, AAC is implemented with a focus on circumventing, or
      compensating for the communication challenges associated with aphasia.

      The ability of people with aphasia to (1) recover language function well-into the chronic
      phase of stroke recovery and (2) self-cue to promote word retrieval during anomic events
      offer the solution for how AAC could be employed as a dual-purpose tool to augment language
      recovery and compensate for deficits. This approach, however, this requires a shift in how
      AAC is implemented. With the goal of language recovery, treatment needs to focus on
      instructing people with aphasia how to use AAC as a mechanism for self-cueing, rather than as
      a tool to replace speaking. Based on our pilot data, we hypothesize that this novel method to
      AAC implementation will promote language recovery by coupling the canonical language and
      visual processing neural networks.

      This work will also contribute to our ability to identify, a priori, who will respond to this
      particular AAC intervention and who will not, by combining neuroimaging with behavioral and
      clinical data. This has the potential to reduce the cost of healthcare for stroke recovery by
      implementing the most effective treatment possible. Importantly, when we identify
      non-responders, this will allow us to construct a profile and identify features of the AAC
      treatment that require adjustment to meet their unique needs.

This design will allow Group 2 to serve as the control group; however, they will still receive AAC treatment; thus, allowing us to increase the total N who receives AAC treatment to 20 people.</intervention_model_description>

    <ipd_description>Even though the final dataset will be stripped of identifiers prior to release for sharing, we believe that there remains the possibility of deductive disclosure of subjects based on their private health information and language profiles. Further, it is possible to reconstruct faces from MRI data and the patients are easily identified through the testing and treatment videos; thus, we will make the data and associated documentation available to users only under a data-sharing agreement that provides for: (1) a commitment to using the data only for research purposes and not to identify any individual participant; (2) a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology; and (3) a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed. Data will be shared at the time of publication, or shortly thereafter.</ipd_description>
