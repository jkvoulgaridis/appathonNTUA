  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      30 healthy adults and 30 patients with major depressive disorder, will take part in three
      single-application pharmacological interventions (GHB vs. Trazodone vs. placebo p.o.) to test
      potential effects of these drugs on nocturnal memory consolidation. All participants will be
      assessed with mood state questionnaires, tests of emotional, procedural and declarative
      memory consolidation, polysomnography, EEG and neuroinflammatory biomarkers. At experimental
      nights, learning tasks are performed prior to sleep. The next morning, recalling tasks are
      performed. Each subject will pass through 5 study nights (1 screening, 1 adaptation and 3
      experimental nights).
