    <textblock>
      The final goal of the present study is to propose a new approach and an innovative
      therapeutic plan in the post-stroke rehabilitation of elderly patients, focused on the use of
      robotic device, in order to obtain the beneficial effects of this treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a leading cause of disability, injury, and death in elderly people and represents a
      major public health problem with substantial medical and economic consequences. The incidence
      of stroke rapidly increases with age, doubling for each decade after age 55 years. Gait
      impairment is one of the most important problems after stroke and improve walking function is
      often a key component of any rehabilitation program. To achieve this goal, robotic gait
      trainer seems to be promising. In fact, some studies underline the efficacy of robotic gait
      training based on end-effector technology, for different diseases, in particular in stroke
      patients. In this randomized controlled trial, we verify the efficacy of the robotic
      treatment in terms of improving the gait and reducing the risk of falling and its long-term
      effects.

      In this single blind randomized controlled trial the investigators will include 150 elderly
      subacute stroke patients divided in two groups to receive a traditional rehabilitation
      program or a robotic rehabilitation using G-EO system, an end-effector device for the gait
      rehabilitation, in addition to the traditional therapy. A 20 treatment sessions will be
      conducted, divided into 3 training sessions per week, for 7 weeks. The control group will
      perform traditional therapy sessions lasting 50 minutes. The technological intervention
      group, using G-EO system, will carry out 30 minutes of traditional therapy and 20 minutes of
      treatment with a robotic system. The primary outcome of the study is the evaluation of the
      falling risk. Secondary outcomes are the assessment of the gait improvements and the fear of
      falling. Further evaluations, such as length and asymmetry of the step, walking and
      functional status, acceptance of the technology, will be carried.

    <description>falling risk will be evaluated by the Tinetti performance oriented mobility assessment (POMA). Balance section of Tinetti Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment (Tinetti Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment has two subscales, Balance and Gait section.) Balance section has 9 items. Each item can be scored in a 3 point ordinal scale (0-2). &quot;0&quot; indicates the lowest level of function and &quot;2&quot; the highest level of function. Total Score = 16. Total score is obtained by adding the individual scores.</description>

    <description>Quality of life will be measured using the Hausa SF-12 Health Survey (SF-12-H). The questionnaire consists of 12 items questioned weighted and summed to provide physical and mental health scores (PCS and MCS). The two composite scores are computed using the scores on twelve questions that range from 0 to 100, with higher score indicating better health</description>
