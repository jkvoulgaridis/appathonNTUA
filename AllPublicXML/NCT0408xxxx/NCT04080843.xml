      This is an Open, Single Arm, Exploratory and Phase II Clinical Trial of Anlotinib
      Hydrochloride Capsules Combined With CAPEOX in RAS and BRAF wild-type patients with
      Metastatic Colorectal Carcinoma(CRC) as 1st Therapy. After 6 cycles of combined therapy,
      patients will receive capecitabine and anlotinib as maintenance therapy until tumor
      progression.In order to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of Anlotinib
      Hydrochloride Capsules combined with CAPEOX in treatment of patients with mCRC. The patients
      who are pathologically confirmed as RAS and BRAF wild-type mCRC will be enrolled.

      Metastatic Colorectal Carcinoma(CRC) as 1st Therapy. After 6 cycles of combined therapy,

      progression.In order to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of Anlotinib
      Hydrochloride Capsules combined with CAPEOX in treatment of patients with Metastatic
      Colorectal Carcinoma(mCRC).Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Objective Response Rate (ORR),
      Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: Progression free survival (PFS) (According to RECIST Version
      1.1), Disease Control Rate (DCR) and duration of response(DoR). Safety and tolerance will be
      evaluated by incidence, severity and outcomes of AEs and categorized by severity in
      accordance with the NCI CTC AE Version 4.0.
