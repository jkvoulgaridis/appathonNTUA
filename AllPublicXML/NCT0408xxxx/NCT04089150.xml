  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicentre randomised, phase II clinical trial to evaluate safety and
      activity of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in addition to chemotherapy in patients
      with high-risk and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC) and locally advanced
      pancreatic cancer (LAPC). High risk defined as any patient with tumour &gt;4cm, extrapancreatic
      extension or node positive disease.
