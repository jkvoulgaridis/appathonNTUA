  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Use of ePROs in oncological care have resulted in improvement of QoL, decreased ER visits,
      and improvement of overall survival. Furthermore, ePRO follow-up resulted in better QoL,
      improved ECOG status and more active cancer treatments at disease relapse, and improved
      survival among cancer survivals. The current study investigates electronic patient reported
      outcome tool in the follow-up of cancer patients receiving chemotherapies or targeted
      therapies.

      The aims of the current study are: 1) The number of alerts triggered by Kaiku Cancer medical
      treatment side-effects questionnaire and their correlation to treatment side-effects, other
      relevant medical events, tumor progression, and survival 2) Changes in Kaiku QLQ-C30 QoL
      questionnaire and their correlation to cancer treatment response, side-effects, other
      relevant medical event or survival 3) Patient compliance to Kaiku ePRO surveillance during
      treatment period according to response rates of Patient experience survey, Kaiku Cancer
      medical treatment side-effects questionnaire and Kaiku QLQ-C30 QoL questionnaire

      In addition, in the CRC (colorectal cancer) cohort:

        1. Integration of laboratory values to patient reported symptoms when prescribing a new
           chemotherapy cycle

        2. Number of phone calls related to prescribing a new chemotherapy cycle

        3. Unscheduled doctor appointments in oncology unit

        4. ER visits

        5. Days in hospitalization

        6. Unscheduled investigations in health care

        7. Development of peripheral neurotoxicity

        8. The number of chemotherapy dose reductions

        9. The number of chemotherapy delays

       10. Health care user experience survey

    <description>The correlation of the Summary score of QLQ-C30 to treatment side-effects, cancer progression, or other medical events or survival.
The Core Quality of life questionnaire (QLQ-C30) is a validated cancer health-related quality-of-life questionnaire that includes five function domains (physical, emotional, social, role, cognitive), eight symptoms (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, insomnia, dyspnea, and appetite loss), as well as global health/quality of life and financial impact. Subjects respond on a four-point-scale from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very much&quot; for most items. Raw scores are linearly converted to a 0-100 scale. For the functioning scales and global QoL higher scores indicate better functioning; for the symptom scales higher scores indicate higher symptom burden. The summary score of QLQ-C30 is calculated from the mean of 13 of 15 QLQ-C30 scales (the Global Quality of Life scale and the Financial Impact scale are not included).</description>
