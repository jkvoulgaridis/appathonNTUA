  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) is a congenital heart defect with four major features including
      right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. About 25 children are born with this condition
      in Denmark every year. Corrective surgery is usually performed within the first year. In 50 %
      of patients, enlargement with a patch is necessary to achieve relief of the outflow tract
      obstruction. This however results in severe pulmonary regurgitation, which eventually leads
      to volume overload, right ventricular dysfunction and arrhythmia. To avoid these late
      complications, pulmonary valve replacement with a prosthesis if performed when patients meet
      the current guideline criteria. Most patients meet the guideline criteria for revalving when
      they are between 20 and 30 years of age. The current guidelines however, are based solely on
      retrospective studies and novel research reveals that in more than 50 % of patients who are
      treated according to current practice, right ventricular volumes and function as well as
      exercise capacity and burden of arrhythmia do not normalize or improve. 500 patients with ToF
      will be enrolled in a multicentre, cross-sectional study, which will yield information about
      the long-term outcomes after initial repair of ToF, as well as suggestions about the optimal
      timing for re-valving. Among patients included in the cross-sectional study, 120 patients
      with free pulmonary regurgitation, will be randomized evenly for early or later re-valving
      with at least 10-years of follow-up, for evaluation of long-term efficacy and safety of early
      re-valving.
