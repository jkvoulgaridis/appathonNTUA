  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to compare the measurement of vital signs (blood
      pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, blood oxygen levels and body temperature) measured by
      the non-invasive, continuous and wireless BiPS monitoring device with vital signs measured by
      current standard of care hospital equipment (blood pressure measurements will be obtained
      from arterial line) an invasive arterial line. The study will be conducted in two medical
      centers in Israel and include 50 adult patients that are connected to an arterial line as
      part of their routine care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BiPS Medical has developed a wearable, wireless device that conveniently monitors important
      vital sign trends over time - blood pressure (diastolic &amp; systolic), heart and respiration
      rates, blood oxygen level (SPO2) and body temperature - to aid in identifying clinical
      deterioration. The device is base on a combination of inflatable mini finger cuff and
      photoplethysmograph technology.

      The aim of this study is to collect data for evaluating and calibrating of the BiPS monitor
      for monitoring patient vital signs and compare it to current standard of care hospital
      monitors. The study population includes a total of 50 adult patients that are connected to an
      arterial line as part of their routine care. The BiPS non-invasive monitor will be attached
      to participating patients during their stay in the ICU/ recovery in cardiac ICU/Post
      Anesthesia Care Unit /other hospital designated unit. The device will be placed on the
      patient for 60 minutes while in hospital bed, in which up to 20 blood pressure measurements
      are performed (each takes up to 60 seconds). Heart and respiration rates, body temperature
      and SPO2 will be measured continuously while the device is attached to the patient hand.

        The study will include a total of 50 adult patients that are connected to an arterial line

        unit patients), recruited in Sourasky Medical Center (Ichilov), Tel-Aviv and Carmel Medical
        Center, Haifa.
