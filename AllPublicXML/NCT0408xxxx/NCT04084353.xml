      An intrapartum fetal monitoring training programme (on intermittent auscultation and
      cardiotocography) will be delivered at Government Medical College (GMC) to all relevant
      staff. This quality improvement project and training evaluation aims to assess and evaluate
      the impact of this training. This will allow the investigators to understand if it is
      feasible and acceptable to staff, increases knowledge and improves patient outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As part of Misoprostol or Oxytocin for Labour Induction (MOLI) randomised controlled trial
      (RCT) (CTRI no. NCT03749902), Government Medical College (GMC) plans to increase the number
      of cardiotocography (CTG) machines available on labour ward and provide a United Kingdom (UK)
      based obstetrician to deliver training on cardiotocography (CTG) interpretation in order to
      improve fetal monitoring for this high risk population.

      An intrapartum fetal monitoring training programme (on intermittent auscultation and
      cardiotocography) will be delivered at Government Medical College (GMC) to all relevant
      staff. This quality improvement project and training evaluation aims to assess and evaluate
      the impact of this training. This will allow the investigators to understand if it is
      feasible and acceptable to staff, increases knowledge and improves patient outcomes. It will
      be done through staff questionnaires, pre-and-post test scores and by examining the effects
      on maternal and perinatal outcomes using Kirkpatrick's training evaluation.

      The whole project aims:

        -  To understand current practice and maternal and perinatal outcomes in Government Medical
           College (GMC)

        -  To improve intrapartum fetal monitoring with intermittent auscultation and
           cardiotocography (CTG)

        -  To improve perinatal morbidity and mortality rates

        -  To reduce caesarean section rates for presumed fetal compromise
