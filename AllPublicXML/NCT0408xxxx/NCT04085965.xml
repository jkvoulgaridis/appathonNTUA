  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot randomized controlled trial was designed to assess the feasibility and preliminary
      efficacy of randomizing children, ages 6-12 years from two low-income communities in Rhode
      Island, to attend a summer day camp (CAMP) or to experience summer as usual (SAU). Children
      randomized to CAMP attended a Boys and Girls Club summer day camp for 8-weeks in summer 2017
      or 2018. As part of the consent process, children randomized to SAU agreed to experience an
      unstructured summer (i.e. not enroll in more than one week of summer camp, summer school or
      other structured summer programming). Primary feasibility outcomes included retention,
      engagement and completion of midsummer measures. Secondary outcomes, change in BMIz (a proxy
      for excess summer weight gain), physical activity engagement, sedentary behavior, and diet
      (energy intake and diet quality), were collected by blinded research staff at the end of the
      school year, midsummer and the end of the summer.

    <description>Children randomized to CAMP were enrolled in the Boys and Girls Club Camp in one of two low-income Rhode Island communities in summer 2017 or 2018 for 7-weeks in 2017 and 8-weeks in 2018 due to a delayed end to the 2017 school year (i.e. snow days). Camp was offered daily from 8:30 to 4:30.</description>

    <description>Children randomized to the SAU group were asked to experience an unstructured summer as otherwise planned by their parent / guardian. They agreed to not attend structured summer programming (i.e. camp, summer school, or day care) for more than one week over the summer so as to provide an inactive control group for comparison to those in CAMP.</description>
