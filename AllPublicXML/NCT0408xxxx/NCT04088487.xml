      self-efficacy. The study aim is to evaluate its effectiveness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of migrants worldwide is growing rapidly over the past years. Migration often
      requires creating a whole new social network. There is something that can help migrants to do
      it—their beliefs. Social self-efficacy is confidence in ability to engage in social
      interactional tasks necessary to initiate and maintain interpersonal relationships. These
      beliefs are positively related to social adjustment and negatively related to acculturative
      stress, depression, and loneliness. Therefore, social self-efficacy may be potentially
      beneficial for the psychological adjustment of migrants helping them establish new
      connections in the social environment. Based on this observation the investigators have
      created New in Town, an internet intervention. Exercises in the intervention are based on the
      principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and relate to four sources of self-efficacy
      beliefs—mastery experiences, vicarious experiences, verbal persuasions, and emotional and
      physiological states.

      The effectiveness of New in Town intervention will be tested in a two-arm randomized
      controlled trial with waitlist control group. Primary outcome is social self-efficacy, and
      secondary outcomes include loneliness, perceived social support, and satisfaction with life.
      Other measure of interest is system usability. Participants will be assessed at pre-test
      (T1), 3-week post-tests (T2), as well as 8-week follow-up (T3). The investigators aim to
      analyze the effect size of the intervention and between-groups comparisons at post-test and
      follow-up.

      This study will provide insights into the effectiveness of an internet intervention in
      increasing social self-efficacy, perceived social support and satisfaction with life, and
      reducing loneliness.

    <measure>Change on Social Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline on Social Self-Efficacy (3 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Social self-efficacy will be measured with the General Self-efficacy Scale (GSES). The measure consists of two subscales for measuring 1) generalized beliefs about self-efficacy (17 test items) and 2) beliefs about self-efficacy in establishing and maintaining relationships with others (6 test items). The remaining test items (7) are buffer theorems. The respondents give answers on a scale 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). In the trial, the investigators will use one subscale, which is beliefs about self-efficacy in establishing and maintaining relationships with others. Social self-efficacy will be indicated by the total sum of 6 items scores. The higher total score represents higher social self-efficacy.</description>

    <measure>Change on Loneliness</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline on Loneliness (3 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>To measure loneliness, the investigators will use De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale. The scale is composed of 11 items; 6 of them are formulated negatively and 5 positively. Each item is measured using on 5-point Likert scale (1 = definitely yes, 5 = definitely no). Positive items should be reversed. The sum of scores is counted on 2 separate subscales: emotional and social loneliness. The higher total score represents higher loneliness.</description>

    <measure>Change on Social support</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline on Social support (3 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>To measure social support, the investigators will use The Berlin Social Support Scale (BSSS). The scale consists of 6 subscales: perceived available support, need for support, support seeking, actually received support (recipient), provided support (provider), protective buffering scale. The BSSS contains 32 items that are scored on a 4-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 4 = strongly agree). Before scoring items negative ones need to be reversed. Scores will be counted both on a general scale and subscales. In the trial, only 3 of 6 subscales will be applied: perceived available support (8 test items), need for support (4 test items), and support seeking (5 test items). The higher total score represents higher social support.</description>

    <description>To measure satisfaction with life, the investigators will use The Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). It is a short scale to assess perceived satisfaction with one's life. It consists of 5 items. The respondents provide answers on a 7-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree). Possible scores range from 5 to 35, while score of 20 indicates a neutral point. The higher total score represents higher satisfaction with life.</description>

    <description>An overall impression of the intervention will be assessed by The User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ). It is a self-reported measure that contains 6 subscales: attractiveness, perspicuity, efficiency, dependability, stimulation, novelty. Participants respond to 26 items using a 7-point scale (-3 = the most negative answer, 0 = neutral, +3 = the most positive answer). User experience will only be assessed at post-test among participants allocated to the experimental group.</description>
