  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to assess the effectiveness and safety of the MitralStitch repair
      system in patients with moderate to severe and severe mitral regurgitation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical trial was designed as a prospective, multicenter, single group assignment study.
      The participants with moderate to severe and severe mitral valve regurgitation will receive a
      transapical beating-heart mitral valve repair surgery using MitralStitch mitral valve repair
      system after signed the informed consent. The follow-up will be conducted after 30 days, 3
      months, 6 months and 12 months of the operation.

      The following conditions evaluate the performance of the system and the safety and efficiency
      of using MitralStitch mitral valve repair system in treating patients with severe mitral
      regurgitation.

      The none occurrence of these conditions will be approved as the main validity index: death,
      mitral valve related surgery without mitral valve failure and moderate or severe mitral
      regurgitation (MR &gt; 2+). The secondary validity index was technical success rate, instrument
      success rate, surgical success rate, cardiac function improvement and quality of life
      improvement. And the safety evaluation indicators were assessed by the incidence of major
      adverse events, adverse events, serious adverse events, and device defects.
