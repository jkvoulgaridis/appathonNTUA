  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Although negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is likely advantageous for
      wound healing, the efficacy and safety of its prophylactic use remain unclear. We performed a
      Randomized Control Trial to assess the usefulness of postoperative NPWT in reduction of
      postoperative wound healing complications and surgical site infections after diverting
      ileostomy closure, in the group of patients previously operated for colorectal resection due
      to cancer.

      Materials &amp; Methods: Prospective, randomized study will be conducted. Patients with past
      history of colorectal cancer laparoscopic surgery with protective loop ileostomy scheduled to
      undergo ileostomy closure with primary wound closure will be randomly divided into groups
      with or without NPWT. The primary endpoint are incidence of wound related complications (WRC)
      (wound healing complications witch required surgical intervention other than suture removal
      or dressing changing). The secondary endpoints are incidences of Surgical Site Infection
      (SSI) and length of postoperative hospital stay (LOS) and length of complete wound healing
      (CWH). Cost analysis will also be performed.

      In first step of this study between January 2016 and December 2018 we will asses the
      usefulness of one of the NPWT devices (NANOVA KCI) in prevention of WHC in established group.
      The second part of the study will be performed in 2 centers between January 2019 and December
      2021. In this step we want to compere other NPWT devices in the same application and to
      confirm single center outcomes .

    <description>Primary endpoint is described as a reduction of wound healing complications (WHC) after protective ostomy closure in a group of patients previously operated for colorectal cancer with protective ileostomy formation. Wound healing complications are described as any condition of wound which required postoperative intervention other than change of dressing or removing of sutures .</description>

    <description>The primary endpoint is described as a comparison of reduction of wound healing complications (WHC) after protective ostomy closure in a group of patients previously operated for colorectal cancer with protective ileostomy formation between 3 different postopNPWT devices (KCI NANOVA, Smith&amp;Naphiew PICO and Gynadyne XLR 8) . Wound healing complications are described as any condition of wound which required postoperative intervention other than change of dressing or removing of sutures .</description>

    <description>Secondary endpoints is described as incidence of SSI. Incisional SSI diagnosis criteria included an infection that occurred within 30 days after the operation involving the skin, subcutaneous tissue, or deep soft tissue (e.g. fascia and muscle layers) at the incision site, organ or space according to the criteria of CDC and ECDC for diagnosis of SSI</description>

    <description>In case of NPWT group. After Ileostomy closure skin will be closed by 3 or 4 single no absorbable Monosyn 3-0 (Ethicon, Cincinnati, Ohio., USA) sutures. Between them small sponge &quot;tongues&quot; 1x 0,5x2 cm were placed and over whole incision an NANOVA (KCI USA) negative pressure dressing will be placed. In control group first dressing change was made in 48 hours after operation and then every day until suture removal at 7 postoperative day. In NPWT group NANOVA dressing was taken out at 72 hours. 3 steri-streps were placed between sutures and standard sterile dressing was placed. After it dressing was changed every 24 hours until suture removal at 7 postoperative day.</description>
