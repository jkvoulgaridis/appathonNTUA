  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators aim to determine the health benefits of red raspberry
      ellagitannin consumption on cardiovascular health. The study population is stratified
      according to the urolithin metabotypes (gut-microbial metabolic profile): UM-0, UM-A and
      UM-B.

      The investigators will evaluate changes in blood pressure, endothelial function, arterial
      stiffness, lipid profile, cognitive performance and gut microbiome composition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Red raspberries are a good source of polyphenols including ellagitannins. Previous work
      suggests that urolithins, gut microbial metabolites derived from ellagitannins contained in
      raspberries, can improve vascular health. It has also been observed that the capacity of the
      gut microbiome to metabolize urolithins can influence the cardiometabolic response to
      ellagitannin consumption. In this work the investigators aim to investigate whether urolithin
      metabotypes (UM-A, B and 0) can influence the vascular response to a (poly)phenol-rich
      breakfast containing red raspberry ellagitannins in a healthy UK population.

      You will be stratified by metabotype in a first phase (NCT03573414) and are then randomly
      allocated to treatment or placebo. Outcomes are measured at baseline and after 12 weeks
      consumption of the study product.
