  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an observational study evaluating subject's perception of pain to dressing
      changes during removal and application of a surfactant gel. Wound healing will also be
      monitored. Anxiety before dressing change will be measured using a burn specific pain anxiety
      scale. Study intervention will include cleansing the wound per the facility's standard of
      care, followed by applying the investigational product on the wound. This will be followed by
      placing an appropriate secondary dressing.

    <description>A burn-specific pain anxiety scale will be used to measure level of anxiety. Items will be scored on a 100mm visual analog line with two reference points, 0 and 100. These reference points will also be identified by expressions &quot;not at all&quot; and &quot;the worst imaginable way&quot;. Subjects will be requested to scale the strength of their feelings relative to two reference points.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject should be an inpatient, per the Two-Midnight rule at the time of study
             initiation.

          -  At the time of subject's admission in the hospital, duration of his or her burn wound
             should be &lt; or equal to 24 hours.

          -  Subject who has a partial thickness burn wound, or an indeterminate burn wound, or who
             has both these characteristics in the same wound, as determined by the site Principal
             Investigator.

          -  Subject's wound included in this study, does not require any surgical intervention.

          -  Subject is able and willing to comply with requirements of this trial protocol.

          -  Voluntarily signed informed consent obtained before any trial-related procedures are
             performed.

          -  Subject must be able to communicate effectively with study personnel.

          -  Subject has burn total body surface area (TBSA) between 1-20%.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with electrical or radiation burns.

          -  Subjects who are pregnant, nursing or planning to become pregnant during the course of
             the study.

          -  Subjects who have known allergies to any ingredients in the dressings used in the
             study.

          -  Subjects taking opiates during the study duration.

          -  Subjects with an active diagnosis of substance use disorder within the past six
             months.

          -  Subjects with previously diagnosed issues with pain perception, including conditions
             such as peripheral neuropathy, if they will preclude accurate assessment of primary
             and secondary endpoints.

          -  Subjects with an active infection prior to enrollment.

          -  Subject has previous or current systemic disease(s) which, in the judgement of the
             investigator, is likely to interfere with treatment. Subjects with well-controlled
             diabetes mellitus (HbA1C&lt;8.5) shall be permitted.
