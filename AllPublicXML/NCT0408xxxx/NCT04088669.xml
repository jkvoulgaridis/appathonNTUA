  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a serious global health problem affecting people of all ages in every country in
      the world. Despite the presence of effective medications, many studies have reported poor
      asthma control in patients. Therefore, new approaches are needed to improve asthma control.
      Pulmonary rehabilitation is recommended as an alternative approach in patients with chronic
      lung disease including asthma. Also, home-based type of pulmonary rehabilitation can be
      preferred because it is more cost-effective and patients can spend more time with their
      families. There are a limited number of studies in the literature evaluating the efficacy of
      home-based pulmonary rehabilitation in asthmatic patients. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the efficacy of home-based pulmonary rehabilitation program with simple equipment
      in asthmatic patients.

    <description>Change of Six-Minute Walking Test Distance from baseline to 8 weeks.The distance covered in meters in a straight corridor of 30 meters will be recorded as fast as possible but without running for 6 minutes. The distance that normal individuals should take in this period is 400-700 meters. In addition, oxygen saturation and heart rate, resting fatigue and dyspnea levels will be evaluated with pulse oximetry before and after testing. Modified Borg Dyspnea and Fatigue Scales will be used to determine resting dyspnea and fatigue levels.</description>

    <description>Change of Asthma Control Test from baseline to 8 weeks. The Asthma Control Test is a 5-item questionnaire that enables the patient to assess his / her own level of exposure to asthma activities, frequency of day and night asthma symptoms, need for rescue medication, and disease control. Patients will be asked to answer the asthma control test, which includes scores associated with the answer to each question, and the total score will be 25 if complete control, 20-24 as partial control, and &lt;19 as uncontrolled.</description>

    <description>Change of Medical Research Council Scale results from baseline to 8 weeks. The Medical Research Council Scale (MRCS) is a five-item scale based on various physical activities that produce dyspnea. Here, patients are asked to mark the level of activity that causes dyspnea in themselves. On the scale, 0 describes the best 4 dyspnea and the worst.</description>

    <description>Change of Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire Results from baseline to 8 weeks.It is a self-answered questionnaire consisting of three categories, evaluating the symptoms, activities and effects of patients on daily life. It was developed in order to determine the severity of the disease as more comprehensive and sensitive. Symptoms examined; cough, sputum, wheezing and shortness of breath. Physical functions, housework and hobbies are questioned to determine activity status. The survey consists of 76 questions and is completed in 20 minutes. 0 indicates excellent health and 100 indicates worst health.</description>

    <description>Change of London Chest Activity of Daily Living Scale results from baseline to 8 weeks. This questionnaire consisting of 15 items; personal care (4 items-dry, dress up upper body, wear shoes / socks, wash hair), housework (make 6 items-bed, change sheets, window / curtain wash, clean / remove dust, wash dishes, sweep), physical activity (2 items-stairs, leaning) and leisure (3 items-walking in the house, socially go out, talk) consists of four components. Each item is given a score ranging from 0 to 5. Higher scores indicate higher limitation. The scale can be evaluated as total score, component score and question score. The total score can reach up to 75.</description>
