  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pilot study with biomarker exploration.50 patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) that are eligible for treatment with nivolumab. Patients will undergo a
      18F-FDG-PET/CT and EBUS-FNA of the lymph nodes and have blood drawn before and after immune
      checkpoint inhibitor treatment to compare tumor FDG uptake and to identify changes in the
      immune effector cell subsets in TDLNs. Blood will be drawn in parallel to compare the
      distribution of immune effector cell subsets before and after treatment initiation. Because
      of the possible burden for patients, the EBUS-FNA is not mandatory to complete the study and
      is there for an exploratory objective. Also blood will be drawn for a tumor mutational burden
      at baseline. The first six patients will undergo a dynamic PET-CT scan in addition to a
      static scan to study the influence of possible immunotherapy induced changes to the body
      distribution and kinetics of FDG..
