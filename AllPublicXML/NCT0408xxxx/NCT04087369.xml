  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will test an NCD intervention bundle incorporating the World Health Organisation (WHO)'s
      Package for Essential Non-Communicable Disease Interventions (PEN) within an approximate
      population of 300,000 people in rural Nepal. This intervention integrates three
      evidence-based approaches for both facility- and community-based NCD care focused on the key
      areas of Clinical Practice, Counseling, and Technology for two tiers of non-physician
      healthcare worker - Mid-Level Providers and Community Health Workers: 1) Task-shifting of
      evidence-based medicine algorithms and clinical skills from PEN protocols to non-physician
      healthcare workers; 2) Delivering quality counseling based on the Motivational Interviewing
      Model to drive behavior change with respect to both treatment adherence (defined as
      medication adherence and follow-up completion) and risk factor modification (alcohol,
      tobacco, diet, physical activity); 3) Employing a facility- and community-based clinical
      decision support tool for effective integration of PEN protocols into non-physician
      healthcare worker workflow. This five-year study will initial test the acceptability and
      feasibility of the intervention (two years) followed by a type 2 hybrid
      effectiveness-implementation research trial (three years) to which we will apply the RE-AIM
      implementation evaluative framework of both outcomes and process indicators. Co-primary
      outcomes for the intervention bundle will be: a) disease-specific, evidence-based control
      metrics that measures clinical efficacy; b) qualitative evaluation of acceptability and
      feasibility that incorporates perspectives of patients, providers, and government
      stakeholders; and c) an implementation checklist of key intervention process measures.

    <description>In the intervention includes the planned roll-out of the World Health Organization's Package of essential noncommunicable disease interventions (WHO PEN) for primary care in low resource settings by the Government of Nepal, Ministry of Health and Population. In addition, this intervention will include three evidence-based components: 1) non-communicable disease (NCD) care integration using mid-level practitioners (MLPs) and community healthcare workers (CHWs); 2) clinical decision support (CDS) tools to ensure quality care in accordance with best practices; and 3) training and supervision of MLPs to provide motivational interviewing (MI) techniques for modifiable risk factor optimization, with a specific focus on tobacco and alcohol use.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult patients aged 18 or older that screen into Nyaya Health Nepal/Possible's chronic
             disease program for the following conditions: Hypertension, Type II Diabetes Mellitus,
             COPD, and Asthma OR

          2. Adult patients aged 18 or older with end-organ pathology resulting from the
             aforementioned conditions including the following: Chronic Kidney Disease, Ischemic
             Heart Disease, Cerebrovascular Disease AND

          3. Healthcare staff; mid-level providers serving at district/primary health center-level
             facility; community health workers serving village clusters, Nyaya Health
             Nepal/Possible and Government of Nepal/Ministry of Health and Population employees
             involved in study design, program implementation, data collection, or data analysis
             processes.

               -  Note, study populations 1 and 2 must reside in either Achham or Dolakha (Nepal)
                  districts.

                    -  Patients must have a noncommunicable note in electronic medical record
                       system at least twice (indicating at least one follow-up visit) and must
                       have minimum 12 weeks in between baseline/endline clinical measures
                       (indicating patients have been followed up for at least 3 months and have 3
                       months of exposure to intervention).

                         -  Patients do not need to have been in study for all 3 years. Duration of
                            exposure to intervention will depend on stepped implementation design.

        Patients may be identified at Bayalpata Hospital (Achham, Nepal) or Charikot Primary Health
        Center (Dolakha, Nepal) by facility clinicians. Community health workers can also identify
        hypertensive patients and refer them to the facility for diagnosis confirmation. Patient
        enrollment will not be restricted by economic status or caste. Patients will not be
        recruited exclusively to participate in the study but will undergo routine evaluations,
        entering the final diagnosis in electronic health record system, tracking progress at each
        patient contact, the frequency for which is determined by the clinician's recommendation
        per World Health Organization Package of Essential Noncommunicable disease intervention
        protocols and the patient's availability. Patients will receive longitudinal care via the
        community health workers at their homes and at the hospitals by mid-level providers and
        staff physicians. Their receipt of care is not contingent upon their enrollment in the
        study; they receive care per routine service delivery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients migrate from the study are before completion of any of the Package of
             Essential Noncommunicable disease interventions

          2. Patients explicitly request exclusion from the study and decline to consent to the
             study.
