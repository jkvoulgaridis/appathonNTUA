  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alemtuzumab is a highly effective therapy in relapse remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The
      aim of this study is to elucidate the mechanism of action of the neuroprotective potential of
      alemtuzumab in RRMS. Therefore, the investigators will semi-annually analyse blood samples of
      RRMS patients treated with alemtuzumab up to 36 months. Using in vitro/ ex vivo assays the
      investigators aim to detect and characterize immune cells including their functional
      activity. Furthermore, the study aims to combine this analysis with clinical data (MRI, EDSS:
      Expanded Disability Status Scale, MSFC: Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite) to reveal
      the underlining mechanism of action of alemtuzumab to further improve its efficacy and safety
      for present and future patients.

    <description>• Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS):
Scoring will be performed using standard scoring test from www.neurostatus.net.
EDSS is an ordinal clinical rating scale which ranges from 0 (normal neurologic examination) to 10 (death due to MS) in half-point increments. EDSS steps 1.0 to 4.5 refer to people with MS who are fully ambulatory, while EDSS steps 5.0 to 9.5 are defined by the impairment to ambulation.</description>

MSFC will be administered according to the MSFC manual of the National MS Society.
In brief measurements on the impact of MS in three key clinical dimensions: leg function and ambulation, arm and hand function, and cognitive function are done. Raw scores in different measurement scales are transformed into standard comparable scores (z-scores) and an overall composite score is calculated.</description>
