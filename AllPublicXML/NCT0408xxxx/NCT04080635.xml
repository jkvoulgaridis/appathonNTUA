  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biologics, such as brodalumab, are currently the most effective treatment option for patients
      with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. But they are costly for health care systems and prescribed
      according to a 'one dose fits all' dosing regimen, leading to potential over- and
      undertreatment. Within this study we aim to investigate the predictive value of early serum
      trough levels of brodalumab and determine the therapeutic window of brodalumab in psoriasis
      patients.

      Patients will be included after siging informed consent. After inclusion, patients will
      continue on standard dosing schedule of brodalumab (i.e. one loading dose first (210mg), once
      a week for 2 weeks (210mg), then a regular dose regimen (210mg) every 2 weeks). During each
      study visit, blood will be taken in order to quantify Ctroughs and/or anti-drug antibodies
      towards brodalumab. In addition, the Psoriasis Severity and Area Index (PASI) and the
      Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score will be evaluated by a physician. Patients
      complete the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and European quality of life EQ-5D
      instrument at each visit.

    <measure>DLQI</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 until week 52 of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index) (range 0-30) is a dermatology specific quality of life (QoL) instrument designed to assess the impact of the disease on participant's QoL. It is a ten item questionnaire that, in addition to evaluated overall QoL, can be used to assess six different aspects that may affect QoL: 1) symptoms and feelings, 2) daily activities, 3) leasure, 4) work or school performances, 5) personal relationships, and 6) treatment.
The scoring of each question is as follows:
Very much - scored 3; A lot - scored 2; A little - scored 1; Not at all - scored 0; Not relevant - scored 0; Question 7, 'prevented work or studying' - scored 3. The DLQI is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EQ5D5L</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 until week 52 of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>EQ5DL comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.</description>

The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the patient's own judgement.</description>
