    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the rate and extent of absorption of bedaquiline
      following administration of a single oral dose of 100 milligram (mg) equivalent (1*100 mg)
      given as different test tablet formulations compared to the administration of a single oral
      dose of 100 mg equivalent (1*100 mg) formulated as SIRTURO commercial tablet (formulation
      F001), under fasted conditions in healthy adult participants. Also, to assess the effect of a
      standardized breakfast on the rate and extent of absorption of bedaquiline compared to fasted
      conditions following administration of a single oral dose of 100 mg equivalent (1*100 mg) for
      each of the different test tablet formulations.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. Therefore, it can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to that medicinal product.</description>
