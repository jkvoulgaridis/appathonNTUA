    <textblock>
      A single-arm, multi-center, clinical study to assess the safety profile of the Tandem t:slim
      X2 with Control-IQ system in children with T1D aged 2-6 years old under free living condition
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial aims to demonstrate the safety of the Closed-Loop Control (CLC), also
      known as Artificial Pancreas (AP) named t:slim X2 with Control-IQ Technology and assess
      usability in a supervised setting for the treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in young
      children (2-6 years old).

    <description>Subjects will use the Tandem t:slim X2 with Control- IQ Technology and Dexcom G6 CGM to control their glycemia. The Tandem t:slim X2 with Control-IQ device is an automated insulin delivery pump that automatically adjusts insulin delivery to predicted and prevailing glucose levels, as measured by a Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitor [CGM].</description>
