        To detect a 130% increase in NICU length of stay with power of 0.8, the investigators
        calculated a sample size of 400 subjects with 200 subjects before and after implementation.
        It is estimated that the data collection period is roughly over the course of one year,
        with the assumption that not all neonates with hypoglycemia will meet the inclusion
        criteria.
