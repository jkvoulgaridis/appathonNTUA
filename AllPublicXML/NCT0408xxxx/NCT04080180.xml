  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two different interventions for
      medication-assisted treatment (MAT) adherence: Contingency Management (CM) and Brief
      Motivational Intervention plus Substance Free Activities Session (BMI+SFAS).

      Our research team seeks to compare the effectiveness of these two different interventions for
      MAT adherence by first refining and piloting CM and BMI+SFAS adherence approaches, then
      conducting a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) to assess sequential,
      individual, and combined effects across MAT initiation and maintenance.

      In order to tailor treatment to individual's needs, we propose the following sequential
      multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART): In stage 1, participants are individually
      randomized (1:1) to BMI+SFAS or CM. Adherent buprenorphine-naloxone participants complete
      treatment in the arm they were originally assigned to, but non-adherent participants are
      re-randomized (1:1) to either switch to the other intervention or add the other intervention
      in this part-factorial SMART.

    <intervention_model_description>In stage 1, participants are individually randomized (1:1) to BMI+SFAS or CM. At the end of stage 1, adherent buprenorphine-naloxone participants remain in their respective intervention group during phase 2 (maintenance phase of same approach), whereas non-adherent participants are randomized (individually and 1:1) to either switch or add the respective other intervention in this part-factorial SMART. Our primary outcome is buprenorphine-naloxone adherence by the end of stage 2. This sequential randomization based on past treatment success assures that the assigned treatment option at any point in time is independent of future potential outcomes and only conditional on the subject's history, i.e., the sequential ignorable treatment assumption is satisfied by design,108 in sharp distinction to observational data where patients chose to switch/add or not to switch/add and where this assumption remains untestable.</intervention_model_description>
