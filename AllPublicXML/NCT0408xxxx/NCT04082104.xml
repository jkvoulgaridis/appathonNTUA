  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess stuttering severity in both narration and conversation in
      adults and adolescences in order to determine which situation is more stressful so that more
      reliable and accurate measures for diagnosis can be done. Also this study will help in
      determining the best line of management of stuttering.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stuttering is a speech disorder in which the flow of speech is disrupted by involuntary
      repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, words or phrases as well as involuntary
      silent pauses or blocks.

      In the world, approximately 1% of the adult population suffer from stuttering. Stuttering has
      severe impact on the overall quality of the person's life such as anxiety, stress, shame, low
      self-esteem and negative affectivity .It also affects his educational attainment, his
      attractiveness and work life as he avoids employment.

      Stuttering varies in severity, frequency and duration from situation to situation. So its
      dynamics are best understood within discourse contexts that involve interactions with other
      people. Clinicians typically rely on spontaneous conversational samples for analyzing speech
      disfluencies. They have good validity, but the use of a more structured form of speech may
      allow for more efficient, reliable elicitation of stuttering related behaviours and better
      understanding of the nature of stuttering.

      Narration offers a more structured context than conversation because storytellers must weave
      together information about the characters, the circumstances and actions. Also, narration
      often contains more complex language than conversation and put the whole responsibility on
      the speaker for planning and conveying the information to the listener, compared to
      conversation where two or more speakers co-construct the stream of topics and comments. Thus,
      narration places more linguistic, cognitive and communicative demands on speakers than does
      conversation.

      A research was done on six adult participants and showed that some of them stuttered more
      during conversation and others stuttered more during narration.

    <description>Riley's Stuttering Severity Instrument is used for the objective assessment of severity and in other examinations of stuttered speech. Current versions of the instrument measures three parameters: 1) stuttering frequency; 2) duration of selected stutters; 3) observed physical concomitants.</description>
