      A single center, double-blind, randomized, dose-escalation study to assess the safety,
      tolerability and efficacy of 3 doses of AD17002 in comparison to placebo. Subjects will be
      randomized at 3:1 ratios in each of 3 cohorts to receive AD17002 or placebo. The following
      treatment cohorts are featured in a dose-escalating manner:

      A. Cohort 1 will comprise 16 subjects who will receive, in a double-blind manner, either 20
      μg AD17002 (n=12) or placebo (n=4) on Study Day 1, 8, and 15.

      B. Cohort 2 will comprise 16 subjects who will receive, in a double-blind manner, either 40
      μg AD17002 (n=12) or placebo (n=4) on Study Day 1, 8, and 15.

      C. Cohort 3 will comprise 16 subjects who will receive, in a double-blind manner, either 60
      μg AD17002 (n=12) or placebo (n=4) on Study Day 1, 8, and 15.

      A total of 16 subjects in cohort 1 will receive the assigned study preparation before the
      remainder of the Cohort. Study drug administration to the next subject for the first 8
      subjects in the cohort 1 will be separated for at least one day elapse (at least 24 hrs). The
      progression to the next cohort will take place after the SRT review the whole follow-up
      period safety data of previous cohort.

        A subject can participate in the study only if all the following criteria are met:

          1. Subject 20-49 aged years, having a clinical history of allergic rhinitis (diagnosed by
             a physician) of 1 year duration or more and have received anti-allergy treatment
             during the previous year before the study enrollment.

          2. Subjects with HDM-specific IgE serum value ≥ 0.7 kUA/L during screening period.

          3. HDM allergic rhinitis symptoms during the baseline period defined as a total nasal
             symptoms score more than 6, at least on 5 of 7 consecutive calendar days in screening
             period. A subject receiving anti-allergy medication is required to washout of their
             medication before and during screening period of the trial until the required symptom
             threshold is met.

          4. No known prior clinical history of asthma.

          5. Subjects who are of reproductive potential agrees to remain abstinent or use (or have
             their partner use) an acceptable method of birth control within the projected duration
             of the trial. Acceptable methods of birth control are: intrauterine device, hormonal
             contraception, diaphragm with spermicide, contraceptive sponge, condom, vasectomy, as
             per local regulations or guidelines. Female subjects of childbearing potential must
             have negative serum pregnancy test at screening, and negative urine pregnancy test at
             randomization visit.

          6. A female subject who is not of reproductive potential and a male subject who is
             diagnosed to be sterile is eligible without requiring the use of contraception. A
             female subject who is not of reproductive potential is defined as: one who has either

               1. Reached natural menopause (defined as 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with
                  serum follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the postmenopausal range as
                  determined by the laboratory, or 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea),

               2. Six weeks postsurgical documented total hysterectomy and/or bilateral
                  salpingo-oophorectomy, or

               3. Bilateral tubal ligation.

          7. Subject or the subject's legal representative understands the trial procedures,
             alternative treatments available, risks involved with the trial, and voluntarily
             agrees to participate by giving written informed consent.

          8. Be able to read, understand, and complete questionnaires and diaries.

          9. Provide written informed consent for the trial and willing to adhere to dose and visit
             schedules.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria are not eligible to enter the study:

          1. Has a clinically relevant, known history of symptomatic allergic rhinoconjunctivitis
             and/or asthma caused by mold, animal hair and dander, or other allergens (except HDM)
             to which the subject is regularly exposed and sensitized. Subjects without a known
             history of allergy other than to HDM, but show any positive result (on CAP test)
             towards the allergens could be accepted in the judgement of the investigator.

          2. Has any nasal condition that, in the judgement of the investigator, could confound the
             efficacy or safety assessments (e.g., nasal polyposis, nasal malformation, frequent
             nosebleeds, etc).

          3. Has a history of anaphylaxis reaction to any known or unknown cause.

          4. Has a history of chronic urticaria and/or angioedema within the last 2 years before
             Screening Visit.

          5. Immunosuppressed subjects as result of illness (e.g. HIV infection) or treatment.

          6. Has acute respiratory illness needing antibiotics or antivirals within 14 days prior
             to the Screening visit.

          7. Has acute sinusitis or chronic sinusitis accompanying acute symptoms within 3 days
             prior to administration of first dose of study drug.

             autoimmune diseases].

          9. Has documented history of Bell's palsy.

         10. Has a history of allergic reaction to kanamycin.

         11. Has received Immunosuppressive treatment (ATC code L04 or L01) within 3 months prior
             to the Screening visit.

         12. Has had previous immunotherapy treatment with any HDM allergen.

         13. Has had previous exposure to the study drug or Flu Vaccine AD07030.

         14. Is receiving ongoing treatment with any specific immunotherapy at the time of the
             Screening Visit.

         16. Subjects with chronic (&gt; 6 months) or intermittent dependence on nasal, inhaled, oral,
             intramuscular, intravenous corticosteroids, or potent topical corticosteroids with
             systemic effects. Subjects who are non-chronic users and do not use these
             corticosteroids intermittently must undergo at least 5 half-lives of washout prior to
             the Screening visit.

         17. Subjects using other medications for their allergic rhinitis and/or asthma if they
             cannot abstain from the specified time window below (or 5 half-lives, whichever is
             longer) prior to the Screening visit:

               -  Nasal or oral antihistamines: 48 hours

               -  Nasal decongestants: 24 hours

               -  Oral decongestants: 24 hours

               -  Short acting inhaled beta-agonists: 48 hours

               -  Long acting antihistamine (half-life &gt;24hrs): 10 days

         18. Subjects who had chronic use (&gt; 6 months) of concomitant medications [e.g., tricyclic
             antidepressants, beta-blocker, xanthines (including theophylline, but not including
             caffeine), anticholinergics, cromoglycates, leukotriene antagonists, 5-lipoxygenase
             inhibitors and long-acting inhaled beta-agonists, etc] that would affect assessment of
             the effectiveness of the investigational product. Subjects who are non-chronic users
             of these medications must undergo at least 5 half-lives of washout prior to the
             Screening visit.

         19. Is nursing at randomization and within the projected duration of the trial.

         20. Subject who plans travel outside the trial area for a substantial portion of the trial
             period.

         21. Other cases judged by the investigator to be ineligible for participation in the
             study.
