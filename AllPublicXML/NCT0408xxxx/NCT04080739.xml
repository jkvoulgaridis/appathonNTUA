      The purpose of this protocol is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of regional anesthesia
      for head and neck patients undergoing microvascular free flap reconstruction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The increasing rate of opioid related overdose mortality is well documented in the literature
      and approached 15 per 100,000 in 2017. Because of a growing epidemic in the US, the medical
      community is under scrutiny to curtail opioid prescription. However, this is weighed against
      surgical outcomes; importantly, postoperative pain has adverse effects on function, recovery
      and quality of life.

      Regional anesthesia provides a non opioid based, pain control strategy. First, regional
      anesthesia decreases systemic adverse events including respiratory failure in abdominal
      surgery, decreases length of stay and improves rehabilitation in common orthopedic procedures
      such as total knee arthroplasty and shoulder arthroplasty. Second, the physiologic benefits
      of regional anesthesia are compelling including augmented micro and macrocirculation,
      maintenance of body temperature and decreased systemic stress response through chemical
      sympathectomy. Finally, regional anesthesia has been established as safe in the microvascular
      and anesthesia literature for pediatric, and adult patients.
