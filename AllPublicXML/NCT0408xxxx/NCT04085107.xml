  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a sequential mixed study to test the hypothesized models with seven hypotheses of the
      relationship between cognitive deficit (subject and objective) and neuropsychiatric symptoms
      (NPS) among persons with mild cognitive impairment (PwMCI). The study will also examine the
      psychometric properties of the Chinese version of Mild Behavioural Impairment -Checklist
      (MBI-C).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to test the hypothesized model that explores the moderating
      roles of neurotic personality, social support and coping style, as well as the mediating role
      of self-esteem in the relationship between cognitive deficit and NPS. This study will also
      examine the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of MBI-C.

      Specifically, the four objectives of this study are as follows:

        1. To examine the relationship between cognitive deficit (subjective and objective) and NPS

        2. To examine the moderating roles of the neurotic trait (neuroticism) and coping resources
           (coping style and social support), as well as the mediating role of self-esteem in the
           relationship between cognitive deficit and NPS

        3. To explore the life experience of PwMCI that help to determine how these factors
           moderate/ mediate the relationship between cognitive deficit and NPS

        4. To examine the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of MBI-C among PwMCI in
           Hong Kong

      This sequential mixed study will be conducted in two non-governmental organization in Hong
      Kong.

      For the first and second objective, a descriptive, cross-sectional, correlational approach
      will be adopted to test the hypothesized models with seven hypotheses of the relationship
      between cognitive deficit (subject and objective) and NPS. The moderating roles of
      personality trait (neuroticism) and coping resources (coping styles and social support), as
      well as the mediating role of self-esteem in such a relationship, will also be explored.

      For the third objective, semi-structured interviews will be adopted to explore the life
      experience of PwMCI, which help understanding how the proposed factors mediate or moderate
      the relationship between compromised abilities and NPS.

      For the fourth objective, the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of MBI-C will be
      examined and reported. Internal consistency, 2-week test-retest reliability, factorial
      validity, concurrent validity and convergent validity will be assessed.

    <measure>Chinese Version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>NPI-Q is a caregiver-administered instrument that assesses measure the frequency and severity of NPS among the participants.This instrument measures 12 domains including delusion, hallucination, anxiety, depression, euphoria, apathy, disinhibition, irritability and aberrant motor behaviour, sleep disturbance and appetite. The instrument will be completed by an informant to rate the frequency of NPS on a four-point scale (1 - sporadically, 4 - very often) and the severity of NPS on a three-point scale (1 - mild, 3 - severe).</description>

    <measure>Hong Kong Chinese version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (HK-MoCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This 12-item instrument will be used to measure cognitive functions including visuospatial functions, naming, verbal memory, abstraction, delay memory, calculation and orientation. Total score ranges from 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating more severe cognitive impairment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Chinese version of Chinese version of Mild Behavioural Impairment -Checklist</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This 34-item questionnaire will be used to measure five domains of NPS, including decreased motivation, emotional dysregulation, impulse dyscontrol, social inappropriateness and abnormal perception or thought content. It involves closed-ended questions on the existence of symptoms followed by a 3-point Likert scale on their severity. Total scores of all domains range from 0 to 102, with higher scores indicating more NPS.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Chinese version of Simplified Coping Scale Questionnaire (SCSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This 20-item questionnaire will be adopted to evaluate their attitude towards life events, which could be divided into active (12 items) and passive (eight items) coping styles. Each item is rated at four-point Likert scale, with subscale score are summed from the items in each subscale. A higher subscale score indicates more frequent use of the coping style.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Chinese version of Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This 12-item instrument measures the availability of support from family (4 items) and friends (8 items) on a seven-point Likert scale with total scores range from 12 to 48. Higher scores indicate a higher level of perceived social support.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Chinese version of the neuroticism subscale of NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This 12-item neuroticism subscale will be adopted to measure neuroticism over manageability, comprehensibility and meaningfulness on a five-point Likert scale. Total scores range from 0 to 48, with higher scores indicating a more neurotic personality.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rosenberg self-esteem scale (RSES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The 10-item scale will be adopted to evaluate the sense of self-worth through five positive and five negative statements on a four-point Likert scale, all items are summed to total scores that range from 10 to 40, with a higher score indicating higher level of self-esteem.</description>
