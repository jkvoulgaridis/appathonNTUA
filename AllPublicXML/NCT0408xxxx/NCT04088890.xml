      The primary purpose of this study is to test whether CD22-CAR T cells can be successfully
      made from immune cells collected from adults with relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies
      (leukemia and lymphoma).

      Primary Objective:

        -  Determine the feasibility of manufacturing CD22 CAR T cells using the Miltenyi CliniMACS
           Prodigy® system for administration to adults with relapsed/refractory CD22 expressing
           B-cell ALL or relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell non hodgkins lymphoma (NHL).

        -  Establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CD22 CAR T
           cells in adults with relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell NHL.

        -  Determine the safety of an established dose of CD22-CAR T cells in adults with
           relapsed/refractory CD22 expressing B-cell ALL and the safety of the MTD/RP2D of
           CD22-CAR T cells in adults with relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell NHL.

      Secondary Objective:

      - Assess the clinical activity of CD22-CAR T cells in adults with R/R CD22 expressing B-cell
      ALL and R/R aggressive B-cell NHL, including overall survival (OS) and progressive free
      survival (PFS).

               -  Subjects with ALL: must have evaluable or measurable disease (MRD positive by
                  flow cytometry, next-generation sequencing (NGS), or PCR is acceptable).

               -  Subjects with aggressive B-cell NHL: must have evaluable or measurable disease
                  according to the revised International Working Group (IWG) Response Criteria for

                  considered measurable only if progression has been documented following
                  completion of radiation therapy.

          3. CD22 expression

             • Subjects with ALL: CD22 positive expression on malignant cells is required and must
             be detected by immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry. The choice of whether to use
             flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry will be determined by what is the most easily
             available tissue sample in each subject.

             CD22 expression must be demonstrated subsequent to any anti-CD22 targeted therapy
             (e.g. Moxetumomab pasudotox or inotuzumab ozogamicin) in subjects with ALL.

             • Subjects with aggressive B-cell NHL: CD22 expression at any level, including
             undetectable, will be acceptable. Subjects must have archival tissue available for
             analysis of CD22 expression or must be willing to undergo a biopsy of easily
             accessible disease.

          4. Prior Bone Marrow-Stem Cell Transplant Subjects who have undergone autologous stem
             cell transplant (SCT) with disease progression or relapse following SCT are eligible.

             other eligibility criteria, they are at least 100 days post transplant, they have no
             evidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD) and have been without immunosuppressive
             agents for at least 30 days.

          5. Prior Therapy Wash-out At least 2 weeks or 5 half lives, whichever is shorter, must
             have elapsed since any prior systemic therapy at the time the subject is planned for
             leukapheresis, except for systemic inhibitory/stimulatory immune checkpoint therapy,
             which requires 5 half lives.

             Subjects with ALL may not have received inotuzumab ozogamicin therapy within the past
             3 months.

             Exceptions:

               1. There is no time restriction with regard to prior intrathecal chemotherapy
                  provided there is complete recovery from any acute toxic effects of such;

               2. Subjects receiving hydroxyurea may be enrolled provided there has been no
                  increase in dose for at least 2 weeks prior to starting apheresis;

               3. Subjects who are on standard ALL maintenance type chemotherapy (vincristine,
                  6-mercaptopurine or oral methotrexate) may be enrolled provided that chemotherapy
                  is discontinued at least 1 week or 5 half lives, whichever is shorter, prior to
                  apheresis.

               4. Subjects receiving steroid therapy at physiologic replacement doses only are
                  allowed provided there has been no increase in dose for at least 2 weeks prior to
                  starting apheresis;

               5. For radiation therapy: Radiation therapy must have been completed at least 3
                  weeks prior to enrollment, with the exception that there is no time restriction
                  if the volume of bone marrow treated is less than 10% and also the subject has
                  measurable/evaluable disease outside the radiation port or the site of radiation
                  has documented progression.

                  disqualify a subject).

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL, except in subjects with Gilbert's syndrome.

               -  Cardiac ejection fraction ≥ 45%, no evidence of physiologically significant

               -  No clinically significant pleural effusion

                  underlying leukemia/lymphoma.

         11. CNS Status Subjects with CNS involvement are eligible as long as there are no overt
             signs or symptoms that in the evaluation of the investigator would mask or interfere
             with the neurological assessment of toxicity.

          3. History of other malignancy, unless disease free for at least 3 years. At the
             discretion of the Principal Investigator, subjects in remission for 1-2 years prior to
             enrollment may be deemed eligible after considering the nature of other malignancy,
             likelihood of recurrence during one year following CAR therapy, and impact of prior

                  and/or nucleic acid testing.

          6. CNS disorder such as cerebrovascular ischemia/hemorrhage, dementia, cerebellar
             disease, or any autoimmune disease with CNS involvement that in the judgment of the
             investigator may impair the ability to evaluate neurotoxicity.

          7. History of myocardial infarction, cardiac angioplasty or stenting, unstable angina, or
             other clinically significant cardiac disease within 12 months of enrollment.
