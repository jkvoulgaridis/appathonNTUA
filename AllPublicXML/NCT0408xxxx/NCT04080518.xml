  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of Dapagliflozin (FORXIGA) 10mg
      (n=20) versus placebo (n=20) administered orally, daily, in addition to current therapy, on
      the renal concentration mechanism, the mobilization skin and muscle Na+ stores, and the
      mobilization of muscle and liver fat stores in diabetic patients with heart failure New York
      Heart Association (NYHA) classes I and II, in a 4-week randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors improve cardiovascular outcomes with
      unprecedented reductions in cardiovascular mortality, renal disease progression, and heart
      failure hospitalizations, but the underlying mechanisms of these beneficial effects are
      unclear. The investigators hypothesize that the actions are not solely related to Na+
      elimination and volume-related blood pressure reduction. Our previous work has shown that
      increased Na+ excretion leads to profound metabolic changes and energy utilization in the
      body in order to avoid water loss and dehydration. Our hypothesis is that dapagliflozin
      treatment induces high renal Na+ and glucose excretion predisposing to water loss, to which
      the body responds by concentrating the osmolytes into the urine, in an effort to prevent
      dehydration. Increased urea accumulation in the renal medulla, necessary to provide the
      osmotic driving force for water reabsorption, requires increased hepatic urea production,
      which is a costly, energy-intense process. This metabolic response leads to a
      reprioritization of energy metabolism in favour of amino-acid utilization in the liver, and a
      switch in fuel utilization in favour of fatty acids in the skeletal muscle.

    <masking_description>The assignment of consented patients will occur in a blinded fashion using a randomization scheme generated by a statistician who is not part of the study team and has no contact with the study subjects. Randomization assignments will be made in permuted blocks of 4. Once eligibility criteria are met, study participants will be randomly assigned to receive either Dapagliflozin 10mg or matching, identically appearing placebo. Stratified random sampling (by gender) will be performed in order to minimize selection bias. Access to the randomisation code will be controlled and documented. Relevant parties will be blinded to the treatment group assignment.</masking_description>
