  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite knowledge about the effect of preventive measures in lifestyle, smoking,nutrition,
      alcohol and physical activity (SNAP), there is a lack of systematic assessment of the overall
      lifestyle of the patient before surgery and knowledge about how lifestyle interventions can
      be organized in connection with cancer surgery. The intention with prehabilitation is to
      optimize the individual's risk factors and personal burdens that can affect the clinical and
      patient reported outcomes after surgery. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of
      intensive SNAP interventions compared to treatment as usual (TAU) in ptt undergoing
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy before radical cystectomy on postoperative complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multicenter randomised controlled trial involving 110 bladder cancer patients
      screened positive for at least 1 SNAP factor and undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy before
      radical cystectomy.

      Patients allocated to the intervention group will receive five counselling sessions in 6
      weeks including an integrated prehabilitation program covering the time period until surgery
      tailored to meet the individual patient's need for risk reduction. Patients are ensured that
      they are free to access support to lifestyle changes in the community.

    <description>Intervention: Patients allocated to the intervention group receive min. five counselling sessions in 6 weeks as an integrated prehabilitation program tailored to meet the individual patient's need for risk reduction at surgery. It is introduced via the surgical 'Engage in the process of change'. The smoking and alcohol cessation intervention follows the Gold Standard Programme and patients in the intervention group are introduced to a standardized exercise training programme taking individualized needs into account. Nutritional support is also individualized.</description>
