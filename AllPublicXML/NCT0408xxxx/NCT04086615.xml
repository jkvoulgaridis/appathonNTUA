  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this project is to compare two self-managed treatment regimens for
      PFPS: (1) NMES-Exercise supplemented with high BFR LOP of 80% and (2) NMES Exercise augmented
      with a low percentage of BFR LOP at 20 mmHG (BFR-sham). Each of the two treatment arms will
      perform a fixed exercise protocol singularly and in combination with BFR-NMES, and NMES
      alone. The specific aims of the study are 1) To determine whether self-managed NMES-Exercise
      program supplemented with a high BFR of 80% LOP (limb occlusion pressure) is significantly
      more efficacious than NMES-Exercise with low BFR LOP set at 20 mmHG (sham) in improving
      muscle strength of the lower extremity, daily physical activity and mobility; and 2) To
      determine whether NMES-Exercise with high LOP BFR therapy improves QOL and PFPS symptoms
      significantly more than NMES-Exercise with low LOP BFR.

      The long-term goal is to identify effective self-managed therapies for military members that
      will return them to duty as quickly as possible. The overall objective of this project is to
      compare two self-managed treatment regimens for PFPS: (1) NMES-Exercise supplemented with
      high BFR LOP of 80% and (2) NMESExercise augmented with a low percentage of BFR LOP at 20
      mmHG (BFR-sham). Each of the two treatment arms will perform a fixed exercise protocol
      singularly and in combination with BFR-NMES, and NMES alone.

      The rationale for this study is that by limiting blood flow to an exercising limb using both
      active and passive exercise is expected to significantly improve lower extremity muscle
      strength, mobility, quality of life (QOL) and pain. The central hypothesis is that the
      combination of NMES/exercise of the injured leg supplemented with BFR set at 80% LOP will
      show significantly greater improvements in muscle strength, mobility, pain, daily activity
      and QOL than the NMES-Exercise with BFR set at a very low percentage of LOP at 20 mmHG. To
      test this hypothesis, the investigators will address the following specific aims:

      a1. To determine whether self-managed NMES-Exercise program supplemented with a high BFR of
      80% LOP (limb occlusion pressure) is significantly more efficacious than NMES-Exercise with
      low BFR LOP set at 20 mmHG (sham) in improving muscle strength of the lower extremity, daily
      physical activity and mobility. Muscle strength will be measured by isometric peak torque of
      the left and right knee and hip posterolateral stabilizers; physical activity will be
      measured by steps walked and energy (kcal) expenditure/day; and mobility by time to complete
      a stair climb, step down test, distance walked in 6 minutes, and number of times to complete
      the chair rise.

      a2. To determine whether NMES-Exercise with high LOP BFR therapy improves QOL and PFPS
      symptoms significantly more than NMES-Exercise with low LOP BFR. QOL will be measured by the
      SF-12 Health Survey and the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale.
      Symptoms of PFPS will be quantified by the Anterior Knee Pain Scale and IKDC subjective knee
      form.

      The investigators expect to demonstrate that these combined multimodality therapies of a
      self-managed NMES-Exercise program supplemented with high (80%) LOP BFR-NMES-Exercise is more
      efficacious than a low percentage of LOP BFR-NMES-Exercise (sham). Positive results will
      translate into therapy options for PFPS that can be used by health care providers to
      accelerate rehabilitation, speed return to world-wide duty status, decrease symptoms, and
      lower medical costs. Moreover, these approaches are safe, easy to use and
      non-pharmacological.

    <intervention_model_description>84 (anticipated) participants will be assigned to one of two parallel groups. Sample size was determined using 1) an alpha level of 0.05 and power of 0.80; 2) review of PFPS literature and data from pilot work; and 3) calculation of effect sizes for key variables from previous studies that addressed the Specific Aims.
For the primary outcome variable of strength, the sample size calculated was 35 subjects per groups (70 total subjects) with an effect size of 0.52. For the outcomes measures of function, mobility and pain, assuming that standard errors will be similar to those observed in our previous work, the sample size of 35 per group is sufficient to detect the expected mean changes. To account for dropouts, the investigators inflated the sample size by 20%, for a total of 42 subjects per group and a total sample size of 84.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in Lower Extremity Muscle Strength- Extension</measure>
    <time_frame>Time Frame: 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Strength of knee extension muscle groups will be measured using the Nicholas Manual Muscle Tester (NMMT). The participant will be positioned with a small towel roll placed distally to support the femur in 90-degree hip flexion. The participant's knee will be placed in 70º knee flexion using a goniometer. The distance from the tibial tuberosity (TT) to the superior aspect of the medial malleolus will be measured.
For knee extension, the first measurement will be taken using standard NMMT protocol (0.6 X the distance from the tibial tuberosity to the superior aspect of the medial malleolus). Participants will perform three maximal efforts holding contractions for 4 seconds, separated by 30-sec rest; the highest value of the will be accepted (kg).</description>

    <measure>Change in Mobility- Timed Stair Climb Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Time Frame: 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Tests the activity of stair climbing. The test will begin with participants ascending up four steps (6-inch rise, 11.5-inch run) to a 30-inch square platform, and then descending to the bottom of the stairs. Participants will climb the stairs at a self-selected pace using the handrails if necessary.
Each participant will complete two complete rounds, if possible, and the two times will be averaged to produce one score.</description>

    <measure>Change in Mobility- Forward Step-Down Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Time Frame: 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a specific function test for PFPS, putting weight bearing stress during a movement that mimics stair descent. The test is performed from a 20 cm (8 inch) high platform. The participant steps forward and down toward the floor from a single-leg stance with a straight knee (hands on hips). The knee of the stance leg bends until the opposite foot lightly touches the floor with the heel and then returns to full knee extension. The heel touching the floor is not to be used to accelerate back onto the platform. This counts as one repetition; the number of repetitions performed in 30 seconds is recorded. Both legs are tested separately.</description>

    <measure>Change in Symptoms of PFPS- Knee pain limiting actiivty (AKPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time Frame: 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain associated with activity limitations will be measured by the Kujala Anterior Knee Pain Scale, a 13-item knee specific self-report questionnaire. Scores range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Symptoms of PFPS- Pain at rest and post-activity (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time Frame: 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of pain will be used to assess pain at rest and after activity. Participants will complete this scale following the stair climb, step down test, 6-minute walk and the chair rise test. This VAS pain subscale is a 100-mm horizontal line index with descriptive anchors at each end. At the far left (0.0cm) is &quot;no pain&quot; and at the far right (10 cm) is &quot;worst possible pain&quot;. The participant is instructed to place a vertical line at some point between the anchors to describe his/her level of pain. The VAS pain scale shows high correlations with acute pain levels.</description>

    <measure>Change in Symptoms of PFPS- Knee Injury and Disability (IKDC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time Frame: 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Knee Injury and disability will be measured by the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee form, a well standardized outcomes questionnaire that is knee-specific and assesses patients with various knee disorders. The 18-item instrument assesses symptoms, function and level of sports participation for those with an injured knee.</description>

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life- Overall: The Short Form Health Survey Version 2.0 (SF-12v2) Health Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Time Frame: 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form Health Survey Version 2.0 (SF-12v2) Health Survey will be used to determine each participant's overall health-related quality of life. The SF12v2 has two summary scores for physical (PCS) and mental health (MCS). Raw scores for each subscale are computed using the scores of 12 questions ranging from 0-100. Zero score indicates the lowest level and 100 indicates the highest level of health. The PCS and MCS subscales are norm-based for different age groups because of the variance in PCS and MCS scores over the life span.</description>
