    <description>Acute variceal bleed (AVB) - will be estimated by history of hematemesis, melena, and AVB will be confirm by endoscopy if these clinical history present. It can be oesophageal variceal or gastric variceal bleed as per sarin's classification, which is confirmed and managed with endoscopy procedure. AVB is defined as a bleed in a known or suspected case of PHT, with the presence of hematemesis within 24 h of presentation, and/or ongoing melena, with last melanic stool within last 24 h. The time frame for the AVB episode is 48 h. AVB is further classified as active or inactive at the time of endoscopy. BRTO/PARTO is technically feasible, safe, and effective for gastric variceal haemorrhage in patients with portal hypertension.</description>
