  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biologics, such as ixekizumab, are currently the most effective treatment option for patients
      with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. But they are costly for health care systems and prescribed
      according to a 'one dose fits all' dosing regimen, leading to potential over- and
      undertreatment. Within this study the investigators aim to investigate the predictive value
      of early serum trough levels of ixekizumab and determine the therapeutic window of ixekizumab
      in psoriasis patients.

      Patients will be included after siging informed consent. After inclusion, patients will
      continue on standard dosing schedule of ixekizumab (i.e. one loading dose of 2 subcutaneous
      injections (160 mg) at week 0, followed by one subcutaneous injection (80 mg) every 2 weeks
      for 12 weeks, and then one subcutaneous injections (80 mg) every 4 weeks). During each study
      visit, blood will be taken in order to quantify Ctroughs and/or anti-drug antibodies towards
      ixekizumab. In addition, the Psoriasis Severity and Area Index (PASI) and the Investigator's
      Global Assessment (IGA) score will be evaluated by a physician. Patients complete the
      Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and European quality of life EQ-5D instrument at each
      visit.

    <measure>DLQI</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 until week 52 of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index) (range 0-30) is a dermatology specific quality of life (QoL) instrument designed to assess the impact of the disease on participant's QoL. It is a ten item questionnaire that, in addition to evaluated overall QoL, can be used to assess six different aspects that may affect QoL: 1) symptoms and feelings, 2) daily activities, 3) leasure, 4) work or school performances, 5) personal relationships, and 6) treatment.
The scoring of each question is as follows:
Very much - scored 3; A lot - scored 2; A little - scored 1; Not at all - scored 0; Not relevant - scored 0; Question 7, 'prevented work or studying' - scored 3. The DLQI is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.</description>

    <measure>EQ5D5L</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 until week 52 of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The 5-level EQ-5D version (EQ-5D-5L) was introduced by the EuroQol Group in 2009 to improve the instrument's sensitivity and to reduce ceiling effects.
The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems (level 1), slight problems (level 2), moderate problems (level 3), severe problems (level 4) and extreme problems (level 5). The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state, which is the outcome result. There is no minimum or maximum score since the the 5 digit-number is a non-numeric variable.</description>

    <measure>EQ VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 until week 52 of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) (range 0-10) records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the patient's own judgement. Minimum score is 0%, max. score is 100%. Lower values mean 'worse health the patient can imagine', higher values mean 'better health the patient can imagine'.</description>
