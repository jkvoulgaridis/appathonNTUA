      The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of treatment with evolocumab on the risk for
      cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or
      coronary revascularization, whichever occurs first, in patients with high risk coronary
      artery disease.
