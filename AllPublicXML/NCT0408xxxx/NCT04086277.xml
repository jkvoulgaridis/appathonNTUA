      The objective of the study was to evaluate the intervention of intrapartum continuous support
      by a professional nurse with a university degree to reduce the nulliparous, term, singleton,
      vertex (NTSV) cesarean birth rate, in women pregnant less than 40 years in the HGZ No. 4 of
      the Guanajuato delegation of the Mexican Institute of Social Security, Mexico

      Continuous intrapartum support is a strategy used to decrease the cesarean section rate,
      where multiple factors influence its effectiveness (start and duration of support,
      professional training of support staff, and others.). The objective of the study was to
      decrease the rate of deliveries by cesarean, through continuous intrapartum support during
      the active phase until birth, by a professional nurse with a university degree, the support
      was based on three basic aspects: 1) emotional support, 2) physical support and comfort
      measures and 3) information and counseling, for which a quasi-experimental study was
      conducted, with a study population of 115 women in labour (nulliparous, full-term, single
      product, vertex position) and under 40 years, a group control was formed (n = 55) who
      received routine maternal care and a study group (n = 60) who received continuous intrapartum
      support.
