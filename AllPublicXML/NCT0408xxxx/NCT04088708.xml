  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this project is to determine the effects of exercise on the gut
      microbiome in breast cancer survivors and determine how these changes may relate to
      psychosocial symptoms such as fatigue.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer survivors are at increased risk of gut bacteria communities that can negatively impact
      health and energy level and it is possible that exercise can cause healthy changes in these
      communities. Through careful design, this study will use a controlled-feeding diet and 10
      weeks of exercise training to determine exercise effects on the number, distribution, and
      types of bacteria in the gut of breast cancer survivors. These changes will then be linked to
      fatigue and physiologic effects of exercise to determine how the information can be used to
      enhance exercise benefits and identify new treatment strategies leveraging changes in gut
      bacteria communities.

    <description>Each session will last 20 to 60 minutes depending on the stage of progression (shorter duration in the first few weeks). Sessions will occur on nonconsecutive days of the week. Moderate-intensity, continuous aerobic exercise will be used to target large muscle groups (e.g., legs) with the principal goal of increasing cardiorespiratory fitness. Exercise intensity will be gradually increased. To mitigate stagnation and support continued improvement of cardiorespiratory fitness, high-intensity interval exercise will be added in later weeks of the intervention.</description>

    <description>The flexibility/toning control condition will be delivered using the same frequency as the aerobic condition (i.e., 3 times per week) and use light resistance bands of least difficulty. The flexibility/toning sessions will last about 40 minutes, be led by trained exercise specialists. Flexibility/toning activities will target the head/neck, shoulder, elbow/forearm, hand/wrist, trunk/hip, and ankle/foot. The progression of activities over the 10-week period will involve performing additional exercises and sets along with using progressively thicker elastic resistance bands (i.e., Thera-bands) that provide minimal resistance.</description>
