  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic abdominal pain is highly prevalent in patients undergoing abdominal surgery.
      Adhesions are reported to be one of the most common causes of chronic pain after surgery.
      There is little epidemiological data on the natural course and risk factors of pain. In this
      study the investigators will assess risk factors for chronic pain and natural course by
      tracking pain scores through an app in a cohort of 1,500 patients undergoing abdominal
      surgery. In part two of the study patients with persistent abdominal pain at 12 months, that
      meet IASP criteria for chronic pain will have clinical investigations to determine the cause
      of their pain. This investigation includes cineMRI for diagnosis and mapping of adhesions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Chronic abdominal and pelvic pain are highly prevalent in among patients who had
      abdominal surgery in history. An estimate of 11-20% of all patients undergoing different
      kinds of abdominal surgery will develop chronic abdominal pain. Adhesions (a form of internal
      scar tissue) are the most common pathology found in patients undergoing diagnostic
      laparoscopy for pain. Other factors that might be associated with chronic post-operative pain
      are anxiety, depression, and female sex. Little is known about the natural course of pain
      after abdominal surgery, risk factors for developing chronic pain, and the mechanisms causing
      pain in patients with adhesions. In this longitudinal study we will prospectively study the
      natural course of pain through repeated measurements, and predictive factors for
      chronification of pain after different types of abdominal surgery.

      Objective: In Phase 1 we will study the natural course of pain following abdominal surgery.
      Primary objective for phase 1 is to assess risk factors for chronic pain at 12 months after
      surgery; where chronic pain is defined as daily continues or intermittent pain with maximal
      pain scores of 4 or higher during more than 3 months in accordance to IASP criteria. As a
      pivotal secondary outcome we will describe and model the duration (days) of moderate (worst
      pain score 4 to 6) to severe pain (worst pain score 7 or higher), and assess factors that
      impact the chance in painscore using mixed models. In phase two we will assess the impact of
      adhesions on chronic pain. Primary objective for phase two is to compare incidence and extent
      of adhesions on cineMRI between patients who developed chronic pain and patients who did not
      develop chronic pain at 12 months after surgery.

      Study design: This is prospective cohort study, including 1,500 patients scheduled for
      elective abdominal surgery. In phase one, patients are asked to fill a comprehensive
      questionnaire, including quality of life assessment and a comprehensive assessment of
      potential predictive factors for chronic pain prior to surgery. Post-operatively pain
      symptoms will be monitored using short daily and weekly questionnaires taken by m-health and
      e-health techniques to study natural course of pain. A comprehensive assessment of pain,
      quality of life, and medical consumption will be taken at 3,6, and 12 months
      post-operatively.

      In phase two of the study patients who developed chronic pain will be invited for mapping of
      adhesions using cineMRI. Results of mapping of adhesions using cineMRI in patients with
      chronic abdominal pain will be compared to mapping of adhesions in 100 patients matched for
      type of surgery and risk factors who did not develop chronic pain.

      Study population: 1,500 patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery from different
      surgical subspecialties (e.g. colorectal, upper-GI, and gynaecological surgery), aged 18
      years or older.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Main study outcome for phase one are risk factors for
      development of chronic pain at 12 months post-operative. Pivotal secondary outcomes include
      description of the median duration (days) of moderate to severe abdominal pain following
      abdominal surgery, and modelling of factors that impact change in abdominal pain after
      surgery. Other secondary outcomes include health-related quality of life, healthcare
      utilization, and return to daily activity or work.

      Main outcomes for phase two is the percentage of patients with adhesions on cineMRI as
      compared between patients with and without chronic pain. Secondary outcomes relate to the
      appearance of adhesions on cineMRI, and included extent and the loss of shear.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: In phase one of this cohort study patients will be asked to fill repeated
      questionnaires on pain and potential risk factors for chronic pain. The intake questionnaire
      prior to surgery will take approximately 60 minutes to fill. Post-operatively we will send
      short questionnaires that take 2-5 minutes to fill. These questionnaires will be send daily
      during the first 60 days after surgery and weekly afterwards. A more comprehensive
      questionnaire on abdominal pain and complaints that takes 45 minutes to complete will be send
      at 3,6, and 12 months post-operative. There are no risks related to participation in this
      study, nor are there direct benefits.

      Patients participating in part two of this cohort will undergo cineMRI to evaluate if pain
      symptoms might relate to adhesions form previous surgery. The MRI will take approximately 20
      minutes to perform. MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique without health risks. However,
      there is a risk of incidental findings that do not relate to the subject of this study
      (adhesion formation). Patients who do not want to be informed about incidental findings will
      be excluded from phase two. In a subset female patients who had pelvic surgery and resection
      of the uterus an additional transvaginal ultrasound will be made. Like MRI, this is a
      non-invasive diagnostic test without health risks. There is some additional inconvenience by
      the use of a transvaginal ultrasound prove. The test will take approximately 15 min.

        Patients with undergoing different types of abdominal surgery (laparotomy and laparoscopy).
        Included are all patients undergoing elective surgery. Patients undergoing laparoscopic
        cholecystectomy and caesarean section are excluded because both are very frequent
        procedures with a low risk of chronic post-operative pain and low risk of adhesions. These
        procedure could therefore significantly impact the power of the study. Although patients
        after laparoscopic cholecystectomy frequently report pain, these pain symptoms are often
        attributable to persistence of pre-existing pain. There are known difficulties in
        differential diagnosis of symptomatic cholelithiasis and dyspepsia, that might interfere
        with indication for cholecystectomy
