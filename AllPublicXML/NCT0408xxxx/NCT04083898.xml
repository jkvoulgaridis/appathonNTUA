  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Isatuximab targets and kills CD38-positive myeloma cells in manner similar to rituximab's
      mechanism of action on CD20-positive lymphoma cells. Based on the synergy between rituximab
      and bendamustine, as well as the established clinical efficacy of bendamustine and isatuximab
      as single agents for multiple myeloma, the logical next step is to combine isatuximab with
      bendamustine and prednisone. Due to lack of effective therapies in refractory multiple
      myeloma, herein the investigators propose studying this novel combination in this population,
      in order to address a significant unmet need. The aim of the investigators is to first
      determine the maximal tolerated dose of the combination in participants with
      relapsed/refractory myeloma and then to establish the efficacy of this novel combination.

    <time_frame>Completion of first cycle of treatment for all participants enrolled in Phase I portion (estimated to be 9 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at which 2 participants of a cohort (of 2 to 6 participants) experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first cycle of treatment. Dose escalation will proceed until the MTD has been reached or until the maximum dose of each drug is tested (Dose Level 3). If no more than 1 DLT is observed at dose levels 1, 2 and 3, level 3 will be declared the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and the MTD will remain undefined.</description>

Any patient who expires, withdraws, or is lost to follow-up prior to disease progression or relapse will be censored at last follow-up. Patients who are removed from study therapy prior to progression or relapse will be censored at the time of initiation of subsequent anti-myeloma treatment.</description>
