               4. No contraception is required for a vasectomized male, provided his vasectomy was
                  performed 6 months or more prior to screening and his female partner is not
                  pregnant, and for a male participant with a female partner of non-childbearing
                  potential.

               5. A male who was vasectomized less than 6 months prior to screening must follow the
