  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is increasing sharply around the world and obesity
      and sedentary lifestyles are driving the epidemic. Obesity is often, but not always present
      in patients with T2DM. The primary aim of this study is to understand the impact of the ratio
      of lean body mass (metabolically active skeletal muscle) to adipose tissue mass on the
      severity of insulin resistance and pancreatic beta cell dysfunction in non-obese and obese
      Qatar residents with T2DM. An exercise programme aimed to increase lean mass and aerobic
      capacity will be initiated for a period 10 weeks in non-obese and obese early onset diabetics
      who are residents of Qatar. The effect of the exercise programme on total body fat, regional
      fat distribution and intramuscular and intrahepatic fat content using magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) in these groups of diabetics will be assessed and related to total body insulin
      sensitivity and β-cell function as measured with the gold standard methods: the euglycemic
      clamp technique and arginine stimulation. Genetic approaches including candidate gene testing
      and non-targeted miRNA expression profiling and metabolomics are employed. Physical fitness
      pre- and post-intervention will also be assessed. The impact of the exercise programme on
      conventional inflammatory markers, the phenotype of immune cells, metabolic hormones, and
      markers of oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress and heat shock response (Hsp-72,
      Hsp -40/DNAJB3 and Hsp-25) are studied in relation to metabolic changes. Through this study,
      the contributions of fitness, fatness and exercise training on insulin resistance and beta
      cell function will be elucidated in Qatari residents with T2DM.
