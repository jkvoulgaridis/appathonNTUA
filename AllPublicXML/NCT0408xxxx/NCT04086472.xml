  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine if a single intravenous (IV) dose of
      MK-1654 when administered at 1 of 4 dose levels results in a reduction in viral load after
      intranasal inoculation (with RSV A Memphis 37b) compared to IV placebo. It is hypothesized
      that at least 1 of the 4 dose levels of MK-1654 given prior to inoculation will reduce the
      area under the viral load-time curve (VL-AUC) from Day 2 through Day 11 (inclusive) after
      viral inoculation (Study Day 31 through Day 40) compared to placebo.
