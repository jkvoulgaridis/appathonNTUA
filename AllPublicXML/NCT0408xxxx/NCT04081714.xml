      This is a single-center intermediate expanded access program to provide access to the
      investigational product, CNM-Au8, up to twenty participants diagnosed with ALS. Safety,
      pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of CNM-Au8 treatment in ALS participants will be
      evaluated. Visits will occur at Massachusetts General Hospital or via tele-visit.
      Participants will be screened over up to a 4-week period prior to treatment initiation.
      Participants who meet the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusionary criteria may be
      enrolled into the EAP. Per protocol all participants will receive open label oral treatment
      daily up to 24-weeks during Treatment Period 1.

    <description>CNM-Au8 is a dark red/purple-colored liquid formulation consisting of a stable suspension of faceted clean surfaced elemental gold nanocrystals in buffered USP water with a concentration of up to 0.5 mg/mL of gold. The formulation is buffered by sodium bicarbonate present at a concentration of 0.546 mg/mL. There are no other excipients. The drug product is formulated to be taken orally and will be provided in single dose HDPE containers.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Able to understand and give written informed consent.

          2. Male or female participants aged 18 years or greater (inclusive) at the time of ALS
             diagnosis.

          3. Participants whose conditions are defined as &quot;definite ALS&quot; or &quot;probable ALS&quot; or
             &quot;possible ALS&quot; diagnostic criteria by the revised El Escorial Criteria as determined
             by a neurologist specializing in ALS (e.g., the Principal Investigator or
             sub-investigator at the site).

          4. For participants presently taking riluzole or edaravone, stable dosing over the prior
             4-weeks.

          5. Participant is able to daily consume 60 mL of the investigational drug suspension
             without substantial dysphagia, OR can intake the drug through a gastrostomy tube.

          6. In the judgement of the Investigator, the participant's expected survival is greater
             than six-months

          7. Participants who have established care with a neurologist at the specialized ALS
             center involved in the study and will maintain this clinical care throughout the
             duration of the EAP.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participant with a history of any clinically significant or unstable medical condition
             based on the Investigator's judgment that may interfere with assessment of the study
             objectives.

          2. Based on the investigator's judgment, participants who may have difficulty complying
             with the protocol and/or any study procedures.

          3. Participant with clinically significant abnormalities in hematology, blood chemistry,
             ECG, or physical examination not resolved by the Baseline visit which according to
             Investigator can interfere with EAP participation.

          4. Participants with clinically significant hepatic or renal dysfunction or clinical
             laboratory findings that would limit the interpretability of change in liver or kidney
             function, or those with low platelet counts (&lt; 150 x 10^9 per liter) or eosinophilia
             (absolute eosinophil count of â‰¥ 500 eosinophils per microliter) at Screening.

          5. Participants with a prior history of, or positive serological assay for the presence
             of HIV infection, or laboratory evidence of active or chronic infection with hepatitis
             C (HCV) or hepatitis B (HBV). Note, participants who have been vaccinated for HBV and
             have detectable HB antibodies are not excluded unless positive for surface antigen
             (HBsAg).

          6. Participant has participated in any other investigational drug trial (within 4-weeks
             prior to screening or at least five-half lives of the investigational product), and
             thereafter.

          7. Females who are pregnant or nursing or who plan to get pregnant during the course of
             this clinical trial or within 6 months of the end of this trial.

          8. Females of child-bearing potential, or men, who are unwilling or unable to use
             accepted methods of birth control.

          9. History of gold allergy.
