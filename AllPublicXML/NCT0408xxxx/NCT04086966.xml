  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will investigate the use of PSMA-PET/MRI (Positron Emission Tomography/
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging)to guide radiation treatment planning in patients with known or
      suspected locally metastatic prostate cancer at the time of diagnosis. Patients will undergo
      a single PSMA-PET/MRI (or PET/CT (Computed Tomography) in some circumstances) prior to
      initiation of treatment. Following development of a PSMA-PET guided radiation treatment plan,
      therapeutic radiation will be delivered per standard-of-care parameters and assessments of
      feasibility and tolerability will be performed.
