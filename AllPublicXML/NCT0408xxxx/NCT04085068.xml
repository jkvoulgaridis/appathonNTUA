      Something must be done in order to release the tension within the dura mater before any
      lasting correction of the spine can be effected. Each of the cranial nerves is wrapped in a
      sheath of dura mater. As they exit the cranial vault they are described by Gray's Anatomy as
      having a &quot;dural cuff&quot;.

    <description>algometer Algometers are devices that can be used to identify the pressure and/or force eliciting a pressure-pain threshold. It has been noted in pressure-pain threshold studies that the rate at which manual force is applied should be consistent to provide the greatest reliability</description>
