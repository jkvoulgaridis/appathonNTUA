  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No substantial clinical trials of Cannabidiol (CBD) in Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) have yet
      been conducted. This randomized doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial of CBD in adults with
      SAD will evaluate the efficacy, tolerability and safety of CBD oil (CHI-902) in SAD. In
      addition, the effects of treatment with CHI-902 on the Endocannabinoid System (ECS) will be
      assessed by evaluating peripheral endocannabinoids (Arachidonoylethanolamide/Anandamide (AEA)
      and 2-Arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG)) before and after treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate efficacy, therapeutic effects, tolerability and safety of CBD oil in
      adults with SAD through a randomized placebo-controlled study design and will evaluate
      effects of CHI-902 on peripheral endocannabinoids (AEA and 2-AG). This study will be the
      first randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial conducted with CHI-902 in adults with
      SAD.

      The study is designed to:

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of CHI-902 versus placebo in adults with SAD.

        -  Evaluate the tolerability and safety versus placebo of CHI-902 in adults with SAD.

        -  Explore the effects of CHI-902 versus placebo on different biomarkers in subjects with
           SAD.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to endpoint (week 10)</time_frame>
    <description>Quantitative change in LSAS total score from baseline to endpoint (week 10) in subjects receiving active treatment with CHI-902 compared to subjects receiving placebo.
The scale is composed of 24 items divided into 2 subscales, 13 concerning performance anxiety, and 11 pertaining to social situations. The 24 items are first rated on a scale from 0 to 3 on fear felt during the situations, and then the same items are rated regarding avoidance of the situation. Combining the total scores for the Fear and Avoidance sections provides an overall score with a maximum of 144 points. Research supports a cut-off point of 30, in which SAD is unlikely. The next cut-off point is at 60, at which SAD is probable. Scores between 60 and 90 indicate that SAD is very probable. Scores higher than 90 indicate that SAD is highly probable.</description>
