  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4, multicenter study of pegloticase in adult participants with uncontrolled
      gout who have undergone kidney transplantation. Approximately twenty participants will be
      enrolled. Study duration will be approximately 41 weeks.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of pegloticase in kidney
      transplant participants with uncontrolled gout refractory to conventional urate lowering
      therapy.

      This is a multicenter study of pegloticase in adult participants with uncontrolled gout who
      have undergone kidney transplantation.

      The study design will include: 1) a Screening Period, lasting up to 35 days; 2) a 24-week
      treatment period which includes an End-of-Study (Week 24) /Early Termination Visit; 3) a
      safety follow-up phone/email Visit 30 days after the last infusion; and 4) a 3 month
      post-treatment follow up visit.

    <description>Serum uric acid (sUA) responders are defined as participants achieving and maintaining sUA &lt;6 mg/dL for at least 80% of the time during Month 6 (Weeks 20, 21, 22, 23, 24).</description>

    <measure>Mean change in Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) pain score from baseline to Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ pain visual analog scale (VAS) is a measure of pain on a continuous 100 point scale. Participants were asked to indicate how much pain they had in the past week as a result of their illness by placing a vertical mark on a horizontal line from 0 (no pain) to 100 (severe pain). A score from 0 to 3 is obtained based on the location of the participant's mark.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in Heath Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) score from baseline to Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ-DI is a self-reported assessment of how the participant's illness affects their ability to function in their daily life over the past week. The HAQ-DI for a participant is calculated as the mean of the following 8 category scores (range: 0 to 3): Dressing and Grooming, Arising, Eating, Walking, Hygiene, Reach, Grip, and Activities. A lower score demonstrates less disability.</description>
