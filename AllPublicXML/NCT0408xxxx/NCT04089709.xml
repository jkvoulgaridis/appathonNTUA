  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single center randomized control study. Patients &gt;18 years with isolated distal radius
      fractures treated non-operatively will be randomly assigned to either the treatment group
      (exercise of contralateral &quot;well&quot; arm) or control group (standard fracture care and
      rehabilitation).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Distal radius fractures are common injuries, especially in the aging population. Fracture
      healing requires immobilization of the injury, which inevitably leads to muscle atrophy and
      joint stiffness. This strength lost during immobilization can be problematic in patients who
      are already de-conditioned at baseline. Previous research using healthy participants found
      that exercising a non-immobilized, &quot;well&quot;, arm helped attenuate muscle atrophy in the
      contralateral immobilized arm. The study aims to answer the following questions: Does
      exercise of the contralateral arm prevent muscle atrophy and weakness of the injured arm?
      Does exercise of the contralateral arm improve pain scores in the injured arm

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Patients will be randomized using an online randomization tool. Study folders will be placed in order and include the consent form and exercise sheet if randomized to the treatment group. Those randomized to the control group will be given an information sheet on distal radius fractures. Patients will be consented by an unblinded research assistant in order for the treating physician to remain blinded.</masking_description>
