  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The major aim of the proposed study is to develop a gender-sensitive individually tailored
      add-on intervention that focusses on improving individual gender-specific SIRs (subjective
      illness representations) in obese or overweight individuals. We will investigate whether this
      will improve compliance with and long-term success of common weight loss interventions. The
      effectiveness of this intervention in every-day-life with regard to weight-related behavioral
      changes and weight loss will be evaluated within a randomized controlled setting.To enhance
      the applicability of the intervention in every-day-life and its dissemination we plan to
      develop a smart-phone-based intervention.

    <description>The study will be a Smartphone-based interventional trial. To assess the effectiveness of the intervention weight- and eating-related behavior and cognitive and emotional responding as well as body-weight will be assessed using questionnaires and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) for one week at a pre- (T0), post- (T1) and two follow-up-assessments after six (T2) and 12 months (T3).</description>

    <description>According to the SIRs the 12-week intervention will contain exercises from three out of six different key modules (e.g. self-efficacy, impulsivity). The remaining modules will be implemented as mini-modules during the end of the intervention phase. The study will be designed gender-sensitive instead of gender-dichotomous. This means that treatment contents will be individualized based on gender-related SIRs and not biological sex. Participants choose between two different styles of presentation for each module and the contents can be deepened within specific exercises.</description>
