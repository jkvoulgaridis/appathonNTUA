    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase II modular study in patients with prostate cancer which will
      assess safety, efficacy, and tolerability of AZD4635 in combination with other therapeutic
      agents in different treatment arms (referred to as modules).

      Combinations to be studied include: 1) Module 1: AZD4635 plus durvalumab; 2) Module 2:
      AZD4635 plus oleclumab.

      The protocol may be amended to include other combinations.

      This is an open-label Phase II modular study in patients with prostate cancer which will
      assess safety, efficacy, and tolerability of AZD4635 in combination with other therapeutic
      agents in different treatment arm (referred to as modules).

      Combinations to be studied include: 1) Module 1: AZD4635 plus durvalumab; 2) Module 2:
      AZD4635 plus oleclumab. The protocol may be amended to include other combinations.

      All patients will be allocated into a module using an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS).
      Randomization will occur when patients meet eligibility criteria for two or more modules that
      are currently recruiting. If patients only meet the criteria for only one currently
      recruiting module, they will be allocated to that module without randomization taking place.

      The primary objective of the clinical study is to evaluate the efficacy of each combination
      therapy by: 1) assessing the objective response rate (ORR) of patients with measurable
      disease [response will be determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST
      1.1)]; 2) assessing the PSA confirmed response rate of each combination therapy [PSA
      confirmed response rate is defined as the proportion of participants with a reduction in the
      PSA level of ≥50% measured from baseline to the lowest post-baseline PSA result measured
      twice, at least 3 weeks apart by the Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 criteria PCWG3).

      The primary safety endpoints include assessment of adverse events and serious adverse events,
      physical examinations, vital signs, and collection of clinical chemistry/hematology
      parameters

      In Modules 1 and 2 there will be approximately 30 evaluable patients in each module, and at
      least 20 patients will have RECIST measurable disease at baseline. If any of the required
      patients for PSA and/or ORR are not evaluable for PSA response or tumor response,
      respectively, they may be replaced at the sponsor's discretion.

        criteria are met and none of the exclusion criteria apply:

          1. Provision of signed and dated, written informed consent form prior to any mandatory
             study specific procedures, sampling, and analyses.

             as those which are biopsiable (at screening) and amenable to repeat biopsy (after 2
             weeks of AZD4635 therapy), unless clinically contraindicated. The provision of paired
             biopsies will be closely monitored to ensure the desired number of biopsiable patients

          7. Patients with measurable diseases must have at least 1 documented lesion on either a
             bone scan or a computed tomography (CT)/ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan that
             can be followed for response and is suitable for repeated measurement, or patients
             with non-measurable disease must have measurable PSA ≥1.0 ng/mL if the confirmed rise
             is the only indication of progression (excluding small cell carcinoma).

        Patients must be surgically sterile or using an acceptable method of contraception (defined
        as barrier methods in conjunction with spermicides) for the duration of the study (from the
        time they sign ICF) and for 3 months after the last dose of AZD4635 to prevent pregnancy in

                  events such as heart failure, hypokalemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family
                  history of long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years-of-age, or

             received at least one dose of study drug in the present study.
