  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a chronic, incurable condition that affects about 10% of women of
      reproductive age. It is defined as a growth of cells similar to the womb lining outside of
      the womb in the pelvis, and is associated with chronic pelvic pain, excessive period pain,
      pain with sexual intercourse and difficulties in getting pregnant. If the disease is found
      only on the lining of the pelvis it is known as &quot;superficial peritoneal&quot; and is usually
      treated during a laparoscopic surgery by cutting out (excision) or burning off (ablation).
      However, many women do not find improvement in their symptoms after the surgery and can have
      complications from the procedure. The aim of this study is to determine if removal of the
      superficial peritoneal endometriosis improves pain symptoms and quality of life, which method
      of removal (excision or ablation) is more effective or if surgical removal is of no benefit
      to the patients and can potentially cause harm. The investigators plan to recruit up to 90
      women from four NHS hospitals in Scotland over a period of 12 months. Women who are attending
      gynaecology departments with pelvic pain who have not previously had a diagnosis of
      endometriosis via laparoscopy will be approached. Patients will be asked to read an
      information sheet about the trial. Women who consent to the trial will be randomised during
      the surgery, if superficial endometriosis is found, to either having the endometriosis
      removed or not. For this pilot, follow up will be at 3 and 6 months (and obtain permission to
      continue to follow them up at 12 and 24 months should time and finding permit). Patients who
      do not consent to take part in the trial will be asked if the investigators can collect data
      on their demographics and reasons on why they did not wish to take part.
