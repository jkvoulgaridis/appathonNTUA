  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supplementation with Iron and folate have been part of a worldwide strategy targeting anaemia
      and neural tube defects for many years. However, vitamin B12 deficiency has received much
      less attention. High prevalence of deficiency in mothers in the antenatal period and in their
      infants, has been documented. Multiple case series document the neurological consequences of
      severe deficiency and their reversal with B-12. Trials on the subject are limited and those
      available have either used an ineffective dose or for a short duration.

      Therefore, we propose this randomised controlled trial to compare the efficacy of two
      different doses (pharmacological and preventive) of maternal Vitamin B-12 supplementation in
      improving infant B12 deficiency and neurodevelopment. We propose to undertake a multi-centric
      trial in India and Nepal given the high prevalence of deficiency reported from these
      countries and to allow a wider socio-demographic spectrum (Pay-for-service hospital catering
      to middle income populace from India and a free-care public hospital catering to lower income
      groups from Nepal). We will recruit 720 vegetarian, pregnant women from the antenatal clinics
      of the Indian and Nepalese centres at their first antenatal visit. Elderly primi mothers,
      taking B12 supplementation, multiple gestations, chronic medical conditions, anticipating
      moving out of the city, treated for infertility or with known psychological illnesses will be
      excluded. In Stage 1, recruited mothers will be randomized into 2 equal groups (360 each).
      Group 1-Daily 250 μg Vitamin B12 supplementation. Group 2-Daily 50 μg Vitamin B12
      supplementation. B-12 will be started in 1st trimester and continue up to 6 months
      post-partum. In Stage 2, the birth and post-delivery course of the new-born will be monitored
      and documented for any morbidity. At 9 months, the neurodevelopmental, complementary feeding
      and home environment will be assessed and infant B12 status will be determined.

      The two groups will be compared for the primary (neurodevelopment) and secondary outcomes
      (biochemical parameters in mother and infant). The results of this study will be used to
      generate scientific evidence on whether B-12 should be supplemented in vegetarian pregnant
      women with a view to preventing B-12 deficiency and its neurodevelopmental consequences in
      the infant.
