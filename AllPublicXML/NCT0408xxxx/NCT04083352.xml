    <description>Title: 12-Item Grit Scale; Construct: measures trait-level perserverance and passion for long-term goals; the scale for each question includes the following answers to check: Very much like me, mostly like me, somewhat like me, not much like me, not like me at all; Scoring: for questions 1, 4, 6, 9, 10, and 12 the following answers receive the associated number as a score: Very much like me (5), Mostly like me (4), Somewhat like me (3), Not much like me (2), Not like me at all (1). And questions 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 11 receive the following points for the checked answers: Very much like me (1 points), Mostly like me (2 points), Somewhat like me (3 points), Not much like me (4 points), Not like me at all (5 points). Add up all the points and divide by 12. The maximum score on this scale is 5 (extremely gritty) and the lowest score is 1 (not at all gritty).</description>
