    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of intraperitoneal
      administration of heated nanoliposomal Irinotecan in cytoreductive surgery (CRS), which is
      surgery designed to remove as much of the cancer as possible, and heated intraperitoneal
      chemotherapy (HIPEC) procedures.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cytoreductive surgery and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy consists of two parts: the
      first is the surgical removal of all grossly visible deposits of cancer from the abdomen; and
      the second is application of heated chemotherapy in salt water at the same time as the
      removal of the visible cancer. HIPEC is an alternative method of delivering chemotherapy.
      Traditional chemotherapy is injected into a vein, while HIPEC applies chemotherapy drugs
      warmed up by an FDA-approved machine to 108 degrees Fahrenheit directly into the abdomen
      during surgery, making it an option for cancers that originated in or have spread to the
      abdominal cavity. Standard treatment in this manner usually includes Mitomycin C or Cisplatin
      as its chemotherapy agents. In this study, the investigators will use nanoliposomal
      irinotecan as the chemotherapy agent. Irinotecan is FDA approved for the treatment of
      pancreatic cancer.

    <description>The starting dose of nal-IRI will be 70 mg/m2 (cohort level 1) applied for 30 min using a closed HIPEC technique following completion of cytoreductive surgery. If there is dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in cohort level 1, then the dose will be reduced the dosage of the next cohort to 50 mg/m2 (cohort level 0). If there is no DLT, the dose of nal-IRI will be increased to 140 mg/m2, 210 mg/m2 and 280 mg/m2 . If one of the patients experiences DLT, then the cohort will expand to 6 patients and accrual to the current dose level and dose escalation will stop if 2 or more patients experience a DLT at a given dose level.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei or peritoneal carcinomatosis of digestive origin
             or primary peritoneum: appendiceal mucinous tumor or adenocarcinoma (including goblet
             cell cancer and signet ring cell cancer), colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, primary
             peritoneal adenocarcinoma, and mesothelioma, regardless of the number of prior
             treatment lines. Clinical diagnosis is required prior to surgery and pathologic
             diagnosis of peritoneal surface disease must be confirmed from surgical pathology.

          2. Age â‰¥18 years

          4. Patients must be candidates for grossly complete cytoreduction surgery (i.e.,
             completeness of cytoreduction score 0) with life expectancy greater than 3 months

          5. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

          6. Documentation of measurable disease by radiographic peritoneal carcinomatosis index
             (PCI) score and RECIST criteria with preoperative measurements taken within 4 weeks of
             study entry. Presence of measurable disease is required for entry into this study.

          7. Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (barrier or hormonal plus barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation (at least first 6 months). Should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,
             she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          8. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with peritoneal disease considered to be unresectable according to
             preoperative clinical criteria.

          2. Patients who undergo debulking for palliation with persistence of gross residual
             disease (complete of cytoreduction score 3, CC=3) will be ineligible for the study.

          3. Large burden visceral metastases or extra-abdominal metastases.

          4. Patients who have had radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering the study or those
             who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4
             weeks earlier. There is no limit on the number of prior lines of chemotherapy.

          5. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          6. History of allergic reactions to nal-IRI or irinotecan.

        7 Uncontrolled ongoing illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection,
        symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or
        psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

        8 Pregnant or breast-feeding women are excluded from this study.

        9 HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the
        potential for pharmacokinetic interactions. In addition, these patients are at increased
        risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.
