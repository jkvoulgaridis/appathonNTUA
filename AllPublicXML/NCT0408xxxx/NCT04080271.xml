  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bone is a fertile soil for dissemination of metastatic tumor cells which can cause either
      osteolytic ( destructive) or osteoblastic (sclerotic) or mixed lesions in advanced cancer.
      Bone metastases are most common throughout the axial skeleton, this leads to major
      complications referred to as skeletal-related events (SREs), the most frequently are the need
      for radiotherapy and pathological fractures, associated with increase life morbidity and
      decrease overall survival.

      Seeking accurate image modalities provides definite staging, determining the optimal strategy
      of treatment and precise evaluation to decrease the burden of complication.

      PET/CT is superior than 2-dimensional planar providing a better image quality and enables
      quantitation of tumor metabolism. Acquisition and fusion of PET with CT also allow for
      localization and morphologic evaluation of abnormalities, leading to increased specificity.
      The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline recommended PET/CT imaging in
      cancers with high risk skeletal metastases, PET has advantage than CT in diagnosing
      osteolytic lesions; but combining PET with CT, increase the detection of osteoblastic
      lesions.

      CT is recommended to evaluate structural integrity in revealing cortical integrity and the
      extent of structural destruction.
