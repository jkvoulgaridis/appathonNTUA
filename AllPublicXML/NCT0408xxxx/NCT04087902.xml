      This is a prospective longitudinal study to access postoperative 2-year quality of life in
      patients who undergo endonasal endoscopic approach surgeries of the skull base.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single-institution longitudinal study to access quality of life in
      patients who undergo endonasal endoscopic approach surgeries of the skull base. Patients will
      be followed before surgery and up to twenty-four months post-surgery. The primary goal of the
      study is to assess the alterations to patient quality of life following endoscopic endonasal
      surgery using modern sinonasal reconstruction techniques. Secondary goals are to better
      understand the time course of normal healing and patient/procedural risk factors associated
      with poorer quality of life outcomes.

    <description>This study aims to better understand the long-term overall quality of life of patients undergoing endoscopic endonasal surgery using modern sinonasal reconstruction techniques. The PROMIS-29 metric, an overall quality of life metric, will be used to better understand quality of life for patients undergoing this procedure.</description>
