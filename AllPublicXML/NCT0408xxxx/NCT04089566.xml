  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to examine the clinical efficacy of nusinersen
      administered intrathecally at higher doses to participants with spinal muscular atrophy
      (SMA).

      The secondary objectives of the study are to examine the safety and tolerability of
      nusinersen administered intrathecally at higher doses to participants with SMA; to examine
      the effect of nusinersen administered at higher doses compared to the currently approved dose
      in participants with SMA; and to examine the pharmacokinetic(s) (PK) of nusinersen
      [cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma] after intrathecal administration of nusinersen given
      at higher doses to participants with SMA.

An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, in the view of the Investigator, places the participant at immediate risk of death, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in a birth defect.</description>
