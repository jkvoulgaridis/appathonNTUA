  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomised, parallel group, controlled trial, comparing the effects of fruit
      products as to their physiological, microbiologic and metabolomic effects on the gut, as well
      as their effects on the dietary intake and quality in healthy people with constipation.
