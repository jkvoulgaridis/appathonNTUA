    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to understand the links and outcomes of adoption of a
      cleaner cookstove/fuel and exposure to a personal empowerment training on women's health
      outcomes in a Congolese refugee camp in Rwanda, with a focus on gender-based violence (GBV).

      This randomized controlled trial examines the impacts of a phased-in integrated technology
      -behavior change intervention on women's health with a focus on gender-based violence. In a
      population of approximately 1500 Congolese households in Kigeme refugee camp in Rwanda, two
      interventions are randomly deployed in the camp. The first intervention is the Inyenyeri
      cookstove/pellet fuel system, a Tier 4 clean cookstove system; the second intervention is a
      behavior change intervention (referred to as I-ACT, Individual-Agency-Centered Training)
      designed to foster personal agency and empowerment, given to women and, if applicable, their
      male partner. Analyses will be done with interviews on 1500 women (ages 18-45) from these
      households that may have received one, both or none of the interventions, either as the full
      sample or the sub-sample of partnered-only women.

    <intervention_model_description>In this natural experiment, we have two connected randomized intervention deployments. The cookstove/fuel program was randomly rolled out to 750 households in Kigeme camp over a 6-month period (September 2018-March 2019) by Inyenyeri (a Rwandan social business). A second intervention (I-ACT empowerment training) was rolled out by Plan, International (December 2018-March 2019). I-ACT was deployed to women and their male partners (if applicable and available). After March 2019, the cookstove/pellet program was available to the whole camp. Assessments of impacts are done at 6 months after deployment of the interventions. Due to the staggering of the intervention roll-outs, the midline follow-up includes a six-month follow-up of the cookstove deployment and approximately 2-3 months of the I-ACT intervention and includes both partnered and non-partnered women. The 12-month assessment includes a 6-month follow up of the I-ACT empowerment intervention for partnered women only.</intervention_model_description>
