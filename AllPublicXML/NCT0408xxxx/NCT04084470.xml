  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although wheat and gluten containing food products are generally considered to be healthy, a
      large number of individuals in the general population reduces or limits their intake and/or
      replaces wheat by other grains because of possible symptoms. This non-coeliac gluten/wheat
      sensitivity (NCGS/NCWS) is accompanied by a range of (extra-)intestinal complaints soon after
      consuming wheat or gluten, which improve after wheat/gluten withdrawal. Evidence for a
      biological mechanism and for the exact contributing compound is limited. Furthermore, the
      impact of grain type, bread processing and the resulting compositional changes in bread on
      gastrointestinal tolerability in NCGS/NCWS is unclear, especially as consumed part of a
      typical daily human diet.

      The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of well-characterised breads on
      (extra-)intestinal symptoms, gut microbiota composition and activity, metabolite profiles,
      and innate immune function in individuals with NCGS using a three-arm randomized cross-over
      design. Subjects are required to adhere to a gluten-free diet during the trial. The
      investigators hypothesize that grain type and processing will have a different effect on the
      primary outcomes.
