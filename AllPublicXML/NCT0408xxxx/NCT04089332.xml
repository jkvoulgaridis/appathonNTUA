  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The growing population of adolescents with insulin resistance (IR) is predicted to create a
      large public health burden in the next few decades. This study examines the function of brain
      blood vessels and cognitive function, to test if increasing severity of IR in adolescents is
      related to reduced cognitive function and reduced brain blood vessel function. Findings from
      this study may help create treatments to delay or prevent some of the negative effects of IR
      on cognitive and vascular health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One in five American adolescents are obese, and many of these patients exhibit some level of
      insulin resistance (IR). IR is associated with cerebrovascular disease, reduced memory,
      attention, and cognition, but how IR contributes to these in the course of adolescent brain
      development is unclear. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the extent and by which
      IR drives reductions in neurocognitive function and cerebral blood flow (CBF) in adolescents
      at elevated risk for poor brain and cerebrovascular health. The overall goal of this research
      program is to investigate IR-related changes in neurocognitive and vascular function. The
      investigators propose to study adolescents across a spectrum of IR, from healthy to
      pre-diabetic, without confounding effects of age or diabetes— before the negative effects of
      IR can exert their full negative impact. The general hypothesis is that cognitive and
      vascular function is impaired via shift away from insulin-mediated vasodilation in brain
      blood vessels.

It is a visual display using a central arrow flanked by arrows either pointing in the same direction or different that the central arrow. The participant is to indicate the direction of the central arrow when they are all pointing in the same direction. Scoring is algorithm derived and based on accuracy and reaction time, with a total range of possible scores 0-10 with higher scores indicating increased executive attention.</description>
