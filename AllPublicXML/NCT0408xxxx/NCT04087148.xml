    <textblock>
      The congenital adrenal hyperplasias (CAHs) comprise a family of autosomal recessive disorders
      that disrupt adrenal steroidogenesis. Three specific enzyme deficiencies are associated with
      virilization of affected women. The most common form is 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD)
      due to mutations in the 21-hydroxylase (CYP21A2) gene. Other virilizing forms include
      3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD3B2) and 11b-hydroxylase deficiencies associated
      with mutations in the HSD3B2 and 11b-hydroxylase (CYP11B1) genes, respectively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been reported that approximately one child in every 18000 born in Great Britain has
      CAH. In North America, the incidence varies from 1:15000 to 1:16000. The reported rates of
      CAH have been as high as 1:280 among the Yupik people of Alaska and 1:2100 on the French
      island of Réunion in Indian ocean; both of these populations are geographically isolated. The
      reported incidence of CAH in the two Brazilian states that have routinely included CAH in
      their public newborn screening programs is 1:11655 in the South (Santa Catarina) and 1:10325
      in Midwest (Goiás).

      Salt-losing CAH accounts for about three quartes of cases reported and non-salt losing CAH
      for one quarter. Non-classic is more common ;Estimated as 1 in 1000-2000 in white
      populations. It is more frequent in certain ethnic groups, such as the Ashkenazi Jewish
      population. The mild non-classic form is a common cause of hyperandrogenism.

      Treatment of classic 21-OHD consists of replacement doses of gluco- (GC) and
      mineralocorticoids aiming to reduce excess androgen, and to allow adequate linear growth.
      However, several series report that growth in these children is below expectation, as
      compared with both the reference population and the target height (TH).

      The reasons for the inadequate growth and impairment of the final height (FH) are not
      completely understood. A major cause is the difficulty in accomplishing a fine balance
      between inhibition of excess androgen production which accelerates bone maturation and
      adequate GC replacement itself which even at slightly supraphysiologic doses can be
      deleterious to growth.
