  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently there has been an increased interest in limiting intake of carbohydrates (CHO) for
      improving long term health. While healthcare professionals (HCPs) are sometimes reluctant to
      limit the CHO intake due to the lack of information related to safety issues, low CHO diets
      are increasing in popularity amongst both people with and without diabetes. One of these
      diets, the very low CHO high fat diet (VLCHF) raises concern on its impact on the lipid
      profile, liver, response to glucagon, and insulin dose adjustments when adopting it in the
      context of type 1 diabetes (T1D). The investigators recently conducted a series of interviews
      with people with diabetes following a VLCHF diet (Brazeau et al. Manuscript in preparation)
      to inquire on their reasons for adopting VLCHF as well as challenges they faced. The main
      reasons to initiate the diet were to limit blood glucose fluctuations and reduce medication.
      An issue that was frequently mentioned during the interviews was the lack of support from
      HCPs which often leads to not discussing it with said HCP. This is an important source of
      concern that can lead to additional safety issues. Our goal is to provide information
      regarding the safety of a VLCHF diet for T1D and the individualized insulin adjustments
      required.

      The investigators aim to evaluate the changes in daily blood glucose fluctuations after 6
      weeks of a VLCHF diet, to monitor the changes in the insulin dosing and to measure impact on
      lipid profiles, response to glucagon, and liver function.

    <description>Participants will be provided with a two-week menu to be consumed 3 times for each intervention, for a total of 6 weeks per intervention. For the Control diet, the diet will provide 50% of energy from CHO, 15% from protein, and 35% from lipids. Menu will be adapted to the participant's food preferences and usual caloric intake by a dietitian. Participants will be asked to limit their alcohol intake in both interventions. During this phase, participants will also have to wear a pedometer and use the Pezio: Achieve the Guidelines! mobile application to help the research assistant track their daily steps remotely.</description>

For the Experimental diet, the diet will provide 10% of energy from CHO, 15% from protein, and 75% from lipids. During the Experimental diet, participants will be provided with a multivitamin to reduce risk of deficiencies due to restrictions on fruits and grain products. Menu will be adapted to the participant's food preferences and usual caloric intake by a dietitian. Participants will be asked to limit their alcohol intake in both interventions.
