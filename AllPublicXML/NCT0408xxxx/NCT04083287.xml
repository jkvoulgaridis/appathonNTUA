  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain is important following arthroscopic shoulder surgery. Postoperative
      effective pain treatment provides early mobilization and shorter hospital stay.Ultrasound
      (US)-guided brachial plexus blocks such as interscalen and supraclavicular block are usually
      performed. Interscalen brachial plexus block (ISCB) is one of the most preferred techniques
      among these.

      The US-guided erector spina plane block (ESPB) is a novel interfacial plan block defined by
      Forero et al. Local anesthetic injection is administrated into the deep fascia of erector
      spinae. ESPB provides thoracic analgesia at T5 level, abdominal analgesia at T7-9 level, and
      lumbar analgesia at T10-12, L3 levels. There are a few case reports about the efficacy of
      ESPB for acute and chronic shoulder pain. However, there are no randomized clinical studies.
      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of the US-guided ESPB and ISCB for
      postoperative analgesia management after arthroscopic shoulder surgery.

      Postoperative pain is an important issue in patients underwent arthroscopic shoulder surgery.
      Pain causes a few problems; discomfortable patients, negative outcomes and longer
      rehabilitation. Postoperative effective pain treatment provides early mobilization and
      shorter hospital stay, thus complications due to hospitalization such as infection and
      thromboembolism may be reduced. Various techniques may be used for postoperative pain
      treatment. Opioids are one of the most preferred drugs among the analgesic agents. Parenteral
      opioids are generally performed for patients after surgery. However opioids have undesirable
      adverse events such as nausea, vomiting, itching, sedation and respiratory depression
      (opioid-related adverse events).

      Various methods may be performed to reduce the use of systemic opioids and for effective pain
      treatment following arthroscopic shoulder surgery. Ultrasound (US)-guided brachial plexus
      blocks such as interscalen and supraclavicular block are commonly used. Interscalen brachial
      plexus block (ISCB) is one of the most preferred techniques among these.

      US-guided interfascial plane blocks have been used increasily due to the advantages of
      ultrasound in anesthesia practice. The US-guided erector spina plane block (ESPB) is a novel
      interfacial plan block defined by Forero et al. at 2016. The ESPB contains a local anesthetic
      injection into the deep fascia of erector spinae. This area is away from the pleural and
      neurological structures and thus minimizes the risk of complications due to injury.
      Visualization of sonoanatomy with US is easy, and the spread of local anesthesic agents can
      be easily seen under the erector spinae muscle. Thus, analgesia occurs in several dermatomes
      with cephalad-caudad way. Cadaveric studies have shown that the injection spreads to the
      ventral and dorsal roots of the spinal nerves. ESPB provides thoracic analgesia at T5 level,
      abdominal analgesia at T7-9 level, and lumbar analgesia at T10-12, L3 levels. To the best of
      our knowledge, there have been a few case reports about the efficacy of ESPB for acute and
      chronic shoulder pain. There are no randomized clinical studies, yet.

      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of the US-guided ESPB and ISCB for
      postoperative analgesia management after arthroscopic shoulder surgery. The primary aim is to
      compare perioperative and postoperative opioid consumption and the secondary aim is to
      evaluate postoperative pain scores (VAS), adverse effects related with opioids (allergic
      reaction, nausea, vomiting).

    <description>In group E, ESPB will be performed. US probe will be placed longitudinally 2-3 cm lateral to the T2 transvers process. Erector spinae muscle will be visualized on the hyperechoic transverse process. The block needle will be inserted caudo-cranial direction and then for correction of the needle 5 ml saline will be enjected deep into the erector spina muscle fascia. Following confirmation of the correct position of the needle 30 ml %0.25 bupivacaine will be administered for block.</description>

    <description>In group I, ISCB will be performed with patients in the supin position. US probe will be placed in transverse plane at the level of cricoid cartilage. The prob will be moved laterally when the artery is visualized. The needle will be inserted in a medial-to-lateral direction after the brachial plexus between the scalen muscles is visualized. Then, 5 ml normal saline will be enjected for correction of the needle with in-plane technique. Following confirmation of the correct position of the needle 30 ml %0.25 bupivacaine will be administered for block.</description>
