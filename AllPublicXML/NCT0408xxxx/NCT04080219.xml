  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep-disordered breathing has a prevalence of 30~80% in patients with heart diseases.
      Various studies have revealed a correlation between the incidence and various diseases such
      as heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, and cerebral infarction. Postoperative acute kidney
      injury after heart surgery is one of the major complications with incidence with 40~50%,
      however, there has been no preventive method or treatment yet. Recently, several studies have
      been published that have shown a correlation between sleep-disordered breathing and renal
      impairment. In general, sleep-disordered breathing can be regulated easily with continues
      positive expiratory pressure, which means that early diagnosis and treatment of
      sleep-disordered breathing might help to reduce the incidence of postoperative acute kidney
      injury and improve patients' prognosis.

      In this study, the investigators investigate the impact of sleep-disordered breathing
      (diagnosed by oxygen desaturation index ≥5) on the incidence of postoperative acute kidney
      injury in patients undergoing valvular heart surgery.
