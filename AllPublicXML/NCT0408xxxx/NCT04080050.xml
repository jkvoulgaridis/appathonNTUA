    <textblock>
      This long-term observational study is designed to follow subjects who, during another
      Clinical Study, received gene therapy treatment used to treat their Homozygous Familial
      Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) disease. This study is intended to follow those subjects for up
      to 5 years since they received treatment to look for any long-term safety concerns. There is
      no investigational drug or therapy provided as part of this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) is a rare genetic metabolic disorder
      characterized by absent or severely reduced capacity to catabolize circulating LDL particles
      by the hepatic LDL receptor. As a consequence, HoFH subjects present abnormal total plasma
      cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, resulting in severe atherosclerosis often leading to early onset
      of cardiovascular disease. Early initiation of aggressive treatment for these patients is
      therefore essential. Unfortunately, despite existing therapies, treated LDL-C levels could
      remain well above acceptable levels. Thus, the functional replacement of the defective LDLR
      via AAV-based liver-directed gene therapy, RGX-501, may be a viable approach to treat this
      disease and improve response to current lipid-lowering treatments.

      This is a prospective, observational study to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy
      after a single administration of RGX-501. Eligible participants are those who previously have
      enrolled in a clinical study and received a single intravenous infusion of RGX-501.
