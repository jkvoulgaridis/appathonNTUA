  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study aims to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of a
      micro-randomized acceptance and commitment therapy-based (ACT-based) intervention that is
      delivered to distressed first-generation college students.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The transition to college is associated with a number of changes in health behaviors and
      mental health functioning, with 50% of college students meeting criteria for a psychiatric
      disorder. In particular, first-generation college students may be at particular risk for
      increased stress and mental health difficulties. The development of effective
      psychotherapeutic interventions is essential in providing adequate care to young adults
      during the transitional years of college. Delivery of these interventions via acceptable and
      feasible modalities for this population is also of utmost importance so that utilization and
      engagement are prioritized. Brief interventions have been a point of emphasis in recent years
      from the perspective of patient and provider efficiency, as well as many studies indicating
      effectiveness of brief interventions in creating and sustaining clinical levels of change.

      The current study seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of brief interventions delivered via a
      smartphone app, or &quot;microinterventions&quot;, based in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT).
      ACT is a cognitive-behavioral therapy that seeks to promote psychological flexibility. ACT is
      transdiagnostic, meaning that it is designed to target human suffering, rather than a
      particular psychological or physical disorder. ACT targets experiential avoidance, which is
      the inability or unwillingness to make contact with painful experiences (e.g., thoughts,
      emotions, memories. Avoidance provides short-term relief, but exacerbates the long-term
      experience of the avoided stimulus in terms of intensity and duration. The microintervention
      in this study will consist of one of 84 prompts that aim to target one of 6 processes
      targeted in ACT. For example, one prompt is &quot;Do your current actions align with what matters
      most to you?&quot; Delivery of these prompts (e.g., whether and when to deliver which prompt) is
      randomized to allow for secondary analyses of optimal delivery of the microintervention in
      addition to primary analyses of its effectiveness.

    <intervention_model_description>This study uses a design known as a microrandomized trial. Whereas a multi-arm trial randomizes a subject to an intervention group only once at the start of the study, a microrandomized trial repeatedly randomizes a subject to an intervention group throughout the study. In addition to an overall effect of an intervention on proximal outcomes, a microrandomized trial allows one to determine if the effect is modified by momentary factors (e.g., current mood, day of the week, day in the study).
For the present study, every subject has a equal chance of being assigned to one of two intervention groups at each of 84 time points (2 daily x 42 days). At each time point, the two intervention groups are to either receive a prompt based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) or not receive such a prompt. Regardless of the assigned group, subjects are asked to assess their mood, stress, and activity at every time point prior to assignment to intervention group.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 - day 43</time_frame>
    <description>The feasibility of the microintervention will be assessed by Adherence to prompts (defined as a response to at least 50% completion of prompt items per day). If subjects adhere to prompts over 60% of the days of the intervention period on average, the intervention will be considered feasible. The prompts considered will be the 2 questions from the PHQ-2, the 4 questions from the PSS-4, and the 4 questions from the activity assessment.</description>

    <measure>Safety of ACT micro-intervention: Change in Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months and 6 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The analysis will look at the change in proportion of individuals who meet criteria for minor or major depression on the PHQ-9 between study start (measure taken at baseline assessment) to study end (measure taken at 6-month follow-up assessment).
The Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) is a multipurpose scale for screening, diagnosing, monitoring and measuring the severity of depression. PHQ-9 will reflect the effect of intervention on the severity of depression. The PHQ-9 scores correlates with the depression severity as follows:
5 to 9- Minimal symptoms 10 to 14- Minor depression 15 to 19 Major depression, moderately severe &gt;20 Major depression, severe</description>

    <measure>Effectiveness of the ACT micro-intervention: proximal changes in mood outcomes as a result of intervention as indicated by self-reported activity of participant</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1-43</time_frame>
    <description>The effectiveness of the ACT micro-intervention will be assessed by looking at the responses to the activity assessment in relation to whether or not a participant received a micro-intervention at the prior time-point. The activity questions of interest are as follows:
Since you [woke this morning or last logged your symptoms], how much energy was consumed by trying to get rid of unwanted feelings, thoughts, or other internal experiences (example: suppressing, distracting, avoiding)?
Since you [woke this morning or last logged your symptoms], how much energy was consumed by pursuing your values (example: making choices that align with who you want to be or who/what matters)?
Both questions are answered using a scale of 0-6, where 0 = &quot;none&quot; and 6 = &quot;all of my energy.&quot;</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proximal changes in mood outcomes as a result of intervention: The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1-43</time_frame>
    <description>The effectiveness of the ACT micro-intervention will be assessed by looking at the PSS-4 score in relation to whether or not a participant received a micro-intervention at the prior time-point.
The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4) consists of four questions, each answered using a scale of 0-4. The total PSS-4 score ranges from 0-16. A higher score indicates a higher degree and/or longer duration of perceived stress.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proximal changes in mood outcomes as a result of intervention: Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1-43</time_frame>
    <description>The effectiveness of the ACT micro-intervention will be assessed by looking at PHQ-2 score in relation to whether or not a participant received a micro-intervention at the prior time-point. The PHQ-2 consists of the first two questions of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and asks about the frequency of depressed mood and anhedonia over the past two weeks. Each question is answered on a scale of 0-3 as follows:
0 = Not at all
= Several days
= More than half the days
= Nearly every day
The PHQ-2 score ranges from 0-6, with a score of 0-2 being negative for potential major depressive disorder and a score of 3 or more being positive for potential major depressive disorder.</description>

    <description>At every time-point of the study, participants will complete self-reports of stress, (as measured by the PSS-4) distress (as measured by the PHQ-2), and activity through the mobile app Lorevimo. After completing these assessments, participants will be randomly assigned to either receive one additional ACT-based microintervention question or receive no additional question.
The microintervention will consist of one of 84 prompts that aim to target one of 6 processes targeted in ACT (contacting the present moment, defusion, acceptance, self-as-context, values, and committed action).
The ACT-based questions were developed by the research team as a unique intervention for the current study. They are based upon core themes of acceptance and commitment therapy: engagement, awareness, and openness.</description>

    <description>The mobile intervention in this study consists of two components: 1) self-monitoring and 2) an ACT-based microintervention.
Self-monitoring: twice daily, participants will complete self-reports of distress, depressive symptoms, and activity through the mobile app Lorevimo.
Microintervention: The microintervention will consist of one of 84 prompts that aim to target one of 6 processes targeted in ACT (contacting the present moment, defusion, acceptance, self-as-context, values, and committed action). At each time-point, participants have a 50% chance of receiving a microintervention question along with the daily self-monitoring assessments.</description>
