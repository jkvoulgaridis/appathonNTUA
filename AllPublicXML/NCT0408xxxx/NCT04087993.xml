  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with IDA and for whom fast replenishment of iron stores is necessary, e.g. if its
      not appropriated to postpone surgery, will be identified within 28 to 42 days before surgery.
      Patients will be randomised to receive either Polyglucoferron intravenously (i.v.), Ferric
      Carboxymaltose i.v. or oral iron substitution with Ferrous sulfate.

      Randomised, active-controlled, open-labelled, parallel group, multicentre study to
      demonstrate superiority of Polyglucoferron i.v. compared to oral iron substitution for the
      treatment of iron deficient anaemic patients who need fast replenishment of iron stores as
      judged by the treating physician, e.g. if it is not appropriate to postpone surgery, before
      elective non-cardiac surgery and superiority of Polyglucoferron i.v. vs Ferric Carboxymaltose
      in short term safety monitoring.
