  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study should determine if performing the less uncomfortable part of the exam (the perianal
      exam) results in less recalled discomfort if performed last vs. if performed first.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Performance of the perianal examination at the end of the high resolution anoscopy (HRA)
      procedure will lead to patients reporting less discomfort directly following the procedure.
      The study team hypothesizes at least a 10% decrease in subsequently rated pain scores in the
      group where the perianal exam is performed last compared to the group where it is performed
      first.

    <intervention_name>high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) with biopsy</intervention_name>
    <description>The HRA exam involves insertion of a plastic anoscope 4-6 cm into the anal canal, with use of 5% acetic acid and Lugol's iodine to highlight abnormal lesions for biopsy. The entire squamocolumnar junction is visualized during the exam, which lasts between 5 and 20 minutes.</description>
