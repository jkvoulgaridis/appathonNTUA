  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This interventional multicenter dose-optimization Phase IV PASS conducted in Europe and the
      USA evaluates the comparative long-term safety and efficacy of SPD503 in children and
      adolescents aged 6 to 17 years diagnosed with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
      for whom stimulants are not suitable, not tolerated, or shown to be ineffective.

      The study will be conducted in two parts: Study Part A (randomized, double-blinded,
      parallel-group, placebo- and active comparator-controlled, 3-treatment arm safety and
      efficacy evaluation of SPD503) and Study Part B (open label SPD503 treatment).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in two parts Part A and Part B. Part A is a double-blinded,
      double-dummy, placebo-controlled study with an atomoxetine arm as an active reference to
      SPD503. Eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio among SPD503, atomoxetine,
      and placebo treatment arms for the first 18 weeks of double-blinded treatment. At the end of
      the first 18 weeks, participants in the placebo treatment arm will rollover to Part B of the
      study directly for an additional 52 weeks of open-label SPD503 treatment. Participants in the
      SPD503 and atomoxetine treatment arms will continue in Part A of the study for the remainder
      of the 52 weeks. At the end of 52 weeks of double-blinded treatment and evaluation in Part A.
      Participants in the SPD503 and atomoxetine treatment arms will rollover into Part B of the
      study for an additional 1 year of open-label SPD503 treatment.

      26 JUNE 2020: The temporary enrollment stop of new patients into this study due to the
      COVID-19 pandemic has been lifted in one or more countries/sites, and the study is now again
      enrolling new patients. However, some countries/sites may still have paused the enrollment of
      new patients due to the pandemic.

      20 APRIL 2020: Enrollment of new patients into this study has been paused due to the COVID-19
      situation. The duration of this pause is dependent on the leveling and control of the
      COVID-19 pandemic.

The PDSS is a self-reported assessment of daytime sleepiness in children aged 11 to 15 years. PDSS questionnaire was designed to be easy to administer, score, and interpret. Sleepiness-related questions are based on previous research of situations that can be sensitive to sleep loss in this age group. The 8 questions are scored on Likert-scale from 0 to 4 (never=0; seldom=1; sometimes=2; frequently=3; always=4). The total score on the PDSS can range from 0 (never sleepy) to 32 (always sleepy).

    <description>The ADHD-RS-5 (DuPaul et al., 2016) is used widely by mental health, educational, and medical practitioners in screening, diagnosis, and treatment evaluation to determine the frequency and severity of ADHD symptoms and impairments in children and adolescents. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms is measured by the investigator-administered ADHD Rating Scale-5 (ADHD-RS-5) total score and hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattentiveness symptoms as subscale scores. The ADHD-RS-5 is based on the diagnostic criteria for ADHD as described in the DSM-5 and consists of 2 symptom subscales, inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity, each with 9 items and a total scale of 18 items. Each item in the subscale is scored with a value ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms). The total score can range from 0 to 54. ADHD-RS-5 Total Score and Subscales wiil be assessed at specified time points in both Part A and Part B.</description>

    <description>Global clinical measurement of ADHD improvement as measured by Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) using the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) to establish baseline. The CGI scale will be used to evaluate the severity of mental illness over time. The CGI-S will be administered to assess the severity of mental illness at baseline. The CGI-S is scored on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill participants). The CGI-I is also scored on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). CGI-I will be measured at specified time points in both Part A and Part B.</description>

             participant awakens.

          -  Participant has supine and standing blood pressure (BP) measurements less than the
             95th percentile for age, sex, and height at both screening (Visit 1A) and baseline

             medications (i.e., antihistamines).

          -  Participant has a history of a seizure disorder (except for a single childhood febrile
             seizure episode that occurred before the age of 3 years)

          -  Participant is well-controlled on his/her current ADHD medication with acceptable
             tolerability, and the parent/treating physician does not object to the current
