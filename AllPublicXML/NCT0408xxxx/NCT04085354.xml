  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a single-blind placebo-controlled clinical study, it will be carried out on 120 patients
      with PE.

      All patients will be randomized equally divided into four groups (30 patients each).

      Group 1 was given placebo in form oral multivitamin tablet 1 h before intercourse.

      Group 2 was given on-demand 30 mg dapoxetine 1-2 h before intercourse. Group 3 was given
      on-demand 30 mg dapoxetine 1-2 h before intercourse and daily oral supplementation of 0.5 mg
      folic acid.

      Group 4 was given on-demand 30 mg dapoxetine 1-2 h before intercourse and daily oral
      supplementation of 0.5 mg vitamin B12
