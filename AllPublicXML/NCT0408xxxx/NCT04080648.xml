  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biologic such as guselkumab are currently the most effective treatment option for patients
      with moderate to severe psoriasis. But they are costly for healthcare systems and still
      described according to a 'one dose fits all' dosing regimen, leading to potential over- and
      undertreatment. In this study we aim to investigate the predictive value of early serum
      trough levels of guselkumab and determine the therapeutic window of guselkumab in psoriasis
      patients.

      Patients will be included after signing informed consent. After inclusion, patients will
      continue on standard dosing schedule of guselkumab (i.e. one loading dose (100 mg) at week 0
      and week 4 and followed by subcutaenously injections every 8 weeks). During each study visit
      blood will be taken in order to quantify Ctroughs and/or anti-drug antibodies towards
      guselkumab. In addition, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and Investigator's Global
      Assessment (IGA) score will be evaluated by a physician. Patients complete the Dermatology
      Life Quality Index (DLQI) and European quality of life EQ-5D instrument at each visit.

    <measure>DLQI</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 until week 52 of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index) (range 0-30) is a dermatology specific quality of life (QoL) instrument designed to assess the impact of the disease on participant's QoL. It is a ten item questionnaire that, in addition to evaluated overall QoL, can be used to assess six different aspects that may affect QoL: 1) symptoms and feelings, 2) daily activities, 3) leasure, 4) work or school performances, 5) personal relationships, and 6) treatment.
The scoring of each question is as follows:
Very much - scored 3; A lot - scored 2; A little - scored 1; Not at all - scored 0; Not relevant - scored 0; Question 7, 'prevented work or studying' - scored 3. The DLQI is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.</description>

    <measure>EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 until week 52 of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.</description>

    <measure>EQ VAS</measure>

    <description>The EQ VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) (range 0-10) records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the patient's own judgement.</description>
