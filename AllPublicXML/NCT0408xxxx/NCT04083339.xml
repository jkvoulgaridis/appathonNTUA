  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, 2-part study to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of AT-001 in adult patients (N=675) with Diabetic Cardiomyopathy at high risk of
      progression to overt heart failure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of two consecutive parts: Part A and Part B. Part A will evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of two doses of AT-001 vs placebo. The primary objective of Part A is to
      demonstrate that AT-001 improves or prevents the decline of functional capacity in patients
      with Diabetic Cardiomyopathy. Part B is an extension of at least 12 months that will evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of chronic administration of AT-001 vs placebo in the same patients
      who had previously been evaluated in Part A. Assessments in Part B will include safety
      endpoints and exploratory clinical efficacy endpoints, i.e. death and hospitalization due to
      a cardiac event.

    <measure>Peak VO2 during cardio-pulmonary exercise test (CPET)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 months after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>. Changes in Peak VO2 during cardio-pulmonary exercise test CPET performance from baseline to approximately Month 15 (+/-3). A CPET may be repeated at Month 27 (+/-3) if the assessment at Month 15 does not demonstrate a significant difference between placebo and at least one of the 2 doses of AT-001.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in NT-proBNP</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes in NT-proBNP from baseline will be assessed at Month 6 (+/-3), Month 15 (+/-3), and Month 27 (+/-3).</time_frame>
    <description>Levels of BNP and NT-proBNP are elevated in subjects with diabetes without overt HF and these biomarkers have been effectively utilized as a screening instrument to select high-risk asymptomatic diabetic patients who could benefit from therapeutic intervention aimed at preventing cardiac disease.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the modified Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes in KCCQ score from baseline will be assessed at Month 15 (+/-3), and Month 27 (+/-3).</time_frame>
    <description>KCCQ is a valid, reliable and responsive health status measure for patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) that has also been utilized in patients at risk of HF who do not have a diagnosis of HF at baseline. For each KCCQ question, responses are assigned an ordinal number with lower numbers indicative of lower levels of function. Within each domain, missing values are assigned the average of the answered items within the domain. Scores are converted to a scale of 0 to 100 with 0 indicative of the lowest level of function. There are two summary scores. The functional status score is the combination of the scores for the physical limitation and symptom (excluding symptom stability) domains. The clinical summary score is the functional status score plus scores for the QoL and social limitation domains.</description>

    <description>Changes in biomarkers levels from baseline will be assessed at Month 6 (+/-3), Month 15 (+/-3), and Month 27 (+/-3).
Several biomarkers will be assessed, including the following ones:
Sorbitol
High-sensitivity troponin T (HsTNT)
C-reactive protein (CRP)
Sorbitol has been selected as a biomarker of aldose reductase inhibition; high-sensitivity troponin (HsTNT) as a marker of cardiac injury and C-reactive protein (CRP) has a marker of inflammation.</description>
