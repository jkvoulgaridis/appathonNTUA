    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a study drug, and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. AE is considered &quot;serious&quot; if the investigator or sponsor view any of the following outcomes: Death, life-threatening, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly or birth defect, hospitalization, or medically important event. Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event observed after starting administration of the study drug and within 30 days after the last dose of study drug.</description>

    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects whose best overall response (BOR) is rated as compete response (CR) or partial response (PR) among all analyzed subjects. Complete response (CR) of target lesions is defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes, if chosen as target lesions, must have a reduction in the short axis to &lt; 10 mm from the baseline measurement. Partial response (PR) of target lesions is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions (long diameter for non-pathological lymph nodes and short diameter for pathological lymph nodes), taking the baseline sum diameter as a reference. BOR rated as CR or PR should be confirmed by at least 2 consecutive assessments performed at a minimum interval of 4 weeks. Subjects must therefore meet the criteria for CR or PR continuously for 4 weeks or longer.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the start of study treatment until death from any cause, or radiographic or clinical disease progression per RECIST 1.1, whichever occurs earlier.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control Rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects whose BOR is rated as CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) among all analyzed subjects. SD of target lesions is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD), taking the smallest sum diameter on study as a reference. (PD) of the target lesions is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (long diameter for non-pathological lymph nodes and short diameter for pathological lymph nodes), taking the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study) as a reference. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>DOR is defined as the time from the date of the first response (CR or PR) per RECIST 1.1 to the date of radiological PD, clinical progression only if radiological assessment is not available, or death, whichever occurs earlier.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 18 months</time_frame>
