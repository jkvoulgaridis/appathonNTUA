  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the functional differences between two types of foot
      prostheses for people with ankle disarticulation (Syme's) amputations. The two feet being
      tested are low- and high-profile feet, with the difference being the latter has an extended
      keel and attaches to the posterior of the prosthetic socket, rather than the distal end. The
      hypothesis is that the high-profile foot (i.e., the crossover foot) will lead to functional
      and biomechanical improvements compared to low-profile feet.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Syme's prostheses are typically limited to low-profile prosthetic feet due to clearance
      restrictions below the prosthetic socket. As a result, the functional benefits provided by
      the long residual limb are mitigated by prosthetic design limitations. Recently,
      high-profile, posteriorly-attaching crossover feet have been modified for use with people who
      have Syme's amputation. Crossover feet theoretically improve motion and energy
      storage-and-return compared to traditional foot options for the Syme's level. Crossover feet
      also have the potential to broaden the range of high-impact activities that can be performed
      with a single prosthesis. However, to date there is no empirical evidence that compares
      functional differences when walking with high-profile crossover feet compared to low-profile
      feet for people with Syme's amputation. This mixed-method pilot research will use a
      randomized, controlled within-participants design. Investigators will assess gait
      biomechanics, self-reported health outcomes, and qualitative interviews to compare relative
      advantages and disadvantages of traditional low-profile Syme's feet and high-profile
      crossover feet. This proposed work will create a foundation for future research that examines
      the potential benefits of crossover feet in people with Syme's amputation. In addition,
      results from this research will be used clinically to inform prosthetic options for people
      with limited clearance for distally-attached prosthetic feet.

Questions will ask about overall preference, and preference for a range of mobility activities (e.g., &quot;Which foot did you prefer overall, and why?&quot; and &quot;Which foot did you prefer for walking up stairs, and why?&quot;).</description>
