  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of TISSEEL Lyo for haemostasis
      in patients receiving peripheral vascular prosthetic expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE)
      conduits, as compared to a control arm treated with manual compression with surgical gauze
      pads.

    <description>The dose to be applied is governed by variables including the type of surgical intervention, the size of the affected area and the mode of intended application, and the number of applications.. The guideline for sealing surfaces is one package of Tisseel Lyo 2 ml (i.e. 1 ml sealer protein solution plus 1 ml thrombin solution) is sufficient for a surface of at least 10 cm2.</description>
