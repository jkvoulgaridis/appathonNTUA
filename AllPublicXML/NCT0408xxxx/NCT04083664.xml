      To assess the pattern of NGAL and Hepicidin in relation to anemia in End Stage Renal Disease
      Patients on regular hemodialysis in Assiut University Hospital and study the relation between
      both NGAL and Hepicidin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic kidney disease have a chronic inflammatory state, due to many factors
      e.g. enhancedincidence of infections, the uremic milieu, elevated levels of proinflammatory
      cytokines, frequent presence of widespread arteriosclerosis, etc. Iron metabolism is
      disturbedin chronic inflammatory diseases.AlteredNGAL levels in hemodialysis patients was
      probablydue to the fact that this protein was involved in ironmetabolism and suggested that
      NGAL might be anew tool in the assessment of iron deficiency.Another study found in
      multipleregression analysis that; residual renal function, hepcidin,creatinine and hsCRP were
      predictors of serum NGAL inhemodialyzed patients. They concluded that NGAL is highly induced
      in dialyzed patients and could reflect both kidney function and iron metabolism.Several
      studies suggested that hepcidin plays a role as anegative regulator of intestinal iron
      absorption and ironrelease from macrophages. Hepcidin controls intestinal ironabsorption by
      regulating ferroportin expression on thebasolateral membrane of enterocytes .Hepicidin is
      also an acute phase reactant.Both NGAL and hepcidin are elevated inchronic kidney disease,not
      only through ironmetabolism, but both are also associated with inflammationand may be related
      to anemia. Possible relationship between NGAL and hepicidin is still under study.
