      Standard neuropsychological evaluations after severe TBI (traumatic brain injury) often
      minimizes the executive deficits, these latter are known to seriously impair return to work.
      Therefore, we developed an ecological organization and problem-solving test in a vocational
      setting called the TEM-PRO. The test consists of 4 activities of variable complexity,
      collection and redaction of information and demands to follow well defined rules.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While there may be many reasons for obtaining neuropsychological assessement after TBI,
      predication of the real world functioning is generally the final goal. Among the cognitive
      deficits, the dysexecutive syndrome is certainly the most disabling in impeding to return to
      work. The classical neuropsychological tests often fail to asses theses deficits adequately.
      Several more ecological tests have been previously developed. Based on the multiple errands
      test and the six elements test, we built up first an ecological test over 60 minutes for
      activities of the daily living (test des errances multiples, &quot; TEM, version CRR &quot;). Used
      regularly in the clinical setting, it was able to evaluate the functional aptitudes of the
      patients and was useful to complete the classical neuropsychological tests. However test
      duration is too short and activities are far away from real work scenarios to test working
      aptitudes. Therefore we developed a new executive-ecological test in a vocational setting
      (TEM-PRO). The adaptation of the original test in a vocational setting induces the addition
      of 4 activities of variable complexity, research and redaction of information and demands to
      follow well defined rules. Skills that are solicited are planning, selective and sustained
      attention, prospective memory, organization, problems solving and behavior adaption over a
      long period of time. Based on a pilot study with patients without neurological deficit we
      assessed that our test displayed good sensitivity without ceiling effect. It allowed a
      quantitative and differentiated evaluation, a classification of various error types
      (interpretation and judgment failure, rule breaks, task failures and inefficiencies) and
      provided a qualitative behavioral analysis.

    <description>The following data will be collected: (1) sociodemographic variables (2); clinical and psychological data; (3) functional tests (neuropsychological testing, TEM version CRR and TEM-PRO).
On day one, patients will undergo standard neuropsychological tests and questionnaires listed hereafter, which are commonly used in the clinical practice at the CRR.
The Patient Competency Rating Scale (PCRS)
TEM (Multiple errands test)
GREFEX
5 POINTS TEST
TAP 2.3
Behavioral Assessment of the Dysexecutives Syndrome (BADS)
On day two, the patients will perform the TEM-PRO test ambulatory in our vocation rehabilitation unit.
&quot;Predictors&quot; variables will be collected before testing: Sociodemographic: age, sex, education, marital status, mother language, time since TBI, severity of the TBI (moderate or severe), type of lesion (contusion, diffuse axonal injury grade 1-3, ischemic or other complications), history of TBI, stroke or meningitis.</description>
