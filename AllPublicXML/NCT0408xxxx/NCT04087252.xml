  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite years of preclinical efforts and hundreds of clinical studies, therapeutic cancer
      vaccines with the routine ability to limit or eliminate tumor growth in humans have been
      elusive. With advances in genome sequencing, it is now possible to identify a new class of
      tumor-specific antigens derived from mutated proteins that are present only in the tumor.
      These &quot;neoantigens&quot; should provide highly specific targets for antitumor immunity. Although
      many challenges remain in producing and testing neoantigen-based vaccines customized for each
      patient, a neoantigen vaccine offers a promising new approach to induce highly focused
      antitumor T cells aimed at eradicating cancer cells

      1. Methods of vaccine storage and transportation: as a special biological product, the
           vaccine should be stored at 2-8 ℃ to protect the efficacy (titer) of the vaccine from
           being damaged.All vaccines must be stored and transported at temperatures that meet
           regulatory requirements.A cold chain system is required to support and monitor the
           temperature at all stages of the vaccine from production to final inoculation (aircraft,
           ship, train, automobile, motorcycle, bicycle, walking, etc.);Cold storage, refrigerator,
           vaccine transport box, cold pack, ice bar, etc.) to avoid overheating or over-cooling.

        2. Treatment plan: intramuscular injection of vaccines of D1, D4, D7, D14, D21, D51, D142
           of the deltoid muscle of the left and right upper arm, every six months for the next 3
           years, and every year for the next 3 years, until the patient withdrew from the clinical
           study or the study was discontinued.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥18 years ≤ 70 years at the time of informed consent

          -  Signed informed consent to be provided

          -  failed in previous standard chemotherapy and targeted therapy

          -  Life expectancy not less than 90 days

          -  Karnofsky performance status 0-1

          -  adequate organ functions

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Actively infectious condition including hepatitis

          -  Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the
             potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus or infant.

          -  Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined immunodeficiency
             Disease).

          -  Concurrent opportunistic infections (The experimental treatment being evaluated in
             this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune
             competence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible
             to its toxicities).

          -  Active systemic infections, coagulation disorders or any other active major medical
             illnesses.

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.
