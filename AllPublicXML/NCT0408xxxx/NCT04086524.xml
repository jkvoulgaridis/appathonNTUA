  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether a binocular treatment can improve vision and
      motor function in young children with amblyopia. The proposed treatment is an animation
      series that has been modified so that different characters in the animation are presented to
      each eye. The contrast of the images shown to the amblyopic eye is higher than the contrast
      of the images shown to the fellow eye. The aim of the treatment is to promote co-operation
      between the two eyes and improve visual and motor outcomes. We will compare the benefits of
      this binocular treatment to patching, whereby the better eye is occluded with an eye patch
      for two hours per day to force the usage of the weaker eye. We hypothesize that the binocular
      treatment will improve vision and motor outcomes in young children with amblyopia, and that
      these improvements will be superior to any effects of patching.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study with study sites in Ontario, Canada (University of Waterloo);
      Quebec, Canada (University of McGill); Texas, United States of America (Retina Foundation of
      the Southwest); and Queensland, Australia (Queensland University of Technology). There are
      three study conditions. 1) binocular treatment at home, 2) binocular treatment in office and,
      3) standard patching therapy.

      Participants will be recruited from university-affiliated clinics and local clinical
      practices. Following full informed consent, participants will complete baseline testing to
      confirm eligibility and provide pre-treatment measurements of visual acuity, stereopsis,
      interocular suppression and motor function. Eligible participants will then be randomized to
      either binocular treatment or patching.

      The treatment consists of dichoptically presented children's animations with all characters
      seen by the amblyopic eye and only a subset of characters seen by the fellow eye. Images
      shown to the amblyopic eye will be presented at 100% contrast and images presented to the
      fellow eye will be presented at 20% contrast on session 1 and contrast will increment by 10%
      of the prior session's contrast level for each subsequent session. Participants will complete
      4 x 1-hour sessions per week for two weeks. After 2 weeks of treatment, participants will be
      offered the opportunity to complete an additional 2 weeks (8 hours) of treatment. Treatment
      will take place in the home or in-office depending on the study site.

      The control group will patch for 2 hours every day, at home, for 2 weeks. A calendar will be
      provided (to both groups) in order for parents to track compliance. After 2 weeks of
      patching, participants in the control group have the option to crossover to the treatment
      group for an additional 2 weeks.

      The primary analysis will compare visual acuity improvements from baseline between the
      binocular treatment and patching groups after 2 weeks of treatment. Secondary analyses will
      include comparisons of binocular vision and motor function outcomes between the binocular
      treatment and patching groups, comparisons of at-home vs. in-office binocular treatment
      outcomes and an evaluation of crossover effects.

    <description>Participants will view a dichoptic binocular cartoon (provided by BBC) on the Nintendo 3DS-XL at home. They will continue to watch the cartoon for 60 minutes, 4 times a week, for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, they will be given the option to continue for an additional 2 weeks (total of 4 weeks). Watching the cartoon does not require any special glasses. They will discontinue patching during this time.</description>

    <description>Participants will patch for 2 hours every day at home. After 2 weeks, they will be given the option to crossover to the teratment group for an additional 2 weeks (total of 4 weeks). Patching is a common treatment for amblyopia, often considered the &quot;golden standard.&quot; It is the most common comparison as a &quot;control&quot; group in amblyopia and vision therapy literature.</description>
