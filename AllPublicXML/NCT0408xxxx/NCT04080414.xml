  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 12-week, exercise study will assess the feasibility of a home-based high-intensity
      interval training (HIIT) program among colorectal cancer survivors and explore the impact of
      home-based HIIT compared to a standard home-based moderate-intensity continuous aerobic
      exercise program on physical outcomes linked with survival from colorectal cancer and
      surrogate blood markers of colorectal cancer recurrence.

      HIIT is a type of aerobic exercise that includes short bursts (i.e. 1-4 minutes) of vigorous
      exercise followed by longer periods of moderate to lower intensity exercise (i.e. 1-10
      minutes). Participants in this study will be randomly assigned into a personalized home based
      exercise program - either high-intensity interval training (HIIT) or moderate-intensity
      continuous aerobic exercise (MICE).

      This pilot study will provide us with preliminary evidence for a larger trial aimed to
      compare the effectiveness of these two different types of home-based exercise programs on
      physical outcomes linked with survival, quality of life, and surrogate blood markers of
      colorectal cancer recurrence.

    <description>Feasibility will be assessed by adherence to the home-based high-intensity interval training protocol, which is defined at the participant level as completing ≥70% of workouts consistent with the exercise prescription. The intervention will be considered feasible if ≥75% of participants meet or exceed the 70% criterion.</description>
