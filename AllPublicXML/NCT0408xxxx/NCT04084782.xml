  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effect on quality of life of consumers with self-reported onychomycosis
      during the first 4 weeks of treatment in relation to the appearance of the infected toenail.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The appearance of the infected toe nail in those suffering from the disease may have a
      greater impact on quality of life than the severity of the disease. It is believed that a
      visual improvement in the appearance of the infected toenail at an earlier stage could have a
      positive impact on quality of life and encourage compliance with treatment. The aim of this
      consumer study is to evaluate the quality of life of consumers with onychomycosis and
      investigate its relation to the appearance of the infected toenail within the initial 4 weeks
      of treatment with Scholl Fungal Nail following its purchase from an eCommerce platform.

    <description>Change in mean total score of the OnyCOE-tâ„¢ from baseline to end of inital treatment period. The domains are transformed into 0-100 scale where higher scores indicate better functioning. Changes from baseline of the mean total score will be evaluated with repeated measures t-tests.
The questionnaire contains 7 domains:
7-item Toenail Symptoms, containing Symptom Frequency (5 categories: 1 = never, 5 = very often) and Symptom Bothersomeness (5 categories: 1 = not at all bothered, 5 = extremely bothered) 8-item Appearance Problems (4 categories: 1 = very much a problem, 4 = not a problem) 7-item Physical Activities Problems (4 categories: 1 = very much a problem, 4 = not a problem)
1-item Overall Problem (4 categories; 1 = very much a problem, 4 = not a problem) 7-item Stigma (5 categories: 0 = does not describe me at all, 4 = describes me very well) 3-item Treatment Satisfaction scale (5 categories: 1 = very satisfied, 5 very dissatisfied)</description>

    <measure>Participant perception of the improvement in healthy appearance of their infected toenail.</measure>
    <time_frame>Any timepoint up to day 28</time_frame>

A successful outcome of this measure would be 70% Top 2 Boxes (T2B) (Strongly Agree or Agree) improvement in the healthier appearance of the target toenail at any post baseline assessment compare to Day 1 (prior to initial product application)</description>

A successful outcome of this measure would be 70% T2B (Strongly Agree or Agree) improvement in the brighter appearance of the target toenail as determined by participant perceived questions at any post baseline assessment compare to Day 1 (prior to initial product application)</description>

A successful outcome of this measure would be 70% T2B (Strongly Agree or Agree) improvement in the colour of the target toenail as determined by participant perceived questions at any post baseline assessment compare to Day 1 (prior to initial product application)</description>
