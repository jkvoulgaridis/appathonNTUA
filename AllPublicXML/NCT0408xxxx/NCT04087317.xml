  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Untreated postpartum pain has been associated with increased risk of opioid use, postpartum
      depression and development of persistent pain. In this study the investigators will
      investigate whether a scheduled administration of analgesics is superior to administration of
      analgesics based on patient request following a vaginal delivery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than two million women deliver vaginally every year in the United States (US). Along
      with the joy and happiness of having a new member in the family, women may suffer from
      cramping pain and lower abdomen discomfort following uterine involution; perineal pain due to
      perineal trauma or episiotomy; and nipple pain from breastfeeding or breast engorgement.

      A stepwise approach using multimodal combination of medications can effectively provide an
      individualized pain management for women in their postpartum period. The first step includes
      non-opioid analgesics (as paracetamol and NSAIDs), step two adds milder opioids (as codeine,
      tramadol and oral morphine), and step three incorporates stronger opioids (as parenteral
      morphine).

      In this study the investigators will investigate whether a scheduled administration of
      analgesics is superior to administration of analgesics based on patient request following a
      vaginal delivery.

    <intervention_model_description>Women following a vaginal delivery, with no exclusion criteria to participate in the study, will be addressed. After receiving all the information about the study, women who choose to participate will be consented.
All participants will be randomized to either scheduled analgesic administration (study group) or analgesic administration per women's request (control group) as accustomed at the investigator's unit.</intervention_model_description>
