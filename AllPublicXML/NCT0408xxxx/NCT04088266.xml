    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the exposure-response relationship between the
      steady-state plasma concentrations of buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine, naloxone, and total
      naloxone and the change from baseline in QTc prolongation intervals following administration
      of CASSIPA® sublingual film (16 mg buprenorphine with 4 mg naloxone) to male and female adult
      subjects initiating treatment of opioid dependence.

             criteria:

               -  surgically sterile (e.g., bilateral oophorectomy, tubal ligation, hysterectomy or
                  permanent sterilization procedures), with the procedure performed at least 3
                  months before the start of Induction

               -  naturally postmenopausal (no menses) for at least 1 year before Induction and/or

             Screening as confirmed by a negative quantitative serum pregnancy test with a
             sensitivity of 5 mIU/mL of human chorionic gonadotropin. Females of childbearing
             potential must have negative urine pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of 25 mIU/mL at

             contraceptive), throughout the study. A sterile sexual partner is not considered an
             adequate form of birthcontrol. Subjects on hormonal contraceptives must have been on
             the same hormonal contraceptive for at least one month before Screening and continue
             throughout the duration of the study.

          7. Has a Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score of greater than 12 at the start of
             the Induction period and a COWS score of less than 5 at the start of the Dosing
             period.

          8. Has successfully completed the Induction period of the study to continue on to the

             any substances other than opioids or tobacco.

          3. Requires opioid treatment for any ongoing medical condition.

          4. Has sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI) within 30 days prior to Screening, which,

             integrity of the study.

          5. Significant history or current medical condition associated with increased
             intracranial or cerebrospinal fluid pressure such as intracranial neoplasm,
             hydrocephalus, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, or a related condition which, in
             the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the safety of the subject or the
             integrity of the study.

          6. Significant history or current medical condition associated with increased
             intracholedochal pressure such as choledocholithiasis or a related condition which, in
             the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the safety of the subject or the
             integrity of the study.

          7. Significant history or current medical condition compromising respiratory function
             such as COPD, moderate to severe persistent asthma, cor pulmonale, or a related
             condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the safety of

             questions 4 or 5 on the suicidal ideation portion of the C-SSRS. A suicide attempt,
             interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, or preparatory acts/behavior within 6 months

             the drug delivery system, other opioids, or history of any drug hypersensitivity or
             intolerance which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the safety of
             the subject or the integrity of the study.

         13. Significant history or current medical condition or organ dysfunction that in the
             opinion of the Investigator would compromise the safety of the subject or the
             integrity of the study, including but not limited to cardiovascular, neurologic,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, endocrine, psychiatric and infectious
             disease.

         14. Diagnosed or treated for cancer within the last 5 years.

             block (LBBB), QRS duration &gt; 120 ms, prior evidence of MI) that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would compromise the safety of the subject or the integrity of the
             study; or a QTc &gt; 450 ms for males and &gt; 470 ms for females using Fredericia formula.
             ECGs may be repeated as appropriate to confirm values and rule out extraneous results,
             at the discretion of the Investigator.

         19. Significant history of chronic hypokalemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypocalcaemia or any
             electrolyte abnormality that can prolong the QTc interval.

         20. Any clinically significant finding on physical exam, clinical labs or ECG that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the safety of the subject or the
             integrity of the study.

         21. History of hypotensive episodes or evidence at screening of orthostatic hypotension.
