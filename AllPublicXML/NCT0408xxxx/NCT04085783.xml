  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The endometrial function and endometrial receptivity have been accepted to be major limiting
      factors in the establishment of pregnancy. In spite of improved almost all aspects of IVF:
      ovarian stimulation, embryo culture and transfer, the pregnancy rates still not satisfactory.
      The bottleneck is the process of implantation.

      Recurrent implantation failure (RIF) is one of the nightmares in reproductive medicine and
      despite several strategies that have been described for management; there is no universal
      agreement yet.

      Recently, intrauterine infusion of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is described to promote
      endometrial growth and receptivity, PRP has been investigated as a therapeutic approach for
      several medical disorders in dermatology and rheumatology, but its use in IVF is still
      limited.

      Objective:

      To evaluate the effectiveness of intrauterine perfusion of autologous platelet-rich plasma in
      the improvement of pregnancy rate in RIF patients.

      After ethical committee approval was obtained, 150 infertile women with history of RIF gave
      their written consent to be included in this study. All were recruited from the outpatient
      clinic of Al-Baraka fertility hospital - with age below 40 yrs, body mass index (BMI) below
      30 kg/m2, whose uteri were morphologically normal as confirmed by HSG and U/S to limit
      additional factors that may affect the results of the study - Divided into 2 comparable
      groups; all participants underwent antagonist protocol, oocytes retrieval, fertilization and
      embryo transfer; In the study group, intrauterine infusion of 0.5 to 1 ml of platelet-rich
      plasma (PRP) was performed 48 hrs before blastocyst transfer, pregnancy tests were done 12
      days after ET.

    <description>In study group (75 patients), intrauterine infusion of PRP was done 48 hrs. before ET. PRP was prepared from autologous blood and it was made by using two steps centrifuge process. All Blastocyst transfers were performed under ultrasound guidance by one expert gynecologist with infertility fellowship. ET was performed according to American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) guidelines 2013 (Two or three embryos for each participant). On PRP infusion day, 17.5 ml of peripheral venous blood was drawn into a syringe that contains 2.5 ml of Acid Citrate and centrifuged immediately at 1200 rpm for 12 min to separate red blood cells, then plasma was centrifuged again at 3300 rpm for 7 min to obtain PRP that contained platelet 4-5 times more than peripheral blood. 0.5- 1 ml of PRP was infused into the uterine cavity with embryo transfer catheter (Wallace - Smiths, UK). On the other side, No PRP was done in control group. Pregnancy tests were done 12 days after ET.</description>
