      This study is a randomized, open-label, fed, single dose, crossover study to investigate the
      pharmacokinetic profiles and safety of high-dose CKD-385 in healthy volunteers under fed
      conditions.

    <textblock>
      To healthy subjects of twenty-four (24), following treatments are administered dosing in each
      period and wash-out period is a minimum of 7 days. Reference drug: D744, Test drug 1: CKD-385
      64 mg formulation I, Test drug 2: CKD-385 64 mg formulation II. Pharmacokinetic blood samples
      are collected up to 48 hrs. The pharmacokinetic characteristics and safety are assessed.
