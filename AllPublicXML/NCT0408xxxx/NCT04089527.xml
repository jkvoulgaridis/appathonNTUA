  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CC-95775-ST-001 is an open-label, Phase 1B, dose escalation and expansion study of CC-95775
      in subjects with advanced or unresectable solid tumors, including laBCC, and relapsed/
      refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The dose escalation part (Part A) of the study will
      explore escalating oral doses of CC-95775 administered on a 4d on/24d off schedule to
      estimate the MTD of CC-95775. A mTPI-2 will help guide CC-95775 dose escalation decisions
      with the final decisions made by an SRC. Approximately 20 subjects will be enrolled.

      The expansion cohort (Part B) will evaluate the safety, PK, PD safety and preliminary
      activity of CC-95775 in advanced solid tumors, including laBCC. Approximately 20 subjects
      will be enrolled.

          9. Females of childbearing potential

               -  A female of childbearing potential (FCBP) is a female who: 1) has achieved
                  menarche at some point, 2) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral
                  oophorectomy, or 3) has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following
                  cancer therapy or other medical condition does not rule out childbearing
                  potential) for at least 12 consecutive months and verified by an FSH blood test
                  at screening.

               -  FCBP must either commit to true abstinence from heterosexual intercourse (which
                  must be reviewed monthly and source documented) or to use one highly effective
                  contraceptive method plus one barrier method. True abstinence is acceptable when
                  this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic
                  abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods] and
                  withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception). Highly effective
                  contraceptive methods are combined (containing estrogen and progestogen) or
                  progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation
                  (oral, injectable, intravaginal, patch, or implantable); bilateral tubal
                  ligation; intrauterine device; intrauterine hormone-releasing system; or
                  vasectomized partner sterilization (note that vasectomized partner is a highly
                  effective birth control method provided that partner is the sole sexual partner
                  of the FCBP trial participant and that the vasectomized partner has received
                  medical assessment of the surgical success). Barrier methods are male or female
                  latex or synthetic condom, diaphragm, cervical cap or sponge with spermicide,
                  barrier contraceptive with spermicide. These measures should be used from signing
                  the ICF, throughout the study, and for up to 44 days following the last dose of
                  CC-95775.

               -  Have two negative pregnancy tests as verified by the investigator prior to
                  starting CC-95775.

               -  Pregnancy testing:

               -  A negative serum pregnancy test (or Î²-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin
                  (Î²-hCG pregnancy test) at Screening verified by the Investigator.

               -  A negative serum or urine pregnancy test (or Î²-subunit of human chorionic
                  gonadotropin (Î²-hCG pregnancy test) on Day 1 of dosing verified by the
                  Investigator prior to dosing.

               -  Agree to ongoing pregnancy testing during the course of the study, and after the
                  end of study treatment. This applies even if the subject practices true
                  abstinence from heterosexual contact.

         10. Male subjects must practice true abstinence (which must be reviewed on a monthly
             basis) or agree to use a condom (a latex or non-latex synthetic condom is required)
             during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a FCBP and will avoid conceiving from
             signing the ICF, while participating in the study, during dose interruptions, and for
             at least 104 days following CC-95775 discontinuation, even if he has undergone a
             successful vasectomy. True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the
             preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject [female partner's periodic abstinence
             (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are
             not acceptable methods of contraception].

               -  Males must agree not to donate semen or sperm for at least 104 days following
                  CC-95775 discontinuation.

               -  Other than the subject, FCBP and males able to father a child should not handle
                  the study drugs or touch the capsules, unless gloves are worn.
