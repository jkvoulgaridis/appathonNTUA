      A total of 90 Chinese women aged 9-45 years old were divided into three age groups: 27-45
      years old, 18-26 years old, and 9-17 years old. The experimental group and the placebo group
      were randomly assigned in a ratio of 2:1. Sixty patients had a placebo group of 30 patients.
      All subjects enrolled in the upper arm deltoid muscle were injected with 3 doses of test
      vaccine or placebo according to the 0, 2, and 6 months immunization program.
