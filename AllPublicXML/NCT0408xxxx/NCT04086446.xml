    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the possible therapeutic effects of Transcranial Direct Current
      Stimulation (tDCS) in drug-naïve obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients, and the
      underlying neural mechanism by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),transcranial magnetic
      stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of tDCS over orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)
      in treatment of drug-naïve OCD patients. 60 drug-naïve OCD patients will be randomized into
      two groups (i.e. active or sham stimulation). tDCS stimulation will be performed once a day,
      five times a week, for two weeks. The investigators will assess symptom severity before and
      after two weeks of tDCS. Through the study, Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale（Y-BOCS）,
      the Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R), the Beck Depression Inventory-II
      (BDI-II), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Pittsburgh sleep
      quality index (PSQI)and side-effect questionnaire will be obtained by a trained investigator.
      The patients will also receive MRI scan and TMS-EEG.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale(Y-BOCS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>It assesses the severity of OCD symptoms. The Y-BOCS scale ranges from 0 to 40, with 0 being no symptoms and 40 being severe.The responder on Y-BOCS is defined as a Y-BOCS decrease at least 35% from the baseline at post-treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-Revised(OCI-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is an inventory of OCD symptoms with 18 items that are rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Total scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating more severe OCD symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Beck Depression Inventory-II(BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of 21 items and uses a 0 to 3 severity scale. Total scores range from 0 to 63, with higher scores indicating more severe depression symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is an inventory of anxiety symptoms with 18 items that are rated on a 5-point Likert scale(0 to 4). Total scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating more severe anxiety symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Perceived Stress Scale(PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is a 10-item, 5-point Likert scale(0 to 4) to measure the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful.The total score ranges from 0 to 40, with lower total scores representing a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pittsburgh sleep quality index(PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) contains 19 self-rated questions which measures seven aspects of sleep: (1) subjective sleep quality, (2) sleep latency, (3) sleep duration, (4) habitual sleep efficiency, (5) sleep disturbances, (6) use of sleeping medication, and (7) daytime dysfunction. The 19 self-rated items are combined to form seven component scores, each of which has a range of 0-3 points (0 indicates no difficulty, while 3 indicates severe difficulty). The seven component scores are then summed to yield one global score, with a range of 0-21 points (0 indicating no difficulty, and 21 indicating severe difficulties in all the seven areas of sleep quality).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Side-effect questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of 10-item and uses 0 to 3 severity scale to rate the intensity of side effects. Total scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating more severe side-effect. It also assesses the relation between side-effect and the effects of tDCS using 0 to 4 scale. Total scores range from 0 to 40, with higher score indicating the greater relation.</description>
