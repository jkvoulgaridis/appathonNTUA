    <textblock>
      This trial studies the frequency of incident and prevalent of cancer in people living with
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) at cancer
      centers in Latin America. By counting how many people living with HIV/AIDS have cancer at
      these specific centers, researchers may better understand how they are being treated and
      cared for. This may help researchers to understand what new studies may be helpful for those
      areas in the future.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the number of diagnosed cancers in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA)
      presenting to participating clinical sites in Latin America, and estimate site-specific
      prevalence based on all presenting cancers (new diagnosis, recurrence, and surveillance
      cases) and site-specific incidence based on newly diagnosed cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Obtain information on the use of diagnostic testing and treatment for the cohort of
      diagnosed HIV-associated cancer participants.

      II. To collect information on participant characteristics for diagnosed HIV-associated
      cancers (e.g., antiretroviral therapy [ART] regimen, current CD4 count, current viral load,
      etc.).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the timelines and requirements for protocol review and approval at the local,
      regional, and national level.

      II. To familiarize local sites with the online data entry systems utilized by the AIDS
      Malignancy Consortium (AMC).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients respond to surveys and/or undergo medical record review at baseline and at 4 weeks.

    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Participants presenting to HIV treatment programs or cancer treatment programs at
        collaborating sites, with both HIV and cancer, which may include either a history of
        malignancy or current diagnosis

    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV positive. Documentation of HIV-1 infection by means of any one of the following:

               -  Documentation of receipt of ART by a licensed health care provider (Documentation
                  may be a record of an ART prescription in the participant's medical record, a
                  written prescription in the name of the participant for ART, or pill bottles for
                  ART with a label showing the participant's name);

               -  HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) detection by a licensed HIV-1 RNA assay
                  demonstrating &gt; 1000 RNA copies/mL, and confirmed by a licensed screening
                  antibody and/or HIV antibody/antigen combination assay;

               -  Any licensed HIV screening antibody and/or HIV antibody/antigen combination assay
                  confirmed by a second licensed HIV assay, such as a HIV-1 Western blot
                  confirmation or HIV rapid multispot antibody differentiation assay.

               -  Note: The term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a kit that has been certified or licensed by
                  an oversight body within the participating country and validated internally.

               -  WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and
                  Prevention) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must
                  use a test that is different from the one used for the initial assessment. A
                  reactive initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid
                  assay or an E/Custom Industrial Analysis (CIA) that is based on a different
                  antigen preparation and/or different test principle (e.g., indirect versus
                  competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.

          -  Must have a current or prior (within the last 5 years) diagnosis of cancer, but there
             is no restriction of the number or type of prior treatments. Participants will qualify
             under one of three categories:

               -  New diagnosis: no prior treatment for current malignancy. May be prior to, or
                  currently receiving the first line of therapy.

               -  Prior diagnosis (within 5 years), in remission: Not currently on cancer treatment
                  other than combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Prior treatment for
                  malignancy can include surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy (or cART initiation in
                  Kaposi sarcoma [KS]). No restriction on number of prior lines of therapy.

               -  Prior diagnosis, recurrent: considering or currently receiving treatment that is
                  not first line. No restriction on the number of prior lines of therapy.

          -  Date of birth and age should be determined based on best possible information or
             documentation available.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to provide informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants not meeting all criteria above are ineligible.
