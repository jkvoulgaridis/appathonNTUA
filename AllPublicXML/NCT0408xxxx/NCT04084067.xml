  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to assess the ability of Indocyanine Green (ICG) to identify neoplastic
      disease. For many pediatric solid tumors, complete resection of the primary site and/or
      metastatic deposits is critical for achieving a cure. An optimal intra-operative tool to help
      visualize tumor and its margins would be of benefit. ICG real-time fluorescence imaging is a
      technique being used increasingly in adults for this purpose. We propose to use it during
      surgery for pediatric malignancies. All patients with tumors that require localization for
      resection or biopsy of the tumor and/or metastatic lesions will be eligible.

      Primary Objective

      To assess the feasibility of Indocyanine Green (ICG)-mediated near-infrared (NIR) imagery to
      identify neoplastic disease during the conduct of surgery to resect neoplastic lesions in
      children and adolescents. NIR imaging will be done at the start of surgery to assess
      NIR-positivity of the lesion(s) and at the end of surgery to assess completeness of
      resection. Separate assessments will be made for the following different histologic
      categories:

        1. Osteosarcoma

        2. Ewing Sarcoma

        3. Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS)

        4. Non-Rhabdomyosarcoma Soft Tissue Sarcoma (NRSTS)

        5. Neuroblastoma

        6. Renal tumors

        7. Metastatic pulmonary deposits

        8. Liver tumors, lymphoma, other rare tumors, and nodules of unknown etiology

      Exploratory Objectives

        1. To compare the ICG uptake by primary vs metastatic site and pre-treated (chemotherapy,
           radiation, or both) vs non-pre-treated.

        2. Assess the sensitivity and specificity of NIR imagery to find additional lesions not
           identified by standard of care intraoperative inspection and tactile feedback.

        3. Assess the sensitivity and specificity of NIR imagery to find additional lesions not
           identified on preoperative diagnostic imaging.

        4. Assess the sensitivity and specificity of NIR imagery for identifying residual disease
           at the conclusion of a tumor resection.

      This trial is a single center open-label study. Patients with a solid tumor or lymphoma who
      require resection either for therapeutic or diagnostic intent will be included.

      Indocyanine Green (ICG) is an FDA-approved drug. The day before the surgery, patients will
      receive a single dose of ICG intravenously. Surgery will be performed the following day.

      During surgery, after the surgeon identifies the mass through visual (seen with the naked
      eye) and or tactile methods (palpated), the patient will have his/her tumor field imaged by
      Iridium system optimized for detection of ICG (Visionsense Corp, Philadelphia, PA). The
      entire procedure will be photo- documented and recorded.

      The Visionsense system records images in real time, calculates percentages, and captures the
      data. At least three different areas of the tumor will be measured. If the tumor cannot be
      identified by visual inspection or palpation, NIR-imaging will be used in an attempt to
      locate the lesion. The surrounding area will be inspected and measured to screen for
      additional sites of metastatic disease. After tumor resection, residual fluorescence in the
      surgical resection bed will be measured.

      Direct subject participation in the trial will last for the period of time from injection of
      the ICG the day before surgery and until 24 hours post-surgery.
