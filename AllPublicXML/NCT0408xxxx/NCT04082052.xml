  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are testing whether a single session online intervention for self-dislike
      decreases:

        1. Fear of self-compassion from immediate pre to immediate post intervention

        2. Self-hatred immediate pre to 1 month post-intervention

        3. Individual depression symptoms immediate pre to 1 month post-intervention more than a
           placebo online single session intervention encouraging the disclosure of feelings in
           college students.

           The investigators will also explicitly test whether the following variables are
           predictors, of at least the smallest variance predicted of interest, of response to
           treatment vs. placebo on self-hatred:

        4. Pre intervention self-hatred score

        5. Screening positive for clinical depression based on self-report

        6. Immediate pre to post-intervention reduction in fear of self-compassion

        7. The investigators will also assess whether any of the variance shared between the
           treatment and changes in individual depression symptoms immediately pre Intervention to
           1 month post-intervention is statistically mediated by change in self-hatred from
           immediate pre intervention to 1 month post intervention

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Participant is a current college student at the time of study enrollment

        Participant has not previously taken part in the study

        Participant speaks English well enough to complete online intervention activities, which
        are available in English only

        Participant is comfortable with completing online surveys and programs

        Participant is at least 18 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The investigators will exclude participants 3 SDs above/below the mean completion time for
        the study or exit the study prior to randomization for our listed analyses.

        The investigators will also test whether there's any association between how quickly
        participants are responding to questions and the variability in their responses. If there
        is a response time frame (i.e., a series of questions that require answers where timing is
        measured) where there is a linear relationship between response time and response
        variability, the investigators may exclude those participants, as response time and
        response variability should be uncorrelated and a linear association can indicate random
        responding. This time frame can be identified visually on a graph, and sensitivity tests
        can be conducted to determine if slight variations on the visual interpretation affect
        substantive results.

        The investigators will exclude participants who respond with either copy/pasted responses
        from text earlier in the intervention (e.g. Copy and pasting only text from a previous
        testimonial slide) to any of free response questions.

        The investigators will exclude for primary analyses (but may run sensitivity analyses
        including them) any participants who provide responses of 5 words or fewer to writing
        prompts that ask for at least 1 sentence or more.
