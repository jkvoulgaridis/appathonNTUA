      Health care associated infection (HCAI) is a serious health hazard as it leads to increased
      morbidity and mortality of patients, length of hospital stay and costs associated with
      increased hospital stay.

      A total of 361 subjects divided into four groups were included in this study. The first group
      comprised of 179 doctors, the second had 31 nurses, third group had 110 OT Technicians and
      the fourth group included 41 subjects which included housekeeping staff and cleaners. Swabs
      were collected from OT staff at the time of entry and at exit from the OT. Places of swabs
      taken were: A) Web space, B) OT dress and C) Anterior nares.

      Introduction:

      Health care associated infection (HCAI) is a serious health hazard as it leads to increased
      morbidity and mortality of patients, length of hospital stay and costs associated with
      increased hospital stay. Infections from OT is well known and is well established which are
      often referred to as &quot;hot zones&quot; for emergence &amp; spread of microbial resistance.
      Contamination in an operation theatre is an important cause of HCAIs and is the third leading
      cause of HCAIs.

      This was a prospective observational study conducted in the operation theatre of a tertiary
      hospital once a month randomly from April 2014 - April 2016. All Operation theatre (OT) staff
      were included in the study. All the patients in OT and samples from the OT air &amp; equipment
      were excluded from the study. A total of 361 subjects divided into four groups were included
      in this study. The first group comprised of 179 doctors, the second had 31 nurses, third
      group had 110 OT Technicians and the fourth group included 41 subjects which included
      housekeeping staff and cleaners. Swabs were collected from OT staff at the time of entry and
      at exit from the OT. Places of swabs taken were: A) Web space, B) OT dress and C) Anterior
      nares.

        All OT staff viz. Surgeons, Anesthetists, Residents, OT matron/Nurse, OT Technicians,
        Housekeeping and Cleaning staff were include in the study. All the patients in OT and
        samples from the OT air &amp; equipment were excluded from the study. All subjects were
        screened as per inclusion and exclusion criteria and selected without any gender bias.

        The study population contained 361 subjects among which were divided into four groups.
        Doctors, Nurses, OT technicians and others. Swabs were collected from OT staff at the time
        of entry in to OT and at the time of exit from OT. Places of swabs taken are: A) Web space,
        B) OT dress, C) Anterior nares (distal 1cm in a circular motion). Swabs were inoculated on
        5% sheep blood agar/ Mueller-Hinton agar/ Mannitol salted agar/ MacConkey agar and were
        incubated at 35-37 degree centigrade under aerobic conditions for 48hrs with observation
        once in 24hrs. The age, gender and rank of the OT staff were collected as a part of
        demographic data.
