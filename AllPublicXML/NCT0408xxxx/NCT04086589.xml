  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to address the mechanisms that account for alteration of circadian rhythms with
      age. As the blood of aged individuals can produce this alteration, the investigators propose
      to use such blood samples to &quot;age&quot; circadian rhythms in cultured cells. The investigators
      will verify aged blood-dependent alteration of rhythms and then conduct molecular screens to
      reverse this decline. If the investigators identify specific genes that can restore molecular
      circadian rhythm in vitro, the investigators will explore these in animal models (Drosophila,
      mouse).
