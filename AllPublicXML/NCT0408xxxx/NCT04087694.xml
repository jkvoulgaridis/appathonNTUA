    <textblock>
      This study compare the results of 2 methods in surgical treatment of Lumbar spine
      stenosis.These are microdecompresssion and open decompression with posterior stabilization.
      100 patients are involved in this study who divided in 2 groups.Each group was treated with
      one method and follow up done which showed both method are effective with better results in
      those patients treated with microdecomppression.

      This randomized controlled study was conducted between January 2016 and October 2018. One
      hundred patients were involved in this study. All these patients were suffered from radicular
      leg pain with MRI features of multilevel lumbar spinal stenosis and were treated by
      conservative treatment of medical treatment and physiotherapy without benefit for (6) months.
      Those patients were divided into two groups; Group A, (50) Microdecompression, and Group B,
      (50) patients who were treated by open wide laminectomy and posterior stabilization. Both
      groups of patients were followed up with ODI (Oswestry disability index) and VAS (Visual
      analogue score) for the back and leg pain for one year.

      Results: The results showed that both groups got significant improvement regarding Oswestry
      disability index. Regarding back pain, there was a significant improvement in both groups
      with better results in-group A due minimal tissues injury as the advantage of minimal
      invasive technique. In both groups, there were marked improvement of radicular leg pain
      postoperatively.

      Conclusions: Both Microdecompression and wide open laminectomy with posterior stabilization
      were effective in treatment of multilevel lumbar spinal stenosis with superior results of
      Microdecompression regarding less back pain postoperatively with less blood loss and soft
      tissue dissection.

    <description>For each section the total possible score is 5: if the first statement is marked the section score = 0; if the last statement is marked, it = 5. If all 10 sections are completed the score is calculated as follows:
Example: 16 (total scored) 50 (total possible score) x 100 = 32% If one section is missed or not applicable the score is calculated: 16 (total scored) 45 (total possible score) x 100 = 35.5% Minimum detectable change (90% confidence): 10% points (change of less than this may be attributable to error in the measurement)</description>
