  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As undiagnosed and untreated hypertension is one of the largest drivers of cardiovascular
      disease in sub-Saharan Africa approaches are needed to optimize the hypertension care
      cascade. The HIV treatment platform in low and middle income countries provides a robust,
      scalable foundation to address other chronic care priorities, such as hypertension. This
      proposal will evaluate an evidence-based intervention designed to improve chronic care
      services (the Systems Analysis and Improvement Approach (SAIA)) for hypertension detection
      and management in people living with HIV, and will build evidence on how to achieve rapid,
      sustainable and scalable improvements in services that can dramatically improve population
      health in resource-limited countries.

    <description>The Systems Analysis and Improvement Approach to Optimize the Hypertension Care Cascade for People Living with HIV (SAIA-HTN) is a five-step systems analysis and iterative improvement cycle intervention which will be implemented by study nurses and district managers in intervention facilities. Components of the intervention include joint care cascade analysis, patient flow mapping and continuous quality improvement, aimed to incrementally improve hypertension screening, diagnosis, treatment and care in the HIV+ population at intervention health facilities.</description>
