  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to look at how a type of drug called cannabinoids are related to
      the processing of fear signals, the experience of emotions and fear, and the pattern of
      activity in the brain that is involved in these processes and how this relates to the
      treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is an anxiety disorder that occurs
      after experiencing a traumatic event(s) and is characterized by unwanted memories of the
      trauma(s) through flashbacks or nightmares, avoidance of situations that remind the person of
      the event, difficulty experiencing emotions, loss of interest in activities the person used
      to enjoy, and increased arousal, such as difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, anger
      and hypervigilance. The information gained from this study could lead to the development of
      new treatments for persons who suffer from anxiety or fear-based disorders.

      The total time commitment estimated per participant 18 study visits. This is broken down
      below:

      Visit 1: Questionnaires, Screening, and Orientation: During this visit the potential
      participant will learn about the study procedures, sign the informed consent documents, and
      fill out a packet of forms that ask about his or her race and ethnic background, use of drugs
      and alcohol and physical and mental health.

      Visit 2: Pre-Treatment Behavioral Tests and and Magnetic Resonance (MR) Scan: During this
      visit the participant will complete several computer tasks, and the study staff will be
      measuring reaction time and psychophysiological measures.The tasks that the participant will
      perform will show three different images and an aversive stimulus (e.g. loud burst of noise
      or animated snake) may follow one image most of the time, while the other images may never be
      followed by the aversive cue. The participant will need to try to predict whether the
      aversive cue will occur or not based on which image is shown and will be asked to repeatedly
      rate on a scale how likely it is that he or she thinks an aversive cue will occur after each
      image. Lastly, during the session the participant will also be asked to report his or her
      level of anxiety on a scale from 0 to 100.

      Visit 3: Pre-Treatment Behavioral Tests and MR Scan: This visit will be very similar to Visit
      2. Participants will participate in the same type of task inside the MR scanner, while the
      study staff measures reaction time and psychophysiological responding and brain activation.
      Participants will view the same images he or she did previously, and may experience the same
      aversive stimulus as during Visit 2. Participants will again be asked to rate how much they
      expect to experience the aversive stimulus after each image and will also be asked to report
      their level of anxiety on a scale from 0 to 100.

      Visits 4 &amp; 5: Prolonged Exposure (PE) Sessions 1 &amp; 2: These sessions will consist of
      psychoeducation that includes discussion or reactions to trauma , treatment rationale,
      breathing retraining, and review of SUDS to assess level of distress from 0 to 100
      (100=extreme anxiety/distress) when facing fears. One session occurs weekly across 2 weeks.

      Visits 6-14: PE Sessions 3-11: These sessions will consist of repeated exposures to trauma
      memories (imaginal exposure) and avoided situations (in vivo exposure). As is standard,
      patients will also practice exposures (e.g., listen to tapes of imaginal exposure, carry out
      in vivo exposure) outside of PE sessions as &quot;homework&quot;. At exposure-focused sessions
      (Sessions 3-11) either THC or PBO will be administered just before the session. One session
      occurs weekly across 8 weeks.

      Visit 15: PE Session 12 [Post-treatment Assessment]: This session will include a review of
      therapeutic gains/relapse prevention/assessments.

      Visit 16: Post-Treatment Behavioral Tests and MR Scan: This visit will be very similar to
      Visit 2. Participants will participate in the same type of task inside the MR scanner, while
      the study staff measures reaction time and psychophysiological responding and brain
      activation. Participants will view the same images he or she did previously, and may
      experience the same aversive stimulus as during Visit 2. Participants will again be asked to
      rate how much they expect to experience the aversive stimulus after each image and will also
      be asked to report their level of anxiety on a scale from 0 to 100.

      Visit 17: Post-Treatment Behavioral Tests and MR Scan: This visit will be very similar to
      Visit 3. Participants will participate in the same type of task inside the MR scanner, while
      the study staff measures reaction time and psychophysiological responding and brain
      activation. Participants will view the same images he or she did previously, and may
      experience the same aversive stimulus as during Visit 3. Participants will again be asked to
      rate how much they expect to experience the aversive stimulus after each image and will also
      be asked to report their level of anxiety on a scale from 0 to 100.

      Visit 18: 3-Month Follow-Up Treatment Assessment: This session is similar to Visit 15 and
      will include review of therapeutic gains/relapse prevention/assessments.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)-5 (CAPS-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>To track PTSD symptom change for each participant. The CAPS is the gold standard in PTSD assessment. The CAPS is a 30-item structured interview. In addition to assessing the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms, questions target the onset and duration of symptoms, subjective distress, impact of symptoms on social and occupational functioning, improvement in symptoms since a previous CAPS administration, overall response validity, overall PTSD severity, and specifications for the dissociative subtype. The assessor combines information about frequency and intensity of an item into a single severity rating. Total symptom severity score is calculated by summing severity scores for the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms. The five-point CAPS-5 symptom severity rating scale is used for all symptoms (0, Absent; 1, mild; 2, Moderate/threshold; 3, Severe/markedly elevated; 4, Extreme/incapacitating). Total CAPS-5 symptom severity scores range from 0-80, with higher scores indicating worse PTSD symptom severity.</description>

    <measure>Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>A standardized questionnaire of 53 statements for assessing subjective effects of psychoactive drugs. Used to differentiate drug effects from placebo. Participants rate &quot;true&quot; if the statement applies to them or &quot;false&quot; if it does not apply. Specific statements are related to a particular drug class and for that drug class all &quot;true&quot; responses are summed for a total score in that drug class. Higher scores means higher subjective drug effects for particular drug classes. The scales are the Morphine-Benzedrine (score range: 0-16; drug-induced euphoria), Amphetamine (score range: 0-11; specific for dose-related effects of d-amphetamine), Benzedrine (score range: 0-13; an amphetamine scale relating to intellectual efficiency and energy); Pentobarbital-Chlorpromazine (score range: 0-15; sedation); Lysergic Acid (score range: 0-13; dysphoria and somatic symptoms); and Marijuana (score range: 0-12; marijuana's effects).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Measures of state and trait anxiety. The STAI has 20 items for assessing trait anxiety and 20 for state anxiety. State anxiety items include: &quot;I am tense; I am worried&quot; and &quot;I feel calm; I feel secure.&quot; Trait anxiety items include: &quot;I worry too much over something that really doesn't matter&quot; and &quot;I am content; I am a steady person.&quot; All items are rated on a 4-point scale (e.g., from &quot;Almost Never&quot; to &quot;Almost Always&quot;). The numerical ratings for each of the 20 items assessing trait anxiety are summed for a total trait anxiety score. The numerical ratings for each of the 20 items assessing state anxiety are summed for a total state anxiety score. Scores on the trait and state anxiety scales of the STAI can range from 20-80. STAI scores are commonly classified as &quot;no or low anxiety&quot; (scores 20-37), &quot;moderate anxiety&quot; (scores 38-44), and &quot;high anxiety&quot; (scores 45-80).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>End of Session Questionnaire (ESQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Includes 5 questions total. The first two question ask the participant to select one of several statements that best describes the effect of the capsule they took during that visit. The second question asks the participant to guess what they thought they received in the capsule and how confident they are. The third question asks the participant to rate how much the liked or disliked the effects of the capsule overall on a scale from -5 to 5, with -5 being &quot;disliked a lot&quot;, 0 being &quot;neutral&quot;, and 5 being &quot;liked a lot&quot;. The fourth question asks participants to check &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; if they would take the capsule again. Finally, the last question is a free text response asking the participant if they experienced any unusual reactions or if they have any comments or observations that may be relevant to the study.</description>
