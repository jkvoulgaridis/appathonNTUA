        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥18 years.

          -  Diagnosis of Essential Thrombocythemia per World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic
             criteria for myeloproliferative neoplasms (Arber et al., 2016).

          -  3. Patients who are intolerant or resistant to hydroxyurea per ELN (European Leukemia
             Net) criteria, or in the Investigator's judgment are not candidates for available
             approved therapy. The ELN definitions of resistance/intolerance to HU (hydroxyurea)
             requires the fulfillment of at least one of the following criteria:

               -  Platelet count greater than 600 × 109/L after 3 months of at least 2 g/day of HU
                  (2.5 g/day in patients with a body weight over 80 kg);

               -  Platelet count greater than 400 × 109/L and leukocytes less than 2.5 × 109/L or
                  hemoglobin (Hb) less than 100 g/L at any dose of HU;

               -  Presence of leg ulcers or other unacceptable mucocutaneous manifestations at any
                  dose of HU;

               -  HU-related fever.

          -  Requires treatment in order to lower platelet counts based on the Clinically Relevant
             IPSET (International Prognostic Score for Thrombosis in Essential Thrombocythemia)
             -Thrombosis Guidelines.

          -  Platelet count &gt;450 x 109/L pre-dose Day 1.

          -  Peripheral blast count &lt;10% pre-dose Day 1.

          -  ANC (absolute neutrophil count) ≥0.5 x 109/L pre-dose Day 1.

          -  Fibrosis Score ≤ grade 2, as per a slightly modified version (Arber et al., 2016) of
             the European Consensus Criteria for Grading Myelofibrosis, (Thiele et al., 2005).

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 36 weeks.

          -  Able to swallow capsules.

          -  Amenable to spleen size determination, bone marrow evaluations, and peripheral blood
             sampling during the study.

             ring, a barrier contraceptive such as a condom with spermicide cream or gel,
             diaphragms or cervical cap with spermicide cream or gel, or an intrauterine device
             (IUD).

          -  If male, agrees not to donate sperm or father a child for at least one month after the
             last dose of the study medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Greater than 3 separate transfusion episodes over the last 6 months and/or any
             transfusion over the last 4 weeks.

          -  Evidence at the time of screening of increased risk of bleeding, including any of the
             following:

               1. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) &gt; 1.3 x the upper limit of normal

               2. International normalized ratio (INR) &gt;1.3 x the local upper limit of normal
