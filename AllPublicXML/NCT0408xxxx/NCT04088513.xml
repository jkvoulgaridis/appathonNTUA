  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aspirin was reported to induce hemolysis in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
      (G6PD) deficiency on some occasions, while still widely uesd for stroke prevention. The SAST
      trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of aspirin in patients this enzyme
      disorder.The primary purpose of the trial is to evaluate the hemolytic effects of a 3-month
      regimen of aspirin 100mg/d versus a 3-month regimen of clopidogrel 75mg/d.

      This SAST trial is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial.440 acute
      ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with G6PD deficiency will be randomized to receive a 3-month
      regimen of aspirin 100mg/d or clopidogrel 75mg/d. The primary end point is the proportion of
      protocol-defined hemolysis at 90 days. Protocol-defined hemolysis is defined as one or more
      of the following conditions: a) Hemoglobin level declined ≥2.5 g/dL from baseline, meanwhile
      ruling out bleeding events. b) Hemoglobin level declined ≥25% from baseline, meanwhile ruling
      out bleeding events. c) Clinically relevant hemolytic events, could manifested as fatigue,
      back pain, anemia, dark urine and jaundice. The study consists of five visits including the
      day of randomization, day 4, day10±3days, day27±3days, day90±7days.
