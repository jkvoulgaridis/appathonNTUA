  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Self-testing of glucose by patients living with diabetes mellitus (DM) involves needles,
      which can cause discomfort or inconvenience; these and other factors can lead to decreased
      willingness to perform these checks that are vital to DM management. While technology has
      evolved, a needle-free glucose monitoring device is currently not available. The
      investigators are studying a glucose sensor that adheres to the skin, similarly to a
      temporary tattoo. This sensor can now obtain continuous readings. As it has not yet been
      tested in individuals with DM, this study will examine its accuracy and acceptability in
      these patients. Results from this clinical trial could serve as the basis for further
      development of a non-invasive, wearable glucose sensor that can provide measurements of
      glucose levels continuously.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  An existing diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, either T1DM or T2DM, or any other type or
             etiology of diabetes

          -  Ability to provide informed consent for participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals without diabetes

          -  Those who cannot speak or read English. We are limiting participation to those who
             read and speak English, as this is a pilot study of a small number of participants,
             that will very unlikely offer the prospect of direct benefit from participating.

          -  Individuals who have frequent hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia unawareness, or who are at
             high risk for hypoglycemia.
