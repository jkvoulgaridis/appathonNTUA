  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 dose-escalation study of PRT811, a protein arginine N-methyltransferase
      (PRMT) 5 inhibitor, in subjects with advanced cancers and high-grade gliomas who have
      exhausted available treatment options. The purpose of this study is to define a safe dose and
      schedule to be used in subsequent development of PRT811.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, dose-expansion Phase 1 study of PRT811, a
      PRMT5 inhibitor, in subjects with advanced cancers without any approved or available
      treatment options including solid tumors and /or high-grade gliomas. The study will consist
      of 2 parts, a dose escalation part evaluating subjects with advanced solid tumors and/or
      high-grade glioma and a cohort expansion part which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      PRT811 in subjects with advanced solid tumors and glioblastoma multiforme. For subjects, the
      study will include a screening phase, a treatment phase, and a post treatment follow-up
      phase. An end-of-study visit will be conducted within 30 days after the last dose of PRT811.
