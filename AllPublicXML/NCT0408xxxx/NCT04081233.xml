  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the usual care alone to usual care plus early
      surgical stabilization in adult trauma patients who have been admitted with rib fractures, to
      evaluate for heterogeneity of treatment effect in high risk subgroups and to determine the
      the impact of multiple rib fractures on post-discharge health status and time to return to
      work or usual physical activity.
