  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the aim of this study is to verify whether manual therapy associated with kinesiotherapy is
      more effective than kinesiotherapy alone in the treatment of chronic pain and upper limb
      dysfunction in women surviving cancer of mama. It is a randomized controlled double blind
      clinical trial (evaluator and patient), parallel in two groups (Intervention Group and Sham
      Group). The intervention will last 6 weeks and chronic pain and upper limb functionality will
      be evaluated. Both groups will undergo a kinesiotherapy program once a week for 6 consecutive
      weeks. Also, participants in the intervention group will receive, once a week, a manual
      therapy protocol, while participants in the Sham group will receive traditional massage.
      Manual therapy associated with kinesiotherapy is expected to yield superior results to the
      isolated kinesiotherapy in chronic pain and upper limb functionality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a double-blind randomized controlled trial, parallel in two groups
      (intervention group and sham). Participants will initially be evaluated by a trained
      investigator who will be blinded and assigned randomly (random numbers generated on the
      computer) block for the intervention and sham groups by an opaque envelope draw. Participants
      will be randomized into two groups: intervention and sham. Both groups will undergo a
      kinesiotherapy program once a week for 6 consecutive weeks.

      Also, participants in the intervention group will receive, once a week, a manual therapy
      protocol, while participants in the Sham group will receive traditional massage. When making
      the invitation to participate in the survey, individuals will not be required to participate
      if they do not agree, and therefore will not be penalized. Participants who agree to
      participate in the survey will sign a Free and Informed Consent Form and will be informed of
      the possibility of withdrawing from the survey at any stage, without penalty. The collection
      of the evaluation and intervention will be carried out in a salon Clinic School of
      Physiotherapy in the Center of Health and Sports Sciences (CEFID) of the State University of
      Santa Catarina (UDESC) in the city of Florian√≥polis- SC. All personal identification data of
      the participants will be preserved according to resolution of the national health council,
      taking into account the possibility of scientific dissemination of the results obtained. The
      risks of these procedures will be medium, since the participant may present muscle pain after
      the intervention protocol. To minimize these risks will be available, if necessary,
      attendance at the Clinic School of Physiotherapy. The sample will be selected in a
      non-probabilistic way for convenience. This study will include women diagnosed with breast
      cancer who have undergone breast surgery with curative intent and who have completed
      chemotherapy and / or radiotherapy treatments.

    <measure>Change in Chronic Pain Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Pre Intervention Chronic Pain Intensity at 6 weeks Post Intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Chronic pain intensity will be evaluated through the analogue visual scale. It consists of a numbered line from 1 to 10, 0 being no pain and 10 the worst pain imaginable.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain Location</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Pre Intervention Pain Location at 6 weeks Post Intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Pain location will be assessed using a Body Pain Diagram. It is a graphical representation of a woman's body in anterior, posterior, and lateral views to identify the location and frequency of pain. In this diagram, women should mark with a X their main pain points in the upper quadrant homolateral to the surgery.</description>

    <measure>Change in Neuropathic Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Pre Intervention neuropathic pain at 6 weeks Post Intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Neuropathic Pain will be assessed using the Douler Neuropathique 4 Questionnaire. It aims to discriminate neuropathic pain from nociceptive pain. It consists of 10 items grouped into 4 sections. The first 7 items are related to pain quality (burning, painful cold, and electric shock) and its association with abnormal sensations (tingling, numbness, and itching). The remaining 3 items are associated with neurological examination in the painful area (touch hypoesthesia, needle stick hypoesthesia, and tactile allodynia). Each positive item receives a 1-point score and the total score is calculated as the sum of all 10 items. A score of 4 or higher indicates the diagnosis of neuropathic pain.</description>

    <measure>Change in central sensitization pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Pre Intervention central sensitization pain at 6 weeks Post Intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Central sensitization pain will be assessed using the the Central Sensitization Questionnaire. It aims to evaluate the symptoms considered associated with central sensitization pain. The total score ranges from 0 to 100 and a score of 40 or more indicates the presence of central sensitization pain.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain dimensions</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Pre Intervention pain dimensions at 6 weeks Post Intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Pain dimensions will be assessed using the McGill Pain Questionnaire. It is an instrument that assesses pain dimensions in physical (sensitive and discriminative) aspects, pain interpretation (affective and motivational) and pain understanding (cognitive and evaluative). It is made up of 4 large groups, divided into 20 smaller groups of words, each of which is related to a type of pain. The groups are numbered according to intensity, with 1 being the smallest: 10 groups of 42 words related to physical aspects; 5 groups of 14 words related to the affective part; 1 group of 5 words about pain in general; 4 groups of 17 words that did not fit the other groups, called miscellaneous. The values are summed and the result is given by the pain index (sum of the intensity values of the chosen descriptors, with a maximum value of 78) and by the number of descriptors (how many words were marked, with a maximum value of 20).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Upper limb functionality</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Pre Intervention Upper limb functionality at 6 weeks Post Intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Arm, Shoulder and Hand Dysfunctions Questionnaire (DASH) will be used to assess disabilities and physical symptoms of the upper limbs. It is a 30-item questionnaire that evaluates the physical disabilities and symptoms of upper limbs in a wide variety of musculoskeletal disorders. The Likert score ranges from 1 to 5 and the total score ranges from 0 to 100, where higher scores represent higher physical disabilities and upper limb symptoms. The questions refer to the last week and the questionnaire items are divided into physical function, symptoms and social function.Questionnaire.</description>
