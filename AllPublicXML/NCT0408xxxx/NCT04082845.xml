  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of an internet website, created by the nurse for the purpose
      of internet-based training related to perioperative period, on the anxiety and postoperative
      recovery measures (length of hospitalization, first oral feeding time, first mobilization
      time, first defecation time, first gas release, pain, nausea, vomiting, re-admission) of
      thyroidectomy patients. For this, while the experimental group will educate via the internet,
      the control group will take rutin care.

    <textblock>
      Today, due to changing guidelines, current approaches, and new paradigms, the approach to
      thyroid surgery has become more sensitive and selective. Besides, thyroid surgery has
      increased due to the increase in thyroid cancer and early detection of thyroid nodules. In a
      comprehensive study conducted by the Thyroid Cancer Association with 2398 patients in 35
      countries, it is found that 92.6% of the patients did not receive psychological support,
      84.1% did not receive institutional information, and 63.0% did not receive written
      information about the disease or treatment. Thyroidectomy patients are known to experience
      postoperative complications and symptoms such as hypocalcemia, hoarseness, dysphagia,
      drowsiness, or restricted neck/shoulder movement. Therefore, informing thyroidectomy patients
      about the surgical process will facilitate the management of the process. In addition to
      this, due to the increasing use of the internet with the developing technology, the behaviors
      of the patients searching for information from the internet are increasing day by day. It has
      been found that the rate of searching for health information from the internet is 68-72% in
      the world. Under this scope, this study will evaluate the effect of the web-based training on
      with thyroidectomy patients

    <time_frame>9 days</time_frame>
    <description>Self reported anxiety intensity during surgical process that includes on the day of surgery and one week after surgery. State-Trait Anxiety Inventory will be used to evaluate the anxiety. The higher the score is the more anxiety.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of length of hospitalization</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>It means that how long did the patients stay at the hospital during surgery? This measure record via questionnaire as day. The minimum, maximum, median, 25th and 75th quartile were evaluated for each group and compared between the groups.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of first feeding time after surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>It is described that how many hours after surgery did the patients eat first? This measure record via questionnaire as day. The minimum, maximum, median, 25th and 75th quartile were evaluated for each group and compared between the groups.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of first mobilization time after surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>How many hours after surgery did the patients walk first? This measure record via questionnaire as day. The minimum, maximum, median, 25th and 75th quartile were evaluated for each group and compared between the groups.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of first defecation time after surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>How many hours after surgery did the patients deface first? This measure record via questionnaire as day. The minimum, maximum, median, 25th and 75th quartile were evaluated for each group and compared between the groups.</description>

    <measure>Rate of first gas release time after surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>How many hours after surgery did the patients release gas first? This measure record via questionnaire as day. The minimum, maximum, median, 25th and 75th quartile were evaluated for each group and compared between the groups</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Concentration of pain after surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>It means that what is the severity of the pain that the patients had in 24 hours after surgery. It evaluated with Visual Analog Scale. The most common style used in pain measurement uses a horizontal line measuring exactly 10 cm. The patient is asked to make a mark on this line (from 0 to 10), then the line is measured and recorded in millimeters or centimeters. The higher the score is the more severe the pain. The severity of the pain compared between groups as average</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Concentration of nausea after surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>It is the severity of the nausea that the patients had in 24 hours after surgery. It evaluated with Visual Analog Scale. The patient is asked to make a mark on the line (from 0 to 10), then the line is measured and recorded in millimeters or centimeters. The higher the score is the more severe the nausea. The severity of the nausea compared between groups as average</description>

    <measure>Rate of vomiting after surgery until the discharge</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>It means that how many times did patients vomit until the discharge. It evaluated as number via questionnaire. The minimum, maximum, median, 25th and 75th quartile were evaluated for each group and compared between the groups.</description>
