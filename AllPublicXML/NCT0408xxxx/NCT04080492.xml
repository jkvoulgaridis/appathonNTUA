  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, longitudinal, non-comparator, non-randomized observational cohort study to
      assess the quality of life in adult patients affected by inherited cardiac disease
      (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and thoracic aortic aneurysm) who are not amenable to surgery,
      as well as those affected by non-inherited cardiac disease caused by radiation therapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While physicians and patients may be aware of the physical limitations that result from a
      diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) or
      radiation-induced heart disease (RIHD), there is little research on the impact on quality of
      life from the limitations imposed with these diagnosis. This study aims to address these
      unknowns in patients with inherited cardiac disease as well as non-inherited
      radiation-induced cardiac disease in first-time patients at the Cleveland Clinic. Knowledge
      gained from this study will provide us the ability for better management of the chronic
      impacts of the disease by identifying potential risk factors of low quality of life or
      changes in quality of life over time.

      This is a prospective, longitudinal, non-comparator, non-randomized survey study describing
      QOL outcomes for patients with HCM, TAA, or RIHD. Patients being seen for the first time at
      the Cleveland Clinic for cardiac disease with no previous or scheduled surgery for HCM or TAA
      will electronically complete a Cardiac Quality of Life Survey at 3 time points (baseline,
      3month &amp; 9 month). The Cardiac Quality of Life Survey measures the participant's health
      status in five domains - global, physical ,emotional, social, and spiritual - as well as
      self-efficacy and resilience.

    <description>RIHD patients are asked about radiation therapy history, awareness of risk of RIHD, and impact on QOL. 7 questions. One question asks about time since last radiation therapy, ranging from 1= less than 5 years ago to 5=more than 30years ago. Another asks about time since RIHD diagnosis, ranging from 1=within the past week to 5=more than five years ago. One question asks about the duration of time between the symptoms of RIHD and diagnosis of RIHD with responses ranging from 1= less than 1 month to 5=more than 1 year. One question asks about the awareness of risk of RIHD before radiation therapy with responses ranging from 1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree. These four questions were not totaled. Three questions ask about the overall QOL before and after RIHD diagnosis and after treatment for RIHD. Responses ranged from 1=very poor to 5=very good. Total score for this section ranges from 3 to 15 with a higher score indicating RIHD had less of an impact on the overall QOL.</description>

    <description>The Cardiac Quality of Life (QOL) survey measures health status in five domains: global, physical, emotional, social, and spiritual health. It also includes questions that assess self-efficacy and resilience. The global section asks about your overall quality of life and satisfaction with health. The physical section asks about symptoms and difficulty performing day-to-day tasks. The emotional section asks about depression, anxiety, and stress. The social section asks about social support and relationships. The spiritual section asks about the spiritual outlook on the burden of heart disease. Responses on a 5-level scale.</description>
