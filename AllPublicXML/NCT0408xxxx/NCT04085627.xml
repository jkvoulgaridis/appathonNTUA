      Comparative randomized, single dose, three periods, three-way crossover open-label study to
      determine the bioequivalence of Valsartan and Amlodipine Tablets (Hua yuan Pharmaceutical
      LLC, China) and Valsartan and Amlodipine Tablets (Ⅰ) (Novartis Pharma Schweiz AG,
      Switzerland).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Cmax, Area under cover (AUC0→t and AUC0→∞ ) .Secondary
      Pharmacokinetic Parameters: tmax and t1/2. The method of judging bioequivalence of
      three-cross-section repeating experiment design: first of all, the calculation of the SWR of
      the AUC and Cmax, if SWR≥0.294, the use of RSABE analysis; if Swr&lt;0.294, the average
      Bioequivalence analysis method with Non-scale (bioequivalence limit is 80%~125 %）.

      A comprehensive final report will be issued upon the completion of the study.
