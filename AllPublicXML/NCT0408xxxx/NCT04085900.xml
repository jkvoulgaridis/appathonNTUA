      All participants will be tested for EBV associated biomarkers, including EBNA1/IgA, VCA/IgA,
      BNLF2b/IgG et al. And in males, EBV-DNA will be tested.Screening positive people will be
      followed up annually. And screening negative are invited to retest every four year.

      All subjects will also be followed by record linkage to Cancer Register and Population
      Register.

      Sample selection

      - Select communities of 20,000 to 40,000 populations in Zhongshan City as the investigators'
      fields.

      Participants recruitment

        -  Subjects voluntarily attend this screening study Informed consent - Informed consent
           forms will be collected at the recruitment. Questionnaires.

        -  Face-to-face interviews are conducted by well-trained investigators.

      Tests and follow up

        -  At initial screening, all participants will be tested for EBV associated biomarkers,
           including EBNA1/IgA, VCA/IgA, BNLF2b/IgG et al. And in males, EBV-DNA will be tested.
           Based on EBNA1/IgA, VCA/IgA, participants will be stratified into high, moderate and low
           risk. High or moderate risk will be defined as screening positive, and screening
           positive also includes people with BNLF2b/IgG positive or EBV-DNA positive. The rest
           will be screening negative.

        -  Screening positive people will be followed up annually. And screening negative are
           invited to retest every four year.

        -  During the initial screening and following up, people with high risk, or BNLF2b/IgG
           positive, or EBV-DNA positive, will refer to the diagnostic workup for NPC. Briefly,
           fiberoptic endoscopy and pathological biopsy will be performed by
           otorhinolaryngologists.

        -  The rest of the blood samples will be stored at the biobank of Zhongshan People's
           Hospital for further research.

        -  All subjects will also be followed by record linkage to Cancer Register and Population
           Register.
