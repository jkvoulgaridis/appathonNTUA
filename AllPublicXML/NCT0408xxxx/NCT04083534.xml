  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the phase 1 portion of the study, the primary objectives are to assess the safety,
      tolerability, and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and to determine a recommended phase 2 dose
      regimen (RP2DR) (defined as either a maximum tolerated dose regimen [MTDR] or biologically
      effective dose regimen [BEDR]) of REGN5459 as monotherapy in patients with relapsed or
      refractory multiple myeloma (MM) who have exhausted all therapeutic options that are expected
      to provide meaningful clinical benefit. The determination of the RP2DR will be based on the
      review of non-clinical and all clinical data, including that pertaining to safety,
      pharmacokinetic (PK), PK/pharmacodynamics (PD) relationships, and efficacy.

      In the phase 2 portion of the study, the primary objective is to assess the preliminary
      anti-tumor activity of REGN5459 as measured by objective response rate (ORR).

      In the phase 1 and phase 2 portion, the secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of REGN5459 as measured by duration of
           response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), rate of minimal residual disease (MRD)
           negative status, and overall survival (OS)

        -  To evaluate the PK properties of REGN5459

        -  To characterize the immunogenicity of REGN5459 In the phase 1 portion of the study only,
           the secondary objective of the study is to assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of
           REGN5459 as measured by ORR.

      In the phase 2 portion of the study only, the secondary objective of the study is to evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of REGN5459.
