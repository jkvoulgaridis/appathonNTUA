  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vascular and myocardial inflammation are significantly increased in Acute Coronary Syndrome
      (ACS) patients, are closely correlated to LDL-C levels, and are associated with these adverse
      consequences in the post-ACS patient population. Serum proprotein convertase subtilisin/kerin
      type 9 (PCSK9) levels are also increased in ACS, may raise LDL-C, and the investigators'
      pre-clinical studies indicate that PCSK9 is also a potent inducer of vascular inflammation.
      The addition of the PCSK9 antibody evolocumab, currently approved to lower LDL-C in certain
      patient populations, to current medical therapies would appear to be of particular benefit in
      an important subset of ACS patients, those with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) by
      markedly reducing LDL-C, stabilizing vulnerable plaque, and limiting inflammation-associated
      myocardial cell loss and resultant dysfunction.

    <textblock>
      Despite aggressive early intervention and current secondary prevention strategies, many
      patients who survive hospitalization for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)
      experience subsequent unfavorable outcomes, including recurrent ischemic events and
      unfavorable cardiac remodeling associated with progressive left ventricular dysfunction and
      congestive heart failure. Vascular and myocardial inflammation are significantly increased in
      STEMI patients, are closely correlated with LDL-C levels, and are associated with these
      adverse consequences. Serum proprotein convertase subtilisin/kerin type 9 (PCSK9) levels are
      also increased in patients with STEMI, may raise LDL-C, and the investigators' pre-clinical
      studies indicate that PCSK9 is also a potent inducer of vascular inflammation. The addition
      of evolocumab to current medical therapies may therefore be of particular benefit in these
      patients, by markedly reducing LDL-C, stabilizing vulnerable plaque, and limiting
      inflammation-associated myocardial cell loss and resultant dysfunction.

      In this study, the investigators propose to test the effects of PCSK9 inhibition with
      evolocumab on LDL-C reduction, vascular and myocardial inflammation, cardiac function, and
      clinical outcomes in a STEMI patient cohort.

      The investigators propose a double-blind randomized study of 100 patients presenting with an
      ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). One hundred STEMI patients will be randomized to
      evolocumab, 420 mg or to placebo (50 in each group) during early hospitalization and will
      also receive current guideline-directed STEMI therapy. Lipid profiles, including
      LDL-cholesterol levels, and traditional and novel serum markers of inflammation and
      endothelial function will be measured at presentation, during the index hospitalization, and
      at 30-day and six-month follow-up. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans to measure
      myocardial and vascular inflammation and echocardiograms will be performed during the early
      post-infarction period and at thirty days and six-month following randomization and, in a
      subset, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging will be performed during the early post-infarction
      period and at six months. Clinical outcomes, such as angina class, will also be collected at
      the six-month follow-up visit.
