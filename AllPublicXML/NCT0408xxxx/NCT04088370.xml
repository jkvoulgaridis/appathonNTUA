  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory responses in response to alcohol have been identified as contributing to the
      development of alcoholic hepatitis. The inflammatory response including that to
      LippoPolySaccharide is known to lead to progression of alcoholic liver disease. In addition
      to the inflammatory response mitochondrial perturbations exist and redox homeostasis is
      altered in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. Though this is known there have been very few
      studies targeting mitochondrial function in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs). We
      plan to collect 50 milliliters of blood from healthy control patients so that we can compare
      the data to that of patients with alcoholic hepatitis and those who are heavy drinkers
      without liver disease. In addition to studying mitochondrial function we will investigate
      cytokine response, as well as fatty acid metabolism, glucose, and insulin measurements

        values with noted encounter in Cleveland Clinic Electronic Medical Record,

        Heavy Drinking Controls - patients who lack any evidence (biochemical, imaging, and/or
        biopsy) of alcoholic liver disease who consume &gt;40 g/day or &gt;280g/week on average for women
        and &gt;60 g/day or &gt;420 g/week on average for men for a minimum of 6 months
