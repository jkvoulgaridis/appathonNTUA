  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a plant-based diet and a
      portion-controlled diet on weight, muscle and liver fat content, total and LDL (&quot;bad&quot;)
      cholesterol, insulin sensitivity, and metabolism (your body's use of calories) after meals.

    <textblock>
      Using a cross-over design, participants with type 2 diabetes will be randomly assigned to
      start with a plant-based or a portion-controlled diet for 22 weeks. The two groups will then
      switch to the opposite diet regimen for an additional 22 weeks. Before and after each
      intervention period, the investigators will measure intramuscular and liver fat content and
      assess their relationship with insulin sensitivity and glycemic control. We hypothesize that
      both diets will result in reductions in intramuscular and liver fat content and that these
      changes will be associated with improvements in insulin sensitivity and glycemic control in
      individuals with type 2 diabetes. We further hypothesize that a plant-based diet will elicit
      greater changes in intracellular lipid concentration, compared with a portion-controlled
      diet.
