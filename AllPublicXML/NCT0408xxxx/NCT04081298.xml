  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how to improve the diet quality and physical activity level of Latino
      cancer survivors living in rural areas. The recommendation to eat a high-quality diet and
      engage in moderate-to-vigorous physical exercise may reduce cancer risk, improve cancer
      survival rate, and reduce associated conditions. However, it is not well understood how best
      to teach cancer survivors, especially Latino cancer survivors living in rural areas, to
      achieve and maintain diet and physical activity. Understanding how to build a culturally
      appropriate education that is effective may improve the diet quality and physical activity
      level of Latino cancer survivors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Assess feasibility of in‐person group classes and electronic (e)Health intervention
      strategies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Assess changes from baseline to 6 months in diet quality and minutes per week of moderate
      to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and evaluate any differences in these changes between
      the two intervention arms.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete questionnaires, undergo 3 24-hour dietary recalls over 3 days, and wear an
      Actigraph over 7 continuous days. After 2-3 weeks, patients receive a FitBit to monitor
      physical activity. Patients are then assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients attend 4 in-person hands-on nutrition and physical activity (PA) education
      classes, cooking sessions, field trips, and participate in physical activities for 4 hours
      each. Patients wear a FitBit and Actigraph to monitor physical activity.

      ARM II: Patients receive motivational text messages 2-3 times per week and access to a
      nutrition website for 26 weeks. Patients wear a FitBit and Actigraph to monitor physical
      activity.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up periodically.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must self-identify as Latino

          -  Participants must be a resident of the Lower Yakima Valley (LYV) and anticipate
             remaining in the LYV for at least 1 year

          -  Participants must speak Spanish or English and fully understand Spanish for in-person
             group classes

          -  Participants must self-identify as having a medical history of cancer (excluding
             non‐melanoma skin cancer). All other cancer types will be included provided

          -  There is no evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease

          -  The patient has not received a bone marrow, stem cell, or cord blood transplant

          -  Participants must self-identify as being at least 60 days post final chemotherapy,
             biologic therapy, or radiation therapy treatment and/or surgery. Current use of
             hormonal therapy is permitted (e.g., tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors)

          -  Participants must be willing and able to receive text messages via cellphone for 6
             months

          -  Participants must be willing and able to attend four 4-hour in-person group sessions
             in Sunnyside, Washington (WA)

          -  Participants must be willing to complete the surveys, anthropometrics, diet/PA
             assessments, and stool sample collection

          -  Participants must not be active smokers within the past 30 days. Active smoking is
             defined as any smoking, even a puff. Participants who smoke are much less likely to
             engage in healthy lifestyle behaviors, and it is probably more important for
             participants to stop smoking than it is to change their dietary patterns. If
             identified as a smoker, the individual will be referred the Centers for Disease
             Control (CDC) &quot;Quit Now&quot; phone line which supports smoking cessation, or the National
             Institutes of Health (NIH) quite support website SmokeFree.gov which are both
             available in English and Spanish

          -  Participants who report having been told by a health professional they have diabetes
             or cardiovascular disease must provide a clearance from their physician for
             participation

          -  Participants must consume &lt; 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day and/or engage
             in &lt; 150 minutes per week of moderate to vigorous physical activity, as assessed by
             brief questionnaires

          -  Participants must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale of
             performance status score of 0 or 1 for performance status. These scales and criteria
             are commonly used by doctors and trained research staff to assess a person's daily
             living abilities. We will train the community health educators (CHEs) to assess the
             performance status of potential participants during the baseline home visit. Scores of
             0 and 1 corresponds to being fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease
             performance without restriction; and restricted in physically strenuous activity but
             ambulatory and able to carry our work of a light or sedentary nature, respectively

          -  Women must not be pregnant at time of enrollment

          -  Depending on preference, the consent will be provided in English or Spanish
