      Vitrectomy is required for removal of vitreous hemorrhage or retinal traction tissue in some
      patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Post-vitrectomy macular edema may occur in
      these diabetic patients. Intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents or corticosteroid are
      required for treating diabetic macular edema (DME) in vitrectomized eyes. Intraocular levels
      of various cytokines may alter in the diabetic eyes following vitrectomy. Pharmacokinetics
      may be different between various intraocular agents in vitrectomized eyes. Herein our study
      will prospectively randomize to compare the clinical behavior between intravitreal
      ranibizumab (IVR) and intravitreal dexamethasone implant (IDI) in vitrectomized patients with
      DME. To our knowledge, it is the first study involving such subject.

      Vitrectomy is required for removal of vitreous hemorrhage or retinal traction tissue in some
      patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Post-vitrectomy macular edema may occur in
      these diabetic patients. Intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents or corticosteroid are
      required for treating diabetic macular edema (DME) in vitrectomized eyes. Intraocular levels
      of various cytokines may alter in the diabetic eyes following vitrectomy. Pharmacokinetics
      may be different between various intraocular agents in vitrectomized eyes. Herein our study
      will prospectively randomize to compare the clinical behavior between intravitreal
      ranibizumab (IVR) and intravitreal dexamethasone implant (IDI) in vitrectomized patients with
      DME. To our knowledge, it is the first study involving such subject.

      Pseudophakic vitrectomized eyes with treatment-naïve center-involved DME will be enrolled
      with one eye in each patient. They are randomized into one group receiving IDI every 3 to 4
      months, and the other group undergoing IVR using 3 monthly plus treat-and-extend injections
      all with monthly follow-up for 6 months. Switch of intravitreal drugs or deferred macular
      laser is not allowed. Primary outcome measures include change in central foveal thickness
      (CFT) in 1 mm by spectral-domain optic coherence tomography, and best corrected visual acuity
      (BCVA) at Month 6. Primary outcome measures include change in CFT and BCVA at Month 6.
      Injection number, BCVA, CFT, post-injection complications, and IOP are recorded and compared
      with Wilcoxon signed rank test within the group and Wilcoxon rank sum test between groups.
      Fisher's exact test is used for categorical comparison between groups. P value less than 0.05
      is considered significant.

    <description>The eyes undergo dexamethasone intravitreal implant 0.7 mg injections at baseline and every 3 or 4 months thereafter. Dexamethasone implants are re-injected in minimal 3-month interval if macular edema persisted or recurred with CFT more than 350 μm or manifestation of apparent submacular fluid and/or intramacular cysts. If DME subside with CFT less than 350 μm without accompanying fluid and cysts, repeated injection is mandatory in maximal 4-month interval.</description>

    <description>As for intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5 mg (IVR), we use OCT-guided treat-and-extend protocol for DME treatment after modifying the settings of TREX-DME study.4 The regimen include 3 monthly loading doses then extending the treatment injection interval one month more if CFT less than 350 μm without obvious submacular fluid and intramacular cysts. The injection interval shorten one month if CFT more than 350 μm or presence of obvious fluid and/or cysts. The patients are intentionally injected at most every 3 months even DME not existing.</description>
