  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clear, concise, yes, and no answers can be challenging to achieve in the assessment of
      consciousness and breathing in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) calls. Often callers
      will provide an unclear response, and this can lead to hesitation on the part of the
      Emergency Medical Dispatcher (EMD). Further, the relatively small proportion OHCA calls
      represent might demand the need for simulation training in the dispatcher-assisted
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DA-CPR) guiding itself. Therefore, the investigators
      investigate whether low-dose, high-frequency (LDHF) simulation-based training of EMDs can
      increase the quality of DA-CPR in a simulation setting. Additionally, the investigators
      measure whether the effect of the training will be transferred to real OHCA calls.

      The study is a randomised controlled trial comparing LDHF simulation-based training to
      standard quality improvement of the EMD in a single centre. The study protocol is structured
      according to the SPIRIT 2013 statement, and the study will be reported in compliance with the
      CONSORT 2010 Statement. The investigators chose EMDs receiving standard quality improvement
      as the comparator group, to reflect a representative cohort of the EMDs not exposed to the
      LDHF simulation-based training program.

      The aims of this study are:

        1. To measure the effect of LDHF simulation-based training on the quality of DA-CPR in a
           simulation setting.

        2. To measure the effect of LDHF simulation-based training on the quality of DA-CPR in real
           OHCA calls.

      The investigators hypothesise that LDHF simulation-based training will increase the quality
      of DA-CPR in the intervention group in a simulation setting and that this improvement is
      transferred to real OHCA calls - although the effect in real OHCA calls might be smaller due
      to the complexity of some calls. The investigators hypothesise that this improvement can be
      detected as a decrease in time to first bystander compression (TTFC), an increase in
      clarification of consciousness and breathing without asking additional questions, a decrease
      in time to recognition of cardiac arrest, and an increase in calls where the EMD provide
      DA-CPR instructions on patients in cardiac arrest.

    <intervention_model_description>After enrolment and consent from the EMDs, the EMDs will be randomly assigned to receive either LDHF simulation-based dispatcher training (intervention arm) or no LDHF simulation-based dispatcher training (comparison arm).
The EMDs will be randomly assigned to intervention or comparison group in a 1:1 ratio.
Randomisation will be stratified by the EMDs' medical backgrounds (paramedic, approximately 30% of the EMDs, or registered nurse, approximately 70% of the EMDs), to balance the number of EMDs with different medical backgrounds randomly assigned to each arm.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The research group and the participants will not be blinded to the allocation, except for the study statistician (A.K.E.), who will conduct all analyses blinded to the intervention group. Thus, the study statistician will not have access to the randomisation scheme or the random seed and will receive a dataset with the actual groups replaced with the numbers 0 and 1</masking_description>

    <description>Twelve weeks of LDHF training
The simulation-based training sessions take place at the EMDC, at extra workstations set-up as ordinary EMD workstations in an out-of-the-way area. Before each session, the EMD is informed about the simulation call and receives instructions concerning technical differences from a regular call. The instructor acts as a &quot;standardised caller&quot;, guided by a computer program. This program, the Danish version of Resuscitation Quality Improvement for Telecommunicators (Laerdal Medical AS, Stavanger, Norway), is a training program for DA-CPR based on the simulation platform Laerdal Learning Application. This modified version of the RQI-T program has, one test scenario, one data collection scenario and six different cardiac arrests scenarios as well as a feedback checklist based on the Danish dispatcher protocol Danish Index for Emergency Care.
Each simulation session takes approximately 20 minutes, including introduction and feedback</description>
