  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of delirium following open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) surgery is
      significant, with incidence rates ranging from 12 to 33%. The occurrence of delirium on the
      surgical ward after intensive care unit (ICU) dismissal in AAA patients remains unclear.
      Differences in outcomes between a delirium on the ICU and a delirium on the surgical ward
      have not been previously investigated.

      Delirium is a frequent complication in patients who underwent open AAA surgery. This study
      demonstrated that patients on the surgical ward remain at risk for developing a delirium
      after ICU dismissal. Physicians should therefore maintain a high level of awareness for
      delirium in AAA patients who return to the surgical ward after ICU dismissal. This
      simultaneously emphasises the necessity of delirium preventive measures and early recognition
      on the surgical ward in order to improve clinical outcomes.

      The incidence of delirium following open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) surgery is
      significant, with incidence rates ranging from 12 to 33%. The occurrence of delirium on the
      surgical ward after intensive care unit (ICU) dismissal in AAA patients remains unclear.
      Differences in outcomes between a delirium on the ICU and a delirium on the surgical ward
      have not been previously investigated.

      An observational cohort study was conducted that included all patients treated electively for
      an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) by open repair and patients undergoing emergency treatment
      for a ruptured AAA between 2013 and 2018. The diagnosis of delirium was verified by a
      psychiatrist or geriatrician using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
      (DSM-V) criteria. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to analyse 6- and
      12-months survival rate.
