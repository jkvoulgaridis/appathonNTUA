  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b open-label study to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of AB122 in
      biomarker-selected participants with advanced solid tumors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AB122 every 3 weeks (Q3W) will be evaluated in molecularly defined patient populations as
      described by the StrataNGS test (to be performed outside of this study protocol).
      Participants with any advanced tumor type will be stratified evenly by tumor biomarker status
      as follows: TMB-H or Strata Immune Signature positive. Each cohort may enroll approximately
      40 participants. Following completion of and/or discontinuation from investigational product
      and follow-up, all participants will be followed for survival.
