  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2/3, randomized, open-label study for the treatment of patients with
      HER2-positive Gastric cancer (GC) or Gastroesophageal Junction (GEJ) cancer to determine the
      efficacy of margetuximab combined with INCMGA00012 (also known as MGA012) (Cohort A) and
      margetuximab combined with INCMGA00012 or MGD013 and chemotherapy compared to trastuzumab
      combined with chemotherapy (Cohort B).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single-arm cohort (Cohort A, 40 to 110 patients) will evaluate safety and efficacy of
      margetuximab plus INCMGA00012. In a 4-arm cohort (Cohort B Part 1, 50 patients per arm),
      patients will be randomized to margetuximab plus chemotherapy plus INCMGA00012, margetuximab
      plus chemotherapy plus MGD013, margetuximab plus chemotherapy, or trastuzumab plus
      chemotherapy. A checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) (INCMGA00012 or MGD013) will be selected from
      Cohort B Part 1 and evaluated in a randomized 2-arm cohort (Cohort B Part 2, 250 patients per
      arm) of margetuximab plus chemotherapy plus INCMGA00012 or MGD013, or trastuzumab plus
      chemotherapy.
