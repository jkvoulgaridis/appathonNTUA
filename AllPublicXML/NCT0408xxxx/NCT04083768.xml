  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recommended position of the mother under caesarean section after spinal anesthesia is 15
      degrees left. However, recent research has challenged the basic principles and practicality
      of the left-turn 15 degree position. Higuchi et al used nuclear magnetic imaging to directly
      prove that in the supine position, the position of the full-left 30 degrees of the full-term
      pregnancy of the full-term pregnancy relieved the inferior vena cava compression and the
      left-angle of 15 degrees did not. Therefore, there are more and more controversies about the
      choice of cesarean section position. This experiment aims to explore effects of different
      positions (15 degrees left, 30 degrees left and supine) for elective cesarean section on
      lumbar anesthesia for fetal acid-base balance and maternal Hemodynamic.

    <textblock>
      When the pregnant woman in the third trimester is in the supine position, the enlarged uterus
      may oppress the inferior vena cava, thereby reducing the amount of blood and heart output of
      the pregnant woman. This affects the mother mainly, such as dizziness, nausea and vomiting,
      chills, and severe irritability，difficulty breathing or even cardiac arrest, the impact on
      the fetus is mainly the reduction of blood flow in the placenta, affecting the blood exchange
      of the uterus placenta, causing neonatal respiratory distress, acidosis and even death. The
      recommended position of the mother under caesarean section after spinal anesthesia is 15
      degrees left. However, recent research has challenged the basic principles and practicality
      of the left-turn 15 degree position. Higuchi et al used nuclear magnetic imaging to directly
      prove that in the supine position, the position of the full-left 30 degrees of the full-term
      pregnancy of the full-term pregnancy relieved the inferior vena cava compression and the
      left-angle of 15 degrees did not. Therefore, there are more and more controversies about the
      choice of cesarean section position. This experiment aims to explore effects of different
      positions (15 degrees left, 30 degrees left and supine) for elective cesarean section on
