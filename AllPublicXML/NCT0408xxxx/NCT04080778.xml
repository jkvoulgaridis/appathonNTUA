    <description>Remission is defined as a score of 4 or below as assessed by The Severity Measure for Depression-Adult measure (adapted from the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]). The Severity Measure for Depression-Adult measure is a 9-item scale, and each item on the measure is rated on a 4-point scale. The total score ranges from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating greater severity of depression.</description>

    <description>MST will be performed with the MagPro XP (120 V) device under anesthesia 2-3 times a week up to 15 sessions.Treatment is performed by magnetic stimulation of both hemispheres inducing a focal stimulation above vertex, using a serial of pulse trains with a frequency of at least 25 Hz but up to 100 Hz for 4-6 s (up to 10 s), which is sufficient to induce a tonic clonic seizure.</description>

    <description>ECT will be performed with MECTA 5000Q, 4th generation ECT devices provided by MECTA Corporation under anesthesia 2-3 times a week up to 15 sessions.For initial procedure Seizure Threshold (ST) will be estimated by empiric titration in the first session of each participant. ST will be then determined as by the manufacturer of ECT Device by the titration schedule for the initial titration session.The subsequent treatment sessions were dosed at 6 times the charge of the seizure threshold.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are diagnosed by Bipolar I or II, current episode depressed who require a
             rapid response due to the severity of their psychiatric or medical condition

          -  Patients of any race and ethnic group

          -  Ability to provide informed consent or assent

          -  Ability to adhere to the study procedures

          -  For females of reproductive potential:use of highly effective contraception for at
             least 1 month prior to screening and agreement to use such a method during study
             participation and for an additional one week after the end of ECT/transcranial
             magnetic stimulation (TMS) administration. Of note, ECT is indicated in depression
             during pregnancy and has been safely used for decades but MST's effects on fetus are
             still unknown

          -  For males of reproductive potential: use of condoms or other methods to ensure
             effective contraception with partner

          -  Has sufficient English in completing self-rated scales

          -  Good general health evidenced by obtained medical clearance before the procedures from
             another provider

          -  On a stable drug regimen of psychotropic medication for at least 6 weeks at the time
             of entry into the study. Medication changes can be made during patient's study
             participation but would be limited to the clinical judgment of the PI

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have an implanted device that is activated or controlled in any way by
             physiological signals (examples: pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators
             [ICD's], vagus nerve simulators (VNS) and wearable cardioverter-defibrillators
             (WCD's),ocular implants, deep brain stimulators, implanted medication pumps,
             intracardiac lines, even when removed

          -  Patients who have conductive, ferromagnetic or other magnetic sensitive metals
             implanted in their head or within 30 cm of the treatment coil such as stents and
             bullet fragments).Standard amalgam dental fillings are not affected by the magnetic
             field and are acceptable in patients

          -  Patients suffering from vascular, traumatic, infectious, or metabolic lesions of the
             brain, even without a history of seizure, or without anticonvulsant medication

          -  Patient suffering from sleep deprivation or alcoholism. Current or unstably remitted
             substance use disorder except nicotine or caffeine use disorder. Stable remission is
             defined as remission for at least 6 months

          -  Pregnant or nursing patients

          -  Patients with a history of epilepsy or unexplained seizures

          -  Subjects with a history of space-occupying intracranial pathology

          -  diseases which render a patient likely to suffer hemorrhage, including subdural
             hematoma, and aortic aneurysm

          -  degenerative diseases of the central nervous system such as dementia or medical
             illness affecting brain function

          -  Any anaesthesia contraindications including significant cardiac or other medical risk
             factors.

          -  Body Mass Index over 60, as the investigator's ECT suite stretchers are not equipped
             to handle overweight patients

          -  History of severe personality disorder, where, based on the judgment of the
             investigators, the personality disorder will interfere with the patient's ability to
             complete the follow-up protocol,example,borderline personality disorder

          -  Imminent risk of suicide (based on the judgment of the investigators; e.g. patient has
             a plan for suicide, patient is not likely to seek medical attention in case of
             suicide, patient exhibits the presence of current suicidal ideation

          -  Not able to comply with the operational and administrative requirements of
             participation in the study (based on the judgment of the investigators)

          -  Terminal illness associated with expected survival of &lt;12 months

          -  Bipolar Depression with psychotic features

          -  Known allergic reactions to components of anaesthetic or induction agents including
             succinylcholine, methohexital, ketamine, propofol, ketorolac

          -  Participation in another drug, device, or biologics trial within the preceding 30 days

          -  Disallowed concomitant medications: antiepileptics and benzodiazepines as they are
             against seizure therapies, short or mid acting benzodiazepines such as alprazolam,
             temazepam, midazolam, lorazepam will be allowed but they should be skipped at least 10
             hours before the procedures. Medications that are supposed to have weak antiepileptic
             features such as lamotrigine, topiramate, gabapentin will be reviewed by the PI and
             either tapered down or discontinued based upon clinical judgment. Lithium will be
             tapered off before the procedure because of the increased risk of postictal
             disorientation and delirium.
