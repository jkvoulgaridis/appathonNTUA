  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In T1D, the destruction of beta-pancreatic cells causes insulin deficiency and requires
      insulin therapy whose control remains complex: even with recent technologies of continuous
      measurement and monitoring of blood glucose (CGM), current systems are electrochemical,
      insulin therapy algorithms do not are not optimal and cannot completely eliminate vital risks
      such as hypoglycemia. A new biosensor connected to the patient by microdialysis, will be
      tested in a clinical trial in CHU-Bdx on 10 T1D patients with an internal or external insulin
      pump. In various daily scenarios (meals, physical exercise) the biosensor DIABLO responses
      will be compared to the measurements of standard CGM systems.

    <textblock>
      Continuous monitoring and linked drug delivery is a novel approach to the treatment of
      chronic diseases that provides powerful means to improve therapeutic outcomes and quality of
      patient's life. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) concerns 5 to 10% of the estimated 415 million cases of
      diabetes worldwide in 2016, expected to rise to 642 million by 2040(1). Continuous glucose
      monitoring systems (CGMS) linked to insulin delivery has provided a major advance(2). T1D is
      a serious, currently chronic and costly disease in children or young adults. Indeed, the
      destruction of pancreatic beta-cells leads to absolute insulin deficiency in T1D.
