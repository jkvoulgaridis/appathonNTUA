  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heavy episodic drinking and sexual assault (SA) are problematic on college campuses. This
      project will adapt already developed interventions targeting alcohol use and SA to a mHealth
      format and involve content that incorporates federal guidelines and CDC recommendations to
      integrate both bystander intervention and risk reduction content with new innovative
      personalized content for each risk group (cis-gender heterosexual men, cis-gender
      heterosexual women, and sexual/gender minorities). Alpha testing with key stakeholders, an
      open pilot trial, and a randomized pilot trial will be conducted to establish acceptability
      and to estimate sample size for a larger randomized controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific aims are as follows:

      Aim 1 (Stage IA): Modify Alcohol and Sexual Assault Prevention (ASAP) content to an eHealth
      format to include personalized content for each risk group (1. cisgender heterosexual men; 2.
      cisgender heterosexual women; and 3. sexual and gender minorities).

      Aim 1a: Assess normative behaviors (n = 500) regarding alcohol use and SA for feedback.

      Aim 1b: Adapt and assess initial acceptability of a workbook version of the intervention
      content among key stakeholders (college administrators and students from each risk group [n=5
      from each group]).

      Aim 2 (Stage IB): Open Pilot Trial. Obtain usability of ASAP among 30 students who engage in
      HED (10 from each risk group) in an open pilot trial.

      Aim 3 (Stage IB): A pilot to assess effect size and variability for planning a randomized
      trial in the future. Randomize students who engage in HED to ASAP or control condition to
      observe preliminary effect sizes and estimate the variability using a 3-month follow-up.
      Sample size was determined to estimate the variability within a reasonable margin of error.
      This calculation also accounted the low base rates of SA and 20% attrition. This led to a
      sample size of 162 students (n=54 from each risk group).

    <measure>Sexual Experiences Survey - Short Form Perpetration</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>35 items total. Participants indicate the number of times that they did each act ranging from 0 (never) to 3 (3 or more times), with total scores ranging from 0 to 105 with greater scores indicating more perpetration. The mutually exclusive scoring system will be used. The goal is to count people only once according to the most severe act perpetrated.</description>

    <measure>Sexual Experiences Survey - Short Form Victimization</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>35 items total, with total scores ranging from 0 to 105, with higher scores indicating more self-reported sexual assault victimization.

    <measure>Alcohol Quantity Frequency Index</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Scale Range- Frequency: 0 to 4 (with increasing responses indicating increased frequency of alcohol use). Quantity: 0 to 5 (with higher numbers indicating higher use of alcohol) The maximum and minimum number of drinks that could be consumed is calculated for each combined quantity (the highest response category for the quantity question was allocated a score of 10) and frequency category. The mean of these two values represents the average number of standard drinks consumed/week. For example, three or four, two or three times a week is scored as nine standard drinks/week An additional question was utilized to assess heavy episodic drinking, &quot;over the past month, how many times have you had 4 or more drinks for women, or 5 or more drinks for men, over a 2-hour period?&quot; Responses ranged from: (min=0; max=undefined) Scores of 1 or higher indicated past-month heavy episodic drinking, with higher scores indicating increased frequency</description>

Frequency and quantity can be calculated based on participant scores Frequency: ranged from 0-7, with higher scores indicating increased frequency of drinking Quantity: ranged from 0 to undefined (max), based on the number of drinks consumed on day of the average week, with higher scores indicating increased quantity of drinking.</description>
