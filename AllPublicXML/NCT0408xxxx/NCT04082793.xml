  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck cancer originate from the several different anatomical subsites especially the
      squamous cell carcinoma. This involves mainly Oropharynx, Hypopharynx, and Larynx. The common
      treatment approaches for HNC is radiation therapy, alone or combined with chemotherapy and
      surgery. In the present scenario, very little literature is available improving the QOL by
      physiotherapeutic measures in patients with HNC. To improve QOL, a well-designed study is
      needed. The study will be a two-group pretest-posttest design. The study will include
      patients with HNC receiving radiation or chemotherapy. One group will receive
      photobiomodulation therapy and another group will receive Sonophoresis. Both the group will
      receive Mandibular mobilization and stabilization exercises after electrotherapy. The
      Algometer, Digital Vernier caliper and core measure Questionnaire-C30 (QLQ-C30) will be used
      as an outcome measure to measure the effect of interventions between baseline and
      post-interventions.

      The trial will include two experimental groups. The study design will be two groups
      pretest-posttest design. The study will recruit patients with HNC receiving radiation or
      chemotherapy. The study will be conducted in Tertiary care teaching hospital, in the
      departments of Radiotherapy and physiotherapy of Maharishi Markandeshwar Hospital, Maharishi
      Markandeshwar Deemed to be University, Mullana, Ambala. Total of 48 patients will be
      recruited in the study. Patients will be randomized by block randomization method into two
      groups. One group will receive Photobiomodulation therapy whereas another group will receive
      Sonophoresis. Mandibular mobilization and stabilization exercises will be given to both
      groups. The intervention will be given for 4 weeks. Three sessions of photobiomodulation
      therapy will be given per week on alternating days for 12 minutes, whereas three sessions of
      sonophoresis will also be given per week on alternating days for 8 minutes. Mandibular
      mobilization, as well as stabilization exercises, will be advised to perform regularly
      continuously for 4 weeks. There will be blinding of patients who will receive the therapy,
      therapist who will administer the therapy, and therapist who will assess the patients,
      therefore, the study will follow triple blinding.Algometer for pain measurement, Digital
      vernier caliper for measuring mandibular mobility and Core measure Questionnaire-C30
      (QLQ-C30) for measuring the quality of life in patients with head and neck cancer will be
      taken as outcome measures. The outcomes will be taken before giving intervention, then again
      after 2 weeks of interventions and again on another 2 weeks of intervention.

    <description>The questionnaire are designed to measure physical, social and psychological functions of patients with cancer. The questionnaire contains physical, social, emotional and cognitive functioning multi item scales and 9 single items. These items are pain, fatigue, financial impact, appetite loss, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, sleep disturbance and quality of life. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Time required for administration is 10 to 15 minutes.</description>
