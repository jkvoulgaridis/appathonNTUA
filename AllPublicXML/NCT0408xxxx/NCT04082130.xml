    <textblock>
      this study is a Clinical evaluation of using Xenogenic collagen matrix (XCM) plus coronally
      advanced flap (CAF) compared to subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) plus coronally
      advanced using flap to treat Miller class I or II gingival recession. A full thickness flap
      will be elevated in the (XCM+CAF) group while it will be a partial thickness flap in the
      (SCTG+CAF) group. The sample size will be 15 patients. Each patient has bilateral Miller
      Class I or II gingival recessions; and as a split-mouth study design one side will be treated
      with (SCTG+CAF), while the other will be treated with (XCM+CAF).

      The aim of this study is to clinically compare between the subepithelial connective tissue
      graft (SCTG) plus coronally advanced flap (CAF) which is defined as the golden standard for
      the treatment of gingival recessions and Xenogenic collagen matrix (XCM) plus coronally
      advanced flap (CAF) to treat class I or II Miller gingival recession. The flap will be
      partially elevated in the (SCTG+CAF) group while it will be a full thickness flap in the
      (XCM+CAF) group, in both groups releasing incisions will be done and finally the flap will
      stabilized at 1 mm coronally to the CEJ level of the tooth. Fifteen patients who have
      bilateral buccal Miller Class I or II gingival recession defects will be enrolled in this
      study. These defects will be distributed randomly into two groups: the test group (XCM+CAF)
      and control group (SCTG+CAF). Clinical parameters will be evaluated: Recession depth (REC),
      change in visible plaque index, recession width (RW), width of keratinized tissue (KT),
      thickness of gingival tissue (GT), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL),
      healing index (HI), questionnaires will be given to evaluate each patient perception, pain
      index (PI), and changes in root sensitivity by using visual analog scale (VAS) and questions
      about the number of analgesic pills consumed per day.

    <description>Surgical protocol for test treatment with CAF + XCM:
Local anesthesia to anesthetize the recipient site, after that root preparation will be done. sulcular incision will be made at the recession site and will be extended horizontally into the adjacent interdental regions. Bilateral vertical releasing incisions will be made, connected to the horizontal incision, and will be extended out into the lining mucosa. A full-thickness flap will be elevated until the mucogingival junction. a periosteal release will be made to eliminate tension and advance the flap coronally, then de-epithelializing The facial aspects of the interdental papillae and Root surface conditioning will be made. After that the investigators will apply XCM (Geistlich Fibro-Gide® ) onto the surface 1-2 mm coronally of the CEJ. Finally, The mucoperiosteal flap will be coronally advanced to cover the XCM and then sutured to the de-epithelialized papillae.</description>

    <description>The surgical protocol in the control group will be identical with test group protocol with these expectation:
A partial thickness flap will be elevated instead of full thickness flap.
A SCTG harvested from the palate will be used to cover the exposed denuded root surface in lieu of placement of XCM in the test group. And reabsorbable sutures will be used to stabilize it 2 mm coronally from the CEJ.
As in the test group the mucosal flap will passively coronally advanced to completely cover the SCTG.</description>
