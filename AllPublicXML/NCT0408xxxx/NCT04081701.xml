  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study population consists of patients who undergo resection for somatostatin
      receptor-positive (SSTR-positive) CNS tumors, focusing on meningioma, and including
      esthesioneuroblastoma, hemangioblastoma, medulloblastoma, paraganglioma, pituitary adenoma,
      and SSTR-positive systemic cancers metastatic to the brain, such as small cell carcinoma of
      the lung. The study indication is to determine the diagnostic utility of 68Ga-DOTATATE
      PET/MRI in the diagnosis and management of patients with SSTR-positive CNS tumors,
      specifically whether 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/MRI demonstrates utility distinguishing between tumor
      recurrence and post-treatment change. To date, the utility of Ga-68-DOTATATE PET/MRI in
      meningioma has not been explored. Investigators have over the past 3 months been able to
      accrue the largest case series of presently 12 patients in whom Ga-68-DOTATATE PET/MRI
      demonstrated utility in the assessment of meningioma, including assessment for
      postsurgical/postradiation recurrence, detection of additional lesions not visualized on MRI
      alone, and evaluation of osseous invasion. Based on this initial experience, investigators
      intend to study the impact of Ga-68-DOTATATE PET/MRI in the assessment of the extent of
      residual tumor in patients status post meningioma resection, specifically in patients in whom
      tumor location limits resectability, patients with World Health Organization (WHO) grade
      II/III disease, and patients with history of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) who develop
      postradiation change.

    <description>In patients with meningioma who are undergoing surgical planning, subjects will undergo a PET scan at the time of their pretreatment or preoperative standard of care MRI exam, prior to surgery performed for research purposes. Instead of the standard of care MRI exam, subjects will undergo a dedicated hybrid Gallium-68-DOTATATE PET/MRI.There will be up to two follow-up with Ga68-DOTATATE PET/MRI scans performed as standard of care.
In patients with SSTR-positive CNS tumors that are non-meningioma, MRI is often performed to assess extent of disease. Subjects may be asked to undergo a PET scan for research purposes at the time of their standard of care MRI. Instead of the standard of care MRI exam, they may be asked to undergo a dedicated hybrid Gallium-68-DOTATATE PET/MRI.</description>
