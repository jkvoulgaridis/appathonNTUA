    <textblock>
      There is still controversy over the best LPS agent and protocol and its dose and duration as
      well as the time of initiation and cessation.

      There are many protocols of luteal support in assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles.
      Luteal phase support with progesterone is a standard approach for ART cycles .

      Initial studies in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) patients
      have demonstrated that the use of a GnRH agonist (GnRHa) trigger, followed by fresh transfer
      and a standard luteal phase support (LPS) was associated with unacceptably high rates of loss
      in early pregnancy compared to hCG trigger, particularly in normal responder (NR) patients.

      During IVF and fresh embryo transfer, the luteal function is disrupted and the success of the
      treatment is critically dependent on exogenous luteal phase support

      During the last decade, two different modified LPS strategies have been proposed to overcome
      the mentioned luteal phase deficiency. One of these approaches has been called the &quot;European
      approach&quot; in which the endogenous steroid (progesterone and estradiol) production by the
      corpora lutea is boosted by exogenous LH activity, i.e., LH or hCG after GnRHa trigger. The
      other approach has been called the &quot;American approach&quot; in which luteal progesterone and
      estradiol are administered exogenously, thus, disregarding the function of the corpora lutea.

      It has been subsequently concluded that this early pregnancy loss was caused by luteal phase
      (LP) insufficiency, despite the use of a standard LPS package of progesterone (P) and
      estradiol (E2). The LP defect was primarily caused by reduced early-mid-luteal luteinizing
      hormone (LH) activity, resulting in a significant reduction in progesterone output by the
      corpora lutea (CL) as no adverse effects were seen with respect to the maturity rate of
      oocytes, fertilization rates, embryo quality, and reproductive outcomes during the subsequent
      replacement of frozen embryos derived from women who had received a GnRHa trigger .

      Transvaginal progesterone is commonly used for luteal phase support. Progesterone
      administration is initiated on the oocyte pick-up (OPU) day and continued for 12 days, until
      the serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) measurement day. However, there are
      conflicting results regarding the dose, route of administration (oral, subcutaneous,
      transvaginal), duration (until the ultrasound demonstration of heartbeat in an intrauterine
      gestational sac, until 10 weeks of gestation, until 12 weeks of gestation), and formulations
      such as synthetic or micronized types of progesterone.

      A bolus of GnRHa, when administered 6 days after OPU in GnRH antagonist cycles, is able to
      induce a surge of pituitary gonadotropins (FSH and LH), eliciting an increase in steroid
      production (E2 and P) by the CL.

      The exact mechanism behind the presumed beneficial effect of LP GnRHa administration remains
      poorly defined. It has been hypothesized that GnRHa either supports CL function by inducing
      LH secretion by the pituitary gonadotrophic cells or stimulates the endometrial GnRH
      receptors.

      Tesarik postulated a direct effect of GnRHa on the embryo, as suggested by an increase in
      Î²-HCG secretion.

      Importantly, there are significant differences in the early-mid-LP endocrine pattern when
      GnRHa triggers and hCG triggers are compared, especially in terms of LH levels. From this, it
      could be hypothesized that the GnRHa-triggered IVF cycle could benefit more from the addition
      of a bolus of GnRHa to boost the circulating endogenous LH and thus, progesterone levels
      around the time of implantation than the hCG triggered cycle. No studies previously
      investigated this issue. Therefore, the aim here was to explore a possible fine-tuning of the
      LPS of GnRHa-triggered IVF/ICSI cycles, using the previously suggested protocol.

      Significantly increased implantation rates (IRs) were previously reported in oocyte
      recipients as well as in patients who were triggered with hCG, if they received a single
      mid-luteal bolus of GnRHa in addition to standard LPS .

      A beneficial effect of a single dose of GnRH agonist administration as a luteal phase
      supporting agent is yet to be determined because of the wide heterogeneity of data present in
      literature. Well-designed randomized clinical studies are required to clarify any effect of
      luteal GnRH agonist addition on pregnancy outcome measures with different doses, timing, and
      administration routes of GnRH agonists .

      Administration of 0.1 mg of the GnRH agonist triptorelin on day 3 after embryo transfer led
      to a significant improvement in implantation rate (12.3% vs. 7.3%) and clinical pregnancy
      rate (25.5% vs. 10.0%) as compared with placebo.

      Luteal phase support with single-dose GnRHa might be as efficient as three doses of hCG.
      Large prospective, randomized-controlled studies are required comparing GnRHa and hCG for
      luteal phase support.

      Type of the study: Open labelled randomized controlled trial

      Study Setting: ART Unit, Women's Health Hospital

      c. Sample Size Calculation: Sample size calculation was calculated using Epi Info software
      (version 7). Based on previous study the pregnancy rate was 25.5% with GnRHa and 10% with
      control. Based on these percentages and with a confidence level of 95% and power of 80%, the
      sample size needed for the study was estimated to be 200 women (100 in each group).

      Study tools :

      All women scheduled for ICSI cycles in the AUH -ART unit and fulfil the above criteria will
      be invited to participate in the study, and subjected to the following

        1. A Thorough history will be taken with special emphasis on age and parity of the
           patients, age and duration of marriage, menstrual pattern, contraceptive history (with
           stress on type and duration of use), type and duration of infertility and type of
           previous delivery.

        2. Blood sampling will be performed for baseline evaluation FSH, LH, TSH and AMH on 2nd day
           of menses.

        3. Ovarian stimulation will be initiated from the day 2 of the menstrual cycle using
           recombinant gonadotropins 150-450 IU depending on patient age, BMI, antral follicle
           count and basal serum FSH.

        4. After 5 days, doses will be adjusted according to ovarian response. Once the leading
           follicle will reach a size of 14 mm, co-treatment with a GnRH antagonist will initiated
           and continued up until at least three follicles reached a size of 17-18 mm.

        5. Trigger will be done using HCG followed by OPU 36 h later.

        6. Retrieved oocytes will be fertilized by ICSI depending on sperm quality.

        7. According to the local regional policy and after an agreement between the patient and
           the medical team, one to three embryos will be transferred.

        8. For LPS, all patients will receive micronized P (400 mg/day) vaginally beginning on the
           day of oocyte retrieval and continuing until either end of first trimester by ultrasound
           or a negative pregnancy test.

        9. For the study group GnRH agonist 0.1 mg will be given 6 days after OPU.

       10. Blood sampling will be performed for progesterone within 24 h following the GnRH agonist
           0.1 mg injection particularly in the study group.

       11. Blood sampling will be performed 14 days after OPU for Quantative BHCG.

      Randomization:

      Randomization will be accomplished by using cards at the time of embryo transfer; two hundred
      will sequentially divide into two groups. Opaque sealed envelopes will used containing 100
      cards labelled control group and 100 cards labelled study group. All of envelops will mixed
      together randomly in a box. The cards will be pulled randomly.
