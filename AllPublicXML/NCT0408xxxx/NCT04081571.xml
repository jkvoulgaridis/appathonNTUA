      Getting a rough indicator about the prevalence of different grade of severity of NAFLD (NASH
      &amp; liver fibrosis), and Correlate the severity of fatty liver with different serological risk
      factors of metabolic syndrome and diseases progression as well as the prevalence of
      hepatocellular carcinoma related to NAFLD with the use of ; nutritional assessment designed
      and conducted by the investigators in this research, simple blood test (lipid profile and
      blood sugar), and easy cheap non-invasive radiological tool as screening to predict NASH.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective cross-sectional Multicenter National study, will include 1080
      participants with BMI ≥ 24kg/m 2 with or without elevated liver enzymes. All will be
      subjected to; dietary history by already prepared food quality and quantity questionnaire,
      anthropometric data (BMI &amp; waist circumference), Clinical examination, Laboratory work
      include: total lipid profile (LDL-C, HDL-C, VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein)&amp; TGs
      (Triglyceride)), fasting blood glucose and insulin (HOMA-IR (Insulin Resistance) will be
      calculated), HbA1c%, liver biochemistry tests (ALT, GGT (Gammaglutamyl transpeptidase), AST
      (aspartate aminotransferase), and bilirubin), Liver function testes (INR &amp; albumin), HCV
      (Hepatitis C virus) antibody, HBV (Hepatitis B virus) surface antigen, TSH
      (thyroid-stimulating hormone) , Free T3 &amp; T4 will be done for all participants. Imaging;
      Liver ultrasound including measurement of the subcutaneous fat in front of the left lobe of
      liver as well as at the umbilical region and assessment of liver stiffness by Fibroscan.

      The novelty of this study is that, if it showed a successful outcome, the investigators will
      get a rough indicator about the prevalence of different grade of severity of NAFLD, and
      Correlate the severity of fatty liver with different risk factors of metabolic syndrome and
      life style modifications among Egyptians, and trying to confirm the great variability between
      different races regarding BMI classes and overweight &amp; obesity cut-off values, confirming the
      high level of insulin resistance in non-diabetic participants with NAFLD compared to other
      races, identify types of food that are at risk for development and progression of NAFLD thus
      getting a healthy food recommendations for Egyptians and get a recommendation for another
      studies for metabolic syndrome redefinition with NAFLD part of it (not just considering as
      known in the present time), and working on the Triglycerides, LDL, and HDL cut off values.
      investigators also hope through this research to modify dietary habits in the Egyptian
      society encouraging healthy nutrition through dietary assessment (already prepared food
      quality and quantity questionnaire), that can lead to not only NAFLD but also progress to
      NASH, so participants can promote healthy dietary habits and proper life style among
      different health care providers thus decreasing incidence of obesity, one of main risk
      factors of fatty liver diseases and its consequences especially Hepatocellular Cancer.

      Investigators also hope through this research to modify dietary habits in the Egyptian
      society encouraging healthy nutrition through promoting professional nutritional assessment
      and questionnaire among different health care providers thus decreasing incidence of obesity,
      one of main risk factors of fatty liver diseases and its consequences especially
      Hepatocellular Cancer.
