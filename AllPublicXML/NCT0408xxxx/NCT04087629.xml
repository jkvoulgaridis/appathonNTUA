  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to determine if StrataXRT can be used as a steroid sparing agent for the
      treatment of cutaneous reactions related to acute graft versus host disease (GVHD), cutaneous
      T Cell lymphoma (CTCL) and chemotherapy/immunotherapy treatments than the current standard
      treatment - topical steroids - in people who are receiving treatment for CTCL, acute GVHD or
      chemotherapy/immunotherapy for solid/hematologic malignancies. Subjects will have CTCL or
      GVHD and are being treated with topical steroids, or being treated with
      chemotherapy/immunotherapy for another condition and have had cutaneous reactions that have
      warranted initiation of topical steroids.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Topical steroids are the mainstays of treatment for many cutaneous reactions and disorders.
      Steroids are known to cause many side effects and few effective pharmacologic alternatives
      exist. Contact dermatitis is observed in 56% of patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma
      (CTCL) being treated with topical mechlorethamine gel. This usually requires chronic
      treatment with mid-to high-potency steroids. Numerous chemo/immunotherapies are associated
      with cutaneous reactions including paronychia, hand and foot syndrome, and acneiform rash.
      Skin toxicity often requires dose reduction of cancer therapies and a variety of skin
      directed therapies including topical antibiotics and topical steroids. Cutaneous reactions
      are often the earliest manifestation of acute graft versus host disease. Skin manifestations
      can be debilitating and treatment usually requires high potency topical steroids. Additional
      therapies are needed for the treatment of disorders that rely on topical steroids.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to determine whether StrataXRT® gel is effective as a supportive therapy for cutaneous reactions treated with topical steroids as the standard of care. This objective will be measured by the Pruritus Visual Analogue Scale, which measures self-reported itching on a scale of 0 (no itching) to 10 (worst imaginable itch)</description>

    <description>Another objective is to determine if StrataXRT® will improve patient quality of life secondary to symptomatic improvement through the use of the Skindex 16 QOL (a dermatologic quality-of-life instrument) , which is a validated measure where participants self-report from 1 (never) - 5 (all the time) how each of 30 statements describes participants feelings related to their skin condition.</description>

    <ipd_description>Clinical Endpoints/ IPD will be assessed based on analysis of photos and evaluation of survey data, including scores from Pruritis VAS and Skindex-16 QOL scales. The scores during topical steroid treatment period will be compared to the scores during the StrataXRT® gel treatment period. Safety endpoints will be evaluated based on report of product related adverse events and subsequent study product interruption.</ipd_description>
