  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the toxicity and tolerance of carbon ion radiotherapy
      for locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma (LAPC)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The carbon dose of 60-67.5GyE in 15 fractions was delivered to clinical target volume (CTV).
      The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as CTCAE grade 3 or higher of non-hematological
      toxicity (G3). The acute and late toxicities, overall survival (OS), progression-free
      survival (PFS), local progression-free survival (LPFS) and distant metastasis-free survival
      (DMFS) were the endpoints.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The histologically or cytologically confirmed, or the clinically diagnosed by clinical
             diagnosis criterion proposed by Pancreatic Cancer Committee of Chinese Anti-Cancer
             Association, which was based on evidences of (1). Typical symptoms of abdominal and/or
             back pain; (2). CA19-9 increased over the normal up limit; (3). A pancreatic mass
             shown on CT or MRI; and (4). SUV of PET-CT in mass increased compared to that in
             normal pancreas;

          2. Unresectable LAPC defined by the criteria of (NCCN) guidelines (Version 1. 2013), or
             refusal to surgery;
