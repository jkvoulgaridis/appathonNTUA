      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate the vaccine seroresponse sufficiency of meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and
      W following the administration of a booster dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine:

        -  in Group 1 subjects who were first vaccinated with 1 dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine
           3-6 years before the booster dose

        -  in Group 2 subjects who were first vaccinated with 1 dose of Menveo vaccine 3-6 years
           before the booster dose

      Secondary Objective:

      To describe:

        -  the vaccine seroresponse, seroprotection (serum bactericidal assay using human
           complement [hSBA] titer ≥1:8), and antibody responses (geometric mean titers [GMTs]) of
           meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W measured using hSBA in serum specimens collected
           6 days (±1 day) after vaccination in a subset of 50 subjects per group (Groups 1 and 2)

        -  the vaccine seroresponse, seroprotection (hSBA titer ≥1:8), and antibody responses
           (GMTs) to serogroups A, C, Y, and W measured using hSBA on D0 (pre-vaccination) and D30
           (+14 days) after vaccination with MenACYW conjugate vaccine alone (Groups 1 and 2)

        -  the antibody persistence (GMTs and vaccine seroprotection; hSBA titer ≥1:8) of
           meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W before a booster dose in subjects who received
           either MenACYW conjugate vaccine or Menveo vaccine 3-6 years earlier

      Study duration per participant will be approximately 6 months including: 1 day of screening
      and vaccination, 1 or 2 additional visits at Day 6 and Day 30, 2 phone calls and a safety
      follow-up/end of study visit, at Day 8 and Day 180 after vaccine administration,
      respectively.

      Safety assessment includes solicited reactions within 7 days after vaccination, unsolicited
      adverse events (AEs) up to 30 days after vaccination, serious adverse events (SAEs)
      throughout the study.
