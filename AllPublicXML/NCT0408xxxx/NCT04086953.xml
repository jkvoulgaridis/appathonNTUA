  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many exercise tests are commonly used to evaluate the changes of exercise tolerance following
      rehabilitation programs in patients with chronic respiratory diseases.

      Among the tests (6-MWT, incremental test, ...), the literature seems to indicate that
      endurance time is the most responsive parameter for detecting and quantifying changes in
      exercise capacity following a rehabilitation program. Although its clinical interest is
      undeniable, the endurance shuttle walking test is rarely used because it requires the prior
      performance of two incremental shuttle walking tests to determine the walking speed imposed
      on the patient.

      In this protocol, we propose to test a Walk-Time Limit Test (WTLT) derived from the 6-minute
      walk test (6-MWT) and based on the average walking speed achieved in this test commonly used
      in the follow-up of patients with chronic diseases.

      TTLM validation would improve the functional assessment of patients with chronic diseases
      while limiting the number of exercise tests.

      Each patient will perform 4 visits over a period of 4-week. Fifty subjects with COPD and
      fifty subjects with heart failure will be recruited for the same protocol.

      During the first visit, the subject will realize two 6-MWT and a cardiopulmonary exercise
      test on ergocycle with the measure of cardiorespiratory parameters. We will evaluate the
      physical activity during daily life using an accelerometer and we will use several
      questionnaires to measure the quality of life, the motivation to physical activities and
      symptoms.

      During the second visit, the subject will realize a 4-meter walk test, two incremental
      shuttle walk tests (ISWT), an endurance shuttle walk test (ESWT) and a test with dynamometer
      to measure the quadriceps strength.

      During the third and fourth visits, the subject realize two or three endurance walking tests
      (Walk-Time Limit Test - WTLT) at a walking speed equivalent to the mean speed realize during
      the better 6MWT (visit 1)

The walking speed is dictated by a sound signal previously recorded. Every minute, the time between each beep is decreased and therefore the walking speed increased. The increment is 0.17m / sec every minute. Shifting to a higher speed is indicated by a triple beep. At most, the ISWT includes 12 speed levels.</description>
