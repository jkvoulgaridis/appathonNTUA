  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study design: Phase I clinical trial, single-center, controlled, parallel group, open,
      randomized.

      Number of subjects: n = 34 evaluable subjects, 17 evaluable subjects per group (both eyes).

      Estimated duration of the study: 5 months

      Therapeutic indication: Eye lubricant Use: Dry Eye

      Objective:To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Lagricel® Ofteno multidose manufactured
      by Laboratorios Sophia on the ocular surface of clinically healthy subjects.

      Hypothesis:

      H0 = Lagricel® Ofteno multidose ophthalmic solution has a safety and tolerability profile
      similar to Lagricel® Ofteno single dose in healthy subjects.

      H1 = Lagricel® Ofteno multidose ophthalmic solution has a different safety and tolerability
      profile than Lagricel® Ofteno single dose in healthy subjects.

      Main inclusion criteria: Clinically healthy subjects

    <time_frame>during the 10 days of evaluation, including the safety call (day 11).</time_frame>
    <description>the adverse events will be evaluated with a scale of Present / Absent, it is a nominal variable, the normal value is absent</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Eye Comfort Index (ECI)</measure>
    <time_frame>will be evaluated at the end of the treatment (day 8, final visit)</time_frame>
    <description>It is a questionnaire designed to measure the irritation of the ocular surface with Rasch analysis to produce estimates on a linear scale of intervals (ratings: 0-100).The Eye comfort index contains items that focus on the discomfort associated with alterations of the ocular surface.(0: None discomfort, 100: high discomfort).</description>

    <measure>visual acuity (VA)</measure>
    <time_frame>will be evaluated at the end of the treatment (day 8, final visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Visual acuity (VA) is a test of visual function. It will be evaluated at baseline, without refractive correction with the Snellen chart.Which will be located in a place with adequate lighting, natural or artificial and at a distance of 3meters from the subject to be evaluated. The snellen chart consists of a booklet with 11 lines composed of letters, each line has a different size and a different weighting. the subject is placed at a safe distance and the contralateral eye to which it will be evaluated is covered, then the examiner detects until the line can clearly see the letters given he or she a score, the normal score for a VA is 20/20.</description>

    <measure>Epithelial Defects (ED) Fluorescein stain</measure>
    <time_frame>will be evaluated at the end of the treatment (day 8, final visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The epithelial defects will be evaluated by means of two stains, green lysine and fluorescein, it is a discrete variable that will be realized by direct observation, it will be staged according to the degrees of the oxford scale that go from 0 to 5 (0-V) according to its severity, where 0 is the normal lower limit and 5 the upper limit of defects.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>conjunctival hyperemia (CH)</measure>
    <time_frame>will be evaluated at the end of the treatment (day 8, final visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Conjunctival hyperemia will be evaluated as an ordinal variable, by direct observation and staged using the Efron scale as 0.-Normal / 1.-Very Light/ 2.- Light/ 3.-Mild / 4.-Moderate / 5.- Severe. Based on this scale, the normal and mild stages are considered without pathologies or normal. Mild, moderate and severe are considered pathological.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Chemosis</measure>
    <time_frame>will be evaluated at the end of the treatment (day 8, final visit)</time_frame>
    <description>It is defined as conjunctival edema, the result of an inflammatory reaction. It is qualified as present or absent. The evaluator will use a narrow beam of light at 60 ° and will measure if the conjunctiva separates from the sclera by ≥ 1/3 of the total eyelid opening</description>
