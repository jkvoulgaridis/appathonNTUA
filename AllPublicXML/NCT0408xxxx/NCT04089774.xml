  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current management of Spondylarthritis Ankylosant (SA), according to the recommendations
      of the HAS (High Authority of Health), must be a multidisciplinary global approach
      coordinated by the rheumatologist combining a pharmacological aspect (NSAID, analgesics,
      biotherapy ...) and not pharmacological (physical treatments, educational approaches, social
      measures ...). The therapeutic aim of this management is to achieve a low level of activity
      of the disease and a decrease of the repercussion of this one in the daily life of the
      patient.

      The standard physical treatment currently provided is physiotherapy. This can be prescribed
      throughout the disease by the rheumatologist, adapted to the stage of AS and the clinical
      condition of the patient. The medical teams note in their daily practice that there may be a
      lack of attendance of patients at prescribed physiotherapy sessions. This has been confirmed
      in research on certain chronic rheumatic diseases, including AS, for which patients became
      less adherent to physical treatments and thus lost the expected benefits, particularly in
      terms of the functional impact of AS in the patient's daily life. (BASFI). Various studies
      have also shown that combining several physical activities (including aerobic and muscle
      building) or / and performing them in groups at a regular frequency (three times a week)
      could significantly improve several AS parameters, including BASFI.

      From these different findings, we hypothesized that a multidisciplinary treatment combining a
      &quot;cardio training&quot; with muscle strengthening, supervised by qualified sports coaches, for a
      year, could reduce the impact of SA in the daily life of patients balanced by a biotherapy,
      compared to standard physiotherapy. This original care is part of the Adapted Physical
      Activity (APA), whose application decree came into force on March 1, 2017 and allows doctors
      to prescribe a physical therapy tailored to the needs of the patient. At present, the APA
      remains at the expense of the patients in ALD and in some cases, it can be supported,
      partially or totally, by the complementary health. APA could therefore be an alternative and
      / or complementary to physiotherapy as a physical therapy in the management of AS, in
      addition to pharmacological treatments.

    <measure>The mean variation of the BASFI score (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index) over a period of 18 months</measure>
    <time_frame>18 MONTHS</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is the mean change in BASFI score (functional index of ankylosing spondylitis) between 12 months of management (or M12), and baseline (or M0), compared between the 2 groups. It will be noted BASFI (M12-M0). Patients follow-up will be done during 18 months.
BASFI is a self-administered questionnaire that assesses the functional impact of the disease on the patient's life. This tool consists of 10 questions to answer a visual evaluation of 10 cm (0 for &quot;easy&quot; and 10 for &quot;impossible&quot;).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The mean variation of the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>18 MONTHS</time_frame>
    <description>This tool assesses disease activity based on the patient's response to 6 questions related to fatigue, joint and spinal joint pain, localized spot sensitivity, and morning stiffness (duration). and degree). Each answer can range from 0 (absent) to 10 cm (extreme) on a visual analogue scale or Likert scale. First, calculate the average for answers 5 and 6 and then calculate the average of the 5 values (the average value of answers 5 and 6 and the value of answers to the first 4 questions). It is a fast tool (with a filling time per patient from 30 seconds to 2 minutes), reliable and valid, also used for &quot;routine&quot; follow-up, at the request of the practitioner. This questionnaire is completed by the patient referring to his feelings during the last forty-eight hours.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The mean variation of C-reactive protein (CRP) and sedimentation rate (VS) over a period of 18 months</measure>
    <time_frame>18 MONTHS</time_frame>
    <description>These 2 biomarkers of inflammation are regularly dosed as part of a &quot;classical&quot; follow-up by the rheumatologist, in addition to a more complete biological assessment. This assessment can be performed in the laboratory of biological analyzes of the choice of the patient. Patients follow-up will be done during 18 months.
These values are retrieved at visits M0, M6, M12 and M18.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The mean variation of ASDAS (Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score).</measure>
    <time_frame>18 MONTHS</time_frame>
    <description>It is a new composite index to evaluate disease activity that combines 5 variables: 3 questions from BASDAI (2nd, 3rd and 6th), the value of CRP (or VS, if CRP not available ) and the EVA of the Global Assessment (EVA-AG) by the patient. This score has a good sensitivity and is calculated using the following formula:
0.12 x Back Pain (0 to 10) + 0.06 x Duration of Morning Stiffness (from 0 to 10) + 0.11 x Patient Global (0 to 10) + 0.07 x Peripheral Bread / Swelling (0 to 10) + 0.58 x Ln (CRP (mg / l) +1)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The mean variation of the score of the Visual Analogue Scale of Global Appreciation (EVA-AG) over a period of 18 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>18 MONTHS</time_frame>
    <description>The EVA-AG is a visual scale graduated from 0 (worst health condition imaginable) to 10 (best health imaginable) and the patient must indicate the appreciated value of his overall health condition on the scale and within a framework Reserve. Patients follow-up will be done during 18 months.
The questionnaire is completed by the patient at each visit: M0, M6, M12 and M18.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The mean variation in NSAID consumption (Anti-Inflammatory Non Steroidal) over a period of 18 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>18 MONTHS</time_frame>
    <description>The consumption of NSAIDs throughout the study is measured by completion by the physician of a questionnaire, based on the interview of the patient, which makes it possible to obtain the ASAS-NSAIDs (Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society - No Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) score. It is calculated using a formula based on the daily dosage, the number of shots per week and the period of interest in days. Patients follow-up will be done during 18 months.
This score is calculated at each visit over the 6 months preceding the visits: M0, M6, M12 and M18.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The mean variation in the consumption of analgesics.</measure>
    <time_frame>18 MONTHS</time_frame>
    <description>The average consumption of analgesics, in the 6 months preceding the visit, is collected by the investigating doctor during the interrogation of the patient and transcribed in his medical file.
Each treatment is informed as well as its daily dosage, the average number of days of weekly intake and the duration of it</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The average variation in medical consumption over a period of 18 months</measure>
    <time_frame>18 MONTHS</time_frame>
    <description>The medical consumption corresponds to the retranscription of all consultations, hospitalizations or other medical or paramedical care, in connection with his SA, carried out by the patient in the 6 months preceding the visit. Only non-research-related treatment consumptions are collected by the investigating physician and transcribed in his medical file. Physiotherapy sessions of the patient included in group 2, are not considered medical consumption, for example. Patients follow-up will be done during 18 months.
This information is collected at each visit on the 6 months preceding the visits: M0, M6, M12 and M18.</description>
