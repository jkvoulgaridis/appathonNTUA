    <textblock>
      Short Actives Lives Survey is a common tool used to measure physical activity in the UK
      population. Self-reported measures such as the Short Active Lives Survey can be prone to
      bias. As such, during project evaluations, benefits may be exaggerated due to over-reporting
      of physical activity or downplayed due to underreporting of physical activity. There is also
      a lack of research reporting the typical short-term and long-term changes in physical
      activity (measured by the Short Active Lives Survey) in people with chronic lung conditions
      who are not receiving support to become active (i.e. usual care, control groups).
      Accelerometers are small lightweight activity monitors that can be worn on the waist. These
      monitors are known to provide accurate and reliable objective assessment of physical activity
      in people with lung conditions.

      This research study will recruit a cohort of inactive people with lung conditions and
      determine changes in physical activity measured by both the Short Active Lives Survey and one
      of the most valid accelerometers used in people with lung conditions (Actigraph GT3X). The
      study will also evaluate how these physical activity measures relate to general health
      (health status and health care use) of people with lung conditions over 12 months. This study
      will provide information on the usefulness of using the Short Active Lives Survey in the
      future for measuring physical activity in people with lung conditions.

Each dimension is rated between 1 (no problems) to 5 (unable to/extreme problems). Dimensions are combined to produce a five-digit number describing the individual's health status (ranging from 11111 to 55555). Five digit number converted to an index based on the EQ-5D-5L value set for England. Index ranges from âˆ’0.208 (worst possible health) to 1.000 (best possible health).</description>

        The eligibility criteria has been designed to be as broad as possible so that findings can
        be generalisable to the wider population of inactive people with lung conditions. The main
        study population will be recruited via convenience sampling at the participant
        identification centres within Lincolnshire Community Health Services, South Lincolnshire
        CCG, South West Lincolnshire CCG, Lincolnshire East CCG, Lincolnshire West CCG and United
        Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust.
