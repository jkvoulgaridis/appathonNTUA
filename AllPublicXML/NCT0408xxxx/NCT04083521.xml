    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of the probiotic B. subtilis DE111®
      for regulation of bowel movements. A single capsule containing 1 x 10^9 CFU B. subtilis is to
      be consumed once a day per participant. 50 adults (18-65 years of age at the time of
      participation) suffering from occasional constipation and/or diarrhea will be enrolled.
      Participants will be double-blindly and randomly assigned to either the probiotic (Bacillus
      subtilis) or the placebo (maltodextrin) group. Efficacy will be assessed with
      participant-reported bowel movement (BM) records. As a secondary outcome, the study will
      provide further insight into the tolerance of the supplement. Tolerance will be assessed
      using a digestive health questionnaire and blood samples to analyze pertinent metabolic
      biomarkers. Participants will be asked to complete a daily dietary intake record as well.
      Prior to capsule consumption, participants will complete a two-week pre-testing phase in
      order to provide a more inclusive diagnostic baseline. This phase will consist of daily BM
      and dietary intake record keeping.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants suffering from occasional constipation and/or diarrhea will be eligible
             for participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Blood CRP levels for each participant will be monitored at days 0, 60 and 105 of this
             study. Participants with CRP levels greater than 5mg/l on day 0 of the study will be
             excluded from further participation as this level is indicative of underlying
             inflammatory bowel disease. Participants excluded under such conditions will be
             instructed to seek further treatment with their health care provider.
