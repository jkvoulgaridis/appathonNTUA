  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are evaluating the immediate effect of a dental mouthpiece on gait and
      balance among people with Parkinson disease as well as longer-term feasibility use and the
      effect of the mouthpiece on sleep and quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a pilot study with participants who have been diagnosed with
      Parkinson disease recruited from the community. Participants will attend one in-person visit
      and be custom fitted with a dental mouthpiece. Participants will be asked to wear the
      mouthpiece as much as possible for one month including while sleeping and during the day,
      except while eating.

    <measure>Changes in Parkinson Disease Sleep Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>One month</time_frame>
    <description>Indicators of sleep quality will be measured before and after wearing mouthpiece for one-month. The visual analog scale has 15 commonly reported symptoms associated with sleep disturbance (e.g., overall quality of nights sleep, restlessness, daytime dozing). Participants mark a cross along a 10 cm line labelled worst to best state. Items are scored by measuring the distance along each line to the intersection with the cross in centimeters. Each item score can range from 0 - symptom severe and always experienced to 10 - symptom-free. The items are summed and the maximum cumulative score is 150 (free of all symptoms).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Parkinson Disease Questionnaire-39</measure>
    <time_frame>One month</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be measured before and after wearing mouthpiece for one-month. This scale has 39 questions with 5 possible answers (0 = never, 1 = Occasionally, 2 = Sometimes, 3 = Often, 4 = Always). There are eight dimensions: Mobility questions (q)1-10; Activities of Daily Living q11-16; Emotional well-being q17-22; Stigma q23-26; Social Support q27-29; Cognitive impairment q30-33; Communication q34-36; and Bodily Discomfort q37-39. Dimensions are calculated on a scale of 0 to 100, 0 is no problem at all and 100 is maximum level of a problem. The formula for scoring each dimension: (sum of scores of each question in dimension/4 (max.score per question) x nos. questions in dimension)x100. The formula for a total score (called single index) is sum of dimension scores/8.</description>
