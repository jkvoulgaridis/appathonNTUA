  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is the leading cause of death for Southeast Asian refugee and immigrant (R/I) women;
      yet they have unacceptably low screening rates. Drawing on successful tailored navigation
      interventions, the purpose of this study is to compare a culturally congruent, tailored
      navigation intervention delivered by bilingual and bicultural Community Health Advisors
      (CHAs) to increase age-appropriate breast and cervical cancer screening completion among
      intergenerational Southeast Asian R/I women (mother-daughter dyads) with information and
      reminder only. We will examine the underlying factors that associate with the intervention
      that influence cancer screening completion. We will also explore the influence of
      intergenerational exchange of breast and cervical cancer screening information between
      mothers and daughters. This multi-faceted intervention, combining culturally tailored
      messages and navigation via CHAs, has high potential for scalability across settings and
      diseases for hard-to-reach populations. In addition, this study focuses on breast and
      cervical cancer screening jointly potentially increasing the public health impact.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is the leading cause of death for Southeast Asian refugee and immigrant women.
      Cambodian, Lao, and Vietnamese (hereafter referred to as SEAR/I) women have
      disproportionately high incidence rates of breast and cervical cancers. Breast cancer
      incidence increased significantly for all Asians from 1988 to 2013, but the largest increase
      was in SEAR/I women (APC=2.5, 95% CI 0.8, 4.2). Over the past two decades, SEAR/I women
      experienced significant increases in breast cancer incidence across age groups compared to
      other Asian and White women. Lao and Cambodian women are 2.5 times and Vietnamese women are
      40% more likely to be diagnosed with cervical cancer than are White women. Despite evidence
      that regular screening through mammography and Pap testing reduces breast and cervical cancer
      mortality, SEAR/I women continue to have strikingly low rates of screening (75.4% for Pap
      tests and 64.1% for mammography), well below the Healthy People 2020 target of 93% and 81.1%,
      respectively. Drawing on successful tailored navigation interventions, the purpose of this
      study is to test the efficacy of a culturally-relevant, tailored navigation intervention
      delivered through bilingual and bicultural Community Health Advisors (CHAs) for
      intergenerational SEAR/I women (mother-daughter dyads). Ethnically matched CHAs will use the
      tested Tailored Intervention Messaging System (TIMS©) to educate and navigate participants
      from the community to health clinic to complete mammography and/or Pap testing.

      Our specific aims are to:

      AIM 1: Test the efficacy of tailored navigation intervention delivered by SEA community
      health advisors (CHA+TN) to increase age-appropriate breast and cervical cancer screening
      completion compared to an information and reminder only control among intergenerational
      SEAR/I dyads.

      H1: The intervention group (CHA+TN) will have significantly higher age-appropriate breast and
      cervical cancer screening rates compared with the control group (information + reminder
      only).

      AIM 2: Examine the underlying mechanisms (both mediating and moderating factors) associated
      with the intervention (CHA+TN) that influence breast and cervical cancer screening
      completion.

      Exploratory AIM 3: Explore in greater detail the influence of intergenerational exchange of
      information between mothers and daughters related to breast and cervical cancer screening.

    <description>Participants will be contacted by CHAs by phone one week after giving informed consent and completion of the baseline survey. CHAs will contact participants once a week for up to 10 weeks (a maximum of 10 attempts or until a clinic appointment is made, whichever comes first). Using the TIMS© message library, the CHAs will engage participants in conversations about breast and cervical cancer screening and navigate the participants to overcome any barriers to screening and motivate them to make a clinic appointment. Personal messages from mothers to daughters and vice versa and screening reminder notecards will be sent at 12-months (T3). At 18-months (T4), CHAs will follow-up with navigation group participants who reported completing a mammogram during the navigation process. Screening completion will be measured by self-report and confirmed via medical record check.</description>

    <description>Participants will be mailed an informational brochure on mammography and Pap testing one week after enrollment into the study. At 3-months post enrollment, CHAs will conduct a follow-up phone call with each participant to assess mammogram and/or Pap testing completion (primary outcomes). At 12-months (T3) post enrollment, CHAs will contact all control group participants by phone to confirm a scheduled appointment or screening completion. For those who completed a mammogram within the 12 months since enrollment, generic screening reminder notecards will be sent by mail. At 18-months (T4), CHAs will follow-up with those control group participants who reported scheduling a mammogram, Pap smear, or both at the 12-month (T3) time point.</description>
