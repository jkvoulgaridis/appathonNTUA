  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, cross-over, controlled, open label study. The aim of this study is to demonstrate
      that glucose may completely be replaced by a combination of xylitol and carnitine in the
      bimodal PD solution for long dwell exchange.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of a solution icodextrin, xylitol and carnitine (IXC) as the osmotic agent in
      dialysate for the long dwell exchange provides sustained ultrafiltration (UF) through colloid
      osmosis, allowing a consistent reduction in extracellular fluid volume without the expected
      fall in urine output. The other major advantage of IXC is the reduced exposure and absorption
      of glucose as the main osmotic agent in PD therapy. The aim of this study is to demonstrate
      that glucose may completely be replaced by a combination of xylitol and carnitine in the
      bimodal IXC-based PD solution. Compared to glucose, indeed, carnitine and xylitol are
      extremely stable naturally occurring compounds, even at temperatures higher than those used
      to steam-sterilize infusional product. As a consequence, xylitol and carnitine may represent
      better alternatives than glucose as an osmotic ingredient both from the manufacturing and
      biocompatibility standpoints. Moreover, xylitol and carnitine have an excellent safety
      profile and possess distinct systemic actions, which are more favorable than glucose.
