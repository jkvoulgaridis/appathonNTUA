      To determine if a single subcutaneous (SC) administration of TTX at various dose levels has
      an effect on the QT/QTc intervals when assessing concentration QT (C-QT) relationship (i.e.,
      QT/QTc intervals prolongation in relation to plasma levels of TTX) in healthy adult subjects.

      Secondary:

        1. To determine if a single SC administration of TTX at various dose levels has an effect

        3. To confirm plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) of a single SC administration of TTX at various
           dose levels when administered to healthy adult subjects.

        4. To determine the overall safety and tolerability of a single SC administration of TTX at
           various dose levels when administered to healthy adult subjects.

          5. For a female of childbearing potential: either be sexually inactive (abstinent) for 14
             days prior to the first dose and throughout the study or be using one of the following
             acceptable birth control methods:

               -  non-hormone releasing intrauterine device for at least 3 months prior to the
                  first dose and throughout the study.

               -  surgical sterilization of the partner (vasectomy for 4 months minimum prior to
                  the first dose).

               -  physical barrier method (e.g., condom, diaphragm) with spermicide for at least 14
                  days prior to the first dose and throughout the study.

             In addition, female subjects of childbearing potential will be advised to remain
             sexually inactive or to keep the same birth control method for at least 28 days
             following the last dose.

          6. For a female of non childbearing potential: must have undergone one of the following
             sterilization procedures at least 6 months prior to the first dose:

             drug. (No restrictions are required for a vasectomized male provided his vasectomy has
             been performed 4 months or more prior to first dose of study drug. A male who has been
             vasectomized less than 4 months prior to study first dose must follow the same
             restrictions as a non vasectomized male).

          8. If male, must agree not to donate sperm from the first dose until 90 days after last
             dosing.
