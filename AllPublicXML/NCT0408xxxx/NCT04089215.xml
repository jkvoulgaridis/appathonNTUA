    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study conducted in adult subjects
      with R/R Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma in China to evaluate the safety, efficacy,
      pharmacokinetics(PK), pharmacodynamics(PD) of JWCAR029 and collect the patient reported
      quality of life changes and immune response after JWCAR029 treatment.

      There will be two cohorts of cohort A and cohort B. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
      patients will be enrolled in cohort A and follicular lymphoma patients will be enrolled in
      cohort B. Two dose levels of 1.0 x 10^8 CAR+ T cells and 1.5 x 10^8 CAR+ T cells are adopted
      in this study in both cohorts, subjects will be randomly assigned into the two dose levels
      with a 1:1 ratio. All sujects will be followed for 2 years following JCAR017 infusion.
