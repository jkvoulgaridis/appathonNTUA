  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to find out if SSKI (Potassium Iodide) reduces vascularity
      (the number and concentration of blood vessels) and improves how well patients do after
      surgery for removal of their whole thyroid gland in Graves' disease (an autoimmune disease
      that is a common cause of hyperthyroidism).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Graves' disease and goiters tend to have very vascular thyroid glands, which
      increases operative bleeding risks/rates. Many surgeons treat these patients with
      preoperative SSKI which is believed to decrease the vascularity, which in turn may decrease
      bleeding risks. However, there has been no quantitative data published on whether this is a
      real effect with true clinical benefit, in either animal or human models with SSKI. There
      have been some studies in Europe studying Lugol's solution, a different formulation of
      iodine, which show some decreased vascularity using color Doppler or measurements of CD34
      cells.

    <intervention_model_description>All participants complete a baseline neck ultrasound no less than 7 days prior to surgery, to obtain vascular flow imaging. Participants are then randomized to receive 7 days of pre-operative SSKI or not receive any drug. In the practice at Columbia, all patients with Graves' disease receive SSKI preoperatively, though this is not standard practice across the country, thus the 'no drug' group is experimental for research.
All participants complete a second ultrasound on the operating table before surgery, to assess for change in vascularity (experimental, as not all patients receive intra-operative ultrasounds before surgery). Both ultrasounds are performed by the surgeon.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Using 3D imaging software, the investigators will quantify the vascular flow in the ultrasound images and compare baseline images with the operating room (OR) images to assess if there is a difference in vascular flow between those timepoints. Vascular flow will be quantified using percent (%) surface area. This calculation will be done by a computer algorithm.</description>
