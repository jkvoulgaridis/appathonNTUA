  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Silk Medical Aesthetics' Inc. device, SMA-001, is currently under development as a dermal
      filler to fill wrinkles and folds. This study is designed to collect short-term visual,
      photographic, and histological and safety data on small aliquots of the product as part of
      device development. It is an open label study involving up to three investigational sites and
      a maximum enrollment of 10 subjects. Juv√©derm Ultra Plus XC, an FDA-approved dermal filler
      will serve as a control device. Briefly, the investigational product and the control device
      will be injected into the abdomen of patients intending to undergo abdominoplasty at a later
      date. The patients will be followed for 30 days post injection through visual observation. At
      30 days post injection, the injected gel and associated tissue will be removed via biopsy
      during the abdominoplasty surgery and histology slides created for analysis.
