  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral health has improved considerably in recent decades in Sweden, as well as in other
      countries. However, despite great improvements with regard to periodontal disease and dental
      caries in recent decades, global problems still persist, and as a consequence of retaining
      natural teeth high up in age, the risk for oral disease increases.

    <textblock>
      Traditionally, the number of teeth has been a measure of good oral health, and the World
      Health Organization (WHO) stipulated goals of a minimum of 20 functional teeth at the age of
      80 years have been reached in some industrialized countries. Oral Health means more than good
      teeth and is integral to general health. The relationship between oral and general health has
      been recognized. For example, periodontal disease is associated with diabetes and rheumatoid
      arthritis. The severity of periodontal disease and number of teeth have been associated with
      an increased burden of cardiovascular disease.

      There is a lack of longitudinal studies of oral Health and risk factors for oral disease.

    <description>A 9-item survey instrument (Oral Impact on Daily Performance), using a five-point Likert scale, ranging from &quot;never&quot; (1), &quot;less than once a month (2), 1-2 times a month (3), 1-2 times a week (4), and &quot;every, or nearly every day&quot; (5) was used.
The questions are as follows: &quot;during the past 6 months, how often have problems with your mouth or teeth caused any difficulty with:
Eating and enjoying food
Speaking
Pronouncing clearly
Doing light physical activities
Cleaning teeth
Sleeping and relaxing
Smiling, laughing and showing teeth without embarrassment
Maintaining usual emotional state without being irritable
Carrying out major work or social role and enjoying contact with people</description>
