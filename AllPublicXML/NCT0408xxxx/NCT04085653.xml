  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Patients eligible for inclusion in this Treatment Plan have to meet all of the following
        criteria:

          1. Adult or pediatric patients â‰¥ 2 years of age, with a confirmed diagnosis of PROS and
             documented evidence of a mutation in the PIK3CA gene, as determined by a local
             laboratory.

          2. The treating physician has determined that the patient's condition is severe or life
             threatening, treatment is necessary and there are no other feasible alternatives for
             the patient.

        Written patient informed consent must be obtained prior to start of treatment.

        Exclusion criteria

        Patients eligible for this Treatment Plan must not meet any of the following criteria:

          1. Patient has history of hypersensitivity to any drugs or metabolites of PI3K inhibitor
             or any of the excipients of alpelisib.

          2. Patient with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (Type I or II).

          3. Patient who has other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions that
             would, in the Treating Physician's judgment, contraindicate administration of
             alpelisib (eg. active or uncontrolled severe infection, chronic active hepatitis,
             immuno-compromised, acute or chronic pancreatitis, uncontrolled high blood pressure,
             interstitial lung disease, etc.)

          4. Patient has a known history of Steven Johnson's syndrome or toxic epidermal
             necrolysis.

          5. Patient who does not apply highly effective contraception during the treatment with
             alpelisib and through the duration as defined below after the final dose of alpelisib

               1. Sexually active males unless they are sterilized (at least 6 months prior to
                  screening) or use a condom during intercourse while taking drug and for at least
                  4 weeks after stopping alpelisib and should not father a child in this period. A
                  condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent
                  delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.

               2. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
                  becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of
                  contraception during dosing and for at least 4 weeks after stopping alpelisib.

             Highly effective contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-
                  ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks before
                  taking program treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the
                  reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level
                  assessment.

               -  Male partner sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female
                  patients in the program the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner
                  for that patient.

               -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD).

             Note: Use of oral (estrogen and progesterone), transdermal, injected or implanted
             hormonal methods of contraception as well as hormonal replacement therapy is not
             allowed in this program; barrier method is not considered an effective method.

          6. Patient is pregnant or lactating, where pregnancy is defined as state of a female
             after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive human
             chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) lab test.
