  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this four-way crossover study, a plasmakinetic profile of GABA from tomatoes as compared
      to a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) supplement in healthy young men will be established. In
      addition, a plasmakinetic profiles of glutamate from a supplement and from tomatoes as well
      as the effects of glutamate from tomatoes and a supplement on the GABA plasma levels will be
      determined. This study will therefore provide information about the effect of a food matrix
      on GABA plasmakinetics.
