  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Personalisation of radiotherapy dose based on real-time assessments of normal tissue and
      tumour response would maximise cure and minimise treatment related toxicity. During a 5
      fraction course of prostate Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) this pilot study will
      assess whether a number of different biomarker approaches can predict for normal tissue and
      tumour response. Firstly the investigators will analyse volatile organic compounds released
      within the breath with each fraction of treatment. Secondly the investigators will analyse
      cell free normal tissue and tumour DNA released during treatment. Thirdly the investigators
      will develop imaging processing algorithms to look for imaging biomarkers predicting rectal
      wall toxicity using pre and post treatment cone beam CT verification images. Each of these
      approaches will be assessed against prostate specific antigen (PSA), Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0) criteria and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index
      Composite (EPIC-26) patient reported outcomes with a maximum of 24 months of follow up.

      Radiotherapy scheduling and prescription dose does not take into account individual patient
      heterogeneity in normal tissue response or tumour response. Personalisation of radiotherapy
      dose based on real-time assessments of normal tissue and tumour response would maximise cure
      and minimise treatment related toxicity. During a 5 fraction course of prostate Stereotactic
      Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) this pilot study will assess whether a number of different biomarker
      approaches can predict for normal tissue and tumour response. Firstly the investigators will
      analyse volatile organic compounds released within the breath with each fraction of treatment
      using Gas Chromatography Ion Mobility Spectroscopy (GC-IMS). The investigators have extensive
      experience in this area within the TOXI-Triage research program (www.toxi-triage.eu/)
      including deep learning and machine learning techniques to interrogate the metabolomics data
      generated. Secondly the investigators will analyse cell free normal tissue and tumour DNA
      released during treatment to assess both tumour and normal tissue response. Radiotherapy
      releases large amounts in to the blood stream allowing easier quantitative analysis. Thirdly
      the investigators will look for imaging biomarkers of rectal wall toxicity using imaging
      analysis algorithms of on-treatment cone beam verification CT images taken before and after
      each radiotherapy treatment. The RayPilot® system made by Micropos Medical Ltd tracks
      prostate motion throughout the SBRT delivery to ensure that the treatment dose is delivered
      with great precision. The potential of each biomarker approach for predicting normal tissue
      and tumour response will be assessed against PSA and CTCAE v 4.0 toxicity criteria and
      EPIC-26 patient reported outcome measures after 24 months of patient follow up.

    <measure>Measurement of the relative change in Gas Chromatography Ion Mobility Spectra (GC-IMS) of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC's) from breath samples of men with prostate cancer treated with prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre treatment before each fraction of SBRT day 1 to day 5, then at 1 and 3 hours post treatment day 1 to day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of the change in the 3D chromatogram of volatile organic compound GC-IMS Spectra detected from baseline pre-treatment, to completion of SBRT at each time point, for each patient. Each 3D chromatogram GC-IMS printout is generated from the readings of each axis. The y axis is associated with GC separation of VOC's, the x axis measures the movement of the generated ions (IMS drift time) and the z axis ion detector response equating to concentration. These 3 values separate, identify and quantify the VOC compounds detected.</description>
