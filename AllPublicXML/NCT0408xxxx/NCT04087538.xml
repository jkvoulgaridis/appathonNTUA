  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rising number of patients with chest pain without myocardial infarction has made accurate
      diagnosis important. Unnecessary invasive coronary angiographies are increasingly prevalent.
      These are both costly and lead to rare but serious adverse events. Recent studies suggest
      cardiac Troponin I is more cardiac specific than cardiac Troponin T. In this study we will
      investigate whether using cardiac Troponin I lead to fewer unnecessary procedures in clinical
      practice (i.e. invasive coronary angiography and non-invasive tests)

        Two large acute medical centers will include patients for this study, one that routinely
        use cTnT (Hvidovre Hospital) and one that routinely uses cTnI (Herlev Hospital).

        Each center will include consecutive patients over a period of 5 months clinically
        suspected of non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). These patients will
        undergo serial measurement of either cardiac troponin T (cTnT) or cardiac troponin I (cTnI)
        as is standard practice. In addition to regular their lab tests, all patients will have
        extra blood samples set aside for a biobank.

        At the end of the inclusion period, all patients sent to invasive coronary angiography
        (ICA) will be identified and included in the further analyses. As one center uses cTnT and
        one uses cTnI, patients will have either biomarker measured upon admission. The other cTn
        assay will be measured on all samples from the biobank, so every patient has at least one
        measurement of both cTnT and cTnI.
