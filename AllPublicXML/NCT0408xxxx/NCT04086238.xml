  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to investigate the effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of
      decitabine and THU in healthy adults when administered as a modified release formulation of
      the 2 drugs in combination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the relative pharmacokinetics of oral decitabine and
      tetrahydrouridine (THU) after a high-fat, high-calorie (FDA standard) meal as compared to
      decitabine and THU under fasting conditions in healthy adult male and female subjects. In
      addition, this study is to compare the pharmacokinetic parameters between male and female
      subjects, and also to capture safety information for the decitabine and THU combination in
      healthy subjects after oral dosing.

             female, she meets at least one of the following criteria: Surgically sterile
             (hysterectomy, tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy); Or â‰¥1 year postmenopausal
             (will have a follicle-stimulating hormone test performed at screening to confirm
             postmenopausal status)

          -  A body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kg/m2 (inclusive) and a minimum weight of 50
             kg at screening.

          -  Subjects must be free of any clinically significant disease that would interfere with
             the study evaluations, and be in good health as determined by past medical history,
             physical examination, and ECG at screening.

          -  Vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate) will be assessed in
             the supine position after the subject has rested for at least 5 minutes. At screening,
             the potential subject must be afebrile, with a systolic blood pressure between 90 and
             140 mmHg (inclusive), diastolic blood pressure between 60 and 90 mmHg (inclusive), and
             pulse rate between 50 and 100 bpm (inclusive).

             double-barrier local contraception (i.e., spermicidal gel plus condom) when engaging
             in sexual activity with women of childbearing potential while on study medication and
             for 28 days after the last dose of study medication. They must also agree to refrain
             from sperm donations while on study drug, for the entire duration of the study, and
             for at least 28 days after the last dose of study drug.

             condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, that, in the opinion of
             the Investigator, would jeopardize the safety of the subject or the validity of the
             study results.

          -  Any serious medical condition, clinically significant laboratory abnormality, or
             psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from signing the Informed Consent
             Form.

             screening or either check-in.

          -  History of alcohol abuse within 2 years prior to dosing, or a positive alcohol test at
             screening or either check-in.

             seeds, Brussels sprouts, pomegranate, star fruit, char-grilled meat, or
             caffeine/xanthine from 48 hours prior to the first dose of study medication until the
             end-of-study visit. Subjects will be instructed not to consume any of the above
             products; however, allowance for an isolated single incidental consumption may be
             evaluated and approved by the study investigator based on the potential for
             interaction with the study drug.
