  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first in human (FIH), single-centre, double -blind, randomised, cross-over, SAD
      followed by a MAD study of IZD334 conducted in healthy adult participants as well as an
      open-label cohort in adult patients with CAPS. The study is designed to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, PK, PD, and food effect of IZD334 in healthy adult participants, and to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary clinical efficacy of IZD334 in
      adult patients with CAPS.

        Inclusion Criteria: (Healthy Volunteers)

          -  Healthy male or female volunteers, aged 18 to 65 years (inclusive at the time of

          -  Participants must be in good general health, with no significant medical history, have
             no clinically significant abnormalities on physical examination at Screening and/or
             before administration of the initial dose of study drug

          -  Participants must have a Body Mass Index (BMI) between ≥18.0 and ≤32.0 kg/m2 at

          -  Live vaccinations within 3 months prior to Screening, for the duration of the study
             and for up to 3 months following the last dose of study drug;

          -  Positive QuantiFERON test at the Screening visit or within 2 months prior to
