  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project tests the efficacy of glutamate modulators in non-depressed individuals
      with alcohol use disorder (AUD); the primary hypothesis is that the glutamate modulator being
      tested reduces heavy drinking days compared to the active control. It also aims to
      investigate, using a 2 by 2 factorial (2x2) design, the hypothesis that the effects of the
      glutamate modulator are enhanced when combined with behavioral treatment.
