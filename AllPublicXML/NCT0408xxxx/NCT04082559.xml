  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic inflammatory bowel diseases
      (IBD) currently affecting over 5 million patients globally, mostly young adults. These
      conditions are often debilitating, disabling and may markedly affect patient's quality of
      life. Despite important advances in research, the pathogenesis of IBD remains obscure, the
      incidence-rising, the condition - incurable, and drugs have a modest effect. The common
      denominator may be environmental factors, specifically diet and the microbiome, which remain
      a fundamental unmet need in IBD care as high quality randomized trials and mechanistic
      research are limited. Up to a quarter of patients with UC may undergo complete large bowel
      resection due to disease complications. In order to preserve bowel continuity, this surgery
      includes a restorative part with creation of a reservoir (&quot;pouch&quot;) from normal small bowel
      instead of the resected rectum. The majority of these patients develop small intestinal
      inflammation in the previously normal small bowel creating the pouch (&quot;pouchitis&quot;).

      Based on our results from previous studies, we hypothesized that personalized antibiotics and
      dietary interventions will modify microbial composition and result in significantly improved
      outcomes, specifically resolution of inflammation and prolonged remission rates in patients
      with a pouch.

      Aims:

        1. Compare the effect of two antibiotic treatments on clinical, inflammatory and
           microbiological outcomes of patients with pouch inflammation.

        2. Evaluate the effect of combined microbiome-targeted antibiotic and dietary intervention
           as treatment and prevention strategy in patients after pouch surgery.

        3. Evaluate the effect of a microbiome-targeted dietary intervention as prevention strategy
           in patients after pouch surgery.

        4. Identify predictors for response to specific antibiotic and dietary interventions.

      All patients will undergo comprehensive screening by the bio-MDT.

      Aim 1: Antibiotic treatment- (patients with active disease) will be randomized to receive a
      prescription for one of two antibiotic regimens.

        1. Ciprofloxacin + metronidazole

        2. Doxycycline+ metronidazole

      Aim 2: Combination therapy ( Antibiotics+diet) After arm 1 recruitment completion, a
      favorable antibiotic regimen will be determined and recommended in arm 2, in which, patients
      with active disease will be randomized to

        1. Favorable antibiotics + Mediterranean diet (MED)

        2. Favorable antibiotics + The Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD)

      Aim 3: Nutritional prevention-

      Patients in clinical remission will be recruited to a dietary prevention study and be
      allocated to one of three groups:

        1. Mediterranean diet (MED)

        2. Control- based on the American Dietetic Association recommendations for patients with
           IBD.

        3. Personalized nutrition group- based on prior results from study- NCT02858557

      Comprehensive assessment including nutritional, clinical, inflammatory and microbial
      parameters will be performed at baseline and at weeks 2,3,4,8,26, 52.
