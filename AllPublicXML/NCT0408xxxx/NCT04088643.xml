    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of 4Hz transcranial alternating
      current stimulation (tACS) in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study will
      recruit 40 individuals with mild AD, and the participants will be randomized to either a 4 Hz
      tACS group or a sham stimulation group. Both groups will undergo 30 one-hour sessions across
      3 weeks (21 days). At the end of the intervention and 3-month follow-up, all subjects will
      repeat the baseline assessments.

      Background: Recently, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), which could
      interact with ongoing neuronal activity, has emerged as a potentially effective and promising
      treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the 4Hz frequency was suggested to improve
      working memory Methods: The proposed study is a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial
      that will include 40 individuals with mild AD, and the participants will be randomized to
      either a 4Hz tACS group or a sham stimulation group. Both groups will undergo 30 one-hour
      sessions in 3 weeks (21 days). The outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, end of
      intervention and 3 months after the first session. Primary outcome is global cognitive
      function, assessed by the 11-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment
      Scale (ADAS-cog), and the second outcomes include changes in other neuropsychological
      assessments, structural MRI, resting electroencephalogram (EEG) and simultaneous
      EEG-functional MRI (fMRI).

    <description>The alternating current is administered through medical grade conductive pads that are produced specifically for the Nexalin technology. The pads are places on the forehead and behind each ear, and are connected to the Nexalin device with thin cables. Intervention will be implemented with a tACS device with 4Hz frequency and a peak-to-peak amplitude of 15mA, 30 one-hour sessions in 3 weeks (21 days).</description>

    <description>Electrodes will also be put on patient's forehead and behind each ear. The sham stimulator has the exactly same appearance with the true stimulator. Participants and operators cannot determine whether the stimulator is true based on its appearance or patients' feelings. However, when the device is started, no current flows through the electrodes. Participants in this controlled group will also receive sham stimulations with 30 one-hour sessions in 21 days.</description>
