  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of nitrous oxide/oxygen
      administration in reducing the discomfort of intranasal midazolam administration for moderate
      sedation for dental procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the effectiveness of two different concentrations of nitrous oxide
      for reducing the pain of intranasal midazolam when given for subjects already planned for
      moderate sedation for completion of dental procedures in the pediatric dental clinic.
      Moderate dental sedation is useful because it helps relieve anxiety and make the dental
      procedure less memorable and more comfortable for the patient. Sedation appointments
      typically go smoothly when the patient is calm rather than when the patient is upset. Giving
      midazolam through the nose can be painful and the dental provider risks upsetting a patient
      and causing the sedation appointment to fail. Therefore, the goal of this study is to test
      whether nitrous oxide administration is effective in reducing the pain from intranasal
      midazolam administration. The effectiveness will be measured by the primary outcome of heart
      rate pre- and post- midazolam administration for the two randomly assigned study arms. The
      first study arm will be given 30% nitrous/70% oxygen and the second study arm will be given
      70% nitrous/30% oxygen prior to the midazolam administration. The secondary outcome will
      compare subject, dental provider, and the parent/guardian answers to questions regarding the
      subject's experience pre- and post- midazolam administration. The investigators hypothesize
      lower changes in heart rate and less pain reported following midazolam administration in
      subjects given 70% nitrous oxide.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Heart rate</measure>
    <time_frame>through the study completion, an average of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Measured in beats per minute with range from 50-190 bpm. A great change in heart rate indicates more pain and less effect of the nitrous oxide. Heart rate is an autonomic reflex to determine the effect of mental and physical stressors including painful stimuli. The participants resting heart rate will be compared to the heart rate immediately after intranasal midazolam administration for a change in heart rate value.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual analog scales (VAS) for pain</measure>
    <time_frame>through the study completion, an average of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Scale from 1 (no pain) to 10 (most possible pain). A higher score indicates greater pain. VAS will be obtained from the subjective standpoint of the parent/guardian of the parent and the dental provider during time points before and after the administration of intranasal midazolam.</description>

    <description>Scale from 1 (no fear) to 10 (very fearful). A higher score indicates greater fear.
