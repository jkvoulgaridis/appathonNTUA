      The purpose of this study is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended
      phase 2 dose (RP2D) of OBI-999 as monotherapy, and to characterize the safety and preliminary
      clinical activity profile of the RP2D of OBI-999 in patients with advanced solid tumors.

          3. Histologically or cytologically confirmed patients with advanced solid tumors.

          4. Patients must have been treated with established standard-of-care therapy, or
             physicians have determined that such established therapy is not sufficiently
             efficacious, or patients have declined to receive standard-of-care therapy. In the
             latter case, the informed consent must state the effective therapies the patient is
             declining.

             and procedures, including a pretreatment tumor biopsy. Archival tumor biopsies are
             acceptable at baseline.

          9. Females of childbearing potential must have negative serum pregnancy test prior to
             starting study therapy, and agree to use a reliable form of contraceptive during the

             counts ≥ 350 cells/uL; patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be on an
             established dose for at least 4 weeks and have an HIV viral load less than 400
             copies/mL prior to enrollment.

         12. Patients with serological evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are

             100 from a qualified laboratory IHC assay in one of the sponsor-selected tumor types
             to be enrolled in the respective cohort:

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Less than 3 weeks from prior cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy; and less
             than 5 half-lives or 6 weeks, whichever is shorter, from prior biologic therapies,
             prior to the first dose of OBI 999.

          2. Has undergone a major surgical procedure (as defined by the Investigator) or
             significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to the first dose of OBI 999.

          4. Patients with a history of solid organ transplant.

          5. Unresolved toxicities from prior anticancer therapy, defined as having not resolved to
             Grade 0 or 1 (using NCI CTCAE version 5.0), except for alopecia and laboratory values
             listed in the inclusion criteria.

          6. Receipt of any prior therapy targeting Globo H.

          7. Known hypersensitivity to OBI 999 or its excipients.

          8. Has known untreated central nervous system metastases. Patients with treated brain
             metastases are eligible if there is no evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks
             after CNS-directed treatment, as ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging
             (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or computed tomography [CT]) during the screening
             period.

          9. Has a significant clinical cardiac abnormality (e.g., clinical heart failure, unstable
             angina, or ejection fraction &lt; 35%)

         10. Any medical co morbidity that is life threatening or, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, renders the patient unsuitable for participation in a clinical trial due
             to possible noncompliance, would place the patient at an unacceptable risk and/or
             potential to affect interpretation of results of the study.

         11. Is receiving any concurrent prohibited medication
