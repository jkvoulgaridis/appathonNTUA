  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low-income, minority teenagers have disproportionately high rates of asthma morbidity,
      including excess risk of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and death from
      asthma. Despite well established guidelines, under-treatment for asthma is common,
      particularly for poor urban teens. This study aims to test a novel, developmentally
      appropriate and scalable model of care to ensure optimal guideline-based treatment for urban
      teens with difficult to control asthma. The Telemedicine Enhanced Asthma Management-Uniting
      Providers for Teens (TEAM-UP for Teens) program includes 3 core components: 1- An
      individualized asthma management plan developed at the start of the school year via a
      real-time, synchronous school-based telemedicine visit that directly connects the teen to an
      asthma specialist, 2- School-based directly observed therapy (DOT) to implement the
      medication plan and allow for teens to experience the benefits of consistent therapy, 3-
      Follow-up telehealth visits with a nurse asthma educator to facilitate ongoing care and
      provide developmentally appropriate self-management support. This study is a randomized trial
      of TEAM-UP for Teens vs an enhanced care (EC) control group (n=360, 12-16 years). We will
      assess the effectiveness of the program in reducing morbidity and improving guideline-based
      asthma care. Our main hypothesis is that Teens receiving the TEAM-UP for Teens intervention
      will have more symptom-free days at 3, 6, 9, and 12-months compared to EC. We will assess a
      number of secondary outcomes, including additional clinical outcomes, functional outcomes,
      airway inflammation, and receipt of specific care measures including medication adjustments
      and treatment of and other comorbidities. We will also identify potential mediators and
      moderators of the intervention effect, and will evaluate the process of intervention
      implementation. At the completion of the study, the program will be better defined as a
      sustainable means to improve care and reduce morbidity for high risk teens with difficult to
      control asthma.
