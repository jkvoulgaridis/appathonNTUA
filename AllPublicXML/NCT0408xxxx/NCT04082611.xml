  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PREVENTION Trial is a 12-month, two-arm randomized clinical trial (RCT) in adults 50-80
      years old experiencing cognitive decline. Our study clinicians will refer patients for
      enrollment based on three categories: 1) a diagnosis of mild AD according to criteria
      established by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke
      (AD and Related Disorders Association [NINCDS-ADRDA]), 2) those with mild cognitive
      impairment will be diagnosed according to the Petersen method, and 3) subjective memory
      impairment as assessed by neuropsychological assessments and self-report. Enrollment will
      require evidence of AD pathophysiological processes (as defined by a positive amyloid
      positron emission tomography (PET) scan).

      The first objective is to evaluate the efficacy of a coached, data-driven, multi-modal
      lifestyle intervention to treat cognitive decline. Subjects will be randomized into one of
      two groups: Group 1 (Active Control) or Group 2 (Intervention). Group 1 (Data-driven clinical
      recommendations (CR)) will serve as the active control group and will receive data-driven
      clinical recommendations by a study physician based on study assessments and clinical lab
      values. Group 2 (Data-driven multi-modal intervention with coaching (MMIC)) will receive the
      same clinical recommendations and also an intensive multi-modal intervention with health
      coaching, support and resources to carry out these recommendations. This includes health
      coaching sessions (with an RDN), dietary counseling sessions (with an RDN), and group
      cognitive and physical exercise classes (CogFit) with a certified personal trainer and a
      computer-based neurocognitive program at home. Both groups will be measured for treatment
      related changes in cognitive and functional abilities, quality of life, biological, and
      biochemical measures.

      The second objective is to analyze longitudinal multi-omic data, including metabolomics,
      proteomics, genetics, microbiome, behavior and cognition into personalized, dense, dynamic
      data (i.e. PD3) from individuals with cognitive decline and underlying Alzheimer's
      neuropathology. The goal analysis is to identify models of causation that can further advance
      knowledge and research in neurodegenerative disorders and healthy living.

      Subject identification and recruitment - All participants will be recruited from the Pacific
      Brain Health Center in Santa Monica, which is a high-volume memory-care and dementia
      outpatient clinic within a large physician medical group affiliated with Providence Saint
      John's Health Center. 60 participants will be randomized into the RCT, with 30 in each
      treatment arm.

      Procedures for Obtaining Informed Consent - All participants will receive the Experimental
      Research Subject's Bill of Rights prior to signing the informed consent form (ICF),
      authorization of use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI), and authorization
      of medical record release for the subject's treating physician, will be obtained from each
      participants prior to enrolling in the study. A copy of all signed ICF's will be given to the
      participants, and the investigator will retain the original.

      A Functional Assessment Staging Test (FAST) will be done before participants are consented to
      determine whether they or a legally appointed representative (LAR) can consent to participate
      in the study. In this study, participants with FAST stages 2-4 will be recruited (see
      Inclusion Criteria).

      Considerations for consenting: FAST Stages 2-3 Participants - FAST stages 2-3 participants
      are usually capable of making medical and legal decisions, and will be consented directly,
      unless there is a caregiver, legally appointed representative, or other reason to think that
      an informed consent cannot be given by the participants without approval by a reliable
      informant acting on their behalf.

      Considerations for consenting: FAST Stage 4 (mild dementia) Participants - FAST stage 4
      participants will be consented by having them give oral or written assent, indicating their
      preference with regard to study participation. In addition, the caregiver or legally
      appointed representative of a demented participants will be consented to assure full
      understanding of study procedures and willingness on behalf of the participants to
      participate in the study.

      The consenting approach for patients with cognitive impairment has been evaluated by the
      Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Johns Hopkins, and found to adequately
      ensure informed consent. They concluded that ADRD participants should not be excluded from
      study participation if they cannot directly consent themselves, so long as their caregivers
      can consent, and the participants can assent, either verbally or in writing, their preference
      to participate in the study.

      The caregiver or legally appointed representative will be required to accompany participants
      to participate in the required procedures. A copy of the appropriate document (e.g., the
      power of attorney for healthcare) will be obtained and filed with the original ICF.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>To test the hypothesis that high contact coaching is better than no coaching for people in the early stages and at risk for cognitive decline. We plan to test that after one year of coached data-driven personalized interventions, participants in the coaching (CDDCR) (Group 2) will have less cognitive decline than the non-coaching (DDCR) arm (Group 1) as measured by the NIH ToolBox Cognition Function Battery (NIHTB-CB).
The Cognitive Function Composite Score will be our primary outcome measure for cognitive function. The NIHTB-CB contains seven computer-based instruments assessing five cognitive sub-domains: Language, Executive Function, Episodic Memory, Processing Speed, and Working Memory. The Composite Score is calculated using all seven subsets of the NIHTB-CB. Participants will be assessed at baseline and one year.</description>

          -  Subjects with medical conditions must be stable for these conditions. Stable control
             on medication is acceptable. Subjects should not have started any new medications for
             chronic conditions within the last three months.

          -  A neurological and physical evaluation will be conducted prior to enrollment of the
             study by a qualified medical doctor and confirmed through medical records that they do
             not possess any abnormal physical or neurological sign, and/ whether they are
             considered to be clinically significant. Also an MMSE &gt;19 will be confirmed by a
             medical doctor prior to study enrollment.

          -  Subjects, with or without assistance, must be able to use a computer and web
             interface. If assistance is needed, it must be readily available to them.

          -  Subjects must have regular access to a computer and the Internet along with dedicated
             email address since certain aspects of the program (e.g. cognitive training) are
             delivered electronically.

          -  Subject must have normal visual acuity (or corrected to normal) and normal color
             vision as indicated by self-report.

          -  Subject must have adequate hearing acuity as indicated by self-report.
