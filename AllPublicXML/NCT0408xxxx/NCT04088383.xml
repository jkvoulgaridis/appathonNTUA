    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical outcomes of patients with plantar fasciitis
      following treatment with Amnios™ RT. Patients will be randomized to either Amnios™ RT or a
      placebo control.

    <description>The visual analog scale (VAS) is a patient questionnaire used to quantify a subjective experience, such as the intensity of pain. The scale is a 100mm line labeled with &quot;no pain&quot; on the left border and &quot;most intense pain imaginable&quot; on the right border. The subject is instructed to place a vertical line on the scale that indicates the pain severity experienced; 0mm is equal to no pain and 100mm is most intense pain imaginable. Study staff records the distance of the patient's mark on the scale in millimeters.</description>
