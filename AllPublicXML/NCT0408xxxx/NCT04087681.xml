  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect information from study participants who develop an
      invasive disease caused by Extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) during a period of 12
      months. This information will be used to support the development of a new vaccine to prevent
      ExPEC infections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Invasive ExPEC disease (IED) is defined as an acute illness consistent with bacterial
      infection that is microbiologically confirmed by the isolation and identification of E. coli
      from blood or other normally sterile body sites, or by the isolation and identification of E.
      coli from urine in a patient with signs and symptoms of invasive disease and no other
      identifiable source of infection. Adults aged 60 years or older have an increased risk of
      developing IED. To date, there is no vaccine available to prevent IED. ExPEC10V is a 10
      valent vaccine candidate in development by Janssen R&amp;D for the prevention of IED in adults
      aged 60 years and older. A Phase 3 clinical study is planned to investigate the efficacy and
      safety of this vaccine. To obtain insight in the feasibility and design of the Phase 3 study,
      a pilot study is required.

      This pilot study is a prospective, multicenter, observational study conducted in a maximum of
      eight countries in Europe, North-America and Asia. Participant recruitment will be done in
      primary care. In each participating country a local primary care network encompassing
      approximately 40,000 persons and a local hospital, where patients are referred to in case of
      a suspicion of IED, will participate in this study.

      Database screening at the primary care centers will be performed to identify and invite
      potential eligible study participants. Upon consent, each study participant will be followed
      for a period of maximum 12 months after enrollment in the study. At baseline, demographic
      data and medical history data will be collected. During the follow-up period, any referral of
      study participants to a hospital for any reason including IED will be collected. IED
      identification and Medical Resource Utilization (MRU) during the follow-up period will be
      performed by regular telephone calls with all study participants. At the end of the study,
      the primary care files will also be checked for MRU. If a participant is diagnosed with IED
      and admitted to the hospital, the following data will be collected: medical history and
      treatment received 90 days prior to the IED, clinical and laboratory data, data on the
      treatment and outcome of IED and data on MRU related to IED. Data will be collected on Day 1
      of IED diagnosis (signs/ symptoms) and Day 28 after IED diagnosis.

        The study population includes male and female participants aged 60 years or older in stable
        health, preferably at increased risk for IED. A total of 6,000 study participants will be
        recruited. At least 50% of the study participants will be healthy elderly aged 60 years or
        older with a history of UTI in the previous ten years. The other 50% of participants will
        be healthy elderly aged 60 years or older with no (known) history of UTI in the previous
        ten years.

          -  Participant is male or female preferably with a history of UTI in the previous 10
             years. Participant without a (known) history of UTI in the previous ten years may also
             be enrolled.

          -  Participant is aged 60 years or older on the day of signing the informed consent form
             (ICF).

             of the study.

          -  Participant is ambulatory and lives in the community or in assisted-living or
             long-term care residential facility that provides minimal assistance, such that the
             participant is primarily responsible for self-care and activities of daily living.

          -  Based on the clinical judgment of the investigator, participant must be in stable
             health. Participants may have underlying illnesses such as hypertension, congestive
             heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), type 2 diabetes
             mellitus, as long as their signs and symptoms are stable and medically controlled.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has a serious chronic disorder, including severe COPD or clinically
             significant CHF, end-stage renal disease with or without dialysis, clinically unstable
             cardiac disease, Alzheimer's disease, or has any condition for which, in the opinion
             of the investigator, participation would not be in the best interest of the
             participant (e.g. compromise well-being) or that could prevent, limit, or confound the
             protocol-specified assessments.

          -  Participant has history of malignancy within 5 years before screening (exceptions are
             squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or
             malignancy, which is considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence).

          -  Participant has had major psychiatric illness and/or drug or alcohol abuse which in
             investigators opinion would compromise the participant's safety and/or compliance with
             the study procedures.

          -  Participant who, in the opinion of the investigator, is unlikely to adhere to the
             requirements of the study, or is unlikely to complete the full course of the study.
