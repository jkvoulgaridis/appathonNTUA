  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well self-generated survivorship care plans and telehealth education
      works in improving knowledge and self-efficacy in cancer survivors living in rural areas.
      Patients living in rural areas often face barriers to survivorship care and report unmet
      needs. A survivorship care plan created by the patient (self-generated) may help them to
      better transition from oncology to primary care and improve communication between care teams
      in order to meet these needs and create better health outcomes. Telehealth is a way of
      delivering health care services from a distance, including patient education. Combining a
      self-generated survivorship care plan with telehealth education may help to improve knowledge
      and self-efficacy in cancer survivors.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete a questionnaire at baseline (paper, online, or telephone-based) and medical
      records are reviewed.

      Patients are then randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive a self-generated SCP (i.e., generated from baseline questionnaire
      responses).

      ARM II: Patients receive a self-generated SCP as in Arm I. Patients also receive a 30-minute
      telephone-based educational counseling session on survivorship care.

      PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS: Primary care providers complete a questionnaire about perceptions of
      the SCP and self-efficacy in providing survivorship care.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at approximately 8 weeks.
