  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The national opioid epidemic requires development of real-world evidence-based treatments for
      opioid use disorder, including adjuncts to Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) with
      buprenorphine. Interventions are needed that address the complex needs of patients with
      opioid use disorder, which include substantial mental health co-morbidity and high rates of
      chronic pain related to the complex interaction of opioid prescribing for pain and opioid use
      disorder. This study leverages recent federal and state opioid use disorder treatment
      initiatives as a platform for testing a promising mind-body intervention, Mindful Awareness
      in Body-oriented Therapy (MABT) as an adjunct to MAT in three clinical settings funded
      through the Washington Opioid State Targeted Response (STR) program. MABT, a novel
      mindfulness-based intervention, uniquely addresses aspects of awareness, interoception, and
      regulation that may be associated with pain, mental health distress, and behavioral control
      that increase risk of relapse and poor treatment outcomes. Each setting employs a variation
      of the nationally recognized Massachusetts Nurse Care Manager model. Using a randomized,
      two-group, repeated measures design, we will compare those who receive MABT+ MAT to MAT only.
      The overarching goal of this application is to test MABT to improve MAT health outcomes among
      patients receiving buprenorphine to treat OUD. The specific aims for the combined R33/R01
      clinical protocol are to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness of MABT + TAU compared to TAU only in
      reducing opioid use (OU) and other illicit substances; 2) examine the effectiveness of MABT +
      TAU to improve mental and physical health vs. TAU only; 3) examine the effectiveness of MABT
      + TAU to positively affect substance use related outcomes of craving and treatment retention
      vs. TAU only. For the R01, there is an additional aim to explore the effectiveness of
      additional MABT dose offered at 6 months to those with continued substance use
      (non-responders) compared to those with continued substance use at 6 months in TAU. A
      two-group (n = 165/165), randomized controlled repeated measures design will be employed.
      Three hundred thirty individuals with OUD engaged in buprenorphine treatment will be
      recruited for participation at one of three outpatient treatment sites. Assessments will be
      administered at baseline, post-intervention (3 months from baseline), and at 6, 9, and 12
      months. Results of this study will inform the evidence base for behavioral treatment adjuncts
      to MAT with buprenorphine and directly impact the future direction of the Washington Opioid
      STR program.
