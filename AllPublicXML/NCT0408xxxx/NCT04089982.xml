  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to assess varenicline vs. placebo for its effect on decreasing cue
      reactivity in light and intermittent smokers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of randomization to receive either varenicline or placebo over 6 weeks
      and include 5 study visits. Participants are offered an optional additional 6 weeks of active
      varenicline. Cue reactivity will be assessed in both a lab-based setting (viewing series of
      images and rating cravings) and in a real-world setting (text-based daily interaction).
