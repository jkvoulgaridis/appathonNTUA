  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib, open-label, multi-centre study to determine the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of capivasertib when given in combination with novel agents
      (enzalutamide or abiraterone) to inform the selection of capivasertib dose regimens for each
      combination for further clinical evaluation when given to patients with metastatic castration
      resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The study design allows an exploration of different doses
      with intensive safety monitoring to ensure the safety of the patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted on multiple centers (â‰¤10) in USA and Spain. The study design
      allows an exploration of different doses with intensive safety monitoring to ensure the
      safety of the patients.

      The two planned combination treatments during Part A of this study are:

      Part A1: Capivasertib and enzalutamide Part A2: Capivasertib and abiraterone Part B will
      include any optional dose expansion cohorts based on Safety Review Committee (SRC) review of
      data from Part A of this study.

      The study will include up to approximately 87 evaluable patients, divided among the 4 study
      parts as follows:

      Part A1: Up to approximately 36 patients (up to four dose levels with up to approximately 9
      patients per dose level).

      Part B1: Up to approximately 12 patients. Part A2: Up to approximately 27 patients (up to
      three dose levels with up to approximately 9 patients per dose level). Part B2: Up to
      approximately 12 patients.

             [NHA]) or for whom no alternative approved therapy is available.

          4. World Health Organization (WHO) performance status 0 to 2 with no deterioration over
             the previous 2 weeks and minimum life expectancy of 12 weeks, as assessed at day 1.

          5. Patients must be able to swallow and retain oral medication.

          6. Agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use
             contraceptive measures, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm.

               -  Sterilisation (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence

               -  Patients should use barrier contraception (ie, condoms) from the time of
                  screening until 16 weeks after discontinuation of study treatment. It is not

                  organs, after treatment with capivasertib, will be fully reversible or will
                  permanently affect the ability to produce healthy sperm following treatment.
                  Therefore, if patients wish to father children they should be advised to arrange
                  for collection of sperm samples prior to the start of study treatment.

                  sudden death under 40 years-of-age, or any concomitant medication known to
                  prolong the QT interval.

               -  Clinically significant heart disease as evidenced by myocardial infarction or
                  arterial thrombotic events in the past 6 months, severe or unstable angina, or
