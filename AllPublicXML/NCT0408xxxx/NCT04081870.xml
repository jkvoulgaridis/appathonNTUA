      Three D power Doppler US was done for every woman at the day after HCG administration. Ovum
      pick up was done after 35 hours following HCG administration. The luteal phase was supported
      by progesterone 300 mg per day (progest, micronized progesterone 100mg, Technopharma, Egypt,
      for pharco pharmaceuticals, Amriya- Alexandria). Five days following ovum pick up, the
      embryos were transferred at the blastocyst stage.

      All women underwent long agonist protocol for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation described
      by Chang et al. (14) The GnRH agonist was started in the previous mid-luteal phase
      (decapeptylR R 0.1mg, Triptorelin-Acetate, Ferring GmbH, Wittland 11, D-24109, and Kiel,
      Germany). After the confirmation of pituitary down regulation (serum LH less than 5 m IU/ml
      and serum E2 less than 50 pg /ml), the HMG ampoules were started by 225 IU/day (Gonapure 75
      IU, IBSA Institute Biochimique SA, Switzerland). During the follow up of overstimulation, the
      doses were adjusted according to the response of patient. All women underwent serial TVS
      until at least three dominant follicles were reached in every woman. When the dominant
      follicles reached 18-20 mm, HCG 10000 (Choriomon 5000 IU, IBSA Institute Biochimique SA,
      Switzerland) was administered. Three D power Doppler US was done for every woman at the day
      after HCG administration. Ovum pick up was done after 35 hours following HCG administration.
      The luteal phase was supported by progesterone 300 mg per day (progest, micronized
      progesterone 100mg, Technopharma, Egypt, for pharco pharmaceuticals, Amriya- Alexandria).
      Five days following ovum pick up, the embryos were transferred at the blastocyst stage.
      Twelve days later to embryo transfer, serum pregnancy test was done and if positive (chemical
      pregnancy), the clinical pregnancy was confirmed by TVS for detection of gestational sacs and
      embryo cardiac activity. The ongoing pregnancy was detected by abdominal ultrasound at 12
      weeks.
