    <textblock>
      chronic ankle instability could be associated with some proximal deficits as in hip and knee
      regions. these deficits include alternations in motor neurons pools excitability, muscle
      strength, kinematics and kinetics. this study add muscle inflexibility to the preciouse
      literature.

      Background: influence of a localized injury in a distal joint on the function of proximal
      muscles is an important consideration in assessment and treatment of musculoskeletal
      injuries. Up to the investigator's knowledge, there is no study assess flexibility changes in
      CAI. Objectives: The objective of this study is to investigate Hamstring flexibility in CAI.
      Material and methods: The study conducted on 42 subjects with unilateral CAI and controls had
      measure of hamstring flexibility using digital inclinometer during passive knee extension
      test .Results: Revealed statistical and clinical significant difference between non-injured
      control group and CAI group with decreased hamstring flexibility in the later. Conclusion:
      CAI subjects have proximal muscular affection include hamstring tightness which may alter
      sacroiliac joint stability and subsequently back pain.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The control group was self-reported to be healthy

          -  Had no ankle injury history

          -  Matched with CAI patients in gender, dominance side and simulated injured side

          -  CAI group had a self-report of a past history of unilateral ankle inversion injury
             since at least more than 1 year before the study onset which required a period of
             protected weight bearing and/or immobilization at least one day

          -  Patient reported a tendency for the ankle to give way and/or recurrent ankle sprain

          -  Perceives that the ankle was chronically weaker, more painful and/or less functional
             than the other ankle or than before first

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Had a history of lower extremity injury

          -  Surgery or fracture
