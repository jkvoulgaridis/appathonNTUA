  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with non-dialysis-dependent end stage kidney disease (ESKD) the common transition
      of care to renal replacement therapy is dialysis. Each year over 70 000 Chinese transition
      from non-dialysis-dependent ESKD to dialysis. Whereas dialysis therapy is intended to be
      life-sustaining, ESKD patients have a 10-fold or higher risk of death compared with the
      general population. Mortality rates are even higher upon transition and in the first year,
      especially in the first 3 to 6 months following the transition to dialysis, yet it remains
      unknown which is the contributing cause of this high death rate. Hence, there is an urgent
      need to examine the emerging field of Transition of Care in ESKD. We suggest the term
      &quot;peridialysis period&quot; for this transition period for ESKD patients, so that the transition of
      care from non-dialysis-dependent ESKD to dialysis ESKD can be more pragmatically defined and
      studied. In the current study, we will investigate the mortality and its risk factors of ESKD
      patients during peridialysis period, and improve the survival rate and quality of life of
      peridialysis ESKD patients by intervening the risk factors.
