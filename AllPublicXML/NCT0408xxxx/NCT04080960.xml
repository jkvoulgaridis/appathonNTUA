      program for people with or at risk for type 2 diabetes. The program teaches participants how
      to prevent or manage their disease by providing practical knowledge and strategies to make
      the necessary lifestyle changes that will lead to healthier living and reduction in the risk
      of complications. The overall goals and objectives of the program are as follows:

      Increasing knowledge of healthy food choices for families with or at risk for diabetes
      Promoting behavior changes by offering demonstrations and tasting of healthy food.

      Increasing knowledge of essential medical tests associated with diabetes management.

      Promoting physical activity as a component of diabetes control. Encouraging self-management
      and self-efficacy skill. Connecting participants to their healthcare providers for long-term
      follow-up. The program is designed to meet 4 consecutive weeks and then a 3 month follow-up.
      Participants A1c and blood pressure are taking at the first and follow-up classes. Classes
      consist of a nutrition lesson, physical activity, cooking demonstration and food tasting.
