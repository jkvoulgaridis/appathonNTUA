  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will determine whether G6PD-deficient RBCs store differently than normal
      RBCs under standard blood banking conditions. The investigators plan to screen a large number
      of healthy male volunteers for G6PD deficiency in order to identify 10 G6PD deficient and 30
      matched normal individuals using a blood sample obtained from a finger-stick. The identified
      individuals will then be asked to donate a unit of blood that will be stored for up to 42
      days and various tests will be performed on these units during storage. At 6 weeks of storage
      a portion of the unit will be radioactively labeled and re-infused into the volunteer. Blood
      samples will be drawn before, during, and after the infusion to measure how well or poorly
      the red blood cells survive after transfusion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common enzyme deficiency,
      affecting approximately 400 million people world-wide. It manifests as red blood cell (RBC)
      destruction in response to oxidative stress, which can be precipitated by infection, and by
      the ingestion of certain medications and foods. The prevalence of G6PD deficiency varies
      among populations and is most commonly found in individuals from sub-Saharan Africa, the
      Mediterranean region, and south-east Asia. Although in most studies G6PD-deficient
      individuals have normal RBC survival at steady-state, this may vary based upon the G6PD
      variant present, and some individuals may have shortened RBC survival. While it is not
      routine practice to screen blood donors for G6PD deficiency, G6PD deficient donor RBCs may
      store more poorly than normal RBCs. In addition, the transfusion of stored G6PD-deficient
      RBCs may result in decreased RBC survival after transfusion compared to RBCs from normal
      donors.

      Blood will be collected to conduct a complete blood count (CBC), testing for the presence of
      abnormal hemoglobin types (hemoglobinopathy screen), blood type and antibody screen, and
      confirmation of G6PD deficiency by measuring enzyme activity. In addition, DNA will be
      extracted and preserved for genetic testing for G6PD deficiency.
