  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study of IGM-2323 in adult subjects with relapsed or refractory B-cell
      Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. This study will consist of a dose-escalation stage and a dose-expansion
      stage where subjects will be enrolled into indication-specific expansion cohorts. IGM-2323
      will be administered intravenously (IV).

      Additional CD20-positive NHL histologies (e.g. MZL and MCL), may be allowed with Medical
      Monitor approval during the Dose-Escalation Phase of the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IGM-2323 is an engineered bispecific IgM antibody for the treatment of patients with
      CD20-positive cancers. It contains ten high affinity binding domains for CD20, and one
      binding domain for CD3. IGM-2323 is able to eliminate CD20-positive lymphoma cells by
      engaging T-cells and lymphoma cells, leading to T-cell dependent cellular cytotoxicity.
      Additionally, IGM-2323 is also able to eliminate lymphoma cells by recruiting complement to
      the surface of lymphoma cells, leading to complement dependent cytotoxicity.

      In our preclinical studies, we observed activity against rituximab resistant cells carrying
      low levels of CD20. We have also observed much lower cytokine release with IGM-2323 relative
      to comparable IgG format bispecific T-cell engaging antibodies, which is expected to result
      in reduced risk of the serious adverse effects from cytokine release syndrome (CRS).

    <description>Subjects will receive IGM-2323 via intravenous (IV) infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15, of 21-day cycles. Subjects will be treated with 4 cycles (3 weeks each). Subjects benefiting from therapy can receive up to 8 cycles or longer with good response. Dose escalation will be guided by the observed incidence of DLTs at each dose level.</description>
