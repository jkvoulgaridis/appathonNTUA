  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal recordings of diaphragm electrical activity (EAdi) made it possible to monitor
      respiratory drive and the subsequent phrenic nerve conduction and respiratory neuromuscular
      function continuously. Thus, we designed a &quot;spontaneous breathing challenge&quot; test to monitor
      the change in EAdi after a maximal inspiration. We hypothesized that the absolute change
      (ΔEAdi) and the percentage changes change (ΔEAdi%) in EAdi after a &quot;spontaneous breathing
      challenge&quot; predict successful extubation in traumatic CSCI patients during acute
      hospitalization.

      A retrospective cohort study enrolled adult traumatic CSCI patients who underwent mechanical
      ventilation and admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Zhongda hospital form June 2014
      to July 2018. The following inclusion criteria were used: age 18 years or older, traumatic
      CSCI patients with a neurologic level of injury of C2 to C7 by the American Spinal Injury
      Association (ASIA) standard impairment scale grade A，B, and C patients with mechanical
      ventilation due to acute respiratory failure and admite to ICU, dedicated nasogastric tube
      with nine electrodes that allow to continuously measure diaphragm electrical activity (EAdi
      catheter, Maquet, Solna, Sweden) in postion. CSCI was defined as radiologically-confirmed
      injury to the cervical spinal column, combined with clinical signs and symptoms consistent
      with CSCI at that level. The exclusion criteria were: tracheostomy at time of addmition to
      ICU, withhold or withdraw life sustaining treatment due to other serious organ injury, can't
      complete instructional actions, death occurred within 7 days after injury, or postoperative
      MV was a direct result of surgery and had duration of less than 24 hours postoperatively.
      Extubation or tracheostomy was decided by the physician in charge according to the local
      protocol of weaning.
