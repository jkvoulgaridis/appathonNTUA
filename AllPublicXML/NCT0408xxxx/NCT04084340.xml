  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence (UI) is defined as any involuntary loss of urine and can be divided into
      three types: urgency, stress and mixed. Pelvic floor exercises are considered the main non
      pharmacological choice for UI treatment. Its mechanisms are not fully understood, however
      there are some evidence that central mechanisms play an important role in the continence
      control. In this context, neuromodulatory techniques, such as transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS), that address cortical targets has been demonstrated promising results in
      different health conditions. However, few studies have investigated the efficacy of adding
      tDCS to exercise therapies for women with UI.

    <description>Urinary leakage will be measured by the pad test. Pad testing yields an objective measurement of fluid loss over a certain period.
The outcome of the 1-h pad test will be recorded as the weight gain as measured by a verified spring balance.
Pad test assessment: Change in 1-hour exercise (stress), classified as mild, moderate or severe urinary leaking.</description>

    <measure>Incontinence severity</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Incontinence severity will be assessed by the Brazilian version of Incontinence severity index (ISI) that quantifies the frequency and number of urinary leaking.
The ISI comprehend two questions about quantity and frequency of urinary losses. The score are from 0 to 12:
0 continent
1 or 2 mild incontinence 3 or 6 moderate incontinence 8 or 9 severe incontinence 12 very severe incontinence</description>

    <description>Quality of life will be analyzed by the Brazilian version of King's Health Questionnaire.
KHQ is a patient self-administered self-report and has 3 parts consisting of 21 items. The score from eight subscales &quot;domains&quot; are from 0 (best) to 100 (worst). Decreases in KHQ domain scores indicate an improvement in quality of life.</description>

    <description>The emotional impact of urinary incontinence on quality of life will be analyzed by the Brazilian version of Incontinence Quality of Life Questionnaire (IQOL) that evaluates the social, physical and mental aspects of the woman with urinary incontinence.
The IQOL is a self-report questionnaire with 22 questions and three subscales (&quot;domains&quot;). The score are from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).</description>
