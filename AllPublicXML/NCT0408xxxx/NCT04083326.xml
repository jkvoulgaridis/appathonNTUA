  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional study which aims at assessing the effects of a digital patient
      journey solution in patients undergoing elective hip and knee arthroplasty due to primary
      osteoarthritis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally, pre- and postoperative education has been provided face-to-face by paper-based
      methods for patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty
      (TKA). Digital patient journey solution has potential to enhance adherence to preoperative
      preparation and postoperative rehabilitation, and further improve patient experience, while
      reducing potential adverse events.

      The purpose of this study is to assess a digital patient journey solution developed for
      patients undergoing elective hip and knee arthroplasty. The digital solution aims to support
      patient's preparation to and recovery from a hip and knee arthroplasty through provision of
      timely information and support related to preoperative preparation and postoperative
      rehabilitation. The information on the application is aligned with the patient's individual
      needs and requirements, and contains exercises to be completed daily for the duration of the
      program.

    <description>Patients in the intervention arm are provided with a digital patient journey solution used on a mobile device. The application is intended to be used during the whole care path. The patient can familiarize him-/herself to the phases of care through visual timeline representation of the care path, get information on how to prepare for a surgery, receive reminders, fill in questionnaire forms, communicate with the care personnel via messaging functionality and video calls, and search information from frequently asked questions. The application contains information about the preparation, forms for anamnesis, anesthesia and treatment follow-up, information videos and pictures, and timely and individually-tailored reminders, e.g., on when to stop eating and drinking before the surgery. In addition, the application provides instructions on how to arrive to the treatment unit and comprehensive guidance for wound care and rehabilitation at home after the operation.</description>

    <description>Conventional care consists of specialist assessment in conjunction with pre-operative surgical visits and patient education. Patients in the conventional care group are provided with pre- and postoperative information face-to-face by paper-based method. Patients will be admitted and mobilised on the day of the surgery, and discharged one to three days after surgery. The follow-up visit, conducted by a physiotherapist, is conducted after 6 to 8 weeks post-discharge for patients with TKA and after 8 to 12 weeks for patients with THA.</description>
