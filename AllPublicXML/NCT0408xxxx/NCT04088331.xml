    <description>The AMS 800 Artificial Urinary Sphincter (AUS) is an implantable, fluid filled, solid silicone elastomer device used to treat stress urinary incontinence due to reduced urethral/bladder outlet resistance (intrinsic sphincter deficiency). It is designed to restore the natural process of urinary control. The device simulates normal sphincter function by opening and closing the urethra under the control of the patient.</description>
