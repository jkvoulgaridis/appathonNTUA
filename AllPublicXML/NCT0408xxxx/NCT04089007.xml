  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy of an intervention using
      wearable sensors and a mHealth application, SOmNI, to promote sleep for adolescents. The
      investigators hypothesize that a behavioural intervention delivered through a mobile app will
      be a cost-effective and accessible method of engaging adolescents in the self-management of
      sleep behaviours. Participants will be randomized to either the SOmNI Intervention group or
      the Control group. Participants receiving the SOmNI app will attempt to incrementally move
      their school night bedtime earlier in the evening.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 60% of adolescents sleep less than the 9 hours of sleep recommended for 13-18 year olds.
      Quality of life is reduced due to the daytime consequences of chronic sleep deprivation such
      as sleepiness, fatigue, low mood, and inattentiveness at school. Although this sleep debt
      occurs in otherwise healthy adolescents, it significantly increases their risk of development
      of the chronic health conditions (cardiovascular disease and depression) and forms of
      accidental injury (motor vehicle accidents) that place the greatest demands on our health
      care system. Despite increased recognition of adequate sleep as a key contributor to health,
      there exist few effective interventions to promote sleep in adolescents. This study is
      designed to determine compliance, feasibility and preliminary data on health outcomes
      (nocturnal sleep measured objectively by actigraphy; daytime sleepiness; anxiety; depression;
      unintentional injuries; morning school attendance). This study will be a pilot RCT,
      randomizing 76 adolescents to one of two groups (i.e. 38 per group). Study arms will include
      a control group and intervention group (activity monitoring device with custom application).
      Mobile health, user-friendly low-intensity interventions with wearable sleep sensors and
      tailored feedback may help many adolescents to increase the amount of sleep they achieve.

    <description>Participants will receive an iPhone with the SOmNI app and will be instructed to move their bedtime earlier by 5 minutes (from their average baseline week bedtime) on each school night (Sunday to Thursday). Participants will also be given sleep hygiene information related to the embedded features of the SOmNI app. A research assistant will help the participant to enter the appropriate goal bedtime in the SOmNI app and orient them to the features of the SOmNI app. Participants will also be instructed to aim for &lt;1 hour difference between school night and weekend bedtimes and wake times (i.e. avoid staying up late and sleeping in on weekends).
The SOmNI application will allow the user to graphically track sleep behaviour across the four-week intervention period as recorded by the wearable sensor (e.g. bedtimes, wake times, amount of sleep achieved will all be displayed in the app).</description>

    <description>In addition to allowing users to track sleep behaviours across the four-week intervention period, the SOmNI app will also provide messaging via alerts and tips to outline the importance of sleep to health, suggest optimal sleep timing/duration, and suggest sleep promotion strategies. Daily review questions in the app will help the participants link changes in sleep behaviours to changes in health outcomes. As well, when goals related to sleep extension are met, the SOmNI rewards program awards points to the participant and these points can then be redeemed in $5 increments to a maximum of $40 for gift certificates.</description>
