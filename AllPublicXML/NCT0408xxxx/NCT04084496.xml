  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although FOLFIRINOX regimen was recently presented to be effective as adjuvant chemotherapy
      for resectable pancreatic cancer in selected patients who have good physical condition, there
      is still insufficient evidence on this regimen in treating resectable pancreatic cancer
      patients in China. Since for many tumors, different races may show different responses to the
      same regimen, we design this open phase Ⅱ study to evaluate the the efficacy and safety of
      mFOLFIRINOX as adjuvant chemotherapy for resectable pancreatic cancer in China.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study. Patients with resectable pancreatic carcinoma will receive adjuvant
      chemotherapy of FOLFIRINOX for 6 months.

      Primary endpoint is the disease free survival. Secondary endpoints are overall survival,
      safety and quality of life.
