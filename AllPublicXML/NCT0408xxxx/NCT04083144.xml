  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of deep repetitive transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) using the insula H-coil on smoking outcomes in smokers receiving
      varenicline. It is hypothesized that active deep rTMS will improve abstinence rates,
      attenuate craving and reduce cigarette consumption and dependence severity.

      This study will be a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial. Nicotine
      dependent participants will be recruited and randomized tor receive either active or sham
      rTMS intervention for 4 weeks (5 sessions/week). All participants will receive an open-label
      treatment of varenicline for 12 weeks and weekly counselling sessions. The aims of the study
      are:

        1. To examine the efficacy of bilateral deep rTMS to the insula on point prevalence smoking
           abstinence in smokers receiving varenicline treatment.

        2. To examine the efficacy of bilateral deep rTMS to the insula on other smoking outcomes
           such as craving, cigarette smoking and dependence severity.

        3. To examine the effect of bilateral deep rTMS to the insula on abstinence at the end of
           rTMS treatment and at 6-month follow up.

      Abstinence will be measured by point prevalence at week 4 and 12 and continuous abstinence at
      week 26. This will be confirmed using plasma cotinine levels. All other measures will be done
      using various questionnaires such as Fagerstrom Test of Nicotine Dependence (FTND), Timeline
      Follow-Back (TLFB), Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale (MNWS), and Tiffany Questionnaire of
      Smoking Urges (T-QSU).
