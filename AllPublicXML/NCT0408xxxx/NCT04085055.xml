      This is a randomized trial to evaluate and directly compare the tissue quality, diagnostic
      sucess and safety profile of four different Fine Needle Biopsy needles.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is currently the standard
      method for sampling solid pancreatic masses, with reported sensitivity for malignant cytology
      of 85-95%, specificity of 95-98% and diagnostic accuracy of 78-95%. Diagnostic failure of
      EUS-FNA can be due to inadequate targeting, inexperience of the endoscopist/pathologist, or
      necrotic or fibrotic tumors in which viable cells are difficult to obtain. The cellularity
      and architectural representation of the sample can also be determined by the needle used and
      its specific features. Recently, new needles known as &quot;fine needle biopsy (FNB)&quot; needles have
      become available that are specially designed to promote the collection of core tissue by
      unique designs of their needle tips. The advantages of FNB over FNA needles are that (a) the
      quality of tissue procured is superior: FNA needles yield cytology whereas FNB needles yield
      histology (b) molecular marker analysis can be performed more reliably on histology samples
      than cytology aspirates and (c) as histological tissue is greater in quantity than
      cytological aspirates, a quicker diagnosis with fewer passes can be established by histology
      than cytology.

      Four different types of FNB needles are currently available - reverse-bevel tip (EchoTip
      ProCore HD Ultrasound Biopsy Needle, Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN), Menghini-tip (EZ shot,
      Olympus America, Center Valley, PA), Franseen tip (Acquire, Boston Scientific Corporation,
      Natick, MA) and fork-tip (SharkCore, Medtronic Corporation/Covidien, Newton, MA) needles,
      each with unique tip designs to facilitate procurement of histological core tissue. Although
      we have previously compared in randomized trials the diagnostic yield of Franseen and
      fork-tip FNB needles and have shown the two needles to be equivalent, there are currently no
      randomized trials directly comparing all four FNB needle types. EUS-guided tissue acquisition
      can also be performed using different techniques, including the use of suction, no use of
      suction and the stylet retraction technique. There are currently no studies comparing these
      different tissue acquisition techniques using the different FNB needles and no study has
      demonstrated the best technique for FNB.
