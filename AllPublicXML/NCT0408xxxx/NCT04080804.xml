  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to potentiate adaptive immunity to enhance the anti-tumor activity
      of anti-PD1 antibody by the addition of anti-CTLA4 antibody or anti-LAG3 antibody
      (relatlimab) given in subjects with resectable locally advanced HNSCC prior to surgical
      resection.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapeutic agents have been well tolerated in the recurrent/metastatic patient
      population. Studies have shown that delay of surgical resection for 3-4 weeks after diagnosis
      is acceptable. Overall survival for locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
      are poor with the current treatment modalities available. Previously untreated, locally
      advanced (AJCC 8th edition stage III-IVa) HPV+ and HPV- head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
      patients who are candidates for surgical resection, as deemed by the multidisciplinary team
      will be included in this trial. Patients with histories of autoimmune disease or with current
      or previous histories of immune modulating agents will be excluded from participation.
      Relatlimab will be given IV at a dose of 160 mg IV on D1 (and on D28 if surgery is postponed
      at the discretion of the investigator). Nivolumab will be given IV at a dose of 480 mg on D1
      (and on D28 if surgery is postponed at the discretion of the investigator) when given alone
      or with relatlimab. Nivolumab will be given at dose of 3mg/kgIV every 2 weeks on D1 and D14
      (and on D28 if the operating room time is not yet available, and the 4 week CT scan
      demonstrates at least stable disease ) when given with Ipilimumab. Ipilimumab will be given
      at a dose of 1 mg/kg IV once only on D1. Patients will undergo biopsy and CT scan prior to
      treatment initiation. 4 weeks (+/- 1 week) after, patient will undergo surgical resection. CT
      scan will be repeated prior to surgery (from 1-72 hours prior to surgery). The patients will
      be monitored from time of biopsy until 6 months postoperatively.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females, ages ≥18 years

          2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed Squamous Cell Carcinoma, previously
             untreated stage III, or IVA HNC by AJCC 8th edition staging system. Newly diagnosed,

             multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, bilateral lymph nodes, or contralateral lymph node
             will be included. Patients must undergo CT or MRI to rule out the presence of distant
             metastases.

          3. Accessible tumor for pretreatment (baseline) open/incisional biopsy to provide
             adequate correlative specimen.

          4. Have LAG-3 and PD-L1 results for stratification.

          5. LVEF assessment with documented LVEF ≥50% by either TTE or MUGA (TTE preferred test)
             within 28 days prior to first study drug administration

          6. Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) must be advised of the importance of avoiding
             pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an
             unintentional pregnancy. All WOCBP MUST have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days
             prior to first receiving investigational product. If the pregnancy test is positive,
             the patient must not receive investigational product and must not be enrolled in the
             study. All WOCBP must agree to use appropriate contraception to prevent pregnancy for
             the duration of treatment with study treatments, plus 24 weeks after the last dose of
             study treatment (i.e., 30 days [duration of ovulatory cycle] plus approximately 5
             half-lives).

          7. All males must agree to use appropriate contraception for the duration of treatment
             with study treatments plus 33 weeks after the last dose of study treatment (i.e., 90
             days [duration of sperm turnover] plus approximately 5 half-lives). In addition, male
             participants must be willing to refrain from sperm donation during this time. In
             addition, men enrolled on this study must be informed of the risks to any sexual
             partner of childbearing potential and should practice an effective method of birth
             control

          8. Azoospermic males are exempt from contraceptive requirements unless the potential
             exists for fetal toxicity due to study drug being present in seminal fluid, even if
             the participant has undergone a successful vasectomy or if the partner is pregnant.
             WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are also exempt from
             contraceptive requirements, and still must undergo pregnancy testing as described in
             this section.

          9. Primary tumors of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx will be
             included.

         10. Eligible for surgical resection.

         11. Age ≥ 18 years

         12. ECOG performance status 0-1.

         13. Have signed written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior radiation, chemotherapy, oncology vaccine or immunotherapy.

          2. Prior severe infusion reaction to a monoclonal antibody.

          3. Troponin T (TnT) or I (TnI) &gt; 2 × institutional ULN. Subjects with TnT or TnI levels
             between &gt; 1 to 2 × ULN will be permitted if repeat levels within 24 hours are less
             than or equal to 1 x ULN. If TnT or TnI levels are &gt; 1 to 2 × ULN within 24 hours, the
             subject may undergo a cardiac evaluation and be considered for treatment, following a
             discussion with the BMS Medical Monitor or designee. When repeat levels within 24
             hours are not available, a repeat test should be conducted as soon as possible. If TnT
             or TnI repeat levels beyond 24 hours are &lt; 2 x ULN, the subject may undergo a cardiac
             evaluation and be considered for treatment.

          4. Evidence of distant metastasis.

          5. Prior history of HNC treated &lt; 5 years previously.

          6. Prior history of myocarditis, regardless of etiology
