  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation is a prospective, multi-center clinical investigation. It is anticipated
      that a total of one hundred (100) subjects will be enrolled at approximately 5-10 sites. The
      clinical investigation has been designed to follow the surgeon's standard of care for joint
      arthroplasty patients, which entails clinical evaluation on a regular ongoing basis, or as
      needed should the patient become symptomatic in the treated joint.

      The objective of this clinical investigation is to demonstrate the safety and
      efficacy/performance of the ReUnion RFX System. Efficacy/performance of the procedure will be
      measured by the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) Shoulder Score. Safety of the
      ReUnion RFX System will be demonstrated through reporting of device-related intraoperative
      and postoperative Adverse Events (AEs). Enrolled subjects will be assessed at Pre-Operative,
      Operative/Discharge, and at 6 Weeks, 6 Months, 12 Months, 24 Months and annually thereafter
      up to 10 years following the index procedure.

    <description>This is a mixed outcome reporting measure, applicable for use in patients with shoulder pathology regardless of diagnosis and consists of a pain visual analog scale (VAS) and 10 functional questions. The primary endpoint of the clinical investigation is to demonstrate non-inferiority of the device to the selected literature controls, as measured by the ASES Shoulder Score at 24 Months post-operative.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is willing to sign the informed consent.

             evaluations.

          -  Subject is male or non-pregnant female and 18 years or older at the time of surgery.

          -  When used with ReUnion Total Shoulder Arthroplasty (TSA)Humeral &amp; Glenoid components
             as a Hemiarthroplasty or Total Shoulder Replacement, subject has one or more of the
             following:

               -  Aseptic necrosis of humeral head;

               -  Painful, disabling joint disease of the shoulder resulting from degenerative
                  arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or post-traumatic arthritis;

               -  Proximal humeral fracture and/or dislocation;

               -  Clinical management problems where arthrodesis or alternative reconstructive
                  techniques are less likely to achieve satisfactory results;

               -  Previous unsuccessful total shoulder replacement, resurfacing or other procedure

          -  When used with ReUnion RSA Humeral &amp; Glenoid Components as a primary, fracture or
             revision total shoulder replacement, subject's joint has gross rotator cuff
             deficiency, a functional deltoid muscle and is anatomically and structurally suited to
             receive the implant, and subject has one or more of the following:

               -  Painful, disabling joint disease of the shoulder resulting from degenerative
                  arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis;

               -  Proximal humeral fracture

               -  Previously failed shoulder joint replacement

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has an active or suspected latent infection in or about the shoulder joint.

          -  Subject has mental or neuromuscular disorder which would create an unacceptable risk

             postoperative care.

          -  Subject has bone stock compromised by disease, infection or prior implantation which
             cannot provide adequate support and/or fixation to the prosthesis.

          -  Subject has anticipated activities which would impose high stresses on the prosthesis
             and its fixation.

          -  Subject is obese such that he/she produces a load on the prosthesis which can lead to
             failure of fixation of the device or to failure of the device itself.

          -  Subject has severe concomitant disease(s)which may significantly affect the clinical
             outcome.

          -  For Total Shoulder Arthroplasty and Hemiarthroplasty: Subject has absent, irreparable
             or non-functioning rotator cuff and other essential muscles
