      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Apatinib combined with PD-1
      antibody Sintilimab for for Chemotherapy-Refractory Advanced Metastatic Gastric Cancer

    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC) can be treated with multiple lines of
      chemotherapy. After second-line treatment some patients may receive third- and subsequent
      lines of chemotherapy if their performance status is well-preserved and they are willing to
      receive subsequent active treatments. Apatinib is a small-molecule VEGFR-2 tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor approved by the CFDA for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer. In a phase III
      trial, apatinib significantly improved PFS and OS compared with placebo, but the clinical
      benefit was modest. As a result of toxicity, 850 mg/day Apatinib may cause dose reduction and
      delay in some patients ,which also caused some doubts. Therefore, it is a reasonable
      treatment strategy by reducing the dose and combining it with another low-toxic drug to
      achieve similar or better effects. Some studies have shown that the combination of targeted
      therapy and immunotherapy may be effective in solid tumor. Sintilimab (IBI308) is a
      monoclonal antibody targeting programmed death-1 (PD-1). So, the investigators designed an
      open-label, single-arm, phase II clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      apatinib combined with Sintilimab in Chemotherapy-Refractory Advanced Metastatic Gastric
      Cancer.
