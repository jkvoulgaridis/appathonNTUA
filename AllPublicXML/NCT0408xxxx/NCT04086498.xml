  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate how glycemia and ketonemia variations during three
      different diet protocols: a ketogenic diet without any restriction on calories intake (KD), a
      calorie-restricted ketogenic-mediterranean diet (KEMEPHY) and a calorie-restricted
      mediterranean diet (MD) affect appetite, executive functions and mood in overweight young
      women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifty overweight young women with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 25 will be randomly
      assigned to a ten days of ketogenic diet (KD), calorie-restricted ketogenic-mediterranean
      diet (KEMEPHY) or Mediterranean diet (MD). All subjects will begin the prescribed diet at the
      beginning of their follicular phase. Body composition, fasting blood glucose and
      β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), visual analogue scale (VAS) to test appetite as well as
      psychological tests (one mood test and two cognitive tasks) will be obtained 5 days before
      the beginning and on the last day of the diet-period.

    <measure>Motivation to eat and appetite</measure>
    <time_frame>after 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Motivation to eat and appetite were investigated by Visual Analog Scale (Hill &amp; Blundell, 1982) , a test formed by 6 scales. Each scale was 10 cm long and was labelled with vertical lines and numbers (from 0 to10) every cm. Participants had to choose which part of the scale better described how they felt. The scale investigated appetite, fullness, desire to eat, how much would participant eat, urgency of eating and worries about food through 6 questions. Moreover, also the unfullness index (10 - fullness) was taken into account (R. J. Stubbs et al., 2000).</description>

    <description>The working memory test was an adapted version of the visuo-spatial N-back (Cui, Bray, Bryant, Glover, &amp; Reiss, 2011; Haberecht et al., 2001). It consisted in remembering the position of the letter &quot;o&quot; that, in each trial, could appear in different positions, since a 9-part grid divides the screen. Number of correct or incorrect answers will be counted</description>

    <description>The executive function test was an adapted version of the inhibitory control task (Amodio et al., 2010; Cona, Arcara, Amodio, Schiff, &amp; Bisiacchi, 2013) . The stimulus were letters that appear in the centre of the screen. The task was formed by two main parts. In the first one the participant had to respond when the letter x or y appeared on the screen; in the second part the participant had to answer only when x preceded y and then vice versa. Number of correct or incorrect answers will be counted</description>

    <description>The mood test was the Italian Version of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21. It was a self report measure formed by 21 items that reliably measure depression (lack of incentive, dysphoria and low self-esteem) as well as anxiety (somatic and subjective symptoms), stress (irritability, impatience, tension and arousal) and general distress (related to anxiety and depression) (Bottesi et al., 2015). The responses are given on a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from zero if &quot;I strongly disagree&quot; to 3 if &quot;I totally agree&quot;.</description>

    <description>The KEMEPHY diet (Paoli et al., 2011) is a mediterranean calorie-controlled ketogenic protocol (about 900 Kcal/day) with the use of some phytoextracts. During this protocol subjects are allowed to eat with no limits green leafy vegetables, cruciferous, zucchini, cucumbers and eggplants. The quantity of meat, eggs and fish was limited to once a day (120g of meat or 200g of fish or 1 egg). Moreover, subjects daily consumed four food supplements and liquid herbal extracts. Food supplements are high proteins (19g/portion) and very low carbohydrate (3.5g/portion) formulas simulating the aspect and taste of common carbohydrate rich foods added with dry phytoextracts (Lodi et al., 2016).</description>

    <description>The KD is a protocol in which all foods containing carbohydrate are excluded, whereas meat, eggs, fish, ham, green leafy vegetables, cruciferous, zucchini, cucumbers and eggplants can be eat without any limit. This protocol allows the use of oil, lemon juice (2 tbs/day), spices and aromatic herbs with a limitation of the use of saturated fats like butter, margarine and lard. Coffee, tea and herbal tea could be sweetened with sweeteners</description>

    <description>The MD is a balanced calorie-controlled diet. The calorie intake was 1200 Kcal/day of which 15% were proteins, 60% carbohydrates and 25% fat. In this protocol was highlighted the use of the typical ingredients of the mediterranean tradition, such as extravirgin olive oil, vegetables, fruits, fish, lean meat and whole grain cereals.</description>
