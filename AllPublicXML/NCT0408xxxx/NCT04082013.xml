      PURPOSE: this study aimed to investigate the effect of opposite knee position on hamstring
      flexibility BACKGROUND Hamstrings tightness is one of the most common findings in patients
      with LBP. It is thought that, due to the attachments of hamstrings to the ischial tuberosity,
      hamstrings tightness generates posterior pelvic tilt and decreases lumbar lordosis, which can
      result in LBP.

      HYPOTHESES There will be significant difference in the hamstring flexibility with changing
      position of opposite knee (flexed or extended) in patients with mechanical low back pain.

      RESEARCH QUESTION: Will changing position of opposite knee (flexed or extended) affect the
      hamstring flexibility in patients with mechanical low back pain?

      -  The subject will be instructed to maintain 90° hip flexion in the supine position.

        -  Then asked to actively extend the knee joint.

        -  The degree of achieving active knee extension will be measured using a universal
           goniometer.

        -  The average of three active knee extension measurements will be recorded used as the
           hamstring muscle length for the data analysis (Dong-Kyu Lee, et al., 2018).

        -  This test will be done for the same limb with opposite leg extended and with opposite
           flexed.

    <description>The active knee extension test has been proposed as the gold standard for assessment of hamstring flexibility, as it utilizes readily available equipment and offers a quick, reliable, and low-cost alternative for measurement of hamstring flexibility (Connor et al; 2015).
The subject will be instructed to maintain 90° hip flexion in the supine position.
Then asked to actively extend the knee joint.
The degree of achieving active knee extension will be measured using a universal goniometer.
The average of three active knee extension measurements will be used as the hamstring muscle length for the data analysis (Dong-Kyu Lee, et al; 2018).
the procedures will be done with opposite-leg flexed, then repeated with opposite-leg extended.</description>
