  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, single-arm, open label, multicentre, phase II pilot study to evaluate the
      immediate and short term (one month) impact of a new long acting double bronchodilator on
      innovative parameters in stable and moderate to severe COPD patients.

        -  Variability and complexity of resting tidal breathing

        -  Oscillatory resistance and reactance of airways Tidal volume variability and complexity
           is decreased in airway obstruction and is expected to improve with a bronchodilator
           treatment, together with lung mechanics.

      The relationship with changes in dyspnea and conventional pulmonary function tests is the
      second aim of study.

      After baseline assessment of these parameters, clinical and lung function evaluation will be
      performed 2 hours post-drug (peak drug effects). Patients will continue treatment with PT003
      for 4 weeks. On Day 30, the same clinical and lung function assessments will be performed pre
      (trough) and 2h-post dose in order to obtain after-treatment measurements.

    <time_frame>Baseline, at 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The fundamental principle of forced oscillometry is that lung function can be assessed by measuring changes in pressure and flow in response to external pressure applied at the airway opening. Resistance is complex measure that incorporates the lack of changes in pressure and volume and the rate of these changes in response to pressure oscillations at a specific frequency.
All these measurements are expressed in the same unit (for resistance and reactance) and refer to oscillatory mechanics obtained by the same device. AX and resonant frequency are correlated to reactance.</description>

Reactance is complex measure that incorporates the changes in pressure and volume and the rate of these changes in response to pressure oscillations at a specific frequency at 5Hz was used. Reactance is thought to reflect the elastic properties of the lung.

    <measure>BDI/TDI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The BDI/TDI is an instrument developed to provide a multidimensional measure of dyspnea in relation to activities of daily living. The Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI) provides a measure of dyspnea at a single state, the baseline, and the Transitional Dyspnea Index (TDI) evaluates changes in dyspnea from the baseline state. The instrument consists of three components: functional impairment, magnitude of task, and magnitude of effort. For the BDI, each of these three components are rated in five grades from 0 (severe) to 4 (unimpaired), and are summed to form a baseline total score from 0 to 12. For the TDI, changes in dyspnea are rated for each component by seven grades from -3 (major deterioration) to +3 (major improvement), and are added to form a total TDI score from -9 to +9. Positive scores indicate an improvement, and a change from the BDI or a difference between treatments of 1 point has been estimated to constitute the minimum clinically important difference (MC</description>

    <measure>mMRC dyspnea scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale uses a simple grading system to assess a subject's level of dyspnea that consists of five statements about perceived breathlessness. It is an interviewer-administered ordinal scale on which subjects provide their dyspnea according to five grades of increasing severity (scores ranges from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe).</description>

    <measure>Modified Dyspnea Profile (MDP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The MDP consists of 11 items evaluating both the sensory and affective dimensions of dyspnoea. One item (A1) assesses the unpleasantness of dyspnoea on a 0-10 visual numerical scale anchored by &quot;neutral&quot; (0) and &quot;unbearable&quot; (10). Five items assess the sensory dimension of dyspnoea, both in terms of quality and intensity (on a scale of 0-10). Five items assess the affective dimension of dyspnoea, also in terms of quality and intensity (on a scale of 0-10).</description>
