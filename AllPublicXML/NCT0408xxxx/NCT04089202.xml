  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Flash glucose monitoring is an FDA-approved and widely clinically available, glucose
      monitoring technology that is worn on the body and measures glucose values every 15 minutes,
      storing this data for up to 14 days. The Freestyle Libre Pro is already used as a diagnostic
      technology in clinical care. It provides a full 24-hour glucose profile for each day that the
      sensor is worn and that can be correlated with daily activities, medication administration,
      food intake, and other factors that are contextually relevant in meeting glycemic goals for
      an individual patient.

      In this study, patients referred to Endocrinology for specialty diabetes care will be
      randomized to an in-person visit as is typically done or to wear the Freestyle Libre Pro
      placed by staff at their primary care clinic. Patients who wear the Freestyle Libre Pro will
      have a professional interpretation of their glucose data completed by an endocrinologist as
      well as a remote eConsult completed using this glucose data and information from their
      medical record. The recommendations from the eConsult regarding medication and lifestyle
      adjustment as well as potential referral on to see Endocrinology will be implemented by the
      primary care physician at their clinical discretion.

      The investigators will utilize glycemic measures including hemoglobin A1c, number of clinical
      visits (outpatient, inpatient and emergency department) for diabetes care, patient reported
      outcomes including self-efficacy, and patient and provider assessments of burden to determine
      if eConsults utilizing flash glucose monitoring technology are non-inferior to in-person
      visits with a diabetes specialist.

The five questions are from the original 20 item PAID survey (specifically questions 3, 6, 12, 16, and 19) and each has a 5-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;not a problem&quot; (score of 0) to &quot;serious problem&quot; (score of 4). The possible total scores of the PAID-5 ranges from 0 to 20, with higher scores implying greater emotional distress.</description>

    <description>In this arm, patients meeting eligibility criteria and consented into the study are randomized to have the Freestyle Libre Pro continuous glucose monitor (CGM) placed at their primary care clinic. The data collected from the diagnostic CGM will be utilized in conjunction with diet, exercise and medication logs provided by the patient and information from the patient's electronic medical record to complete an eConsult with treatment recommendations. Implementation of these recommendations will be per the primary care provider's discretion in conjunction with conversation with the patient in follow up visits.
Surveys will be administered to measure patient burden and self efficacy.</description>
