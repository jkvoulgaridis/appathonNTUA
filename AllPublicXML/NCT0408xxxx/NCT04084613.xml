  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective multi-centre, non-interventional observational study, that will be conducted in
      several centers in Greece for a 2-year time period (completion date December 2020), to
      describe patient characteristics, medical history, and the clinical benefit of mepolizumab in
      patients with severe eosinophilic asthma newly initiated to the drug.

    <measure>Reduction of annual exacerbation rate in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma in treatment with mepolizumab</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Reduction of the clinical significant exacerbations in comparison to the year before the initiation of treatment with mepolizumab. A clinical significant exacerbation is an exacerbation that requires treatment as follows: increase of dose of oral corticosteroids intake</description>

    <measure>Quality of life improvement in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma receiving mepolizumab as it measured by Asthma Control Test (ACT)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>ACT is a 5-point scale that assesses the frequency of shortness of breath and general asthma symptoms, use of rescue medications, the effect of asthma on daily functioning, and overall self-assessment of asthma control. An ACT score 19 or less means that asthma is not well controlled</description>
