  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of medical augmented reality glasses
      and general monitors when distinguishing mucosal lesions from submucosal lesions in
      endoscopic diagnosis for early gastric cancer.

    <time_frame>Image review will be conducted after full collection of both series of images. Review process will be done within 3 months after acquision of images. The time for study completion is aimed at 1 year from the start date.</time_frame>
    <description>All series of images will be reviewed by several endoscopists by evaluation of several endoscopic findings.
Then, concordance rate between the result from medical monitor and that from medical augmented reality glass will be assessed.
More specifically, % of patients that does not show the same results (m cancer, sm cancer, or indeterminate) between medical monitor and medical augmented reality will be assessed.</description>
