  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite significant advances in resuscitation efforts, there are some patients who remain in
      refractory ventricular fibrillation (VF) during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Double
      sequential external defibrillation (DSED) and vector change defibrillation have been proposed
      as viable options for patients in refractory VF. This cluster randomized trial will compare
      (1) continued resuscitation using standard defibrillation; (2) resuscitation involving DSED;
      or (3) resuscitation involving vector change defibrillation, in patients presenting with
      refractory VF during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The results of this study will provide
      high level evidence of the impact of both DSED and vector change defibrillation on ROSC and
      patient survival after OHCA.

    <textblock>
      Double sequential external defibrillation (DSED) and vector change defibrillation have been
      proposed as viable options for patients in refractory ventricular fibrillation (VF) during
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. However, currently there is insufficient evidence to support
      widespread implementation of this therapy. As such, a well-designed randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) employing a standardized approach to alternative defibrillation strategies early
      in the treatment of refractory VF is required to determine whether these treatments may
      impact clinical outcomes. This cluster randomized trial will be conducted in the regions of
      Peel, Halton, Simcoe, and the cities of London and Toronto, Ontario, Canada over a three year
      time period. All adult (≥ 18 years) patients presenting in refractory VF/pulseless
      ventricular tachycardia (pVT) (defined as patients presenting in VF/pVT and remaining in
      VF/pVT after three consecutive standard defibrillation attempts each separated by 2 minutes
      of CPR) during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac etiology will be assigned
      to be treated by one of three strategies: (1) continued resuscitation using standard
      defibrillation; (2) resuscitation involving DSED (two defibrillators, one using
      anterior-posterior pad placement and the second using anterior- anterior pad placement
      delivering two rapid sequential shocks for all subsequent defibrillation attempts); or (3)
      resuscitation involving vector change (change of defibrillation pads from anterior-anterior
      to an anterior-posterior pad position) defibrillation. All study arms will continue to
      receive antiarrhythmic use and epinephrine as per current provincial standards. The cluster
      units will be defined by emergency medical service (EMS) agency and each cluster will
      crossover at 6 month intervals throughout the duration of the study (n=6 crossover periods).
