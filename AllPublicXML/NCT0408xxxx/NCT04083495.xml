  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to determine the safety and tolerability of ATLCAR.CD30 for treating
      relapsed/refractory Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma. Blood samples will be collected from study
      participants and the immune T cells will be separated. T cells will be genetically modified
      in a laboratory at UNC-Chapel Hill to enable them to produce CD30 antibody. The modified T
      cells, called ATLCAR.CD30, will be able to target and attach to lymphoma cancer cells that
      carry the CD30 antigen. Once they are attached, the T cells will attack and destroy the
      lymphoma cancer cells. To prepare the body for the ATLCAR.CD30 cells, participants will
      complete lymphodepletion with two chemotherapy agents. Lymphodepletion will happen over three
      days prior to ATLCAR.CD30 infusion. If participants respond to this treatment, and there are
      sufficient unused ATLCAR.CD 30 cells, they may be eligible to receive a second infusion. The
      second infusion will be given after a second lymphodepletion chemotherapy. Most of the clinic
      visits in this research will last between 1-8 hours.

      Participants will be followed closely for 4 consecutive weeks after ATLCAR.CD30 infusion(s).
      Other follow-up visits will happen on Weeks 6 and 8, and continue every 3 months for the
      first year after infusion. Long-term follow up will continue annually for up to 15 years
      after the last ATLCAR.CD30 infusion.

      There are risks associated in participating in this research study. Risks of treatment
      include pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, and neurotoxicity. Other risks are associated with
      study procedures, such as biopsies, imaging, infusion, and breach of confidentiality.

      This multicenter, open-label phase 2 study will determine the efficacy and safety of
      autologous activated T lymphocytes (ATLs) expressing the chimeric antigen receptor specific
      for CD30 (ATLCAR.CD30) administered in two sequential infusions in subjects with
      relapsed/refractory CD30+ PTCL. Up to 20 subjects will receive 2 infusions of 2 × 108
      cells/m2 of ATL product expressing the CAR.CD30. Subjects will have cells procured to
      manufacture the ATLCAR.CD30 cells and during the time period required to manufacture the
      product the subjects will be able to receive standard of care bridging therapy to be
      determined by their primary local oncologist. Prior to receiving the first cell infusion,
      subjects will undergo lymphodepletion with fludarabine and bendamustine. Subjects will have
      their disease assessed at week 8 by either CT chest, abdomen and pelvis or PET/CT. Subjects
      who have stable disease (SD), partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) without
      subsequent progressive disease and meet the eligibility criteria for a second infusion, will
      receive lymphodepletion followed by a second infusion. The lymphodepletion for the second
      infusion will consist of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.

      OUTLINE

      Cell Procurement Up to 300 mL of peripheral blood (in 2 - 3 collections) will be obtained
      from subjects for cell procurement. In subjects with inadequate lymphocyte count in the
      peripheral blood, a leukopheresis may also be performed to isolate sufficient T cells. The
      parameters for pheresis will be up to 2 blood volumes.

      Bridging Chemotherapy Subjects will be allowed to receive additional standard of care therapy
      (e.g., chemotherapy or radiation therapy) to stabilize their disease if the treating
      physician feels it is in the subject's best interests.

      Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy Prior to the initial cellular product administration subjects
      will receive a lymphodepleting regimen of fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day administered IV over 30
      min followed by an IV dose over 1 hour of bendamustine 70 mg/m2/day administered over 3
      consecutive days. These agents will be administered per institutional guidelines. Prophylaxis
      (e.g., hydration, antiemetics, etc.) needed prior to fludarabine and bendamustine
      chemotherapy will be provided per institutional guidelines 2-14 days prior to the second cell
      product administration.. Prior to the second infusion, subjects will receive a
      lymphodepletion regimen of cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 IV and fludarabine 30 mg/m2 each as a
      daily infusion for 3 days per institutional guidelines 2-14 days prior to the second cell
      product administration. Subjects whose absolute neutrophil count and/or platelet count takes
      ≥3 months to recovery to levels required to meet eligilibity for lymphodepletion (ANC ≥ 1.0 ×
      109/L and platelet count ≥ 50 × 109/L) prior to the second infusion will receive a 25% dose
      reduction in cycolophosphamide and fludarabine lymphodepletion for the second round of
      lymphodepletion.

      ATLCAR.CD30 Cell Administration The cellular product consisting of ATLCAR.CD30 cells will be
      administered by a licensed healthcare provider (oncology nurse or physician) via intravenous
      injection over 5 - 10 minutes through either a peripheral or a central line. The volume of
      infusion will depend upon the concentration of the cells when frozen and the size of the
      subject. The expected volume will be 1 - 50 mL. Post lymphodepletion, subjects who meet
      eligibility criteria for cellular therapy will receive ATLCAR.CD30 cells within 2 - 14 days
      after completing the lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen. The recommended phase 2 dose
      (RP2D) determined in the phase 1 study of ATLCAR.CD30 will be administered to subjects (2 ×
      108 CAR-T/m2).

      If a subject only has enough ATLCAR.CD30 cells product for one infusion, they will still be
      able to receive one infusion of cells and will not have a 2nd lymphodepletion or infusion of
      cells. These subjects will be replaced for the purposes of efficacy determination.

               -  ALT ≤ 5 × ULN

               -  Creatinine ≤ 3 × ULN

               -  Pulse Oximetry of &gt;90% on room air

          4. Subject must have available autologous transduced activated T cells product that meets
             the Certificate of Analysis acceptance criteria.

          5. Negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to lymphodepleting therapy for
             female participants of childbearing potential. Note: Females are considered of
             childbearing potential unless they are surgically sterile (have undergone a
             hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are
             naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months.

          6. Subject does not have evidence of uncontrolled infection or sepsis.

          7. Subject is not receiving a prohibited medication at time of starting lymphodepletion
             up through 72 hours after the last dose of cyclophosphamide.

          8. Subject is a good candidate for CAR T cell therapy, per treating oncologist's
             discretion.

          9. Current use of systemic corticosteroids at doses ≥10 mg prednisone daily or its
             equivalent

        Eligibility Criteria Prior to Cell Product Administration #2

          1. Subject has no evidence of uncontrolled infection or sepsis.

          2. Negative serum pregnancy within 7 days of cell product administration (does not need
             to be repeated if pre-lymphodepletion pregnancy test is within window).

          3. Evidence of adequate organ function as defined by:

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 2 × ULN, unless attributed to Gilbert's syndrome

               -  AST ≤ 5 × ULN

               -  ALT ≤ 5 × ULN

               -  Creatinine ≤ 3 × ULN

               -  Pulse Oximetry of &gt;90% on room air

          4. Subject has no clinical indication of rapidly progressing disease in the opinion of
             the clinical investigator.

          5. Subject is a good candidate for treatment with ATLCAR.CD30 cell product per the
             clinical investigator's discretion.
