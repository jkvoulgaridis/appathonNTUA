  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuromuscular diseases (NMD) in children are severe, possibly life-threatening orphan
      conditions. The children are vulnerable and often subject to rapid deterioration of pulmonary
      function due to impaired ability to clear airway secretions. The use of mechanical cough
      augmentation with insufflation-exsufflation (MIE) is a strategy to treat and prevent.
      Possible major benefits are described, but optimal settings for best efficacy and comfort in
      children are not established. The project aim to improve the quality of the treatment with
      MIE in children with NMD and weak cough. On the basis of a bench study a clinical trial aims
      to examine the most effective MIE settings when used in stable state and when respiratory
      tract infections are present.

      On the basis of a prevalence study and a bench study different settings will be studied in
      children with NMD and weak cough to examine if settings derived from the lung model, are
      optimal to increase the peak cough flow (PCF) and comfort measured by visual analogue scale
      (VAS) in children with NMD and weak cough.
