    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of Vitamin D supplementation on ICU and hospital LOS in
      patients undergoing valve replacement surgery. Half of the patients will receive
      Alfacalcidol, while the other half-the control group- will be exposed to the same environment
      without receiving alfacalcidol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D insufficiency has been reported in more than 80% of critically ill patients,
      hospitalized in intensive care unit (ICU), including cardiac surgical patients. Moreover,
      25(OH)D levels continue to decrease from baseline throughout the hospital stay and resolves
      by 6 months. Vitamin D levels &lt; 20 ng/ml is associated with higher mortality, infection rates
      and prolonged length of ICU saty.

      The discovery of vitamin D receptors (VDR) expressed on cardiac muscle and vasculature,
      released a strong hypothesis suggesting that vitamin D regulates RAAS activity and cardiac
      remodeling.

      The beneficial effects of vitamin D on cardiovascular system, immune function and wound
      healing could be of particular interest in critical care, and patients undergoing valve
      replacement surgery will benefit the most.
