  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 DM is due to insulin resistance or low insulin secretion or sometimes a combination of
      both. Nanotechnology structured water is a type of water that is produced using energy field
      modulators to change the biological, chemical, and physical properties of water molecules and
      improve the bioavailability of this nano-water. Objective: To find out the effect of drinking
      nanotechnology structured water (Magnalife®) on the blood glucose levels in patients with
      type 2 diabetes mellitus.

    <textblock>
      This is a blind randomized control trial, according to CONSORT guidelines for randomization,
      &quot;Participants were randomly assigned following simple randomization procedures (computerized
      random numbers) to 1 of 2 treatment groups.&quot;, that included 387 patients with Type 2 diabetes
      mellitus in Diabetes Care Center, Sulaymaniyah, Kurdistan region from July 2016 till February
      2018. A total of 387 patients with type 2 diabetes who were patients in this center and
      agreed to participate in this clinical trial were included in this study.

      In group A, patients were given nanotechnology structured water Magnalife® and in group B
      they were given ordinary bottled drinking water as a control . The bottles were unlabeled so
      that the patients did not know which water they were drinking. Then they were asked to eat
      their usual food and to drink their usual drinks, also they could drink water ad libitum
      after drinking the daily doses, and to have the same physical activities that they used to do
      in their usual daily life. They were instructed to take their medications as usual, and were
      told to come to test their blood sugar level at the end of the third month to get the HbA1c
      tested at the end of the three months of drinking the water.
