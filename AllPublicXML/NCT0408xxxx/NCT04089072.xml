      A randomized, prospective study comparing ProvayBlue® to standard care with multiple
      sympathomimetic vasopressors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be an un-blinded, Phase 2, randomized, 1:1, prospective trial comparing
      patients in septic shock receiving norepinephrine and vasopressin followed by phenylephrine
      versus ProvayBlue® as the third-line vasopressor. The third line vasopressor will be compared
      at 1 hour to see if it affects the patient's mean arterial blood pressure (MAP).

    <time_frame>One hour and 24 hours after dose</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective is to determine if the administration of ProvayBlue® is non-inferior to the use of phenylephrine as a third-line vasopressor to keep a mean arterial pressure (MAP)&gt;65 mmhg after one hour and at 24 hours after the initiation of the drugs.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of acute kidney injury requiring dialysis</measure>
    <time_frame>through time of patient discharge, an average of 8 days after admission</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary objectives are to see if the total vasopressor dosing and renal replacement needs are different in those patients receiving ProvayBlue® rather than standard care with escalating number of vasopressors.</description>

    <description>Patients in the control group will have phenylephrine infusion starting at 50 mcg/min and titrated to maintain a MAP &gt;65 mmHg as a third line vasopressor. Maximum dose of Phenylephrine is 300 mcg/min.</description>

    <description>Patients enrolled in the intervention group will receive 2 mg/kg IBW (Ideal Body Weight) bolus, given over 15 mins, of ProvayBlue® followed by a concomitant infusion at 2 mg/kg/hr (IBW) mixed in D5W, which will continue for 24 hours. ProvayBlue® ( Methylene Blue) will be used as the third-line vasopressor.</description>

    <description>Prior to the initiation of the randomized treatment, the subject will have received 2 vasopressors ( norepinephrine and vasopressin), they will be initiated on IV hydrocortisone . Once the patient is unable to maintain a mean arterial pressure of &gt;65mmHg and the hydrocortisone has been administered there will be an addition of a third-line vasopressor.
Patients enrolled in the intervention group will receive ProvayBlue® and Patients enrolled in the control group will receive Phenylephrine infusion as a third line vasopressor in the treatment of septic shock.</description>
