  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty has been identified as one of the most effective surgeries for knee
      arthritis. Many patients experience moderate to severe pain during the early postoperative
      period, as the surgery involves extensive bone resection and postsurgical serum levels of
      cytokine interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein may be elevated.Furthermore, many patients
      suffer postoperative nausea and vomiting after total knee arthroplasty . The inflammatory
      response after TKA is pronounced and a result of cumulative effects of anaesthesia and
      mechanical stress . Inadequate management of postoperative pain is relevant with a series of
      undesirable effects, including progression to a persistent pain, delayed functional recovery,
      increased the economic burden and patient dissatisfaction. Steroids may be associated with
      decreased levels of interleukin-6 and C reactive protein and may, thus, relieve the pain
      associated with surgery. Dexamethasone is a long-acting glucocorticoid that has been reported
      to inhibit peripheral phospholipase A, which decreases the pain-aggravating agents from the
      cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways . In addition, it reduces postoperative nausea and
      vomiting by exerting a central antiemetic effect by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis and
      the release of endogenous opioids[5] . Some studies also reported potential adverse events,
      such as infection .
