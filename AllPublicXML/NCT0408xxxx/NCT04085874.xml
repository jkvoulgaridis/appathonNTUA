  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to assess effectiveness of promoting the optimized Food-based
      recommendations (FBRs) for improving dietary practices, nutrient intakes, nutritional status
      and lipid profile among Minangkabau women of reproductive age with dyslipidemia in a
      community setting. A cluster randomized community-based trial was conducted in Padang City,
      West Sumatra, Indonesia. Subjects are Minagabau women of reproductive age (20-44 y) with
      dyslipidemia. The subjects were assigned either into FBR group (n=48) that involved in
      12-weeks prolonged contact of FBRs promotion or into non-FBR group, that received once
      nutrition counselling from usual standard of nutrition program. Baseline and end-line lipid
      profiles, nutritional status, dietary practice and nutrient intake data were assessed through
      biochemical assessment, anthropometri, and interview structured questionaire.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted in two sequential phases. The first stage was a formative phase in
      the form of observational survey to develop and validate food-based recommendations (FBRs).
      The second phase was an intervention study to assess the effectiveness of the FBRs in
      improving dietary practice, the intake of problem nutrient, nutritional status and lipid
      profile of the subject.

      Sample size for intervention per group (n=60/group; 2 groups) was expected to detect
      mean(±SD) differences in LDL-cholesterol concentration (as an secondary outcome) of 14±20
      mg/dL as observed in a previous study in other area, with assumption of 80% power and 25%
      loss of follow up. Potential subjects were identified prior to dyslipidemia screening before
      intervention. Field nutritionist and volunteer cadres were requested to identify and list
      women of reproductive age fulfilling the inclusion criteria living in selected sites. An
      invitation letter was sent to all identified eligible subjects to visit appointed field
      laboratory to perform blood measurement. Inform consent was signed by all potential
      participants before blood measurement.

      This study did not compare an intervention group (FBR group) with a true control group, but
      with a comparison group that received once nutrition counselling from usual nutrition health
      program (non-FBR group). Drawing on concepts of Plan Behavior Theory, persuasive FBR
      promotion was designed to influence subjects' attitude, subjective norms, perceive behavior
      control related to dyslipidemia and dietary management, and intention to change. Participants
      were prompted to set goals for themselves to improve their dietary practices in order to
      fulfill their nutrient requirements, improve nutritional status and lipid profile.

    <description>Change in food consumption from baseline at 12-week intervention, evaluated based on participant's compliance to the Optimized Food-Based Recommendations. The compliance were measured using one-week Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), stated in servings/week for staple foods. snacks, animal protein (sea fish, eggs, poultry), soy protein (tofu/tempeh), potato, fruits,dark green vegetables (DGLV), total vegetables and fried foods. The recommendations (servings/week) for those food groups/items was 14-21, 7-14, minimum 5, 3-4, 2-3,minimum 7,minimum 5, minimum 7, minimum 5, minimum 14, and maximum 14 respectively. Those who complied with the recommendations was scored 1 for each recommendations, and 0 for those who did not. The total score for the compliance to the FBRs was 0-11. Higher score represents better participant's compliance</description>
