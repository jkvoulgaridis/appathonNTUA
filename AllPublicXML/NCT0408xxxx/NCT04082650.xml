    <textblock>
      This multicenter double-blinded placebo-controlled randomised trial aims to evaluate the
      effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation prior to IVF on the live birth rate in women with
      PCOS. We plan to enroll women with PCOS scheduled for IVF. Eligible participants will be
      randomised 1:1 to receive oral capsules of 4000IU vitamin D per day or placebo from day 2 of
      the menstrual cycle for 12 weeks until the day of HCG triggering.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the leading causes of female infertility,
      affecting around 5% of women with a child-bearing age in China. Vitamin D insufficiency is
      common in women with PCOS and is associated with lower live birth rates in these women.
      However, evidence regarding the effectiveness of vitamin D treatment in women with PCOS is
      inconclusive. This multicenter double-blinded placebo-controlled randomised trial aims to
      evaluate the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation prior to IVF on the live birth rate
      in women with PCOS.

      We plan to enroll women with PCOS scheduled for IVF. Eligible participants will be randomised
      1:1 to receive oral capsules of 4000IU vitamin D per day or placebo from day 2 of the
      menstrual cycle for 12 weeks until the day of HCG triggering. All IVF procedures will be
      carried out following a routine method in each center. Women will be followed up until six
      months after randomisation for those who fail to get pregnant after the completion of the
      first embryo transfer or delivery for those who get pregnant after the first embryo transfer.
      The primary outcome is live birth after the first embryo transfer. Primary analysis will be
      by intention-to-treat analysis. We plan to recruit 860 women to demonstrate women treated
      with vitamin D have a higher live birth rate than those treated with placebo (48% versus
      38%), accounting for 10% loss to follow-up with a significance level at 0.05 and a power of
      80%.
