  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study of a drug called crizotinib in people with metastatic (the cancer has
      spread to other parts of the body) non-small cell lung cancer with a mutation (change) in
      genes called ROS1 or MET. The purpose of this study is to look at how effective crizotinib is
      at treating ROS1 or MET mutated non-small cell lung cancer.

      Crizotinib, also called XALKORI, is a chemotherapy drug that is currently approved for the
      treatment of ALK- or ROS1- positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

      The study consists of a screening period, study drug period, end of study drug visit and
      follow-up period.

      During the screening period, participants will be asked to have tests and procedures done to
      make sure that they are eligible to continue in the study. Screening may take several visits.
      Participants found to be eligible to continue in the study, will then enter the study drug
      period where they will take the study drug and have tests and procedures done about once a
      week for safety and for research purposes.

      Participants who stop the study drug completely for any reason, will be asked to return to
      the clinic for an end of study drug visit about 28 days after their last dose of study drug
      to have tests and procedures done for safety and for research purposes. Participants that are
      experiencing any side effects during this time, will be closely followed by their study
      Doctor until the side effects have resolved or stabilized.

      Participants who discontinue study drug for any reason other than disease progression, will
      be asked to have radiological imaging every 8 weeks to follow up on the status of their
      disease, until disease progression or the start a new treatment for their cancer.

      After their final visit, the study nurse will call participants approximately every 3 months
      to check on the status of their health.
