  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This primary case series study will demonstrate the safety and feasibility of the NP-PWD
      technology and treatment protocol to promote healing of surgical incision healing. In a first
      use in humans of the NP-PWD's capability to deliver negative pressure wound treatment (NPWT),
      this project will gather data from patients with elective surgical incisions, with the
      intention to evaluate the NPWT capability for future use in more tenuous situations of wound
      closure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A case series study of 10 subjects will be conducted by enrolling patients who are scheduled
      for elective surgical incisions. Patients will be screened for inclusion criteria and asked
      to consent to participate in the study for single application treatment with the NP-PWD for
      3-6 days. Initial evaluation of the incision would occur on Day 0, including screening,
      pre-procedure evaluation, measurement and photography of the closed surgical incision. Follow
      up data is then gathered Day 3-6 with removal of the NP-PWD, surgical incision assessment and
      photography, and assessment for adverse effects. Day 9-14 follow up include the same
      assessments of progression of wound closure. Gathered clinical data of the 10 subjects will
      be used to evaluate the safety in using the NPWT device for effective wound healing.
