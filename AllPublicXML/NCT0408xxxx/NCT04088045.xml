    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knees is the most common degenerative disorder seen in a
      rehabilitation outpatient clinic. It is characterized by structural changes in the articular
      cartilage and the surrounding tissues. The understanding of its pathophysiology is still
      unclear. Knee OA patients are often troubled with knee pain and functional disturbance.
      Several studies have shown that the earlier the injection of autologous platelet rich plasma
      (PRP) to treat early stages of knee OA, the better the treatment outcome. However, there are
      controversies as to whether PRP injections can also be effective in treating patients with
      moderate to severe degrees of knee OA. Synovial fluid (SF) is in contact with the primary
      tissues affected by OA (cartilage and synovium). Identifying the SF biomarkers can provide us
      with crucial information in monitoring the PRP treatment response.

      PRP is blood plasma that is rich in autologous platelets. Platelet releases growth factors
      and cytokines that can stimulate the healing of soft tissue structures. However, the amount
      of platelets in human blood is not concentrated. Purification and centrifugation procedures
      are needed to concentrate these platelets. The human knee cartilage is contained inside the
      knee joint and has scarce blood supply. When the cartilage is injured, growth factors can
      hardly reach this area to repair the cartilage. Therefore, many studies have suggested early
      usage of PRP in treating knee OA. Some studies have stated that the effect of PRP in treating
      knee OA is superior to that of hyaluronic acid (HA). Recent studies have recommended the
      application of high frequency PRP injections (ex/ intra-articular (IA) PRP injections on a
      weekly basis) in treating patients with more severe degrees of knee OA. Prolotherapy using
      hyperosmolar dextrose solution has been shown to have some positive effectiveness in treating
      patients with knee OA. Higher percentage, such as &gt; 12.5% of dextrose water, may stimulate
      cartilage repair. Lower percentage, such as 5% dextrose water, has been documented to play an
      essential role in anti-inflammation, and pain reduction.

      Our previous study has documented that knee IA PRP injection combined with PRP injection to
      the pes anserine complex offered better treatment effectiveness as compared with IA PRP
      alone. In this two-year study, patients with moderate to severe degrees of knee OA will be
      recruited and divided into 3 groups. The high frequency PRP injection method will be applied
      (weekly PRP injections for a total of 3 weeks). Group 1 will receive knee IA PRP injections
      only. Group 2 will receive simultaneous knee IA PRP injections and PRP injections to the pes
      anserine complex. Group 3 will receive simultaneous knee IA PRP injections and PRP injections
      to the pes anserine complex, as well as to the genicular nerve blocks using 5% dextrose
      solution. We hypothesize that patients in group 3 will have better treatment outcomes. The
      effectiveness will be examined using proteomics, isokinetic measurements and functional scale
      evaluations. Upon the completion of this study, we will be able to gather adequate scientific
      evidences as to which injection approach and what PRP injection frequency is a better option
      in treating patients with moderate to severe degrees of knee OA.

    <description>This experiment compares the effect of injecting PRP alone into the knee joint and pes anserinus complex with when dextrose solution is also injected to the genicular nerves.
The injection of dextrose solution is to decrease the inflammation of the genicular nerves, hoping to further effectively alleviate the knee pain condition. Therefore, upon the conclusion of this study, we can see whether the inclusion of dextrose injection in addition to PRP treatment can really be effective in treating patients with more severe degrees of knee OA.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients suffered from chronic unilateral knee pain for more than 4 months and with
             roentgenogram degenerative findings of grades 3 and 4 on the Kellgren-Lawrence
             Classification of Osteoarthritis scale (meaning moderate to severe degrees of knee OA)
             will be recruited.

          2. The volume of the SF in the supra-patellar bursa region is enough (at least 2 mm
             thickness in bursa fluid as measured by ultrasound) to be aspirated via ultrasound
             guidance.

          3. Small volume of SF will be aspirated first and sent for SF analysis. SF showing
             evidences of crystals suggesting possible gouty arthritis and infection will not be
             included in this study.

          4. Patient has previously received oral NSAIDs and physical modality treatments but
             WITHOUT any obvious improvements in knee pain and function.

        The usage of musculoskeletal ultrasound to confirm that the supra-patellar bursa is in
        communication with the synovial cavity of the knee joint. This is to prevent the aspiration
        of isolated cystic lesion at the supra-patellar region.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Total obliteration of knee joint as shown on the roentgenogram images. Patient has
             systemic disorders such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, major axial deviation of
             the knee joint (varus &gt;5°, valgus &gt;5°), hematological diseases (coagulopathy), severe
             cardiovascular diseases, infections, and immune-depression.

          2. Patients in therapy with anticoagulants, and taking NSAIDs within the 5 days before
             blood harvest
