  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a significant lack of adequately powered randomized clinical trial (RCT) data to
      determine the comparative safety and effectiveness of sedative treatments in pediatric
      patients. In many centres the standard of care for sedation in pediatric critical care unit
      (PCCU) patients includes the use of benzodiazepines despite the known negative effects of
      increased patient agitation and delirium, which can contribute to longer PCCU and hospital
      length of stay (LOS). The use of an alternative sedative, dexmedetomidine may reduce negative
      effects in this population. As such, the investigators plan to conduct a well designed
      comparative RCT to determine the most effective and safest sedative in this vulnerable
      population utilizing clinical assessments of sedation levels and delirium instance,
      electroencephalography (EEG) analysis and patient important outcomes.
