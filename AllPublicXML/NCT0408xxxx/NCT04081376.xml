  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Hydromorphone (HM) is a semi-synthetic derivative of morphine used for pain control. Like
      other opiates, due to its high potential of abuse HM is included on the World Anti-Doping
      Agency (WADA) list of prohibited substances.

      Hypothesis:

      The oral administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride in healthy subjects allows generating
      detectable concentrations of the drug in urine. Positive urine samples will enable to
      identify analytical strategies for doping control.

      Objectives:

      Primary objective: To measure the concentrations of hydromorphone in urine for anti-doping
      control samples.

      Secondary objective: To identify metabolites and precursors of hydromorphone in urine. To
      assess safety and tolerability of the drug used.

      Methods:

      Phase I, open, non-randomized clinical trial, with a treatment condition (hydromorphone)
      administered orally to 2 subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to characterize the patterns of urinary excretion of HM following the oral
      administration of 4 mg of hydromorphone hydrochloride (equivalent to 3.56 mg of
      hydromorphone). The detection of HM consumption can be done by urine immunoassay but several
      immunoassay tests are required to thoroughly detect synthetic, semi-synthetic and natural
      opioids due to the limited cross-reactivity of each assay. Therefore, superior test
      strategies are required to specifically identify low concentrations of opioids.

          -  Smokers of more than 20 cigarettes a day in the 3 months before the study.

          -  Consumption of more than 20 g of alcohol daily in women and more than 40 g in men.
