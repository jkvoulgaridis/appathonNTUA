  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To achieve harmony between restoration and surrounding periodontium, soft tissue management
      plays a pivotal role. Various Gingival displacement techniques show varying results in
      achieving the goals of displacement. The most preferred method of dispalacement by dental
      practitioners is through conventional retraction cord made up of cotton, which besides its
      advantages, poses certain drawbacks, including low tear strength, high friction, and fiber
      remnants within the sulcus.

      Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) retraction cord, is a fluoropolymer, known for its high tear
      strength, low friction, and bio-compatibility.

      This study aims to determine the difference of horizontal gingival displacement between PTFE
      and conventional retraction cord.

      Participants inducted in this study will be assessed for eligibility. qualifying subjects
      will receive crown preparation for Porcelain-fused to-metal crown. subjects will then be
      randomly allocated to either of the two arms of intervention. After making a pre-displacement
      impression, Retraction cord will be applied for 3minutes, then removed to record
      post-displacement impression.

      the difference in pre and post-displacement mean gingival sulcus width will be assessed by a
      stereomicroscope using image analysis software.
