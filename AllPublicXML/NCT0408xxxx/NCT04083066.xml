    <textblock>
      This is an open, randomized, prospective, multicenter clinical study designed to compare the
      efficacy and safety of R-FPD and R-MAD as first-line regimens in the treatment of primary
      central nervous system lymphoma. A total of 20 patients plan to participate in the study. The
      primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) and
      secondary endpoints including overall survival (OS), and adverse events.
