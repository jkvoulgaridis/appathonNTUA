      This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of deoxycholic acid injections to dissolve
      adipose tissue in the anterior and posterior aspect of the axilla or the so called &quot;brassiere
      strap fat&quot; (BSF). Adult females aged 18-65 dissatisfied with their moderate or severe BSF
      will receive deoxycholic acid (dose strength: 2 mg/cm2) via subcutaneous injections into
      posterior and/or anterior axillary roll adiposity .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy and safety of deoxycholic acid injections to dissolve adipose tissue in the
      submental area have been extensively evaluated. Deoxycholic acid injections have also been
      used successfully off-label to dissolve adipose tissues in other body areas. Our clinical
      experience in addition to a few case reports have shown the effectiveness and safety of
      deoxycholic acid injections to dissolve the adipose tissue in the anterior and posterior
      aspect of the axilla or the so called &quot;brassiere strap fat&quot; (BSF).

      This is a single-center, prospective, single-arm, single-blind trial study.

      This study is expected to benefit the existing literature by potentially adding a new
      non-invasive injectable treatment to a condition of excessive adipose tissue in the anterior
      and posterior aspect of the axilla that until now could only be treated with invasive
      surgery.

    <description>Deoxycholic Acid Injections (dose strength: 2 mg/cm2) via subcutaneous injections into posterior and/or anterior axillary roll adiposity. Patients will receive 10 mL or less (≤100 mg) of study drug per treatment administered in 0.2-mL injections with a 30-gauge, 0.5-in needle attached to a 1-mL syringe at 1.0-cm spacing using a customized grid. Up to 6 treatments (30 ± 7 days apart) will be permitted, but fewer can be allowed because of efficacy (insufficient BSF to inject, patient satisfaction with treatment) or safety/tolerability concerns.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult female age 18-65

          -  Subject satisfaction rating score of 0 or 1

          -  Clinician reported BSF rating score of 2, 3 or 4

          -  Patient reported BSF rating score of 2, 3 or 4

          -  Able to follow study instructions and likely to complete all required visits, as
             assessed by the Investigator.

          -  Willing to withhold additional aesthetic therapies to the proposed treatment area.

          -  Negative urine pregnancy test

          -  Willing to use acceptable methods of contraception throughout the study

          -  Sign an IRB-approved Informed Consent Form prior to any study-related procedures being
             performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any intervention to treat BSF (eg, liposuction, surgery, lipolytic agents)

          -  History of trauma associated with the axillary or upper back area

          -  Severe Skin Laxity Grade or other anatomical feature as assessed within 28 d before
             randomization, for which reduction in BSF may, in the judgment of the investigator,
             result in an aesthetically unacceptable outcome

          -  Evidence of any cause of enlargement in the upper back/ axillary roll (eg, tumors,
             lipomas) other than localized BSF

          -  BMI greater than 35 kg/m2

          -  A result on coagulation tests (prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time) obtained
             within 28 d before randomization indicating the presence of any clinically significant
             bleeding disorder

          -  Any medical condition (eg, respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, neurologic disease,
             thyroid dysfunction) that would interfere with assessment of safety or efficacy or
             compromise the patient's ability to undergo study procedures or give informed consent

          -  History of sensitivity to any components of the study drug

          -  History of sensitivity to topical or local anesthetics (eg, lidocaine, benzocaine,
