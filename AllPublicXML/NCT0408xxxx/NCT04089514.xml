  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Candidate Predictors of Persistence on Adalimumab</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Candidate predictors (baseline clinical characteristics, disease score as applicable, incidence and clinical management of flares, and patient satisfaction survey) will be assessed via cox regression which will result in a hazard ratio.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants by Baseline Clinical Characteristic Categories</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline characteristics categories may include age, gender, diagnosis, duration of disease, relevant medical and surgical history, relevant co-morbidities, disease score, relevant concomitant therapies.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants by Utilization of Adalimumab Categories</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Adalimumab utilization categories may include type, dose, dose frequency and mode of administration, any changes, reason(s) for change and/or discontinuation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Disease Scores as Applicable by Indication</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Disease score as applicable by indication may include participant assessments of disease specific questionnaires (e.g. Disease Activity Score- 28 (DAS-28), Bath Ankylosing spondyloarthritis Functional Index (BASDAI), Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI), Partial Mayo Score, Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC))</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction with Biologic Administration</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction with biologic administration will be assessed via a patient satisfaction questionnaire.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Clinically Significant Laboratory Values and Clinical Evaluation Measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical significance will be assessed by the investigator.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants by Utilization of Relevant Concomitant Medication Categories</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Concomitant medication utilization categories may include type, dose, and any changes in use of relevant concomitant therapy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Anti-drug Antibodies</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be assessed for positive antibody results.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Causally-related Non-serious Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; in the view of the Investigator, places the participant at immediate risk of death (a life-threatening event); requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; any other medically important event that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.</description>
