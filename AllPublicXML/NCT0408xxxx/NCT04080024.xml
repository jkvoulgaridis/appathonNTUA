      This phase I, first-in-human (FIH) study is open-label, non-randomised and
      non-placebo-controlled. The study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single intravenous dose of SN132D in up to 20 patients with breast
      cancer. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be performed pre- and post-infusion of SN132D.

             participation in the study or influence the results or the patient's ability to
             participate in the study.

          9. Active infection requiring systemic treatment within one week prior to agent
             administration.

         10. History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may either put the patient at risk because of participation in the
             study, or influence the results or the patient's ability to participate in the study.

         11. Seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B surface antigen
             (HBsAg), or Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies.
