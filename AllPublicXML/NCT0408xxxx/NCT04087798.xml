  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a serious and growing public health problem. The purpose of
      this study is to find out if an educational worksheet, called the Encounter Decision
      Intervention (EDI), combined with health coaching helps CKD patients improve their blood
      pressure and other health outcomes. The research team hypothesizes that the intervention
      group will have greater improvement in CKD outcomes than the control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients that meet eligibility criteria and are seen in a clinic assigned to the control
      group will be given a Control-Encounter Decision Intervention (Control-EDI) about kidney
      disease in general (not tailored to the patient) by their primary care provider. Eligible
      patients that agree to participate and give consent will complete enrollment, 1, 6, and 12
      month follow-up visits.

      Eligible patients that are seen in a clinic assigned to the intervention group will be given
      a personalized Intervention-EDI by their primary care provider. Following this, eligible
      patients that agree to participate and give consent will complete the enrollment visit, and
      have a baseline call with a health coach. In addition to the 1, 6, 12 month follow-up visits
      these patients will also have approximately 4-6 phone calls with the health coach between the
      baseline visit and 11 months after enrollment.

      In both groups the study team will be collecting medical information and assessments
      regarding their health; blood sample and urine samples at baseline and 12 months;
      approximately 4-6 phone calls; as well as surveys at various time points.

      In order to reduce in-person human subject activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
      participants in both groups receive an at home blood pressure monitor so that systolic- &amp;
      diastolic-BP data can be collected at all 4 time points (baseline, 1, 6, 12 months).

    <description>Patients in the intervention group will receive a personalized Intervention-EDI from their primary care provider during visit, which will include their most recent BP, their urine protein level and most recent eGFR. There is also a space for their provider to type in a sentence about specific goals for the patient.
Health coaches will conduct a baseline call and 4-6 coaching calls, based on patient's needs, over an 11-month period. There are 4 topic areas related to blood pressure and CKD that will be the focus of the calls. Coaches will also have pre-determined and vetted educational resources to provide patients if needed. Additionally, patients will be called and reminded of their study visits at 1, 6, 12 months to complete study measures, BP checks, and give urine and blood samples (baseline and 12-month visit only).</description>
