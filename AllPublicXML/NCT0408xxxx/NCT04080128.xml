  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project intends to provide important, previously unmet answers regarding biological
      associations with myopia (nearsightedness) progression in order to improve the ability to
      predict patients who are most likely to benefit from myopia control, as well as questions
      frequently posed by patients and practitioners about the side effects, mechanism, and
      discontinuation of soft bifocal contact lens myopia control. The first three aims examine the
      association between biological variables that can be measured non-invasively and myopia
      progression, and they will be conducted regardless of the outcome of the currently in
      progress BLINK Study. The last three specific aims will be conducted if soft bifocal contact
      lenses slowed myopia progression by 30% or more in the BLINK Study, and they can be
      investigated with very few additional measurements.

      The primary goal of the BLINK2 Study is to determine correlates of myopia progression using
      non-invasive measurement of biomarkers, such as choroidal thickness and intrinsically
      photosensitive retinal ganglion cell-mediated pupil function, and outdoor light exposure in
      children. If multifocal contact lenses slow the progression of myopia by 30 percent or more
      compared to single vision contact lenses during the BLINK Study, the investigators will also
      answer important questions about the consequences and mechanism of the treatment effect, such
      as whether multifocal contact lens wear alters accommodative function and whether or not the
      treatment benefit is transient. Specifically, the investigators will investigate whether
      myopia progression is slowed or simply delayed by multifocal contact lens wear and whether
      there is a rebound in myopia progression, an increase in progression rate, after
      discontinuation of multifocal contact lenses. The investigators will identify myopic children
      who will most benefit from myopia control by determining those who are most likely to
      progress, thereby maximizing the potential for benefit and minimizing risk. The investigators
      will accomplish this goal by investigating the effect on progression of the most important
      ocular and environmental risk factors recently hypothesized to control eye growth. The
      project will collect the most extensive longitudinal dataset ever on choroidal thickness in
      childhood myopia. The investigators will test the important question of whether time outdoors
      and light exposure influence myopia progression after onset in addition to whether these
      affects are mediated by intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. If soft
      multifocal contact lenses show a clinically meaningful slowing of myopia progression, we will
      also answer important questions asked routinely by our clinical colleagues. The investigators
      will know the accommodative effect of multiple years of multifocal contact lens wear in
      children, the investigators will know if multifocal contact lenses slow or simply delay
      myopia progression, and the investigators will know whether myopia progression increases
      following discontinuation of soft multifocal contact lens wear. Answers to questions
      addressed by this proposal could improve care for 60 million myopic children in the United
      States. While the consequences of ordinary myopia are rarely sight-threatening, the quality
      of life for myopic patients is negatively affected and the health care costs to treat myopia
      are approximately 4.6 billion dollars in 1990 US dollars. The National Eye Institute
      recognizes the need to evaluate the efficacy of potential treatments for delaying the onset
      or for slowing the progression of myopia, such as lenses that alter peripheral defocus. The
      BLINK2 Study seeks to maximize benefit while lowering the risk of multifocal contact lens
      wear for myopia control while answering important scientific and clinical questions about the
      consequences and mechanism of myopia progression, a problem that affects many people in the
      United States.

    <description>In the event of an effect of multifocal contact lens on myopia progression, the investigators will test the hypothesis that long-term soft bifocal contact lens wear does not alter accommodative amplitude. This hypothesis predicts that at the baseline BLINK2 Study visit, the accommodative amplitude will be similar across the three treatment groups that were randomly assigned at the beginning of the BLINK Study; if they are not similar, they will become similar over the next two years.</description>

    <time_frame>Two years</time_frame>
    <description>In the event of an effect of multifocal contact lens on myopia progression, the investigators will test the hypothesis that soft bifocal contact lenses slow rather than merely delay myopia progression. This hypothesis predicts that during the first two years of the BLINK2 Study, when all subjects will wear soft bifocal contact lenses, subjects will progress at the same rate regardless of original lens assignment in the BLINK Study. Alternatively, faster myopia progression in subjects originally fitted with soft bifocal contact lenses compared to single vision contact lenses would indicate a delay in myopia progression rather than a permanent treatment benefit.</description>

    <description>In the event of an effect of multifocal contact lens on myopia progression, the investigators will test the hypothesis that there is no increase in myopia when switching from bifocal to single vision contact lenses. This hypothesis predicts that the progression of myopia during the last year of follow-up when all subjects will switch to single vision contact lenses, will be similar to myopia progression during the first two years when all subjects wore bifocal contact lenses. Alternatively, faster progression after switching to single vision contact lens wear indicates a &quot;rebound&quot; of myopia progression.</description>
