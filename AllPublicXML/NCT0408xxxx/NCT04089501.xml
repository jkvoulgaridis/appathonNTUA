  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to better understand the mechanisms responsible for the development
      of and the severity of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), such as Crohn's Disease and
      Ulcerative Colitis, which cause inflammation of the gut as well as potentially affecting
      other areas of the body

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on promising preliminary data, the study will characterize the claim that PXR signaling
      serves as a key mechanistic link between the host environment and the innate immune system in
      the gut. It is widely believed that one cause of IBD stems from abnormal sensing of commensal
      bacteria. The research will shed light on the molecular mechanisms used by gut barrier
      epithelial cells in sensing commensals and regulating inflammatory responses in the gut. This
      will provide a new mechanism towards which more mechanisms derived probiotics could be used
      to abrogate intestinal inflammation. It is hoped that these agents would eventually serve as
      non-toxic alternatives or adjuncts to currently available therapeutics for IBD. The research
      protocol will involve the collection of feces, either by self-collection or through
      colonoscopic washing.

    <description>Subjects will be asked to provide a stool sample (if no colonoscopy is to be performed) or if clinically indicated, a colonoscopy will be performed per standard medical routine. During colonoscopy, stool will be collected for analysis and 3 additional biopsies will be taken each from the ileum and colon for research purposes. Alternatively, subjects who are undergoing intestinal and/or colonic resection will provide stool prior to surgery and a portion of their pathology specimens will be used for research purposes following complete pathologic evaluation.</description>

        Subjects belonging to the target population, (i.e., Diagnosed with IBD, specifically
        Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or indeterminate colitis and patients with no
        diagnosis of IBD in whom small intestinal, colonic, or ileocolonic resection is
        recommended.
