  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Being a family caregiver for a patient at the end of life is both rewarding and stressful.
      When the end of life is nearing, caregivers may be unsure of how to help their family member.
      Reiki, a light touch energy therapy has been shown to increase relaxation and improve sleep
      quality, and decrease pain, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and medication use in both
      hospitalized and community-dwelling adults. This feasibility study is designed to evaluate
      whether teaching caregivers is feasible in addition to evaluating any benefit to FCGs and
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The time a patient and family caregiver (FCG) spend together in a patient's final days is
      filled with emotion. Patients may turn inward and be filled with peace, or they may be
      bothered by symptoms. Caregivers often experience feelings of helplessness and anticipatory
      grief. Learning and providing a skill such as Reiki may give caregivers a way to help the
      patient with symptoms while at the same time feeling useful. Patient and caregiver closeness
      may be enhanced. Reiki has been shown to be helpful with symptoms such as pain, anxiety,
      depression, fatigue, and others. However, teaching caregivers of terminal hospice patients,
      Reiki has not been studied. The knowledge gained from this feasibility study will guide
      future interventions aimed at the comfort of hospice patients and FCGs.

      Approximately 1.49 million Medicare beneficiaries received hospice care during 2017, and most
      had a FCG. During the final days or weeks, FCGs are unsure of what do or how to best help the
      patient when everyday caregiving actives such as physical care or nutrition are not required
      or no longer desired by the patient. Caregiver symptoms of depression, anxiety, or
      anticipatory grief increase toward the end of life along with increased patient symptoms.
      Having a specific skill to help the patient with symptoms or simply to show care and provide
      touch may empower FCGs and improve the quality of life for both caregivers and patients.

    <description>Explore family caregiver feelings related to Reiki by having caregivers complete the System Usability Scale (modified) at the end of the 10 day intervention period. The System Usability Scale is a 13 item survey that measures whether respondents thought that learning Reiki went well, was understandable, and if they were confident using Reiki. Each item is answered by circling an answer on a Likert scale from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree.&quot;</description>

    <description>Reiki Master will perform the teaching and attunement process for Level 1 Reiki and teach the caregiver(s) how to complete a simple 10-minute Reiki session with the patient and a 10-minute self-Reiki session for the caregiver(s). The Reiki Master will explain that Reiki sessions can be given whenever the patient and caregiver feel it is appropriate, but sessions should be at minimum twice per 24-hour period for at least 10 minutes with at least two hours between sessions. Reiki sessions may be more frequent than twice per day and/or longer than 10 minutes. Self-Reiki sessions should be performed daily for at least 10 minutes but maybe more frequent and/or longer in length. Each family caregiver will receive a copy of the book. The patient and caregiver will wear a Holter monitor continuously for 48 hours beginning when the caregiver(s) are trained in Reiki to measure HRV, a valid measure for stress.</description>

    <description>Patients and caregivers will complete all measures expected of the intervention cohort including daily symptom checklist for 10 days. The patient and caregiver will wear a Holter monitor for the first 48 hours of study participation to measure heart rate variability (HRV), a valid measure for stress. The patient and/or caregiver may opt out of the Holter monitor if requested and still participate in the rest of the study.</description>

    <description>Reiki is a complementary health approach where trained providers place their hands lightly on or just above a person, in discrete positions, with the goal of facilitating the person's own healing response. A Reiki practitioner will perform the initial teaching and instruct the caregivers how to perform a simple 10-minute Reiki and self-Reiki session.</description>
