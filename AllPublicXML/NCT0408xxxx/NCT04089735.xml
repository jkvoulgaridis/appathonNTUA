  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a, 2-part study (designated Parts A and B) that will evaluate APP13007 dose
      strength and dosing frequency in a randomized double-masked fashion for comparison to the
      respective matching vehicle placebo. Part A will be conducted first to evaluate 0.05%
      APP13007 and matching vehicle placebo in an approximate 1:1 ratio in approximately 42
      subjects who experience postoperative inflammation on the first day following routine,
      uncomplicated, cataract surgery and who meet all eligibility criteria. Based on the results
      of Part A, Part B of the study may be open for enrollment to evaluate 0.05% and/or 0.1%
      APP13007 at various dosing frequency in approximately 84 subjects, also in an approximate 1:1
      ratio, active vs. placebo. In each Part, subjects will return periodically for study
      assessments during the treatment period and then for a follow-up visit approximately 1 week
      after stopping the study drug.

    <description>The degree of turbidity (flare) in the anterior chamber of the eye is measured using slit-lamp biomicroscopy and quantified on a five-point (0-4) anterior chamber flare grade scale (0 = none; 4 = Intense). The change from baseline is calculated by subtracting the pretreatment measurement value from the value at each visit.</description>

    <time_frame>Post-operative Day 28 (Part A) or Day 22 (Part B)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects who do not respond to study treatment after randomization (anterior chamber cell count &gt; 30 cells or an increase in anterior chamber cell count by &gt; 15 cells from pre-dose baseline or ≥ 2 grade of increase in anterior chamber flare from pre-dose baseline) are started on anti-inflammatory medication (referred to as 'Rescue' medication). The number of subjects starting 'Rescue' medication are recorded at each study visit.</description>
