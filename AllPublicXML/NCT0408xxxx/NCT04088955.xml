  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DigiMeds™ are medications with FDA-approved ingestible sensors (IS), a wearable sensor patch
      (patch), and a mobile app, which records time-stamped medication type and dose alongside
      biometric activity.

      The aim of this registry is to collect and analyze data on the use of DigiMeds™ and a digital
      feedback system on medication adherence, patient-provider communication, and data-driven
      optimization of therapy for cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be prescribed the DMP and DigiMeds™ (capecitabine or supportive medications) by
      their healthcare provider. The pharmacy will co-encapsulate the prescribed medication with a
      sensor.

      The actual doses of DigiMeds™ will be based on standard of care as prescribed by treating
      physician. Patients will be instructed in the use of the DigiMeds™ and the DMP based on
      standard of care plus use of the DMP system.

      Every effort should be made to take the DigiMeds™ as prescribed.

      Patients in this study will be given the option to use their personal smartphone or will be
      provided a provisioned iPad to use for the duration of the study. Each patient will receive a
      Starter Kit comprised of two wearable sensor pods, adhesive strips, and instructions.
      Additionally, some kits may contain the provisional iPad Mini and charger for those without
      an approved smart device. Should a device malfunction occur, such as a broken pod, the
      patient can replace it with their spare pod. Broken pods should be returned to Proteus as
      soon as possible and all pods must be returned to the clinic upon completion of the study.
