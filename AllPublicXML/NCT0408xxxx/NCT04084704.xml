  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip is one of the ten most disabling diseases in the developed
      world. Because OA gradually worsens over time, the sooner treatment is started, the more
      likely its impact is lessened. Hip OA is characterized by joint pain, cartilage degeneration,
      and an increase in disability. Multiple treatments are used to manage the degenerating hip as
      well as the associated pain. These include physiotherapy and rehabilitation, bracing, other
      walking aids, oral medications, injections, and in severe cases, surgery. Prior research has
      shown that injection of hyaluronic acid (HA) and corticosteroids can slow down OA
      degradation. This study will look at the effects of injecting Cingal into the hip, which
      expands on its current approved use in the treatment of knee OA.

    <description>The primary objective of this observational study is to determine, among individuals with hip OA ages 40-65 years, the effect of Cingal on patient-reported hip pain, as measured by a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), at 6-months post-injection.</description>

    <description>The HOS is a 26 item questionnaire assessing activities of daily living that are scored on a 5 point Likert scale. Scores range from 0% (least function) to 100% (most function)</description>
