  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An abnormally formed hip joint (cam deformity) is a major cause of osteoarthritis (OA).
      Individuals may not experience any symptoms until OA is severe due to extensive cartilage
      loss and changes in underlying bone. A series of studies showed that the cam deformity can
      lead to the development of OA if left untreated, thus strongly suggesting a causal
      relationship. Currently, the cam deformity that causes pain is surgically removed to relieve
      the pain and treat the associated cartilage damage. Recent studies have demonstrated that
      surgical treatment leads to bone and cartilage changes that were related to improved function
      and reduced pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will allow the investigators to gain a better understanding of the relationship
      between cartilage and bone changes. The investigators will examine adult participants in the
      disease state that require surgical correction and compare to age-matched controls. The
      investigators will look at the impact of surgical intervention through joint-specific
      biomarkers of OA, specifically the PET-MRI and blood biomarkers, which will allow them to
      simultaneously query cartilage and bone activity. The investigators propose that the use of
      PET-MRI will give more sensitive and hip-specific information about the joint health compared
      to the blood biomarkers in patients with symptomatic cam morphology. Participants will
      undergo motion analysis and 3D modeling to help the investigators better understand the
      disease process during the performance of specific activities and define joint contact
      mechanics as they relate to the PET-MRI imaging, validating a biomarker for early joint
      degeneration. This diagnostic tool will be extremely useful for younger individuals with a
      cam deformity who have not yet developed symptoms. In the future the investigators could use
      this to detect early degeneration in adolescents to prevent and mitigate development of OA
      later on. This will also help the investigators develop activity guidelines for people with
      smaller cam deformities in order to avoid surgery and prevent degeneration.

    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The International Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-33 is a questionnaire that evaluates young active patients with early hip disease. The questionnaire is self-administered and assesses across 4 domains: symptoms and functional limitations; sport and recreational activities; job-related concerns; and social, emotional, and lifestyle concerns. Questions are answered by marking a visual analog scale between 2 anchor statements (100-mm scale). The total score is calculated as a simple mean of these responses ranging from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the best possible quality-of-life score.</description>
