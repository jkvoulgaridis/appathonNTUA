      RGTA® (ReGeneraTing Agent) are synthetic polysaccharides mimicking extra-cellular matrix
      scaffold elements and protective agents called Heparan Sulphates (HSPGs).

      OTR4132-MD is provided as a sterile injectable medical device. OTR4132-MD is indicated in
      anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients re-vascularized (TICI score 2b - 3)
      by combined thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy within 6 hours of symptoms onset.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The promising results of OTR4132-MD in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke in animal
      studies and the excellent results of biocompatibility tests reported in the Investigator's
      Brochure allowed to design a clinical investigation in humans named MATRISS. As this is a
      First-In-Man (FIM) study assessing OTR4132-MD, it is designed as a single ascending dose
      (SAD) to evaluate the safety, tolerability of a single intra-arterial injection of OTR4132-MD
      in AIS patients treated with combined thrombolysis and thrombectomy.

      The FIM will include up to 18 patients in up to five dose groups. Each group will comprise 3
      subjects. This FIM study will also monitor a dose response relationship in humans: lesion
      volume change throughout the study period. Patients will be given a single intra-arterial
      injection of OTR4132-MD with a predefined dose of OTR4132. In the first dose group, the
      OTR4132 dose is 0.20 mg.

      The results of this study will serve as a groundwork for the design of a pivotal study in the
      intended patient population.

    <description>According to Regulation (EU) 2017/745(MDR), OTR4132-MD is an implantable medical device, for short term use which is specifically intended for use in direct contact with systemic circulation system.
OTR4132-MD is by definition intended to come into contact with the patient when being injected. It is administered through intra-arterial injection, in an one-shot dose and the majority of the product is eliminated within 24 hours.</description>
