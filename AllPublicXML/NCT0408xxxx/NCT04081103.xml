  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll participants with a non-infected, corneal persistent epithelial defect
      (PED) resulting from an ocular chemical and/or thermal ocular injury which is non-responsive
      or refractory to current standard of care for at least 14 days. It will assess the efficacy
      and safety of NEXAGON plus standard of care versus NEXAGON-vehicle (placebo) plus standard of
      care. The recovery of the corneal epithelium will be the primary outcome measure, defined as
      a cornea that re-epithelializes by Day 28 of treatment and remains re-epithelialized for at
      least a further 28 days.

             injury.

          4. The PED measures at least 2 mm along the largest diameter at Day 1 of the Treatment
             Period.

          5. Providing written informed consent and ability to comply with the visit and dosing
             schedule.

          2. Have active ocular infection.

          3. Subjects with corneal perforation or impending corneal perforation.

             prednisone) or immunosuppressive or chemotherapeutic agents unless the dose has

          5. Subjects with severe lid abnormalities or ocular conditions that contribute to the
             persistence of the epithelial defect.

          6. Female subjects of childbearing potential who are pregnant, nursing, planning a
