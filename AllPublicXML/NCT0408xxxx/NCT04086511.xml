  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare inherited metabolic disorder, where subjects are born with a
      genetic deficiency in the phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme (PAH), which leaves them unable to
      convert Phenylalanine (Phe) into Tyrosine (Tyr). PKU patients have specific dietary needs and
      must follow a restrictive diet in the aim of preventing toxic levels of the amino acid
      phenylalanine (Phe) accumulation.

      The exploratory study's main objective is to measure blood amino acid levels and to gain
      quantitative insights in children with PKU on a protein substitute with respect to evaluation
      of nutritional intake.
