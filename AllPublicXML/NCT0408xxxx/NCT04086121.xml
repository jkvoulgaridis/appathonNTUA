        Inclusion Criteria:

             treatment prior to week 16, and; In the 1368-0032 re-allocation period (V7 to V11):

               -  If an original non-responder from week 16 (V7), attained at least EASI 50 by last
                  infusion (week 28) or by the EOS.

               -  If an original responder from week 16 (V7) completed the last visit Week 28 (EOS)
                  or dropped to a EASI 50 score prior to Week 28.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP)1 must be ready and able to use highly
             effective methods of birth control per ICH M3 (R2) that result in a low failure rate
             of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly for the duration of the
             trial and 16 weeks after last study drug administration. A list of contraception
             methods meeting these criteria is provided in the patient information.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are pregnant, nursing, or who plan to become pregnant while in the trial.

          -  Any new documented active or suspected malignancy except appropriately treated basal

             cervix.

          -  Use of any restricted medication: or any drug considered likely to interfere with the
             safe conduct of the study, as assessed by the investigator.

          -  Active systemic infections during the last two weeks prior to first drug
             administration.

          -  Currently enrolled in another investigational device or drug trial, except for

             1368-0037

          -  Evidence of a current or previous disease, medical condition (including chronic

             laboratory value at the screening outside the reference range that in the opinion of
             the investigator is clinically significant and would make the study participant
             unreliable to adhere to the protocol, comply with all study visits/procedures or to
             complete the trial, compromise the safety of the patient or compromise the quality of
