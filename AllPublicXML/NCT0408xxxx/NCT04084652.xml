  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary protein is vital for the preservation of health and optimal adaptation to training.
      However, traditional animal proteins come with a number of economic, environmental, and
      ethical issues. Accordingly, there is a need to develop an understanding of the utility of
      more sustainable non-animal derived dietary proteins to support our nutrition. Mycoprotein,
      produced by Quorn Foodsâ„¢, has recently been shown to stimulate a greater anabolic response
      within skeletal muscle compared with milk protein, suggesting its utility within sports
      nutrition. However, it is unclear what accounted for the greater anabolic response of
      mycoprotein. One explanation could be the non-protein nutrients contained within mycoprotein
      (e.g. fibre, carbohydrate, fat or micronutrients).

      Therefore, the present study will compare the muscle anabolic response between mycoprotein
      (MYC) as a whole food and the protein isolated from mycoprotein (PIM).
