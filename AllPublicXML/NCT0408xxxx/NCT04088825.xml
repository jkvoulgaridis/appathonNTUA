  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nutrition Department of University Hospital La Paz decided to implement some method of
      screening in our centre which allowed us to detect as many patients with malnutrition risk as
      possible. Due to the large size of our centre, with about 1,500 beds and the few human
      resources in our unit, we chose to use the CONUT system (Nutritional Control), a 100%
      automatic method based on analytical parameters, very easy to use, low cost and whose
      validity is confirmed, characteristics that fulfilled our needs. The implementation of this
      nutritional screening method has led to a change in the ìnutritionafi culture of our centre
      respect to DRM in most of our professionals: doctors and nurses and even in the management
      team, so all of them understand the importance of the process and know about the available
      tools and knowledge to indicate an adequate and early nutritional support.

    <description>The method collects information from databases of Admission Service (affiliation, age, date) and Laboratory (albumin, cholesterol, total lymphocytes) and generates, in the report of analytical results, &quot;alert&quot; information about each patient's nutritional risk and also nutritional recommendations based on the risk identified. Prior to its implantation several evaluations were performed in order to allow us to better know the extra workload, as it was the main factor that could limit our ability to assume that screening method and also many training activities for doctors and hospital health professionals who were increasingly assuming responsibilities in the nutritional treatment of their patients.</description>

    <description>CONUT has been working from june of 2010 and it has detected risk of malnutrition in 32% of the evaluated patients. The method collects information from databases of Admission Service (affiliation, age, date) and Laboratory (albumin, cholesterol, total lymphocytes) and generates, in the report of analytical results, &quot;alert&quot; information about each patient's nutritional risk and also nutritional recommendations based on the risk identified.</description>
