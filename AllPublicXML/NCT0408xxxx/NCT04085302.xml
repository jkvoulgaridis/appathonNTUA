  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TARA is a Digital Behaviour Change Intervention (DBCI) for individuals with Chronic
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)(IwCOPD), which has been designed using a Human-Centred
      Design (HCD) methodology. HCD involves, among other elements, members of the target audience
      in evaluations at multiple stages within the design process.

      This feasibility study is primarily designed to assess the acceptability of the DBCI test
      asset to the target audience. Acceptability as defined for the purpose of this study includes
      usability of the system, and perceived value and desirability to the end-user audience. As
      such, engagement in this context is deemed to mean the degree to which the test asset
      provides a usable, acceptable, desirable and valuable experience to its users during a
      time-limited trial.
