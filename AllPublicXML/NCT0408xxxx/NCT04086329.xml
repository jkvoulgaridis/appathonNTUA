  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Past mitochondrial disease treatment studies have been unsuccessful in determining treatment
      efficacy, and a major factor has been the lack of validated biomarkers in mitochondrial
      myopathy (MM). There is currently a growing number of potential new treatments to be tested
      through MM clinical intervention trials, which has created a pressing need for quantitative
      biomarkers that reliably reflect MM disease severity, progression, and therapeutic response.

      The purpose of the study is to measure the efficacy of an electrochemical oxygen nanosensor
      to measure in vivo mitochondrial function in human muscle tissue, and its ability to
      discriminate MM patients from healthy volunteers. The data and results from this nanosensor
      study may contribute to current and future research, including improved diagnostic and
      therapeutic approaches for patients with mitochondrial disease.

    <textblock>
      This is an investigational device clinical trial. MM cases and healthy volunteers will
      undergo nanosensor muscle oxygen measurement in exercised (dominant) forearm muscle during
      handgrip exercise. The same measurements will be repeated between 7 and 30 days later in the
      same forearm and at the same time of day for each participant to assess reproducibility.

      After placement of the nanosensor in the forearm under local anesthesia, the primary outcome
      measure is nanosensor-muscle oxygen levels. The secondary outcome measure is an assessment of
      pain.

    <description>The purpose of the study is to test a device called a &quot;nanosensor&quot;, which measures oxygen levels (a proxy of mitochondrial function) in muscle. The nanosensor has not been tested in humans nor has it been approved by the FDA.
The study nanosensor measures 1.8 mm width x 6 mm length x 0.3 mm depth. Placement of the sterilized nanosensor involves a small incision for manual placement of the nanosensor in muscle forearm tissue.</description>
