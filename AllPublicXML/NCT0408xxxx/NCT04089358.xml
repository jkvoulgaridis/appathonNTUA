      This phase III trial compares a mobile health and social media physical activity intervention
      versus wearing a physical activity tracker among adolescent and young adult childhood cancer
      survivors. Regular physical activity helps maintain healthy weight, energy levels, and
      health. Adolescents and young adults who complete treatment for cancer are often less active.
      They may gain weight and have more health problems compared to people the same age who have
      not had treatment for cancer. Comparing the 2 programs will help researchers learn how to
      increase physical activity levels over time and also how changes in physical activity levels
      affect health and quality of life over time.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the effects of a multi-component physical activity intervention including a
      Fitbit, individualized goal setting, and a social media peer support group compared to the
      control condition (Fitbit only) on physical activity among adolescent and young adult
      survivors of childhood cancer (AYA survivors) who do not meet physical activity guidelines.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effects of a multi-component physical activity intervention including a
      Fitbit, individualized goal setting, and a social media peer support group compared to the
      control condition (Fitbit only) on biomarkers predictive of cardiometabolic health among
      adolescent and young adult survivors of childhood cancer (AYA survivors) who do not meet
      physical activity guidelines.

      II. To evaluate the effects of a multi-component physical activity intervention including a
      Fitbit, individualized goal setting, and a social media peer support group compared to the
      control condition (Fitbit only) on health-related quality of life among adolescent and young
      adult survivors of childhood cancer (AYA survivors) who do not meet physical activity
      guidelines.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      INTERVENTION GROUP: Participants receive educational materials about physical activity.

      INTENSIVE PHASE (24 WEEKS): Participants wear a physical activity tracker (Fitbit) daily as
      well as receiving weekly reminders from study staff to wear it. They also receive goal
      setting sessions each week by text or phone call to set personalized step count goals using
      the Fitbit application (app). Lastly, participants receive an invitation to follow and post
      on an online social media peer support group on (Instagram), where encouraging advice and
      messages about physical activity are provided 2-3 times per week, announce badges/awards
      every week, and moderate a forum to discuss physical activity and use of the Fitbit.

      MAINTENANCE PHASE (24 WEEKS): Participants wear a Fitbit daily but do not receive reminders
      to wear it. They also set their own step count goals weekly and check in with study staff
      monthly for assistance with goal setting. Participants take the lead posting content on the
      Instagram account moderated by the study staff. Study staff only post once per week with
      general physical activity-related questions and provide no badges.

      CONTROL GROUP: Participants receive educational materials about physical activity and wear a
      Fitbit daily for 48 weeks.

    <measure>Cardiopulmonary fitness</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiopulmonary fitness is an objective biomarker of exercise capacity and will be assessed by the physiological cost index (PCI) from the six-minute walk test. During the six-minute walk test, participants are asked to walk as quickly as possible for six minutes on a level surface. This test requires a stopwatch, a long, flat, unobstructed corridor, a measurement wheel, a heart rate monitor, and a lap counter. Stopping, starting, and resting during the test are allowed as needed. Distance (meters) and heart rate (beats; measured continuously) are monitored, and PCI is calculated in beats per meter: (average heart rate while walking - heart rate at rest)/meters walked per minute.</description>

    <measure>Blood pressure: systolic</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Systolic blood pressure will be taken with an appropriately-sized cuff after the patient has been sitting upright with both feet on the floor for five minutes. The right arm will be supported at the level of the heart. At least two readings, two to three minutes apart, will be taken and averaged to ensure accuracy.</description>

    <measure>Body mass index (BMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be measured for height and weight without shoes and wearing light clothes using a stadiometer and digital scales to the nearest 1cm and 0.1kg, respectively.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health-related quality of life (HRQOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>HRQOL will be measured with the Pediatric Quality of Life inventory (PedsQL) 4.0 Generic Core Scales (global functioning, physical functioning, and social functioning scales, specifically) and the 18-item PedsQL 4.0 Multidimensional Fatigue Scale, which encompasses three subscales: (1) general fatigue (6 items), (2) sleep/rest fatigue (6 items), and (3) cognitive fatigue (6 items).115-118 Questions refer to how much of a problem each item was during the past month. Items are reverse-scored and transformed to a scale from 0-100, in which higher scores indicate better HRQOL.</description>
