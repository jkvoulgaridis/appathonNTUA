    <textblock>
      This is a prospective phase II, open label, single arm, multi-centre study to evaluate
      activity of an innovative sequence on capecitabine plus concomitant radiation therapy
      followed by durvalumab in patients with operable rectal cancer. The enrollment period will be
      of 12 months. Eligible patients will be initiated to a standard concomitant chemoradiation
      therapy for 5 weeks. One week after the end of CT/RT patients will be treated with durvalumab
      for 3 administrations. Patient will undergo surgery after 10-12 weeks from the end of CT/RT
      and the surgical piece will be analyzed. After surgery patients will be followed up for 5
      years, according to clinical practice.
