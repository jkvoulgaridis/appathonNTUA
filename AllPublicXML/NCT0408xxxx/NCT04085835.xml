  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines gene expression and gene regulation in the uterine lining during menses
      in women, for evolutionary comparison with other primates which do or do not menstruate.
      Samples will be obtained by non-invasive collection of menstrual fluid from healthy donors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Menstruation corresponds to the shedding of the uterine lining when fecundation has not
      occurred. This is a recent evolutionary innovation in primates, and the cellular and genetic
      changes that led to the acquisition of menstruation are not well understood. Additionally,
      the uterine lining is poorly characterized in humans at the menstrual time point, which
      hinders both evolutionary and medically-relevant analyses.

      In this study, the research team are collecting menstrual fluid samples from healthy female
      volunteers to profile gene expression and gene regulatory elements in the major cell types
      that compose the uterine lining during menstruation. The investigators will compare this data
      to similar samples collected from other primates at the same time point in the female
      hormonal cycle.

      The objective is to identify genes that have acquired novel regulation and/or expression
      patterns and which may be involved in menstruation.
