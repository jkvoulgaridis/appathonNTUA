  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A potential long-term consequence of anterior cruciate ligament injuries is the development
      of post-traumatic osteoarthritis in the years following injury. There are no curative
      treatments for osteoarthritis, increasing the importance of minimizing the occurrence of
      post-traumatic osteoarthritis following anterior cruciate ligament injuries. Current
      literature has begun to indicate that biochemical changes in the knee joint cartilage, such
      as chondrocyte death, following injury can contribute to the development of post-traumatic
      osteoarthritis.

      The main objective of this study is to determine if an early intervention of joint aspiration
      and platelet rich plasma injection will positively affect the biomarkers representative of
      chondral degeneration in patients with anterior cruciate ligament injuries. We hypothesize
      that the intervention will reduce the volume of inflammatory and chondrodegenerative
      biomarkers following anterior cruciate ligament injury.

      A non-surgical treatment option for the management of osteoarthritis include injectables such
      as corticosteroids and platelet rich plasma. These injectables work by positively affecting
      cartilage cells, also known as chondrocytes, and the cells of the joint lining tissue, also
      known as synoviocytes. Platelet rich plasma is an autologous derived blood product, i.e. a
      joint injectable made from the patient's own blood at the time and location of injection with
      simple blood centrifugation. Studies in the bench-top laboratory setting have provided
      in-vitro evidence that platelet rich plasma decreases synoviocyte production of metallometal
      proteases, an inflammatory protein with negative effects on cartilage and decreases the
      effects of inflammatory proteins.
