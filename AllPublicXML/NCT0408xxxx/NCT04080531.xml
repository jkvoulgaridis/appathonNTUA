  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase IV trial studies how well influenza vaccination works in preventing infections
      such as influenza in patients with plasma cell disorders. Influenza infections may
      theoretically support the growth of tumor cells and improving protection against influenza
      may improve the status of patients' plasma cell disorder. Giving influenza vaccination may
      reduce influenza-related complications including infections, hospitalizations, and deaths,
      and improve the status of plasma cell disorders.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Demonstrate an absolute 25% increase in seroprotection, defined as hemagglutination
      antibody inhibition (HAI) &gt; 40 against all strains, at week 21 in the experimental arm
      compared to the control arm.

      II. Determine correlation between HAI, predefined risk of influenza-like illness (low,
      moderate, high), and progression-free survival (PFS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Measurement of B &amp; T-cell subsets and flu-specific responses as a way of understanding
      immunosuppression in this patient population, correlating with influenza-like illness.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive trivalent influenza vaccine intramuscularly (IM) at weeks 1, 9, and
      17, and pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine IM at week 5 in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive trivalent influenza vaccine IM at week 1 and pneumococcal 13-valent
      conjugate vaccine IM at week 5 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks and then periodically
      for 2 years.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must have a plasma cell dyscrasia that fits in the International Myeloma
             Working Group (IMWG) diagnostic criteria.

          -  Both men and women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this study.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 3 (Karnofsky ≥ 30%) is
             required for eligibility.

          -  Patient must be eligible to receive standard of care influenza vaccination. If the
             patient has a history of egg allergy with symptoms more severe than urticaria, e.g.
             angioedema, respiratory distress, lightheadedness, or recurrent emesis, they remain
             eligible to receive influenza vaccination but must receive the vaccine in a facility
             able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. Persons who are able to eat
             lightly cooked egg (e.g., scrambled egg) without reaction are unlikely to be allergic,
             although egg-allergic persons might tolerate egg in baked products.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have already received the seasonal influenza vaccine in the current
             season.

          -  History of Guillain-Barré syndrome.

          -  Patients with a previous severe allergic reaction to influenza vaccination or
             pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV13).

          -  Expected survival &lt; 9 months.

          -  Prisoners.
