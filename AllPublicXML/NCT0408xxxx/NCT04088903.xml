  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether daratumumab, a drug that eliminates
      antibody-producing plasma cells, can effectively lower the level of preformed antibodies in
      patients awaiting heart transplantation. These preformed antibodies limit the number of donor
      hearts that are compatible for the patients. If daratumumab can effectively remove preformed,
      donor-specific antibodies, then highly allosensitized patients will have more compatible
      hearts available to them, potentially decreasing transplant waitlist time and reducing
      mortality.

    <description>Participants will receive an intravenous infusion of daratumumab weekly for 8 doses and then every other week for 2 doses.
For this dose-escalation study, the initial patients will receive a 2 mg/kg dose of daratumumab. In subsequent patients, the dose will be uptitrated to 16 mg/kg as tolerated.
Participants will undergo laboratory testing, including for circulating antibodies, at baseline, prior to each infusion session, and at the end of the study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant is on an active list for a heart transplant.

          -  Participant has a high level of allosensitization, defined as a calculated PRA (panel
             of reactive antibodies) of 50%, based on their antibody status at the time of entry
             into the study.

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign an informed consent form prior to any
             study-related procedures.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening.

          -  Both male and female patients must use effective methods of birth control, must not
             donate eggs or sperm during the course of the study and for 3 months after stopping
             daratumumab.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of allergy or intolerance to daratumumab.

          -  Prior diagnosis of myeloma or light chain amyloidosis.

          -  Active infection.

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Ongoing desensitization treatment with another agent. Subjects are excluded if they
             have received:

               -  a. IVIG within 30 days of enrollment.

               -  b. Proteasome inhibitor within 60 days of enrollment.

               -  c. Rituximab within 180 days of enrollment.

          -  Any condition which could interfere with, or the treatment for which might interfere
             with, the conduct of the study or which would, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             unacceptably increase the subject's risk by participating in the study.

          -  Contraindication to herpes zoster prophylaxis.

          -  Known to be seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

          -  Known to be seropositive for hepatitis B (defined by a positive test for hepatitis B
             surface antigen [HBsAg]). Subjects with resolved infection (ie, subjects who are HBsAg
             negative but positive for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen [anti-HBc] and/or
             antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen [anti-HBs]) must be screened using real-time
             polymerase chain reaction (PCR) measurement of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels.
             Those who are PCR positive will be excluded. EXCEPTION: Subjects with serologic
             findings suggestive of HBV vaccination (anti-HBs positivity as the only serologic
             marker) AND a known history of prior HBV vaccination, do not need to be tested for HBV
             DNA by PCR.

          -  Known to be seropositive for hepatitis C (except in the setting of a sustained
             virologic response (SVR), defined as aviremia at least 12 weeks after completion of
             antiviral therapy).

          -  Known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with a forced expiratory volume in
             1 second (FEV1) &lt;50% of predicted normal. Note that FEV1 testing is required for
             subjects suspected of having COPD and subjects must be excluded if FEV1 is &lt;50% of
             predicted normal.

          -  Known moderate or severe persistent asthma within the past 2 years, or uncontrolled
             asthma of any classification.
