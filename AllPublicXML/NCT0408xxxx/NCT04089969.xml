  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the narrowing or blockage of the artery of the heart and is
      prevalent in end-stage liver disease. Consultation with cardiologist and stress tests are
      recommended to patients under consideration for liver transplant. The purpose of this study
      is to evaluate if Computed Tomography Angiogram (CTA) and CTA-derived Fractional Flow Reserve
      (FFRct) procedure influences decisions about further cardiac testing compared with Standard
      of Care (SOC) such as consultation by a cardiologist, Echocardiogram (ultrasound of the
      heart), Electrocardiogram (ECG) and stress tests.

      The purpose of this study is to determine in end-stage liver disease patients whether
      non-invasive assessment of coronary artery disease prior to liver transplant using CTA (CTA)
      and CTA-derived Fractional Flow Reserved (FFRct) is superior to current standard of care
      (SOC) cardiovascular evaluation such as formal consultation by a cardiologist,
      electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and pharmacological stress test such (e.g. Dobutamine
      stress echocardiogram and lexiscan myocardial perfusion imaging). The investigational portion
      of this study is the CTA and FFRct, which is a special x-ray scan that can identify blockages
      in the arteries and determine if blood flow is impaired. The CTA and FFRct will be done
      within 2 weeks after the standard of care evaluation.

      All 100 patients will undergo standard of care stress test plus CTA/FFRct. The referring
      cardiologist will be blinded to the results of CTA/FFRct, and will make an &quot;initial&quot;
      recommendation based on the standard of care evaluation. After making the &quot;initial&quot;
      recommendation, the referring cardiologist will be unblinded to the CTA/FFRct results and
      make a &quot;final&quot; recommendation. The &quot;initial&quot; recommendation will consist of one of the
      following: further cardiac evaluation is not needed or cardiac catheterization is required.
      The &quot;final&quot; recommendation will consist of one of the following: further cardiac evaluation
      is not needed or cardiac catheterization is required. All patients will receive a 1 year
      phone follow up call.

      The hypothesis is that in End Stage Liver Disease (ESLD) patients, non-invasive assessment
      for CAD using CTA/FFRct is superior to SOC cardiovascular evaluation (stress etst,
      echocardiogram, ECG). This study will look at the frequency of how often CTA/FFRct changed
      the clinical recommendation compared with the standard of care alone (Initial recommendation
      versus final recommendation).
