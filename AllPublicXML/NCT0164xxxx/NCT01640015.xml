  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to identify the effect of meal frequency on blood
      pressure (BP) levels of individuals.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Migration studies, observational epidemiology and clinical trial data indicate that causes of
      adverse BP levels are mainly environmental , including lifestyle under which dietary factors
      play a role. Therefore, lifestyle modification is part of the current American Heart
      Association recommendations for prevention and control of adverse BP levels.

      Although the effects of nutrients and foods on BP have been studied extensively, other
      dietetic factors such as eating frequency and number of meals in a day have been less
      thoroughly investigated and warrant further research to explore their possible positive
      effect on BP.
