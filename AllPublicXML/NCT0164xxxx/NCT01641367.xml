      The study was done to:

        -  test a strategy of using a resistance test to choose anti-HIV drugs

        -  see how well combinations of new anti-HIV drugs work to lower HIV infection

        -  see if taking new anti-HIV drugs together is safe and tolerable

        -  see if text messages improve people's anti-HIV drug-taking behavior (only at sites
           participating in the adherence study)

        -  in people taking certain combinations of anti-HIV drugs with an anti-TB drug, compare
           how these drugs act in the body

        -  to see how people do after they stop having frequent clinic visits as part of a research
           study

      A5288 was an open-label phase IV, prospective interventional, strategy study in
      resource-limited settings (RLS) for HIV-1 infected participants with triple-class experience
      or resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-NRTIs (NNRTIs), and
      protease inhibitors (PIs) and who were failing their current regimen. The use of novel agents
      and contemporary clinical decision management tools that include standard genotyping and
      plasma HIV viral load (VL) monitoring were evaluated. The screening genotype results and
      antiretroviral (ARV) history were used to allocate potential participants to one of four
      Cohorts (A, B, C or D) and to select an associated ARV regimen based on the Cohort
      assignment. In brief, individuals assigned to Cohort A continued on the same PI as in their
      second-line regimen, with the ability to modify NRTIs. Those assigned to Cohort B who were
      negative for hepatitis B were randomized to receive RAL and DRV/RTV with either the best
      available NRTIs (Cohort B1) or ETR (Cohort B2). If they were positive for hepatitis B they
      were assigned to Cohort B3 and received RAL, DRV/RTV and either FTC/TDF or 3TC/TDF.
      Individuals assigned to Cohort C received RAL and DRV/RTV with the best available NRTIs.
      Those ineligible for Cohorts A, B or C were assigned to Cohort D and received the best
      available regimen that included study provided drugs and any locally provided drugs.

      At sites where feasible and relevant, the study evaluated an adherence support intervention.
      This involved a randomized comparison of a cell phone-based adherence support intervention
      plus local standard-of-care adherence support procedures (CPI+SOC) versus the SOC adherence
      support procedures.

      Participants enrolled to the study in Step 1. If a participant experienced a confirmed
      virologic failure (defined as two consecutive HIV-1 RNA measures &gt;= 1000 copies/mL) at/after
      22 weeks on their Step 1 regimen, they had another genotype test performed and cohort/regimen
      selected for Step 2. With the exception of one additional visit 4 weeks after enrollment to
      Step 2, the visit schedule for Step 2 followed the participant's original Step 1 schedule
      throughout the remainder of follow up.

      Participants were followed in Steps 1 and 2 until 48 weeks after the last participant was
      enrolled to Step 1. During the first 48 weeks after Step 1 enrollment, clinic visits occurred
      at weeks 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48. After week 48, visits occurred every 12 weeks for adherence,
      safety and efficacy measures.

      Participants had a final step 1/2 visit between November 22, 2016 and February 13, 2017. At
      the final step 1/2 visit, participants taking RAL, ETR, or DRV who were unable to obtain
      these drugs locally (e.g., through local treatment programs), and were otherwise eligible,
      entered Step 3 and continued to receive these drugs through the study for up to 96 additional
      weeks. Step 3 participants were dispensed ARVs every 12 weeks and had clinical assessments
      every 24 weeks. The purpose of Step 3 was to assist participants with the transition back to
      local care.

      The primary analysis specified in the protocol and in the Statistical Analysis Plan was to
      estimate the proportion of participants in the overall study population who were
      virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA ≤200 copies/mL) at week 48 with a 95% confidence
      interval.

    <description>The measurement closest to exactly 48 weeks (ie, 7x48=336 days) after the date of entry, within the window of 48 weeks ± 6 weeks (specifically 295 to 378 days after randomization, inclusive).
The analysis in the protocol and in the Stat. Analysis Plan involved estimating the proportion of participants in the overall study population with HIV-1 RNA ≤200 copies/mL at week 48 with a 95% confidence interval calculated via a Wald approach. Death or lost to follow-up before week 48 was considered as HIV-1 RNA&gt;200 copies/mL at week 48. Missing results at week 48 were considered as HIV-1 RNA &gt;200 copies/mL at week 48 unless the immediately preceding and succeeding HIV-1 RNA measurements were ≤200 copies/mL. Since the primary analysis was on the total study population, overall results were also submitted. All participants in B3 had HIV-1 RNA ≤200 copies/mL at week 48. Therefore, Wald confidence interval could not be computed for B3 and Clopper-Pearson Exact confidence interval is provided.</description>

The analysis in the protocol and in the Stat. Analysis Plan involved estimating the proportion of participants in the overall study population with HIV-1 RNA ≤200 copies/mL at week 24 with a 95% confidence interval calculated via a Wald approach. Death or lost to follow-up before week 24 was considered as HIV-1 RNA&gt;200 copies/mL at week 24. Missing results at week 24 were considered as HIV-1 RNA &gt;200 copies/mL at week 24 unless the immediately preceding and succeeding HIV-1 RNA measurements were ≤200 copies/mL.

    <description>The measurement closest to exactly 72 weeks (ie, 7x72=504 days) after the date of entry, within the window of 72 weeks ± 6 weeks (specifically 463 to 546 days, inclusive).
The analysis in the protocol and in the Analysis Plan involved estimating the proportion of participants in the overall study population with HIV-1 RNA ≤200 copies/mL at week 72 with a 95% confidence interval calculated via a Wald approach. Death or lost to follow-up before week 72 was considered as HIV-1 RNA&gt;200 copies/mL at week 72. If a result was expected, missing results at week 72 were considered as HIV-1 RNA &gt;200 copies/mL at week 72 unless the immediately preceding and succeeding HIV-1 RNA measurements were ≤200 copies/mL. Since the primary analysis was on the total study population, overall results were also submitted. All participants in B3 had HIV-1 RNA ≤200 copies/mL at week 72. Therefore, Wald confidence interval could not be computed for B3 and Clopper-Pearson Exact confidence interval is provided.</description>

          -  Female participants of reproductive potential must have agreed not to participate in
             the conception process (ie, active attempt to become pregnant, in vitro
             fertilization), and if participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy,
             the female participant must have used at least one reliable form of contraceptive.

             needed.

          -  Ability to take oral study medications.

          -  No intention of permanent relocation that would preclude attending Step 1 and 2 study

             DAIDS-approved regional genotyping facility from testing performed on a plasma sample
             that was collected during screening (ie, at or after the date that a sample is
             collected to confirm HIV-1 virologic failure) and which was shipped to a regional
             resistance testing laboratory once documentation of two screening plasma HIV-1 RNA
             values ≥1000 copies/mL were available.

          -  Identification of a cohort assignment and ARV regimen for use on study, selected from

             investigator, would have interfered with adherence to study requirements.

          -  Serious illness requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization until candidate
             either completes therapy or was clinically stable on therapy, in the opinion of the
             site investigator, for at least 7 days prior to study entry.

          -  Concurrent illness or condition that would compromise the ability to take study
             medication, follow the protocol, or that would make participation not in the best
             interest of the participant, per the site investigator.

          -  Requirement for taking any of the prohibited medications with the selected ARV study
             regimen, or within 14 days prior to study entry.

        NOTE: Study candidates should not have discontinued any component of their ART during
        screening. The 14-day restriction on prohibited medications did not apply to ARVs.

          -  Active tuberculosis (TB) or rifampin exposure less than 2 weeks prior to study entry.

          -  Any exposure to darunavir or etravirine.

          <title>Cell Phone Intervention (CPI) + Standard of Care (SOC)</title>
          <description>The CPI was a simple interactive system (Short Message Service [SMS] Reminder and Flashback System) to identify non-adherence soon after it occurred and, in response, a site-based culturally relevant algorithm for managing barriers to adherence. Reminders were sent daily for the first 8 weeks on study, then three times per week for the next 8 weeks, and then weekly through to 48 weeks after study entry. Participants were expected to respond (&quot;flashback&quot;) to each reminder. Failure to respond, triggered the system to alert the site to contact the participant. Sites were instructed to contact the participant if they missed any three flashbacks over two weeks during the daily messaging period, any two missed flashbacks over two weeks of the three times a week messaging period, and any two missed flashbacks over two weeks during the weekly messaging period. Additionally, sites were instructed to continue the local standard of care practices for managing adherence barriers.</description>

        <title>Proportion of Participants With Plasma HIV-1 RNA ≤200 Copies/mL at 48 Weeks</title>
        <description>The measurement closest to exactly 48 weeks (ie, 7x48=336 days) after the date of entry, within the window of 48 weeks ± 6 weeks (specifically 295 to 378 days after randomization, inclusive).
The analysis in the protocol and in the Stat. Analysis Plan involved estimating the proportion of participants in the overall study population with HIV-1 RNA ≤200 copies/mL at week 48 with a 95% confidence interval calculated via a Wald approach. Death or lost to follow-up before week 48 was considered as HIV-1 RNA&gt;200 copies/mL at week 48. Missing results at week 48 were considered as HIV-1 RNA &gt;200 copies/mL at week 48 unless the immediately preceding and succeeding HIV-1 RNA measurements were ≤200 copies/mL. Since the primary analysis was on the total study population, overall results were also submitted. All participants in B3 had HIV-1 RNA ≤200 copies/mL at week 48. Therefore, Wald confidence interval could not be computed for B3 and Clopper-Pearson Exact confidence interval is provided.</description>

          <title>Proportion of Participants With Plasma HIV-1 RNA ≤200 Copies/mL at 72 Weeks</title>
          <description>The measurement closest to exactly 72 weeks (ie, 7x72=504 days) after the date of entry, within the window of 72 weeks ± 6 weeks (specifically 463 to 546 days, inclusive).
The analysis in the protocol and in the Analysis Plan involved estimating the proportion of participants in the overall study population with HIV-1 RNA ≤200 copies/mL at week 72 with a 95% confidence interval calculated via a Wald approach. Death or lost to follow-up before week 72 was considered as HIV-1 RNA&gt;200 copies/mL at week 72. If a result was expected, missing results at week 72 were considered as HIV-1 RNA &gt;200 copies/mL at week 72 unless the immediately preceding and succeeding HIV-1 RNA measurements were ≤200 copies/mL. Since the primary analysis was on the total study population, overall results were also submitted. All participants in B3 had HIV-1 RNA ≤200 copies/mL at week 72. Therefore, Wald confidence interval could not be computed for B3 and Clopper-Pearson Exact confidence interval is provided.</description>

        <title>Time to Confirmed Virologic Failure, Defined as First HIV-1 RNA ≥1000 Copies/mL at or After 24 Weeks on Study, With a New Resistance-associated Mutation Detected in Population-based Sequencing</title>
        <description>Virologic failure was confirmed by the next HIV-1 RNA measurement ≥1000 copies/mL (irrespective of time between initial and confirmatory measure [specimens on separate dates] and treatment status). A week 24 measurement included HIV-1 RNA obtained ≥7*22=154 days after study entry (to allow for 14 day window for scheduling the visit). HIV-1 RNA measurements through and including 21 November 2016 were considered in identifying an initial failing measurement, allowing HIV-1 RNA at the close-out visit between 22 November 2016 and 13 February 2017 to be a confirmatory measure. Event times were the scheduled week of the initial failing measurement (RNA scheduled at week 0, 12, 24, 48 and every 24 weeks after). Censoring times were the scheduled week of the last RNA result. Length of follow-up varied by Cohort. A new resistance-associated mutation is defined as one not present in the genotype prior to entry.</description>

        <title>Percent of Participants With Confirmed Virologic Failure, Defined as First HIV-1 RNA ≥1000 Copies/mL at or After 24 Weeks on Study, With a New Resistance-associated Mutation Detected in Population-based Sequencing, by Week 48</title>
        <description>Results report percent of participants reaching outcome by week 48 using Kaplan-Meier method. Virologic failure was confirmed by the next HIV-1 RNA measurement ≥1000 copies/mL (irrespective of time between initial and confirmatory measure[specimens on separate dates] and treatment status). A week 24 measurement included HIV-1 RNA obtained ≥7*22=154 days after study entry(to allow for 14 day window for scheduling the visit).HIV-1 RNA measurements through and including 21 November 2016 were considered in identifying an initial failing measurement,allowing HIV-1 RNA at the close-out visit between 22 November 2016 and 13 February 2017 to be a confirmatory measure.Event times were the scheduled week of the initial failing measurement(RNA scheduled at week 0, 12, 24, 48 and every 24 weeks after).Censoring times were the scheduled week of the last RNA result.Length of follow-up varied by Cohort.A new resistance-associated mutation is defined as one not present in the genotype prior to entry.</description>

Event time was the exact week of death, AIDS-defining event or non-AIDS defining event. Censoring time was the earlier of last contact week and the week of the last step 1/2 visit. Only new events were considered, an event that was also reported at or prior to study entry was not included. If a participant experienced multiple events, then the time of the first event was used in the analysis. AIDS defining events included parasitic, fungal, bacterial, and viral infections as well as neoplastic diseases, and neurological disorders.

The analysis in the protocol and in the Stat. Analysis Plan involved estimating the proportion of participants in the overall study population with HIV-1 RNA ≤200 copies/mL at week 48 with a 95% confidence interval calculated via a Wald approach. Death or lost to follow-up before week 48 was considered as HIV-1 RNA&gt;200 copies/mL at week 48. Missing results at week 48 were considered as HIV-1 RNA &gt;200 copies/mL at week 48 unless the immediately preceding and succeeding HIV-1 RNA measurements were ≤200 copies/mL.</description>

        <description>Virologic failure was confirmed by the next HIV-1 RNA measurement ≥1000 copies/mL (irrespective of time between initial and confirmatory measure [specimens on separate dates] and treatment status). A week 24 measurement included HIV-1 RNA obtained ≥7*22=154 days after study entry (to allow for 14 day window for scheduling the visit). HIV-1 RNA measurements through and including 21 November 2016 were considered in identifying an initial failing measurement, allowing HIV-1 RNA at the close-out visit between 22 November 2016 and 13 February 2017 to be a confirmatory measure. Event times were the scheduled week of the initial failing measurement (RNA scheduled at week 0, 12, 24, 48 and every 24 weeks after). Censoring times were the scheduled week of the last RNA result.</description>

          <title>Time to Confirmed Virologic Failure, Defined as First HIV-1 RNA ≥1000 Copies/mL at or After 24 Weeks on Study [CPI+SOC v SOC]</title>
          <description>Virologic failure was confirmed by the next HIV-1 RNA measurement ≥1000 copies/mL (irrespective of time between initial and confirmatory measure [specimens on separate dates] and treatment status). A week 24 measurement included HIV-1 RNA obtained ≥7*22=154 days after study entry (to allow for 14 day window for scheduling the visit). HIV-1 RNA measurements through and including 21 November 2016 were considered in identifying an initial failing measurement, allowing HIV-1 RNA at the close-out visit between 22 November 2016 and 13 February 2017 to be a confirmatory measure. Event times were the scheduled week of the initial failing measurement (RNA scheduled at week 0, 12, 24, 48 and every 24 weeks after). Censoring times were the scheduled week of the last RNA result.</description>

Participants were expected to respond (“flashback”) to each reminder. Failure to respond, triggered the system to alert the site to contact the participant. Sites were instructed to contact the participant if they missed any three flashbacks over two weeks during the daily messaging period, any two missed flashbacks over two weeks of the three times a week messaging period, and any two missed flashbacks over two weeks during the weekly messaging period.

        <title>Number of Participants With Confirmed Virologic Failure, Defined as First HIV-1 RNA ≥1000 Copies/mL at or After 24 Weeks on Study, With a New Resistance-associated Mutation Detected in Population-based Sequencing [CPI+SOC v SOC]</title>
        <description>Virologic failure was confirmed by the next HIV-1 RNA measurement ≥1000 copies/mL (irrespective of time between initial and confirmatory measure[specimens on separate dates] and treatment status). A week 24 measurement included HIV-1 RNA obtained ≥7*22=154 days after study entry (to allow for 14 day window for scheduling the visit).HIV-1 RNA measurements through and including 21 November 2016 were considered in identifying an initial failing measurement, allowing HIV-1 RNA at the close-out visit between 22 November 2016 and 13 February 2017 to be a confirmatory measure. A new resistance-associated mutation is defined as one not present in the genotype prior to entry.</description>

            <description>The CPI was a simple interactive system (Short Message Service [SMS] Reminder and Flashback System) to identify non-adherence soon after it occurred and, in response, a site-based culturally relevant algorithm for managing barriers to adherence.

Participants were expected to respond (“flashback”) to each reminder. Failure to respond, triggered the system to alert the site to contact the participant. Sites were instructed to contact the participant if they missed any three flashbacks over two weeks during the daily messaging period, any two missed flashbacks over two weeks of the three times a week messaging period, and any two missed flashbacks over two weeks during the weekly messaging period. Additionally, sites were instructed to continue the local standard of care practices for managing adherence barriers.</description>

        <title>Percent of Participants Experiencing Death, AIDS-defining Event or a Non-AIDS-defining Event by Week 48 [CPI+SOC v SOC]</title>
        <description>Results report percent of participants reaching outcome by week 48 using Kaplan-Meier method. Event time was the exact week of death, AIDS-defining event or non-AIDS defining event. Censoring time was the earlier of last contact week and the week of the last step 1/2 visit. Only new events were considered, an event that was also reported at or prior to study entry was not included. If a participant experienced multiple events, then the time of the first event was used in the analysis. AIDS defining events included parasitic, fungal, bacterial, and viral infections as well as neoplastic diseases, and neurological disorders. Non-AIDS defining events included malignancies, diabetes, neuropathies, cardiac and renal events.</description>

            <description>The CPI was a simple interactive system (Short Message Service [SMS] Reminder and Flashback System) to identify non-adherence soon after it occurred and, in response, a site-based culturally relevant algorithm for managing barriers to adherence. Reminders were sent daily for the first 8 weeks on study, then three times per week for the next 8 weeks, and then weekly through to 48 weeks after study entry. Participants were expected to respond (“flashback”) to each reminder. Failure to respond, triggered the system to alert the site to contact the participant. Sites were instructed to contact the participant if they missed any three flashbacks over two weeks during the daily messaging period, any two missed flashbacks over two weeks of the three times a week messaging period, and any two missed flashbacks over two weeks during the weekly messaging period. Additionally, sites were instructed to continue the local standard of care practices for managing adherence barriers.</description>

        <title>Percent of Participants With Treatment Modification or Discontinuation by Week 48 [CPI+SOC v SOC]</title>
        <description>Results report percent of participants reaching outcome by week 48 using Kaplan-Meier method. Treatment modification is defined as the first occurrence of a substitution or subtraction of one or more drugs in the study regimen, a temporary hold lasting 7 days or longer, or the addition of a new drug to the regimen. This would not include splitting any fixed dose combination medications if the participant continues on the active drugs of the combination. Event time was the exact week of the modification or discontinuation. Censoring time was the earliest time point between last dose week and the week of the last step 1/2 visit.</description>

            <description>The CPI was a simple interactive system (Short Message Service [SMS] Reminder and Flashback System) to identify non-adherence soon after it occurred and, in response, a site-based culturally relevant algorithm for managing barriers to adherence. Reminders were sent daily for the first 8 weeks on study, then three times per week for the next 8 weeks, and then weekly through to 48 weeks after study entry. Participants were expected to respond (“flashback”) to each reminder. Failure to respond, triggered the system to alert the site to contact the participant. Sites were instructed to contact the participant if they missed any three flashbacks over two weeks during the daily messaging period, any two missed flashbacks over two weeks of the three times a week messaging period, and any two missed flashbacks over two weeks during the weekly messaging period. Additionally, sites were instructed to continue the local standard of care practices for managing adherence barriers.</description>

        <description>Event time was the exact week of the modification. Censoring time was the earliest time point between last dose week and the week of the last step 1/2 visit. DAIDS AE Grading Table, Version 1.0 was used.</description>

            <description>The CPI was a simple interactive system (Short Message Service [SMS] Reminder and Flashback System) to identify non-adherence soon after it occurred and, in response, a site-based culturally relevant algorithm for managing barriers to adherence. Reminders were sent daily for the first 8 weeks on study, then three times per week for the next 8 weeks, and then weekly through to 48 weeks after study entry. Participants were expected to respond (“flashback”) to each reminder. Failure to respond, triggered the system to alert the site to contact the participant. Sites were instructed to contact the participant if they missed any three flashbacks over two weeks during the daily messaging period, any two missed flashbacks over two weeks of the three times a week messaging period, and any two missed flashbacks over two weeks during the weekly messaging period. Additionally, sites were instructed to continue the local standard of care practices for managing adherence barriers.</description>

        <description>Baseline is defined as the last measurement obtained on or before the earlier of the following two dates: the date of entry/randomization plus three days (this is the time allowed in the protocol for starting study-defined ART) and the date of starting the study-defined ARV regimen.</description>

            <title>Cell Phone Intervention (CPI) + Standard of Care (SOC)</title>
            <description>The CPI was a simple interactive system (Short Message Service [SMS] Reminder and Flashback System) to identify non-adherence soon after it occurred and, in response, a site-based culturally relevant algorithm for managing barriers to adherence. Reminders were sent daily for the first 8 weeks on study, then three times per week for the next 8 weeks, and then weekly through to 48 weeks after study entry. Participants were expected to respond (“flashback”) to each reminder. Failure to respond, triggered the system to alert the site to contact the participant. Sites were instructed to contact the participant if they missed any three flashbacks over two weeks during the daily messaging period, any two missed flashbacks over two weeks of the three times a week messaging period, and any two missed flashbacks over two weeks during the weekly messaging period. Additionally, sites were instructed to continue the local standard of care practices for managing adherence barriers.</description>

            <description>The CPI was a simple interactive system (Short Message Service [SMS] Reminder and Flashback System) to identify non-adherence soon after it occurred and, in response, a site-based culturally relevant algorithm for managing barriers to adherence. Reminders were sent daily for the first 8 weeks on study, then three times per week for the next 8 weeks, and then weekly through to 48 weeks after study entry. Participants were expected to respond (“flashback”) to each reminder. Failure to respond, triggered the system to alert the site to contact the participant. Sites were instructed to contact the participant if they missed any three flashbacks over two weeks during the daily messaging period, any two missed flashbacks over two weeks of the three times a week messaging period, and any two missed flashbacks over two weeks during the weekly messaging period. Additionally, sites were instructed to continue the local standard of care practices for managing adherence barriers.</description>
