    <textblock>
      This laboratory study is looking into biomarkers in samples from younger patients with kidney
      cancer. Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.
      It may also help doctors find better ways to treat cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is expressed and if FAK is phosphorylated
      in pediatric renal tumors.

      OUTLINE:

      Archived tumor tissue samples are analyzed for FAK expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC).
      IHC staining is compared in normal renal tissue, Wilms tumor (routine and anaplastic),
      malignant rhabdoid tumor of the kidney, clear cell sarcoma of the kidney, and mesoblastic
      nephroma.
