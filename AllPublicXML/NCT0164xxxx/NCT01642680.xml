  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of long-term cancer survivors is growing. As a result, treatment-related morbidity
      - such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, functional decline and fatigue - is
      impacting quality of life and impairing survival. Metabolic syndrome in the general
      population is currently treated with lifestyle advice to increase physical activity (PA) and
      reduce caloric intake. This approach is still underused as standard care for cancer
      survivors. The aim of this study is investigate whether a tailored PA program that starts
      early (during curative chemotherapy with cardiovascular toxic potential) is superior in terms
      of reducing long-term cancer-treatment-related metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular
      morbidity to a program that starts late (after completion of chemotherapy).

    <description>The early group will start the PA program during chemotherapy for 3 months, and after completion of chemotherapy for 3 months (total 6 months). The PA program will consist of two components: improvement of physical fitness and empowerment to adopt a healthy lifestyle. Longitudinal effects of this PA program will be evaluated at 5 time points: before chemotherapy; at start of the PA program and at 3, 6 and 18 months after start of the PA program. Safety parameters will be monitored throughout the study period.</description>
