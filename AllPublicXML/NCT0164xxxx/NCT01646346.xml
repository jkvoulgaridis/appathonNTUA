      The Purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using image guidance and
      four-dimensional computed tomography to reduce the volume of non target breast tissue that is
      treated with accelerated partial breast irradiation via the external beam technique.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study enrolling about 30 patients to evaluate the feasibility of using 4D CT
      and daily image guidance in Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI) to decrease set-up
      error and individualized planning target volumes to limit the non-target breast tissue dose.
      The two specific breasts constraints which shall be decreased are the V50 (percent volume of
      breast receiving 50% of the prescribed dose) and the V100 (percent volume of breast receiving
      100% of the prescribed dose). The goal will be to decrease these to 45% and 23.5%
      respectively, which is down 33% from the NSABP B39 standard of 60% and 35%.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient must consent to be in the study and must have a signed an approved consent
             form conforming with institutional guidelines.

          -  Patient must be &gt; 50 years old.

          -  The patient should have a life expectancy of at least two years with a karnofsky
             performance status &gt; 70.

          -  The patient must have stage 0 or I breast cancer.

          -  On histological examination, the tumor must be DCIS or invasive adenocarcinoma of the
             breast.

          -  Surgical treatment of the breast must have been lumpectomy. The margins of the
             resected specimen must be histologically free of tumor (&gt;2mm, DCIS and invasive).
             Re-excision of surgical margins is permitted.

          -  Gross disease must be unifocal with pathologic (invasive and/or DCIS) tumor size 2 cm
             or less. (Patients with microscopic multifocality are eligible as long as total
             pathologic tumor size is 2 cm or less.)

          -  Patients with invasive breast cancer are required to have axillary staging which can
             include sentinel node biopsy alone (if negative), sentinel node biopsy followed by
             axillary dissection or sampling with a minimum total of 6 axillary nodes or axillary
             dissection alone (with a minimum of 6 axillary nodes). Axillary staging is NOT
             required for patients with DCIS.

          -  The patient must have simulation within 8 weeks/56 days of the final surgery for their
             breast cancer (lumpectomy, re-excision of margins, or axillary staging procedure).

          -  Patients with a history of non-ipsilateral breast malignancies are eligible if they
             have been disease-free for 2 or more years prior to enrollment. Patients with the
             following cancers are eligible even if diagnosed and treated within the past 2 years:
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix, colon, melanoma in situ, and basal cell and squamous
             cell carcinoma of the skin.

          -  Chemotherapy is permitted if planned for â‰¥ 2 weeks after radiation.

          -  Urine pregnancy test must be performed and be negative on all women younger than 60
             who have not had a tubal ligation, oophorectomy, or hysterectomy.

          -  Separate incisions for the lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy should be present. Use
             of only one incision will typically result in a contiguous cavity with the tumor bed
             and the sentinel node sampling, and inability of the radiation oncologist to delineate
             the tumor bed from the sentinel node bed.

          -  The patient must have a cavity which is able to be targeted with external beam APBI,
             either through surgical clip placement, or CVS 3 or higher. The cavity to whole breast
             ratio must be 30% or less.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Men are not eligible for this study as men are not breast conservation candidates.

          -  T0, T2 (&gt; 2.0 cm), T3, node positive, stage III or IV breast cancer.

          -  Any positive axillary nodes.

          -  Palpable or radiographically suspicious ipsilateral or contralateral axillary,
             supraclavicular, infraclavicular or internal mammary nodes, unless biopsy proven to be
             negative for tumor.

          -  Suspicious microcalcifications, densities or palpable abnormalities in either breast
             unless biopsy proven to be benign.

          -  Non-epithelial breast malignancies such as sarcoma or lymphoma.

          -  Proven multicentric carcinoma in more than one quadrant or separated by more than 2
             centimeters.

          -  Paget's disease of the nipple.

          -  History of invasive breast cancer or DCIS in the same breast.

          -  Surgical margins that cannot be microscopically assessed or are less then 2 mm.

          -  Collagen vascular disease, specifically dermatomyositis with a CPK level above normal
             or with an active skin rash, systemic lupus erythematosis or scleroderma.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation at the time of proposed radiation. Women of reproductive
             potential must agree to use an effective non-hormonal method of contraception during
             therapy.

          -  Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other conditions that, in the opinion of the
             treating physician, would preclude the patient from meeting the study requirements.

          -  Patients with coexisting medical conditions in whom life expectancy is &lt; 2 years.

          -  Patients with skin involvement, regardless of tumor size.

        <description>This outcome is measured by the Breast Cancer Treatment outcome Scale (BCTOS). Eleven items (e.g., breast size, breast pain, breast shape) are rated by patients on a 4-point scale (0=no difference to 3=large difference), with a score range of 0-33 (higher scores signifying worse outcome). Scores on each item are summed to obtain a total score.</description>
