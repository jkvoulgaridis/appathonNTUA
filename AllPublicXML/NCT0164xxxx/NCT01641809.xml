  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to select a dose of GSK1265744 primarily on the basis of antiviral
      activity and tolerability in HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral naive subjects.

      This study consists of two parts:

      Induction Phase: Approximately 200 subjects will be randomized (50 subjects in each of the 4
      treatment arms). The Induction Phase consists of a 24 week dose-ranging evaluation of
      GSK1265744 at blinded doses of 10 mg, 30 mg and 60 mg once-daily and a control arm of
      open-label efavirenz (EFV) 600 mg once daily. The background dual nucleoside reverse
      transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all arms will be either
      abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) or tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) as selected by the
      Investigator. Subjects randomized to a GSK1265744 containing arm, who successfully complete
      24 weeks on study and demonstrate virologic suppression (defined as having a plasma HIV-1
      ribonucleic acid [RNA] &lt;50 copies per milliliter [c/mL] before Week 24, with no signs of
      virologic rebound) will become eligible for the Maintenance Phase of this study.

      Maintenance Phase: The background NRTIs will be discontinued and the subjects will continue
      their randomized dose of GSK1265744 in combination with rilpivirine (RPV) 25 mg once-daily
      for an additional 72 weeks. The Maintenance phase will evaluate the ability of this two drug
      ART regimen to maintain virologic suppression through Week 48, Week 72 and Week 96. Subjects
      randomized to the EFV arm will continue on their randomized regimen through Week 96.

      After completion of the maintenance phase, subjects could enroll in the Open-Label Phase to
      continue GSK1265744 + RPV treatment as long as they continue to derive clinical benefit and
      until it is locally approved and commercially available.

    <time_frame>Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma samples were collected for quantitative analysis of HIV-1 RNA. Percentage of participants with HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL at Week 48 was determined using the MSDF algorithm based on the current US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) definition of Snapshot algorithm. This algorithm treats all participants without HIV-1 RNA data at the visit of interest (due to missing data or discontinuation of investigational product prior to visit window) as well as participants who switch their concomitant antiretroviral therapy prior to the visit of interest as non-responders. Virological response within an analysis window was determined by the last available HIV-1 RNA measurement in that window while the participant was on-treatment. MSDF response rate was calculated as number of responders in the analysis window divided by the number of participants in the analysis population. ITT-E Population comprised of all randomized participants who received at least one dose of investigational product.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With HIV-1 Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) &lt;50 Copies/Milliliter (mL) at Week 48 Using the Missing, Switch, Discontinuation Equals Failure (MSDF) Algorithm</title>
        <description>Plasma samples were collected for quantitative analysis of HIV-1 RNA. Percentage of participants with HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL at Week 48 was determined using the MSDF algorithm based on the current US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) definition of Snapshot algorithm. This algorithm treats all participants without HIV-1 RNA data at the visit of interest (due to missing data or discontinuation of investigational product prior to visit window) as well as participants who switch their concomitant antiretroviral therapy prior to the visit of interest as non-responders. Virological response within an analysis window was determined by the last available HIV-1 RNA measurement in that window while the participant was on-treatment. MSDF response rate was calculated as number of responders in the analysis window divided by the number of participants in the analysis population. ITT-E Population comprised of all randomized participants who received at least one dose of investigational product.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;400 Copies/mL Until Week 96 Using the Observed Case Analysis</title>
        <description>Plasma samples were collected for quantitative analysis of HIV-1 RNA. Percentage of participants with HIV-1 RNA &lt;400 copies/mL over time was determined using the observed case analysis, which did not impute for any missing assessments. Observed case response rate was calculated as the number of participants with a positive response at the time point where the participant is on randomized therapy divided by the number of participants in the analysis population with an assessment in the scheduled visit window during the randomized period.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 Copies/mL Over Time by Visit Using the MSDF Algorithm</title>
        <description>Plasma samples were collected for quantitative analysis of HIV-1 RNA. Percentage of participants with HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL over time was determined using the MSDF algorithm based on the current US FDA definition of the Snapshot algorithm. This algorithm treats all participants without HIV-1 RNA data at the visit of interest (due to missing data or discontinuation of investigational product prior to visit window) as well as participants who switch their concomitant antiretroviral therapy prior to the visit of interest as non-responders. Virological response within an analysis window was determined by the last available HIV-1 RNA measurement in that window while the participant was on-treatment. MSDF response rate was calculated as number of responders in the analysis window divided by the number of participants in the analysis population.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 Copies/mL Over Time by Visit Using Observed Case Analysis</title>
        <description>Plasma samples were collected for quantitative analysis of HIV-1 RNA. Percentage of participants with HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL over time was determined using the observed case analysis, which did not impute for any missing assessments. Observed case response rate was calculated as the number of participants with a positive response at the time point where the participant is on therapy divided by the number of participants in the analysis population with an assessment in the scheduled visit window during the randomized period or open-label phase.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Post-Baseline HIV-1 Associated Conditions Progression of Disease</title>
        <description>HIV-1 associated conditions were assessed according to the 1993 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Revised Classification System for HIV Infection in Adults. The clinical categories of HIV infection as per CDC system are class A=Asymptomatic HIV infection or lymphadenopathy or acute HIV infection; class B=symptomatic non-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) conditions and class C=AIDS indicator conditions. Number of participants experiencing disease progression is presented, where disease progression is defined as the progression from Baseline HIV disease status as follows: CDC class A at Baseline to CDC class C event; CDC Class B at Baseline to CDC Class C event; CDC Class C at Baseline to new CDC Class C event; and CDC class A, B or C at Baseline to death.</description>

          <description>HIV-1 associated conditions were assessed according to the 1993 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Revised Classification System for HIV Infection in Adults. The clinical categories of HIV infection as per CDC system are class A=Asymptomatic HIV infection or lymphadenopathy or acute HIV infection; class B=symptomatic non-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) conditions and class C=AIDS indicator conditions. Number of participants experiencing disease progression is presented, where disease progression is defined as the progression from Baseline HIV disease status as follows: CDC class A at Baseline to CDC class C event; CDC Class B at Baseline to CDC Class C event; CDC Class C at Baseline to new CDC Class C event; and CDC class A, B or C at Baseline to death.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Genotypic Mutations Associated With Development of Resistance</title>
        <description>Plasma samples were collected for drug resistance testing. The treatment emergent INI mutations associated with development of resistance to RAL, ELV, dolutegravir (DTG) or GSK1265744 and major resistance mutations to other classes (NRTI, NNRTI, PI) as defined by International AIDS society (IAS)-United States of America (USA) are presented. On-treatment Genotypic Resistance population comprised of all participants in the ITT-E Population with available on-treatment genotypic resistance data, excluding participants who are not protocol-defined virologic failures.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 Copies/mL at Week 16 and Week 24 Using MSDF Algorithm-Induction Phase</title>
        <description>Plasma samples were collected for quantitative analysis of HIV-1 RNA. Percentage of participants with HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL over time was determined using the MSDF algorithm based on the current US FDA definition of the Snapshot algorithm. This algorithm treats all participants without HIV-1 RNA data at the visit of interest (due to missing data or discontinuation of investigational product prior to visit window) as well as participants who switch their concomitant antiretroviral therapy prior to the visit of interest as non-responders. Virological response within an analysis window was determined by the last available HIV-1 RNA measurement in that window while the participant was on-treatment. MSDF response rate was calculated as number of responders in the analysis window divided by the number of participants in the analysis population.</description>

        <description>Plasma samples were collected for quantitative analysis of HIV-1 RNA. The end point was determined using MSDF algorithm based on the current US FDA definition of Snapshot algorithm. This algorithm treats all participants without HIV-1 RNA data at the visit of interest (due to missing data or discontinuation of investigational product prior to visit window) as well as participants who switch their concomitant antiretroviral therapy prior to the visit of interest as non-responders. Virological response within an analysis window was determined by the last available HIV-1 RNA measurement in that window while the participant was on-treatment. MSDF response rate was calculated as number of responders in the analysis window divided by the number of participants in the analysis population. ITT-Maintenance Exposed (ME) Population comprised of all participants randomized to GSK1265744 and who received at least one dose of investigational product during maintenance phase of the study.</description>

          <description>Plasma samples were collected for quantitative analysis of HIV-1 RNA. The end point was determined using MSDF algorithm based on the current US FDA definition of Snapshot algorithm. This algorithm treats all participants without HIV-1 RNA data at the visit of interest (due to missing data or discontinuation of investigational product prior to visit window) as well as participants who switch their concomitant antiretroviral therapy prior to the visit of interest as non-responders. Virological response within an analysis window was determined by the last available HIV-1 RNA measurement in that window while the participant was on-treatment. MSDF response rate was calculated as number of responders in the analysis window divided by the number of participants in the analysis population. ITT-Maintenance Exposed (ME) Population comprised of all participants randomized to GSK1265744 and who received at least one dose of investigational product during maintenance phase of the study.</description>

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: results in death; is life-threatening; requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; other medical events that may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes mentioned before; all events of possible drug-induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinemia. Maintenance Safety Population comprised of all participants randomized to GSK1265744 and who were exposed to investigational products during the maintenance phase of the study with the exception of any participants with documented evidence of not having consumed any amount of investigational product.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Maximum Treatment-emergent Clinical Chemistry Toxicities-Maintenance Phase</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of following clinical chemistry parameters: alanine aminotranferase (ALT), albumin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), carbon dioxide(CO2)/bicarbonate, cholesterol, creatine kinase (CK), creatinine, glucose, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, lipase, inorganic phosphorus, potassium, sodium, total bilirubin and triglycerides. A toxicity is considered treatment emergent if it developed or increased in intensity from Baseline while on-treatment. Laboratory toxicities were graded using the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, where Grade 1=Mild, Grade 2=moderate, Grade 3=severe and Grade 4=potentially life-threatening.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered one tablet of efavirenz 600 mg once daily along with investigator selected, fixed dose dual NRTI therapy (either ABC/3TC 600 mg/300 mg or TDF/FTC 300 mg/200 mg) from Day 1 to Week 24 during the double-blind induction phase. In the Maintenance Phase (double-blind), eligible participants continued to receive one tablet of efavirenz 600 mg in combination with ABC/3TC or TDF/FTC once daily. Participants in this arm did not enter open-label phase and were considered to have completed the study after Week 96.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Maximum Treatment-emergent Clinical Chemistry Toxicities-Maintenance Phase</title>
          <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of following clinical chemistry parameters: alanine aminotranferase (ALT), albumin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), carbon dioxide(CO2)/bicarbonate, cholesterol, creatine kinase (CK), creatinine, glucose, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, lipase, inorganic phosphorus, potassium, sodium, total bilirubin and triglycerides. A toxicity is considered treatment emergent if it developed or increased in intensity from Baseline while on-treatment. Laboratory toxicities were graded using the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, where Grade 1=Mild, Grade 2=moderate, Grade 3=severe and Grade 4=potentially life-threatening.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Maximum Treatment-emergent Hematology Toxicities-Maintenance Phase</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of following hematology parameters: Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT), hemoglobin, international normalized ratio (INR), platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), total neutrophils and white blood cell (WBC) count. A toxicity is considered treatment emergent if it developed or increased in intensity from Baseline while on-treatment. Laboratory toxicities were graded using the DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, where Grade 1=Mild, Grade 2=moderate, Grade 3=severe and Grade 4=potentially life-threatening.</description>

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: results in death; is life-threatening; requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; other medical events that may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes mentioned before; all events of possible drug-induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinemia. Safety Population comprised of all randomized participants who were exposed to investigational products with the exception of any participants with documented evidence of not having consumed any amount of investigational product.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered one tablet of efavirenz 600 mg once daily along with investigator selected, fixed dose dual NRTI therapy (either ABC/3TC 600 mg/300 mg or TDF/FTC 300 mg/200 mg) from Day 1 to Week 24 during the double-blind induction phase. In the Maintenance Phase (double-blind), eligible participants continued to receive one tablet of efavirenz 600 mg in combination with ABC/3TC or TDF/FTC once daily. Participants in this arm did not enter open-label phase and were considered to have completed the study after Week 96.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin Level Over Time by Visit</title>
          <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of hemoglobin level. Baseline value is the last pre-treatment value observed. Change from Baseline is calculated as value at indicated time point minus Baseline value.</description>
          <population>Safety Population. Participants randomized to Efavirenz 600 mg arm were considered to have completed their participation in the study after Week 96; hence were no longer followed as part of this study. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed (indicated by n=X in category titles)</population>

        <title>Number of Participants With AEs and SAEs-Induction Phase</title>
        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: results in death; is life-threatening; requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; other medical events that may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes mentioned before; all events of possible drug-induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinemia.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of following clinical chemistry parameters: ALT, albumin, ALP, AST, CO2/bicarbonate, chloride, cholesterol, CK, creatinine, glucose, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, lipase, inorganic phosphorus, potassium, sodium, total bilirubin, triglycerides and urea/blood urea nitrogen (BUN). A toxicity was considered treatment emergent if it developed or increased in intensity from Baseline while on-treatment. Laboratory toxicities were graded using the DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, where Grade 1=Mild, Grade 2=moderate, Grade 3=severe and Grade 4=potentially life-threatening.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Maximum Treatment-emergent Hematology Toxicities-Induction Phase</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of following hematology parameters: APTT, basophils, eosinophils, hematocrit, hemoglobin, INR, lymphocytes, mean corpuscle volume (MCV), monocytes, platelet count, PT, red blood cell (RBC) count, total neutrophils and WBC count. A toxicity was considered treatment emergent if it developed or increased in intensity from Baseline while on-treatment. Laboratory toxicities were graded using the DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, where Grade 1=Mild, Grade 2=moderate, Grade 3=severe and Grade 4=potentially life-threatening.</description>
