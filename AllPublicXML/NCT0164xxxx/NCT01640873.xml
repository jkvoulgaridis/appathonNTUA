    <textblock>
      This study will assess the initial safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamics of MK-8655, after single and multiple daily oral administrations to
      participants with Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM). The study will assess the reduction in fasting
      plasma glucose concentrations from baseline after multiple daily administrations of MK-8655.

    <description>An adverse event is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign including an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure, regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure, that occurs during the course of the study.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 16 (Predose)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood for fasting plasma glucose (central laboratory) was obtained after at least 10 hours overnight fast.</description>

    <measure>True Geometric Mean Plasma Concentrations of MK-8655 After Single and Multiple Drug Doses at 24 Hours Post Dose (C24)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours post dose on Days 1, 7, and 14</time_frame>
    <description>C24hr was log transformed and analyzed based on a linear mixed effects model containing fixed effects for treatment, day and treatment by day interaction and a random effect for the participant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>24-Hour Weighted Mean Glucose (WMG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15: Predose, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 21, 23 hours post-dose.</time_frame>
    <description>The WMG provides an integrated assessment of the glycemic exposure over the 24-hour period. To reduce variability of the baseline (before any study drug administration) WMG, participants were domiciled in the test facility at least 36 hours prior to Day 1, where standard meals were provided, and physical activity was monitored. The WMG was derived from multiple glucose values collected during both fasting and post-meal periods. The sample scheme for the 18 point glucose measurements used in this study had many samples taken in the very early morning hours, as well as the first three hours after meals. WMG was calculated as the area under the curve (AUC) of the glucose concentrations divided by the duration of time of samples collected.</description>

        <title>24-Hour Weighted Mean Glucose (WMG)</title>
        <description>The WMG provides an integrated assessment of the glycemic exposure over the 24-hour period. To reduce variability of the baseline (before any study drug administration) WMG, participants were domiciled in the test facility at least 36 hours prior to Day 1, where standard meals were provided, and physical activity was monitored. The WMG was derived from multiple glucose values collected during both fasting and post-meal periods. The sample scheme for the 18 point glucose measurements used in this study had many samples taken in the very early morning hours, as well as the first three hours after meals. WMG was calculated as the area under the curve (AUC) of the glucose concentrations divided by the duration of time of samples collected.</description>
