  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, progressive, and life-threatening disease.
      In many patients, the course of PAH is a steady deterioration and reduced life expectancy.

      Sildenafil was approved by the European Commission for the treatment of PAH in pediatric
      patients in May 2011, making it the first agent to be approved for the treatment of children
      with PAH. The approval was based on the largest placebo-controlled study to be conducted in
      this population. The recommended dose in pediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old is 10
      mg TID in patients ≤ 20 kg and 20 mg TID for patients &gt; 20 kg. Higher doses are not
      recommended in pediatrics patients.

      This study is an open-label, multi-center study to investigate safety, efficacy and
      pharmacokinetics of sildenafil citrate in Japanese pediatric patients with PAH.

        <description>BP measurement is recorded as supine and sitting systolic and diastolic systemic blood pressure: 1) Systolic blood pressure when heart is contracting and it is the maximum arterial pressure during contraction of left ventricle. 2) Diastolic BP when heart is relaxing and it is the minimum arterial pressure during relaxation and dilation of ventricles. Only those categories in which at least 1 participant had data were reported.</description>

Participants with &lt;= 20 kg of body weight received 10 mg dose, thrice daily as powder for oral suspension and participants with &gt; 20 kg of body weight received 20 mg dose, thrice daily as film-coated tablets.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Right Atrial Pressure (RAP) at Week 16</title>
        <description>RAP is the blood pressure in the right atrium of the heart. It reflects the amount of blood returning to the heart and the ability of the heart to pump the blood into the arterial system. RAP was measured using a pressure transducer positioned at the mid-axillary line with the participant in the supine position.</description>
