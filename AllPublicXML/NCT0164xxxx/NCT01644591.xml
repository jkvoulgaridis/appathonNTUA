  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well stereotactic radiosurgery works in treating patients
      with melanoma that has spread to more than 3 places in the brain. Stereotactic radiosurgery
      is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers a single, high dose of radiation directly to
      the tumor and may cause less damage to normal tissue.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine local control of brain metastases at 4 months after initial treatment with
      stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in patients with &gt; 3 melanoma brain metastases (MBM).

      II. To determine cognitive decline at 4 months defined as a significant decline (&gt;= 5 point
      decrease from baseline based on the reliable change index) in the Hopkins Verbal Learning
      Test-Revised (HVLT-R) Total Recall after initial treatment with SRS versus whole brain
      radiation therapy (WBRT) in patients with &gt; 3 MBMs.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine local tumor control and distal tumor control in the brain at 1, 4, 6, 9 and
      12 months post-treatment.

      II. To determine overall survival in treated patients. III. To assess the pattern of
      neurocognitive change in memory at 1, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months post-treatment as well as
      executive function, attention, processing speed and upper extremity fine motor dexterity.

      IV. To evaluate composite neurocognitive function scores in treated patients. V. To assess
      the pre-treatment factors of age, Karnofsky performance scale (KPS), extra-cranial disease,
      BRAF-V600E mutation status in the predictive determination of local and distal control and
      neurocognitive outcome in each treatment arm.

      VI. To assess the correlation between number of lesions and total volume of intracranial
      disease and neurocognitive outcome in each treatment arm.

      VII. To document post-treatment adverse side effects in treated patients. VIII. Evaluate the
      time to initiation of systemic therapy from completion of radiation treatment.

      IX. Evaluate the duration/number of cycles of systemic chemotherapy given following radiation
      treatment.

      CORRELATIVE STUDIES:

      I. To determine if apolipoprotein E (Apo E) (i.e., Apo E2, Apo E3, and Apo E4) genotyping may
      prove to be a predictor of radiation induced neurocognitive decline (or neuro-protection).

      II. To determine if inflammatory markers (i.e., IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha) may prove to be
      predictors of radiation induced neurocognitive decline.

      III. To determine if hormone and growth factors (i.e., glucocorticoids [e.g., cortisol],
      gonadal steroids [e.g., estradiol, testosterone, progesterone], growth hormone, human
      chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), insulin-like growth factor-1 [IGF-1], and neuronal growth
      factor [NGF]) may prove to be a predictor of radiation induced neurocognitive decline.

      IV. To assess whether baseline and post-radiation fludeoxyglucose F-18 (FDG)-positron
      emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scans can predict for neurocognitive
      decline.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo SRS on day 1.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 months.

    <description>Time to local failure will be estimated using the product-limit estimator of Kaplan and Meier, and log-rank test will be used for comparison of local failure rate in patients treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to null hypothesis with respect to the time to local failure. Patients who are lost to follow-up or who die from distant disease before having local failure will be censored. Local control rates at 4 months may be estimated with 95% confidence intervals using Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

    <description>The baseline Listening Vocabulary Levels Test-Revised (HVLT-R) score will be compared to the HVLT-R score in patients surviving 4 months. Preservation of function is defined as improvement of HVLT-R score or decline by 4 points or less. Failure is defined as decline by 5 or more points. Time to neurocognitive decline will be estimated using the product-limit estimator of Kaplan and Meier, and log-rank test will be used for comparison of neurocognitive decline rate in patients treated with SRS to null hypothesis with respect to the time to neurocognitive decline. Patients who are lost to follow-up or who die before having neurocognitive decline will be censored. Rates of neurocognitive decline at 4 months may be estimated with 95% confidence intervals using Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will be estimated using the product-limit estimator of Kaplan and Meier. Cox proportional hazards regression will be used to model overall survival as a function of age, Karnofsky performance status, extra-cranial disease, and BRAF mutation status. Will model time to local failure, time to distal failure, and time to neurocognitive decline using competing risk regression when death without events is considered as a competing risk.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neurocognitive function score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will use descriptive statistics and boxplots to summarize and illustrate the neurocognitive function score at each assessment time. Will similarly summarize and illustrate the change from baseline in neurocognitive function score. Will also fit the neurocognitive data with a general linear model including the baseline score as covariates to assess differences in neurocognitive scores over time (to 4 months) for those patients that are alive and progression-free at 4 months. We will also model the data with mixed effects regression including baseline HVLT-R, time, number of lesions, extra-cranial disease, and a patient specific random effect. Will use logistic regression methods to model the logit of the probability of neurocognitive decline as function of ApoE (i.e., Apo E2, Apo E3, Apo E4) genotyping, inflammatory markers, hormone growth factors.</description>
