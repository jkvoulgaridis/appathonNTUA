  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the use of a single-use negative pressure wound
      therapy system (NPWT) will have an effect on the reduction of post-surgical incision healing
      complications following breast reduction surgery and to assess the medium-term aesthetic
      appearance and quality of the resultant scar, compared with standard of care dressings.

    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to assess the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the
      Single-Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) system (PICO) with regard to the reduction
      of postsurgical incision healing complications during the immediate postoperative treatment
      phase, and to assess the medium-term aesthetic appearance and quality of the resultant scar,
      in patients undergoing reduction mammoplasty, compared to standard care.

    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing Incision Healing Complications up to Day 21 Postoperatively</measure>
    <time_frame>21 days postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>The primary variable of whether or not the incision developed a healing complication within 21 days of surgery was defined as the presence of at least one of the following:
Infection (superficial or deep),
Dehiscence (partial, superficial or deep),
Delayed healing (defined as incision not closed within 7 days of the first surgical procedure).
All participants received both PICO and standard care dressings simultaneously during the course of the study; randomized to either right breast for PICO and left breast for standard of care OR right breast standard of care and left breast PICO.</description>

    <measure>Aesthetic Appearance (Cosmesis) and Scar Quality at 90 Days Postoperatively</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) between postsurgical incisions treated with PICO compared with standard care dressings.
VAS score: Assessed for color, appearance, contour, distortion, and texture. Each score ranged from 5 to 18; 5 being 'excellent' and 18 being 'poor.' Also, a global scar score was included in the total score.
POSAS score: Scored in 2 parts which added to create a total score, observer score and patient score. The lowest score of 1 showed 'normal' skin and the highest score of 10 showed the 'worst imaginable' result.
Observer score = 6 categories (vascularity, pigmentation, thickness, relief, pliability, and surface area) each given a score of 1-10.
Patient score = 6 categories (scar pain, itching, color, stiffness, thickness, and irregularity each given a score of 1-10.
All participants received both PICO and standard care dressings simultaneously during the course of the study.</description>

    <time_frame>21 days postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>The nipple and areola areas were not covered by the PICO or standard care dressing as part of the evaluation, they were all dressed the same with Steri-strips and dry gauze pads, which was essentially the standard care dressing regime.
All participants received both PICO and standard care dressings simultaneously during the course of the study; randomized to either right breast for PICO and left breast for standard of care OR right breast standard of care and left breast PICO.</description>

        <title>Aesthetic Appearance (Cosmesis) and Scar Quality at 90 Days Postoperatively</title>
        <description>Assessment of the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) between postsurgical incisions treated with PICO compared with standard care dressings.
VAS score: Assessed for color, appearance, contour, distortion, and texture. Each score ranged from 5 to 18; 5 being 'excellent' and 18 being 'poor.' Also, a global scar score was included in the total score.
POSAS score: Scored in 2 parts which added to create a total score, observer score and patient score. The lowest score of 1 showed 'normal' skin and the highest score of 10 showed the 'worst imaginable' result.
Observer score = 6 categories (vascularity, pigmentation, thickness, relief, pliability, and surface area) each given a score of 1-10.
Patient score = 6 categories (scar pain, itching, color, stiffness, thickness, and irregularity each given a score of 1-10.
All participants received both PICO and standard care dressings simultaneously during the course of the study.</description>

          <description>Assessment of the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) between postsurgical incisions treated with PICO compared with standard care dressings.
VAS score: Assessed for color, appearance, contour, distortion, and texture. Each score ranged from 5 to 18; 5 being 'excellent' and 18 being 'poor.' Also, a global scar score was included in the total score.
POSAS score: Scored in 2 parts which added to create a total score, observer score and patient score. The lowest score of 1 showed 'normal' skin and the highest score of 10 showed the 'worst imaginable' result.
Observer score = 6 categories (vascularity, pigmentation, thickness, relief, pliability, and surface area) each given a score of 1-10.
Patient score = 6 categories (scar pain, itching, color, stiffness, thickness, and irregularity each given a score of 1-10.
All participants received both PICO and standard care dressings simultaneously during the course of the study.</description>
