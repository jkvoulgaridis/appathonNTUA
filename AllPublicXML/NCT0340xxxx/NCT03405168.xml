      This is a phase II,single center,prospective, single arm clinical trial. A lot of in vitro
      and in vivo study demonstrate that quinolones antibiotics can increase anti-tumor effect. The
      objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of routine therapy plus moxifloxacin in
      Advanced Breast Cancer whose evaluation is stable disease with a trend of progression.
