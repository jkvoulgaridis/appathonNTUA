  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, participants with advanced melanoma will be treated with pembrolizumab
      (MK-3475) and their tumors and blood will be analyzed for changes related to pembrolizumab
      therapy.

      The primary hypotheses are that participants who respond to pembrolizumab have:

        1. a higher fraction of cytotoxic tumor-infiltrating T-lymphocytes (FCT) at baseline
           compared to those who do not respond to pembrolizumab

        2. a higher fold-increase in FCT compared to baseline than those who do not respond to
           pembrolizumab

        3. a higher Average Specific Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte Frequency Ratio (ASCTFR) compared to
           those who do not respond to pembrolizumab

      <restrictive_agreement>The Sponsor will generally support publication of multicenter studies only in their entirety and not as individual site data. In this case, a coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual agreement. If publication activity is not directed by the Sponsor, the investigator agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to the Sponsor before submission. This allows the Sponsor to protect proprietary information and to provide comments.</restrictive_agreement>
