  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is one single group of participants with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who
      have not been cured by other treatments. It is the first time the drug has been used in
      humans, and will be in two parts.

      The primary purpose of the parts are:

        -  Dose Escalation: To investigate the safety and tolerability and to determine the maximum
           tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of DS-1062a

        -  Dose Expansion: To investigate the safety and tolerability of DS-1062a

      This study is expected to last approximately 4 years from the time the first participant is
      enrolled to the time the last subject is off the study. Study sites are located in both the
      United States and Japan.

      The number of treatment cycles is not fixed in this study. Participants who continue to
      benefit from the study treatment may continue, unless:

        -  they withdraw

        -  their disease gets worse

        -  they experience unacceptable side effects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dosage strength will change during the study but all participants will receive the same
      study drug. So the study is not a true 2-arm study, it is a 2-part study.

      In both parts, participants with pathologically documented unresectable advanced NSCLC who
      have been refractory to or relapsed from standard treatment or for which no standard
      treatment is available, will be enrolled. Additional solid tumors might be evaluated, if the
      study treatment demonstrates acceptable safety, tolerability and efficacy in NSCLC and/or
      triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) participants. After the primary analysis, the main
      (registered) study will be considered complete, but data will be collected from participants
      who continue receiving study drug.
