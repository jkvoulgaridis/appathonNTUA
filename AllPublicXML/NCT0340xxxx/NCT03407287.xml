  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the effects of fluid alternations, hemodynamic changes,
      mechanical ventilation, pharmacologic agents, positional changes, and comorbidities on the
      Peripheral Intravenous waveform Analysis (PIVA) signal.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intravascular volume status determination remains elusive. Standard vital sign monitoring,
      including heart rate and blood pressure, fails to detect intravascular volume depletion and
      volume overload. Likewise, invasive monitoring is fraught with risk including vascular injury
      and central line associated infections. As such, a minimally-invasive mechanism to overcome
      the barriers of standard monitoring to detect volume status derangement, would be highly
      valuable. The goal of the study is to perform a series of observational feasibility studies
      in healthy and hospitalized subjects to determine effects of fluid alternations, hemodynamic
      changes, mechanical ventilation, pharmacologic agents, positional changes, and comorbidities
      on the PIVA signal

    <description>Peripheral intravenous waveform analysis score is used to detect intravascular volume status. The scale ranges from 2-40 and is interpreted as a surrogate for pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. The normal scale range is 6-12. A PIVA score of 2 indicates a low intravascular volume and 40 indicates a high intravascular volume.</description>
