    <textblock>
      Phase 3 randomized, placebo controlled study assessing the efficacy (complete recovery from
      AKI) and safety of Reltecimod in patients with suspected or confirmed abdominal sepsis
      (planned or completed surgical (laparotomy or laparoscopy) or interventional radiologic
      procedures for control of underlying abdominal infection within 24 hours of evaluation by
      medical personnel) or patients with surgically confirmed necrotizing soft tissue infection
      (NSTI), requiring intensive care unit (ICU) or step down unit admission and in whom the
      diagnosis of Stage 2/3 acute kidney injury (AKI; as defined by Kidney Disease Improving
      Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria) is established at initial presentation for medical
      evaluation or up to 48 hours from the suspected diagnosis of abdominal sepsis or from
      surgically confirmed diagnosis of NSTI.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Has either suspected or documented diagnosis of abdominal sepsis requiring treatment
             with parenteral antibiotics and planned or completed surgical (laparotomy or
             laparoscopy) or interventional radiologic procedures within 24 hours of evaluation by
             medical personnel. Recommended surgical or interventional radiologic procedures be
             performed with 12 hours of evaluation by medical personnel.

          2. Initial diagnosis of AKI Stage 2 or 3 according to KDIGO AKI criteria established
             either upon presentation to medical care in those patients with suspected abdominal
             sepsis or in those patients in whom the initial diagnosis of AKI is established during
             the 48 hour period from the suspected diagnosis of abdominal sepsis.

          3. Study medication must be administered within 6 hours of confirmation of onset of Stage
             2 or 3 AKI as established at the study site, under the following criteria:

                  surgical or interventional radiology procedure for the abdominal infection OR

               -  Primary or acquired immunodeficiency or immunosuppression due to treatment with
                  immunosuppressive medications

               -  Known HIV infection with CD4 count &lt; 200 cells/mm3 or &lt; 14% of all lymphocytes

               -  Neutropenia &lt; 1,000 cells/mm3 not due to the underlying infection

               -  Receiving or about to receive chemotherapy or biologic anti-cancer treatment,
