  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this protocol is to refine the accuracy of proton beam therapy (PT) by the use of
      dual energy computed tomography (DECT), in conjunction with novel iterative image
      reconstruction algorithms, to more precisely determine the tissue properties through which
      the proton beam path travels.

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients enrolling in this study will undergo additional sequential DECT scans in addition to their routine single-energy computed tomography (SECT) or DECT scans
In Arm A, patients are treated with treatment plans optimized and calculated on the SECT data. Plan dose is re-calculated for every patient with the clinical plan in a Monte Carlo dose calculation engine for better accuracy. The investigators will use TOPAS, an extension of Geant4 simulation toolkit, as the dose calculation engine.
An additional 2 or 3 sequential scans of the thorax or head-and-neck/brain scan settings will be acquired ranging from 70-140 kVp (with or without additional filter) prior to initiating proton therapy or early in their course and up to 2nd week of treatment. Additionally at approximately 4 weeks after initiating therapy as well as at conclusion of therapy
Scans can be performed on the Phillips or Siemens scanners</description>

    <description>Patients enrolling in this study will undergo additional sequential DECT scans in addition to their routine SECT or DECT scans
In Arm B1, DECT data is used to estimate the actual dose delivered using the clinical plan based on SECT data.

    <description>Patients enrolling in this study will undergo additional sequential DECT scans in addition to their routine SECT or DECT scans
In Arm B2, the plan is re-optimized on DECT data with the conventional uncertainty margin of 3.5% of proton range.
An additional 2 or 3 sequential scans of the thorax or head-and-neck/brain scan settings will be acquired ranging from 70-140 kVp (with or without additional filter) prior to initiating proton therapy or early in their course and up to 2nd week of treatment.

In Arm B3, the plan is re-optimized on DECT data with the SPR uncertainties derived from the patient-specific uncertainty model developed.

    <description>In addition to acquiring medically-routine datasets, each patient subject will be scanned sequentially at two or three different beam energies (80 or 90 kVp, 100 kVp, 120 kVp, and 140 kVp) as part of this research study. These additional scans will be acquired utilizing the FDA-approved workflow and scanner operating modes. Sinogram data will be exported in raw, minimally processed form utilizing proprietary data export and processing tools provided to the investigators by the scanner vendors. In no case, will the additional local imaging dose (in terms of CTDIvol) given to the patients by the two or three additional scans exceed 6 cGy per session</description>
