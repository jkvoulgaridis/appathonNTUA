  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this pilot study is to explore the feasibility of cyclic vibration (CV)
      of the lower extremity muscles to improve walking in individuals with gait deficits from
      multiple sclerosis (MS).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is designed to test the efficacy and safety of vibration at correcting the
      typical gait deficits that involve strength and coordination of multiple joints (hip, knee
      and ankle) in pre- and early swing phases of the gait cycle.

      Aim 1: Develop a real-time control algorithm, timed by sensor detected gait events, to
      provide vibration emulating electromyographic (EMG) activity of target muscles during normal
      gait and verify its functionality in an able-body volunteer. Further, recruit 12 subjects (6
      for CV and 6 controls) with gait deficits at the hip, knee and ankle from MS. Impose
      vibration during the gait cycle so that it emulates muscle activity pattern of normal gait.
      Perform baseline quantitative gait analyses to determine the spatio-temporal parameters,
      foot-to-floor clearance, kinematics, kinetics and patterns of EMG activity during walking
      with and without vibration in treatment group and without vibration in control group.

      Aim 2: Implement 12 sessions (3/week for a month) of gait training with cyclic vibration
      emulating normal muscle activity of lower extremities in treatment group and gait training
      without vibration in control group and repeat baseline gait assessment to test the following
      hypotheses.

      Hypothesis 1. Vibration of hip, knee and ankle muscles improves walking speed and
      foot-to-floor clearance through increased hip and knee pre-swing flexion and improved
      hip-knee coordination.

      Hypothesis 2. Gait training with cyclic muscle vibration induces carryover effects that
      maintain improved walking after vibration is discontinued.

      Hypothesis 3. Muscle vibration produces no untoward sensations or adverse physiological
      responses.

          <description>Test feasibility of muscle vibration of tibialis anterior, rectus femoris, short head of biceps and tensor fasciae latae bilaterally during walking for 1 hour 3 times per week for 12 weeks to improve walking speed through improved coordination of hip, knee and ankle flexion.
Muscle vibration during walking: Baseline assessment of gait followed by 12 sessions (3/week for a month) of gait training with cyclic muscle vibration during walking emulating normal muscle activity of lower extremities and repeat gait assessment after gait training.</description>
