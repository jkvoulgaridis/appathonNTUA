      A Controlled Trial to Assess the Lot-to-lot Consistency of Sci-B-Vac™ in Adults

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to verify that the manufacturing equivalence of
      Sci-B-Vac™ is consistent and to compare the immunogenicity and safety of a three-dose regimen
      of Sci-B-Vac™ to a three-dose regimen of Engerix-B® in adults.
