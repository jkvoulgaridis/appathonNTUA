      Purpose To determine the relationship between maternal lifestyle and obstetric and neonatal
      outcomes.

      Methods and analysis This is a multicentre, prospective, cohort study including more than
      5000 participants in 24 hospitals in 12 provinces from July 2017 to July 2018 in China.
      Maternal lifestyle (environmental exposures, diet, physical activity, sleeping, psychology
      and economics) and metabolic status will be collected by the electronic self-administered
      questionnaire at the first, second and third trimesters and 42 days postpartum, respectively.
      Obstetric and neonatal outcomes and metabolic status recorded by a clinical research
      coordinator. Descriptive statistics will be used to investigate the outcomes of maternal and
      newborn across China. Logistical regression and covariance analysis will be used to determine
      the relationship between maternal lifestyle and obstetric and neonatal outcomes. SAS
      statistical software will be used for data analysis.

      Ethics and dissemination Permission for the study was obtained from Chinese Academy of
      Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College. Ethics approval was obtained from the
      Ethics Review Committee at Department of Scientific Research, Peking Union Medical College
      Hospital, Beijing, China. The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals or
      disseminated through conference presentations.

    <description>This cohort study only set up a group. We will follow up and observe the pregnant women's lifestyle during pregnancy in order to find the risk factors of adverse pregnancy outcomes. We will divide the participants into more than one group according to the variables（e.g. age, smoking status, drinking status, sleep pattern .etc.）</description>

        More than 5000 pregnant women will be recruited from July 2017 to July 2018 during their
        routine antenatal check at the first trimester. Maternal lifestyle (environmental exposure,
        diet, nutrient, physical activity, sleep quality, psychology and economics) are collected
        by electronic self-administered questionnaire at the first, second, third and 42 days
        postpartum. A clinical research coordinator will record the metabolic status (pre-pregnancy
        BMI and GWG) and obstetric and neonatal outcomes will be recorded.
