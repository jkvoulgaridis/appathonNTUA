    <time_frame>From start of study drug administration up to follow-up (up to 115 days)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participants administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. TEAEs are defined as AEs with onset at the time of or following the first exposure to study drug, or medical conditions present prior to the start of study drug but increasing in severity or relationship at the time of or following the start of treatment, up to the last follow-up visit. Severity of an AE is determined by following definitions: Mild: An event that does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living; Moderate: An event that interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research participants; Severe: An AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) Based on Severity, Seriousness and Causality</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participants administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. TEAEs are defined as AEs with onset at the time of or following the first exposure to study drug, or medical conditions present prior to the start of study drug but increasing in severity or relationship at the time of or following the start of treatment, up to the last follow-up visit. Severity of an AE is determined by following definitions: Mild: An event that does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living; Moderate: An event that interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research participants; Severe: An AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.</description>
