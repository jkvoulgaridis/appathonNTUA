    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy has played an important role in improving patient outcomes in oncology and is a
      cornerstone of therapy for most patients with cancer. Of the adverse effects, none is more
      feared than chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV).

      Nausea and vomiting can adversely affect patients' quality of life and make it difficult for
      them to perform their activities of daily living. Uncontrolled CINV can give rise to medical
      complications, including poor nutrition, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and physical
      and mental deterioration.The introduction and development of antiemetic drugs have
      significantly improved the ability of clinicians to control CINV. The mainstays of antiemetic
      therapy include serotonin (5-HT3) receptor antagonists (RAs) and neurokinin 1 (NK-1) RAs.
      Researchers and patients are seeking additional methods of controlling CINV, such as non-drug
      therapies. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a relatively simple technique
      requiring only a few parts.
