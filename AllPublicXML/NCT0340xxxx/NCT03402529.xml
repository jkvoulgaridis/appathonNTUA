      Introduction: To avoid unnecessary mastectomies and reoperations a correct size assessment of
      malignant lesions in breast is required. Sometimes a supplementary MRI is therefore
      recommended. However, at our unit MRI is not easily available. Contrast enhanced spectral
      mammography (CESM) has in smaller studies been shown to be equal to MRI regarding sensitivity
      and specificity. Size assessment using contrast-based modalities as CESM has also been shown
      to be significantly more accurate than using mammography. Prospective randomized studies
      using CESM are lacking.

      Aim: The aim of the study is to evaluate the added value of CESM in diagnostics of breast
      cancer and choice of operation; partial mastectomy or mastectomy.

      A pilot study of 50 patients will be conducted to prepare for a larger prospective randomized
      study.

      Method: Patients found with breast cancer after diagnostics with mammography, ultrasound and
      core biopsy, and whom are recommended primary surgery, will be enrolled in the study. A
      supplementary examination with CESM will be performed. Preoperative extent of the malignant
      lesions are estimated with each modality and is later compared with the extent measured in
      post-operative PAD. Data on weight, length, age at menopaus, use of contraceptive pills, HRT
      or endocrine therapy, breast volume and density is collected, as well as data of diagnosis
      (ductal or lobular carcinoma), surrounding DCIS, histological grade, ER, PgR, Her2 expression
      and Ki67 index.

      In this pilot study sensitivity and specificity for each modality is calculated. Multivariate
      analysis will be performed regarding influential factors. Pearson correlation coefficient
      will be calculated for each modality regarding size assessment of the malignant lesions in
      comparison with definitive PAD.
