  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants to the study will be assigned to 5 cohorts according to the stage of disease and
      planned antitumor treatment at time of study entry.

      In all patients, 12 ml of blood sample will be collected in EDTA tube for analysis of
      biological biomarkers in different time points.

      Participants to the study will be assigned to 5 cohorts according to the stage of disease and
      planned antitumor treatment at time of study entry.

      Group 0 (set-up): blood sampling and rectal swab will be collected at a single time-point
      during the PC treatment. No follow-up is required.

      Group 1a (control): the first blood sampling will be performed within 4 weeks since the
      negative biopsy; subsequent samplings will be done according to a schedule comparable to that
      of Group 1 up to 1 year or evidence of tumor, whichever occurs first.

      Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3: the first blood sampling will be performed before radical
      treatment or HT start or CT start, on the basis of the planned antitumor therapy; subsequent
      sampling will be done after radical intervention at 4 weeks (only for Group 1) and then every
      3 months (or more frequently if clinically indicated), up to 3 years or evidence of tumor
      recurrence/progression (radiological or biochemical), whichever occurs first.

      At the time of recurrence/progression, patients of Group 1 could become part and could be
      followed as per Group 2, and patients of Group 2 could become part and could be followed as
      per Group 3.
