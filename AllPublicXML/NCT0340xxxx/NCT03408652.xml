    <textblock>
      Multicenter, randomized, open-label, 2-arm, parallel-group, phase III study whose goal is to
      assess the efficacy and safety profile of bone-targeted treatments (Arm A: denosumab or
      zoledronic acid) versus the control arm (Arm B: no specific treatment) in patients with bone
      metastases under targeted therapy for Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma.

    <description>&quot;Functional Assessment of cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G)&quot; questionnaire, made of 27 items measuring the respondents' health state, each of which is answered using a five-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Questions are phrased so that higher numbers indicate a better health state. Subscale scores are added to obtain total score.</description>

    <description>&quot;EuroQoL 5 Dimensions 5 Levels&quot; questionnaire is a scale used in the health state description. Each items is a three-level scale : having no problems, having some or moderate problems, being unable to do/having extreme problems.The respondents are asked to choose one of the statements which best describes their health status of surveyed day. Rated level can be coded as a number 1, 2, or 3, which indicates having no problems for 1, having some problems for 2, and having extreme problems for 3. As a result, a person's health status can be defined by a 5-digit number, ranging from 11111 (having no problems in all dimensions) to 33333 (having extreme problems in all dimensions).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Histologically proven mRCC.

          -  Administration of one of the systemic agents in use for the treatment of mRCC (no more
             than three prior systemic therapy regimens). Patients with at least 6 months of 1st
             line treatment and a bone event may be included.

          -  More than 1 bone metastasis.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) ≤ 2.

          -  Adequate renal function (serum creatinine ≤ 200 mmol/L or creatinine clearance ≥ 30
             mL/min according to Cockroft formula or MDRD formula for patients older than 65
             years).

          -  Covered by a medical insurance.

          -  Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory
             tests, and other study procedures.

             used and are not at higher risk).

          -  Anticancer treatment under investigation.

          -  Paraneoplastic hypercalcemia (corrected total calcium &gt; 2.7 mmol/L).

          -  Grade 4 toxicity under previous targeted agents.

          -  Liver failure (AST and/or ALT ≥ 5.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or total bilirubin
             beyond normal limits).

          -  Severe hypocalcaemia &gt; 2.8 mmol/l.

          -  Fructose intolerance.

          -  Invasive dental procedure (i.e. tooth extraction, dental implants, oral surgery)
             within the 10 days prior to randomization or required dental procedures at the
             pre-inclusion dental examination.

          -  Psychological, familial, sociological, geographical conditions that would limit
             compliance with study protocol requirements.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding woman. Females of child-bearing potential must have a

          -  Life expectancy ≤ 3 months.

          -  Participation to another clinical trial that might interfere with the evaluation of
             the main criterion.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients of
             bisphosphonate or denosumab.
