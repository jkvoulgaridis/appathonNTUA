  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, prospective, non-randomized, non-controlled clinical outcome
      study. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate improvement of pain score at one
      year for the Biomet Comprehensive Reverse Shoulder. The secondary objective is collection of
      long term clinical outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Biomet Comprehensive Reverse Shoulder was developed to provide an additional surgical
      option for patients anatomically and structurally suited to receive a reverse shoulder
      arthroplasty. The aim of the Biomet Comprehensive Reverse Shoulder is to increase shoulder
      function while reducing pain.

      A total of 3 sites will be involved in this study. Having three clinical sites will allow for
      multiple investigators to contribute to the results of the study. 175 implants will be
      included into the study. All potential study subjects will be required to participate in the
      Informed Consent Process.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Score is assessed for each subject by asking them to indicate their current level of pain based on a 5 level scale, with &quot;None&quot; as the best outcome and &quot;Severe&quot; as the worst. Improvement of pain score at one year from pre-operative levels will be assessed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Constant Shoulder Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-operative, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 7 years, 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Constant-Murley Shoulder Score is a scoring method used by clinicians to assess function of the shoulder. The score is on a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 being no shoulder function and 100 being excellent function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Presence of Scapular Notching</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 7 years, 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>All radiographic images collected during the study are assessed by the Principal Investigator for the presence of scapular notching. The severity of notching will be assessed using the Nerot system, where Grade 0 indicates no notch and Grade 4 indicates the largest-sized defect in the scapula.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Biomet® Comprehensive™ Reverse Shoulder products are indicated for use in patients
             whose shoulder joint has a grossly deficient rotator cuff with severe arthropathy
             and/or previously failed shoulder joint replacement with a grossly deficient rotator
             cuff.

          -  The patient must be anatomically and structurally suited to receive the implants and a
             functional deltoid muscle is necessary.

          -  The Comprehensive® Reverse Shoulder is indicated for primary, fracture, or revision
             total shoulder replacement for the relief of pain and significant disability due to
             gross rotator cuff deficiency.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Absolute contraindications include infection, sepsis, and osteomyelitis.

          -  Uncooperative patient or patient with neurologic disorders who is incapable or
             unwilling to follow directions.

          -  Osteoporosis.

          -  Metabolic disorders which may impair bone formation.

          -  Osteomalacia.

          -  Distant foci of infections which may spread to the implant site.

          -  Rapid joint destruction, marked bone loss or bone resorption apparent on
             roentgenogram.
