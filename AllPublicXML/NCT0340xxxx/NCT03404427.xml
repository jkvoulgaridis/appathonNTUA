  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator showed that a night of sleep deprivation halved the duration of an
      inspiratory endurance test and that this loss of endurance could be secondary to a lack of
      activation of the pre-motor cortex. However, the inspiratory endurance test is associated
      with a feeling of dyspnea that could lead to premature arrest, and the inspiratory drive is
      complex, both automatic and voluntary. The investigator can reproduce this results on a
      simpler drive.

      During the execution of an exercise involving repeated contractions of the hand it is
      possible to record the activation of the pre-motor cortex corresponding to the phase of
      preparation of the movement. The amplitude of these premotor potentials is proportional to
      the developed motive force.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of sleep deprivation on the muscular
      endurance of non-dominant in healthy subjects.

      Hypothesis: Sleep deprivation causes a decrease in manual motor endurance by decreasing
      cortical pre-motor control.

      Main objective: To compare the motor endurance of healthy subjects after a night's sleep and
      after a sleepless night.

      Secondary objective: To compare the amplitude of premature cortical control at the beginning
      of the endurance test after a night's sleep and after a sleepless night.
