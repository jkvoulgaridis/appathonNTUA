    <textblock>
      The trial is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety profiles of the single-dose of
      zoliflodacin in eight healthy male or female subjects ages 18 to 45 years inclusive. All
      subjects will be dosed in the morning of Day 1 in a staggered fashion with a minimum of
      several minutes apart. Each subject will receive a single 4g dose of zoliflodacin (2 x 2 g
      sachets of zoliflodacin) after at least an 8-h fast, which will continue for at least 4 h
      after dosing. Consumption of water will be permitted during the fasting period. Subjects will
      be monitored as inpatients in the Clinical Trial Unit (CTU) up to Day 4 and at the Final
      Visit (Day 8 ± 2). Study duration is approximately 4 weeks with subject participation
      duration up to 10 days (from dosing to final visit). The primary objective of this study is
      to evaluate the plasma PK of zoliflodacin after administration of a single 4-g oral dose
      under fasting conditions.

    <textblock>
      The trial will be performed as an open-label, non-randomized, single-dose design in eight
      healthy male or female subjects ages 18 to 45 years inclusive to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics and safety profiles of the zoliflodacin formulation. All subjects will be
      dosed in the morning of Day 1 in a staggered fashion with a minimum of several minutes apart.
      Each subject will receive a single 4g dose of zoliflodacin (2 x 2 g sachets of zoliflodacin)
      after at least an 8-h fast, which will continue for at least 4 h after dosing. Consumption of
      water will be permitted during the fasting period. Subjects will be monitored as inpatients
      in the Clinical Trial Unit (CTU) up to Day 4 and at the Final Visit (Day 8 ± 2). Study
      duration is approximately 4 weeks with subject participation duration up to 10 days (from
      dosing to final visit). The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the plasma PK of
      zoliflodacin after administration of a single 4-g oral dose under fasting conditions. The
      secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single 4-g oral dose of
      zoliflodacin.
