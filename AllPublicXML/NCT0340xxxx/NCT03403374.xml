  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To describe the safety and tolerability of Repatha in subjects with homozygous familial
      hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) in India. All subjects will receive Repatha over an 8 week
      period.

    <textblock>
      An open-label, multicentre, phase 4 study to describe the safety and tolerability of Repatha
      in 30 Indian subjects with HoFH. Subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and
      laboratory assessments at screening will be enrolled and will be required to maintain their
      current lipid-lowering drug therapy throughout the duration of the trial. Subjects will
      receive Repatha 420 mg QM SC and study visits will occur approximately every 4 weeks.
      Apheresis subjects will receive Repatha 420 mg SC every 2 weeks to correspond with their
      apheresis schedule. Final administration of Repatha (for all subjects) will occur at week 8.
      The end of study (EOS) visit will occur at week 12 for all subjects.

In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors, and if not approved, may be further arbitrated by a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.
