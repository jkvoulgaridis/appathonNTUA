  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are to test a manualized mind body skills-building program aimed at
      preventing the development of chronic pain and disability following acute musculoskeletal
      injury in at-risk patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomized feasibility trial of the mind body program Toolkit for Optimal
      Recovery versus usual medical care. The Toolkit is delivered via secure live video to
      patients at risk for chronic pain, at 1-2 months after injury. The primary aim of this study
      is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of the program, randomization, procedures
      and outcome measures. Secondarily, we report means and standard deviation and explore change
      in quantitative outcomes in the Toolkit compared to usual care.

    <description>The Toolkit for Optimal Recovery after Injury (ToR) is a skills based mind body program that was designed to prevent the development of chronic pain and disability following an acute musculoskeletal injury (e.g., fracture). The program has 4 sessions and it is delivered via live video. Patients learn myth about recovery after injury, false and real pain alarms, the fear avoidance model and how to prevent the disability spiral, mindfulness based exercises and activity pacing.</description>
