  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this pilot study are to evaluate the feasibility and safety of
      intramyocardial injection of autologous c-kit+ cells during the Bidirectional Cavopulmonary
      Anastomosis (BDCPA/GLENN) Procedure and to observe effects on clinical outcome including
      right ventricular myocardial function, severity of tricuspid regurgitation, incidence of
      serious adverse events, hospitalizations for heart failure, changes in health status from
      baseline, the need for transplantation, or mortality.

    <description>Safety will be reported as the number of incidence of treatment related major adverse cardiac events (MACE). MACE is defined as any of the following: greater than 30 seconds of sustained/symptomatic ventricular tachycardia requiring intervention, cardiogenic shock, unplanned cardiovascular operation due to injection site bleeding, need for new permanent pacemaker, stroke or embolic event to the brain determined by CT scan and death. MACE will be evaluated by the treating physician and assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.</description>
