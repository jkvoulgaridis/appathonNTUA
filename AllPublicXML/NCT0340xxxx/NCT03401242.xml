  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CARBEHPAD is a multicentric randomized prevalence study aiming to assess the frequency of
      Enterobacteriaceae (ESLB) and carbapenemase producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) carriage in
      Pays de la Loire nursing homes.

      A sample of 50 nursing homes (NH) in Pays de la Loire will be randomly selected for
      inclusion, and a sample of 1/3 of residents of these NH will be screened for ESBL and/or CPE
      fecal carriage. Epidemiological data on each resident will be collected to identify risk
      factors for such carriage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Pays de la Loire region is impacted by 2 main CPE outbreaks in the 2 major university
      hospitals in this region. A sample of 50 nursing homes (NH) in Pays de la Loire region
      (France) will be randomly selected for inclusion in CARBEHPAD study. NH directors will be
      contacted for agreement for inclusion in CARBEHPAD study. In each of the included NH, a
      sample of one third of residents will be randomly selected for inclusion. Upon agreement,
      each resident included will be screened through endorectal swabbing for ESBL and/or CPE
      carriage.

      Epidemiological data will be collected for each resident regarding demographic data, risk
      factors for ESBL and/or CPE carriage, comorbidities. These data collected in the NH will be
      completed with data collection from national NH database regarding: previous hospitalization,
      treatments (including antibiotics), surgery.

      Data on infection control and prevention will be collected in each NH to assess cross
      transmission of resistant bacteria in these settings.

      Comparison of isolated strains will be performed to assess clonal dissemination of these
      resistant Enterobacteriaceae in NH. Data regarding infection control and prevention in each
      included NH will be collected aswell.

      An ESBL/CPE carrier status has no impact on medical care in NH regarding French
      recommendations on management of such resistant microorganisms.
