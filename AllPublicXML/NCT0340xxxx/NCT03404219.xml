  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social impairment contributes to more severe symptoms, higher rates of hospitalization, and
      increased disability in persons with schizophrenia. In this study the investigators will
      develop a smartphone application and test its impact on improving real-world social
      functioning in persons with schizophrenia. Findings from this study will allow researchers
      and clinicians to better understand ways to improve social skills and social motivation, two
      common problems in the daily lives of persons with schizophrenia. The investigators hope this
      mobile phone-based support application will ultimately contribute to increased access to
      effective treatments for social functioning in this population.

      This project will involve an examination of the impact of a mobile intervention to improve
      social functioning in schizophrenia using an evidence-based treatment framework to target
      deficits in social skills and social motivation. Social impairment is a key characteristic of
      schizophrenia, present prior to onset and predictive of long-term course. The approach of the
      current project is to use Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI), administered by mobile
      phone, to integrate features from social skills training (SST; an evidence-based treatment
      for schizophrenia) with social motivation support to improve social functioning. Aim 1 of the
      project will involve iterative development of the mobile application, using expert panel
      input and conducting usability testing to inform intervention content and approach. As an
      exploratory aim, social sensing technology (e.g., GPS and automated conversation detection)
      will be implemented to test the promise of this technology in identifying and intervening in
      social isolation. In Aim 2, 30 persons with schizophrenia will use the application over a
      2-month period (data collection will occur across 2 sites). The investigators will test the
      impact of the application on social motivation (EMA reports of social anticipatory pleasure
      and presence of social interaction) across the intervention period. Investigators will also
      examine the impact on social functioning, measured with standard clinician-administered
      assessments, from baseline to 90-day follow-up. Additional clinical, neurocognitive, and
      social cognitive assessments will be gathered on study participants to identify potential
      moderators of outcome and predictors of application usability. This study will result in a
      better understanding of the feasibility and initial impact of a scalable intervention
      designed to support lasting, sustainable improvements in social functioning in schizophrenia.

    <measure>Changes in social functioning as measured by the Social Functioning Scale (SFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (study entry) and follow-up (3 months post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The Social Functioning Scale (SFS; Birchwood, Smith, Cochrane, Wetton, and Copestake, 1990) is a validated measure of social functioning commonly used in schizophrenia research studies. This clinician-administered measure consists of 7 scales: Social Engagement/Withdrawal (7 items), Interpersonal (5 items), Prosocial (5 items), Recreation (23 items), Independence - competence (15 items), Independence - performance (13 items), and Employment (13 items). The investigators will be examining the difference score between baseline (study entry) and follow-up (3 months after study termination).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (study entry) and follow-up (3 months post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The QLS - Interpersonal Relations subscale (Heinrichs, Hanlon, &amp; Carpenter, 1984) is a validated measure of social engagement used in studies of schizophrenia. This clinician-administered measure consists of 8 items that address different facets of social engagement (e.g., social network, acquaintances, intimate relationships, social withdrawal). The investigators will administer this measure at baseline (study entry) and follow-up (3 months post-intervention)</description>

    <measure>Changes in Experience-Sampling-Based Self-Reports of Social Motivation</measure>
    <time_frame>2 times per day for 2 months (intervention period).</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will ask participants to report on social motivation (i.e., enjoyment of and drive for social interaction; e.g., &quot;How much did you enjoy your recent interaction?&quot;; &quot;How motivated are you to interact with others right now?&quot;; unpublished measure) 2 times per day over the 2-month intervention period. Investigators will examine individual slopes (changes in self-reported motivation) as a secondary outcome.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        •All participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (identified either by
        self-report and confirmatory chart diagnosis, or by using the Structured Clinical Interview
        for DSM-5 [SCID-5]) will be in good general physical health, between 18 and 65 years old
        (as to not confound developmental issues with our focus), and fluent in English. Subjects
        do not need to have a significant other in order to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        •All participants with a current (past 6 months) substance use disorder, which will be
        determined by administration of the SCID-5, and self-reported current suicidal ideation
        with intent and/or a plan (assessed using attached instrument; i.e., &quot;High&quot; risk) or
        diagnosis of a neurological disorder.
