      Tubal sterilization is a widely used method of contraception. The hysteroscopic sterilization
      method (Essure®; Bayer, Germany) was approved in 2007 in France. Increasing patients reports
      of complications, such as bleeding pain, allergies, fatigue or articular pain have raised
      concerns about the safety device. Women suffering of alleged complications of the Essure®
      device ask for surgical removal. But, only few studies have assessed Essure® removal in terms
      of quality of life. This observational study contains two parts will be conducted at two
      academic tertiary care center (Montpellier - Marseille):

        -  a prospective part having received a favorable opinion from a Committee for the
           Protection of Persons,

        -  and a retrospective part having received a favorable opinion from the Institutional
           Review Board (IRB), local ethics committee

      Patients: Women requesting surgical management for removal of Essure® for alleged adverse
      effects.

      Assessment tools :

      Quality of life with the Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey questionnaire (pre-operatively
      and at 1 and 3 months) Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale (pre-operatively and 3
      months)

      Preoperative imaging, procedure characteristics, including the Essure® removal method,
      operative findings, perioperative complications, histopathologic report, and length of
      hospital stay will be collected.
