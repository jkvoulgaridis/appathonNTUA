  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Researchers want to test if certain cells can be re-programmed into stem cells. Stem cells
      can keep reproducing for a long time. Cells made by stem cells can be turned into different
      types of cells. These include cancer-fighting cells, skin cells, etc. The stem cells
      generated in this study will be used to make specific tumor-fighting cells that can recognize
      different types of mutations in cancer cells. They may also help identify new tumor mutations
      that may not have been identified yet.

      Objectives:

      To test if a certain type of tumor-fighting cells can be re-programmed into stem cells.

      Eligibility:

      Participants in another Surgery Branch protocol who are at least 16 years old

      Design:

      Participants already gave samples of blood and/or tumor tissue in the other protocol. They do
      not need to come back to the clinic or give any other samples.

      Participants will give consent for their samples to be used in this study.

      Researchers will obtain cells from the samples. They will grow those cells in the lab. They
      will create stem cells from them.

      Researchers will do genetic tests on the samples.

      Most tests will not show important health results. But if they do, the participant will be
      invited to talk to a genetic counselor and get more detailed testing to confirm the results.

      Some of the samples and results will be stored indefinitely. They may be used in future
      research. No personal information will be stored with them.

      Background:

      -T cells are potentially curative for patients with metastatic cancer, but many patients with

      cancer have T cells that are terminally differentiated , a condition associated with

      treatment failure. We have observed that less differentiated T cells have a greater

      capacity to proliferate, persist and destroy large cancer deposits. Advances in

      regenerative medicine might allow the generation of rejuvenated T cells from induced

      pluripotent stem cells (iPSC).

      Objectives:

      -To reprogram patient specimens into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and

      differentiate them into different types of somatic cells with the goal to produce cancer

      antigen-specific T cells.

      -To make stored specimens and/or data available to approved research laboratories and

      investigators.

      Eligibility:

      -Patients enrolled on the National Cancer Institute Surgery Branch (NCI-SB) Cell

      Harvestin protocol 03-C-0277 (Cell Harvest and Preparation for Surgery Branch Adoptive

      Cell Therapy Protocols).

      -Patients willing to be consented on this protocol

      Design:

        -  Cells and tissue obtained previously under protocol 03-C-2077

        -  Reprogramming of cells and tissue into iPSC lines

        -  Derivation of iPSC lines into T cells and iPSC progeny capable of supporting T cell

      differentiation

        -  Generation of an iPSC-derived thymic organoid

        -  Screening of tumor antigen specificity for regenerated T cells

        -  In vivo analysis of regenerated T cells
