  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms of intestinal nutrient sensing and signal
      relays to insulin sensitive tissues (adipose, skeletal muscle, liver) in humans. The
      investigators hypothesize that human tissue biopsies (from obese surgery and non-surgery
      subjects as well as lean controls) can be used to understand the molecular mechanisms
      underlying intestinal nutrient sensing and signal relay in humans. The investigator will
      obtain tissue specimens from patients during scheduled upper endoscopies, colonoscopies and
      scheduled metabolic and bariatric surgeries or liver transplantation. A blood sample (4mL)
      will be obtained concurrent with these procedures. From metabolic and bariatric surgery
      subjects blood and tissues (liver, adipose, small intestine, omentum, skeletal muscle) can be
      collected at the time of surgery. From liver transplantation patients, excised liver tissue
      will be collected. Stool can be obtained preoperatively and at various time points after
      surgery. Some bariatric surgery subjects will participate in a mixed-meal tolerance test at
      their pre-operative visit and several post-operative visits to compare the whole-body
      metabolic alterations following bariatric procedures.

      Upper endoscopy (subset)

        -  Intestinal biopsies will be obtained during scheduled upper endoscopy from the
           mid-duodenum and/or proximal jejunum. In the case that a patient requires an upper
           endoscopy after metabolic and bariatric surgery, biopsies will be obtained from the
           mid-jejunum.

        -  Blood will be collected from an IV placed in the arm used for administering anesthesia
           required for the indicated procedure.

      Colonoscopy (subset)

        -  Biopsies of the colon will be obtained during scheduled colonoscopy.

        -  Blood will be collected from an IV placed in the arm used for administering anesthesia
           required for the indicated procedure.

      Metabolic and bariatric surgery (subset)

        -  During the metabolic and bariatric surgical procedures, biopsy of the jejunum, liver and
           omentum (visceral adipose) may be obtained. Biopsies of skeletal muscle and subcutaneous
           adipose will be taken at the sites of trocar placement for laparotomy.

        -  Blood will be collected from an IV placed in the arm used for administering anesthesia
           required for the indicated procedure.

        -  Feces will be self-collected by the patient using a provided culture swab specimen
           container or FOB card.

      Liver transplantation (subset)

      • Tissue will be collected from excised disease liver
