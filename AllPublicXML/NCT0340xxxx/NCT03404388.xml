  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is characterized by episodic attacks in which there are sharp
      declines in physical function. Although neurorehabilitation is the most promising clinical
      strategy for motor recovery in patients with MS, treatment responsiveness and outcomes are
      mixed. This is perhaps because each individual with MS has a different capacity to improve
      with rehabilitation, and this capacity may be based on a variety of baseline factors, such as
      disease duration, motivation, cognitive status and integrity of underlying brain structures.
      A better understanding of what &quot;key ingredients&quot; facilitate relearning of motor skills during
      neurorehabilitation is critically needed. Much of the focus of rehabilitation is on
      relearning motor skills. The initial stage of learning a motor skills often requires explicit
      concentration on the details of the movement. As one becomes more proficient in the motor
      skill, it becomes less attention-demanding and more automatic. Those who can perform motor
      skills more automatically will be better able to manage the additional demands of a secondary
      task; thus, capacity for dual-task performance can be used as an index of automaticity.
      Individuals with MS experience demyelination that impacts brain areas critical for motor
      learning. However, the specific clinical and pathological variables that facilitate capacity
      for motor learning in people with MS have not been identified. Identification of such
      variables could be leveraged to determine a patient's capacity to benefit from
      neurorehabilitation at the outset and potentially to maximize motor learning during
      rehabilitation for people with MS. Thus, there is an urgent need to determine the key
      ingredients most strongly associated with successful relearning of motor skills in MS
      patients.

      Our long-term goal is to develop individualized rehabilitation for persons with MS. Our
      overall objective in this application is to identify clinical and pathological variables
      associated with successful relearning of motor skills. Our central hypothesis, based on
      preliminary data, is that the ability to learn to make new movements automatically occurs
      over a dynamic range and is a function of available cognitive processing speed and the
      integrity of corticospinal tract and superior cerebellar peduncles. We will test these
      hypotheses by recruiting 146 individuals with relapsing-remitting MS to participate in a
      mechanistic trial not designed to be a therapeutic intervention. Participants will complete
      baseline testing (including neuroimaging, cognitive testing and dual-task performance)
      followed by 4 consecutive days of training on a challenging balance task. After a 2-day
      washout period, participants will return for post-testing (including dual-task performance on
      a dual-balance and working memory task). The rationale for the proposed research is that
      identification of key ingredients associated with the capacity for motor skill acquisition
      would allow for more targeted rehabilitation programming, thereby improving patient outcomes
      and reducing health care expenses.

      At the completion of the proposed research, we expect to understand more about the capacity
      for individuals with MS to improve with motor skill training, and some of the key ingredients
      that help predict successful shift toward task automaticity, one critical component of
      successful neurorehabilitation. The results of this proposal will facilitate the development
      of predictors of motor recovery, needed to improve rehabilitation outcomes for individuals
      with MS and other neurodegenerative diseases.
