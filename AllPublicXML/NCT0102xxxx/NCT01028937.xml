      The purpose of this U.S. Clinical Trial on treatment of sighted eyes is to investigate the
      safety and effectiveness of optimal keratoplasty (Opti-K™) treatments for hyperopia
      correction using the NTK Enterprises (NTK) Opti-K System.

    <description>The NTK Optimal Keratoplasty System/Procedure is indicated for the temporary improvement of distance uncorrected visual acuity (in patient eyes that have manifest refraction, spherical equivalent equal to +1.0 to +2.5 Diopters, with less than or equal to 0.75 Diopters of refractive astigmatism (minus cylinder format) and with uncorrected distance visual acuity less than 20/40 but greater than or equal to 20/80. Patients must be at least 40 years of age with a documented stability of refraction for the prior 12 months, as demonstrated by a change of less than or equal to 0.5 Diopters in MRSE. The magnitude of D-UCVA improvement by Opti-K treatment may diminish over time, caused by some regression of effect in addition to natural progressive loss of accommodation and, for most patients, progressive hyperopic shift with increasing age.</description>

          <title>Hyperopia</title>
          <description>The NTK Optimal Keratoplasty System/Procedure is indicated for the temporary improvement of distance uncorrected visual acuity (in patient eyes that have manifest refraction, spherical equivalent equal to +1.0 to +2.5 Diopters, with less than or equal to 0.75 Diopters of refractive astigmatism (minus cylinder format) and with uncorrected distance visual acuity less than 20/40 but greater than or equal to 20/80. Patients must be at least 40 years of age with a documented stability of refraction for the prior 12 months, as demonstrated by a change of less than or equal to 0.5 Diopters in MRSE. The magnitude of D-UCVA improvement by Opti-K treatment may diminish over time, caused by some regression of effect in addition to natural progressive loss of accommodation and, for most patients, progressive hyperopic shift with increasing age.
