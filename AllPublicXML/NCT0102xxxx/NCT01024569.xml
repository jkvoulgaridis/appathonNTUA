  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the effectiveness of a standardized peer-led
      intervention to teach self-management skills in improving outcomes of individuals with a
      severe mental illness. The intervention is known as Wellness Recovery Action Planning or
      WRAP, co-developed by Dr. Mary Ellen Copeland. The focus of the inquiry is on whether and how
      developing an individualized plan for successful living: 1) lowers psychiatric symptoms; 2)
      enhances psychosocial outcomes such as self-perceived recovery, empowerment, self-advocacy,
      coping, and social support; 3) increases knowledge of personal mental illness self-management
      strategies; and 4) enhances satisfaction with the service delivery system. The study
      evaluated the following hypotheses:

      Hypothesis #1: Compared to wait-list control subjects, those who participate in the WRAP
      intervention will report reduced levels of psychiatric symptoms.

      Hypothesis #2: Compared to wait-list control subjects, those who participate in the WRAP
      intervention will report enhanced enhanced feelings of empowerment, hope, recovery, quality
      of life, and functioning.

      Hypothesis #3: Compared to wait-list controls, those who participate in the WRAP intervention
      will report increased levels of social support.

      Hypothesis #4: Compared to wait-list controls, those who participate in the WRAP intervention
      will report increased use of peer services, higher satisfaction with services, and have lower
      overall service costs.

      Hypothesis #5: Compared to controls, those who participate in the WRAP intervention will
      report increased knowledge of mental illness self-management, including making/using a WRAP
      plan.

      Hypothesis #6: There will be no difference in employment rates of control vs. intervention
      subjects.

      Eligibility criteria included having a diagnosis of serious mental illness and experiencing
      severe functional impairment in one or more life roles. All study participants completed
      telephone interviews at three points in time: study entry (pre-intervention); 8-weeks later
      (immediate post-intervention); and 6-months after intervention (approximately 8 months after
      study entry). Blinded interviewers administered valid and reliable outcome assessments that
      measured changes in subjects' knowledge about mental illness; emotional well-being;
      empowerment; hopefulness; quality of life, and functioning. All study participants were
      compensated for their time at each interview. All WRAP facilitators were people in recovery
      from serious mental illnesses who were certified and experienced WRAP facilitators. Fidelity
      to the WRAP curriculum was assessed on an ongoing basis throughout the study.

    <time_frame>Study entry (pre-intervention), 8-weeks later (post-intervention), &amp; 6-months after intervention (approx. 8 months after study entry)</time_frame>
    <description>The BSI is a patient self-report mental health symptoms research instrument (Piersma et al., 1994). Respondents are asked how much they were bothered in the past week by 53 symptoms on 9 dimensions with a 5-point response scale ranging from ''not at all'' to ''extremely.'' We assessed the BSI Positive Symptom Score which captures the number of symptoms endorsed in a pathological direction, representing the total volume of different symptoms reported to be present to any degree. The minimum value is 0 and the maximum score is 212, where higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Hopefulness</measure>
    <time_frame>Study entry (pre-intervention), 8-weeks later (post-intervention), &amp; 6-months after intervention (approx. 8 months after study entry)</time_frame>
    <description>Hopefulness is measured by the State Hope Scale. Hopefulness as a cross-situational long-term trait is assessed via patient self-report using a 12-item scale assessed on a 4-point Likert response scale with options ranging from &quot;definitely false&quot; to &quot;definitely true&quot; and summed to produce a total score and sub-scale scores. The minimum value for this scale is 12 and the maximum value is 48. Higher scores indicate a better income.</description>

    <time_frame>Study entry (pre-intervention), 8-weeks later (post-intervention), &amp; 6-months after intervention (approx. 8 months after study entry)</time_frame>
    <description>The ability to advocate for oneself with medical care providers is assessed via self-report using The Patient Self-Advocacy Scale, an 18-item scale with a 5-point Likert response set ranging from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree&quot;. Dimensions include in patient knowledge, assertiveness, and potential for mindful non-adherence to treatment. Values range from a minimum of 18 to a maximum of 90, with higher scores indicating a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Recovery From Mental Illness</measure>
    <time_frame>Study entry (pre-intervention), 8-weeks later (post-intervention), &amp; 6-months after intervention (approx. 8 months after study entry)</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome is measured by the Recovery Assessment Scale (RAS). Recovery is a psychosocial outcome assessed via patient self-ratings on a 41-item scale using a 5-point Likert-Response format ranging from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree&quot;. The minimum value for the RAS is 41 and the maximum is 205, with higher scores indicating a better outcome. Dimensions of recovery include personal confidence and hope, willingness to ask for help, goal and success orientation, reliance on others, and not being dominated by one's residual psychiatric symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Study entry (pre-intervention), 8-weeks later (post-intervention), &amp; 6-months after intervention (approx. 8 months after study entry)</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life was assessed by the World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Assessment (WHOQOL-BREF). The 8-item environment sub-scale was utilized for our study. Respondents rate their experience of 8 quality indicators over the past 2 weeks using a 5-point Likert response scale. The minimum value is 8 and the maximum is 40, with higher scores meaning better outcomes.</description>

        <title>Psychiatric Symptoms Recovery Using the Brief Symptoms Inventory (BSI)</title>
        <description>The BSI is a patient self-report mental health symptoms research instrument (Piersma et al., 1994). Respondents are asked how much they were bothered in the past week by 53 symptoms on 9 dimensions with a 5-point response scale ranging from ''not at all'' to ''extremely.'' We assessed the BSI Positive Symptom Score which captures the number of symptoms endorsed in a pathological direction, representing the total volume of different symptoms reported to be present to any degree. The minimum value is 0 and the maximum score is 212, where higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>

        <description>Hopefulness is measured by the State Hope Scale. Hopefulness as a cross-situational long-term trait is assessed via patient self-report using a 12-item scale assessed on a 4-point Likert response scale with options ranging from &quot;definitely false&quot; to &quot;definitely true&quot; and summed to produce a total score and sub-scale scores. The minimum value for this scale is 12 and the maximum value is 48. Higher scores indicate a better income.</description>

Recovery is a psychosocial outcome assessed via patient self-ratings on a 41-item scale using a 5-point Likert-Response format ranging from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree&quot;. The minimum value for the RAS is 41 and the maximum is 205, with higher scores indicating a better outcome. Dimensions of recovery include personal confidence and hope, willingness to ask for help, goal and success orientation, reliance on others, and not being dominated by one's residual psychiatric symptoms.</description>
