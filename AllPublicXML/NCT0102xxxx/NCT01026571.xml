      BAVgenetics is a partnership between Investigators at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,
      Brigham and Women's Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital and the Harvard-Partners Center
      for Genetics and Genomics, dedicated to discovering the genetic causes of bicuspid aortic
      valve disease and associated aortic disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Investigators at BAVgenetics are dedicated to discovering the mechanisms of bicuspid
      aortic valve disease and why individual genetics seem to play such an important role in
      generation of this disease.

      If you have, or have had, a bicuspid aortic valve, we seek your help in this effort by
      volunteering to donate DNA to the BAV Registry, so that this disease can be better understood
      and therapies for it can be developed.

      The BAV Registry is comprised of patients who have donated DNA collected from saliva (spit)
      and have provided us with personal health information that tells us about their bicuspid
      aortic valve.

      Individuals in the Registry have signed the consent form, filled out the medical history
      questionnaire and the authorization form, and provided DNA via our saliva sample kits.

      We will send you the requisite forms so that you receive the most up-to-date information
      about the study as older forms may be outdated. We also need paper copies of the forms;
      therefore, we send all the forms via ground mail along with a pre-paid return envelope for
      your convenience.

        The investigators wish to identify genetic variation that is associated with BAV in
        Americans.

        Patients with a diagnosis of bicuspid aortic valve will be enrolled. Patients who have had
        their bicuspid aortic valve previously replaced will also be enrolled. Relatives of
        patients with a diagnosis of bicuspid aortic valve are also welcomed to be enrolled
        regardless if they have BAV or not, as it is helpful to examine the DNA of first degree
        relatives.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any adult patient â‰¥ 14 years of age may be recruited regardless of gender, ethnicity
             or racial group.

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of bicuspid aortic valve will be enrolled.

          -  Patients who have had their bicuspid aortic valve previously replaced will also be
             enrolled.

          -  Relatives of patients with a diagnosis of bicuspid aortic valve are also welcomed to
             be enrolled regardless if they have BAV or not, as it is helpful to examine the DNA of
             first degree relatives.
