    <measure>Concentrations of Antibodies Against Vaccine Pneumococcal Serotypes (Primary Immunization)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month following primary immunization (at Month 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Concentrations were expressed as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs). Antibodies assessed for this outcome measure were those against the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F (ANTI-1, -4, -5, -6B, -7F, -9V, -14, -18C, -19F and -23F). The seropositivity cut-off of the assay was an antibody concentration ≥ 0.05 microgram per milliliter (µg/mL).</description>

    <description>Antibodies assessed for this outcome measure were those against the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F (ANTI-1, -4, -5, -6B, -7F, -9V, -14, -18C, -19F and -23F). Antibody concentrations were measured by 22F ELISA, expressed as GMCs, in μg/mL. The seropositivity cut-off of the assay was an antibody concentration ≥ 0.05 μg/mL. Antibody concentrations &lt; 0.05 μg/mL were given an arbitrary value of half the cut-off for the purpose of GMC calculation.
Administration of catch-up pneumococcal vaccination with a licensed product other than Synflorix was allowed in the DTPa Group at least 7 days before DTPa vaccine booster dose. Thus, for this booster phase analysis, the DTPa Group was further split in DTPa + Prevenar Group and DTPa - no Prevenar Group.</description>

        <title>Concentrations of Antibodies Against Vaccine Pneumococcal Serotypes (Primary Immunization)</title>
        <description>Concentrations were expressed as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs). Antibodies assessed for this outcome measure were those against the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F (ANTI-1, -4, -5, -6B, -7F, -9V, -14, -18C, -19F and -23F). The seropositivity cut-off of the assay was an antibody concentration ≥ 0.05 microgram per milliliter (µg/mL).</description>

Subjects from this group who also received at least one dose of Prevenar (PCV7): Pfizer’s (formerly Wyeth Lederle) 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, given before pre-booster blood sample (as optional treatment considered as standard of care), were assigned to the DTPa + Prevenar Group in the booster phase, and subjects who did not receive any dose of Prevenar before pre-booster blood sample were assigned to the DTPa-no Prevenar Group in the booster phase. Some booster phase analyses were only performed on subjects of both pooled sub-groups, renamed as DTPa booster Group, at the time of the analysis..</description>

Antibody concentrations were measured by 22F ELISA, expressed as GMCs, in μg/mL. The seropositivity cut-off of the assay was an antibody concentration ≥ 0.05 μg/mL. Antibody concentrations &lt; 0.05 μg/mL were given an arbitrary value of half the cut-off for the purpose of GMC calculation.
Administration of catch-up pneumococcal vaccination with a licensed product other than Synflorix was allowed in the DTPa Group at least 7 days before DTPa vaccine booster dose. Thus, for this booster phase analysis, the DTPa Group was further split in DTPa + Prevenar Group and DTPa - no Prevenar Group.</description>

        <description>Pneumococcal vaccine serotypes assessed were 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F and were calculated, expressed as geometric mean titers (GMTs). The seropositivity cut-off for the assay was ≥ 8. Antibody titers &lt; 8 were given an arbitrary value of half the cut-off for the purpose of GMT calculation.</description>

        <population>The analysis was performed on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity for primary epoch, which included all evaluable subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine antigen component after primary vaccination.</population>

Subjects from this group who also received at least one dose of Prevenar (PCV7): Pfizer’s (formerly Wyeth Lederle) 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, given before pre-booster blood sample (as optional treatment considered as standard of care), were assigned to the DTPa + Prevenar Group in the booster phase, and subjects who did not receive any dose of Prevenar before pre-booster blood sample were assigned to the DTPa-no Prevenar Group in the booster phase. Some booster phase analyses were only performed on subjects of both pooled sub-groups, renamed as DTPa booster Group, at the time of the analysis..</description>

        <title>Opsonophagocytic Titers Against Vaccine Pneumococcal Serotypes (Booster Immunization)</title>
        <description>Pneumococcal vaccine serotypes assessed were 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F and were calculated, expressed as geometric mean titers (GMTs). The seropositivity cut-off for the assay was ≥ 8. Antibody titers &lt; 8 were given an arbitrary value of half the cut-off for the purpose of GMT calculation. Administration of catch-up pneumococcal vaccination with a licensed product other than Synflorix was allowed in the DTPa Group at least 7 days before DTPa vaccine booster dose. Thus, for this booster phase analysis, the DTPa Group was further split in DTPa + Prevenar Group and DTPa - no Prevenar Group.</description>
        <time_frame>Prior to (PRE, at Month 14-16) and one month after booster (POST, at Month 15-17) immunization</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was performed on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity for booster epoch, which included all evaluable subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine antigen component before and after booster vaccination.</population>

        <description>Cross-reactive pneumococcal vaccine serotypes assessed were 6A and 19A and were calculated, expressed as geometric mean titers (GMTs). The seropositivity cut-off for the assay was ≥ 8. Antibody titers &lt; 8 were given an arbitrary value of half the cut-off for the purpose of GMT calculation.</description>

Some booster phase analyses were only performed on subjects of both pooled sub-groups, renamed as DTPa booster Group, at the time of the analysis..</description>

            <description>Healthy male or female subjects, between 90 and 118 days of age, who received, during the primary vaccination phase, 3 doses of the DPT &quot;KAKETSUKEN&quot; Syringe (DTPa) vaccine, administered subcutaneously on alternating (left/right) sides of the distal one third of the upper arm at 3, 4, and 5 months of age, followed by a booster dose at 17-19 months of age (booster vaccination phase). Subjects from this group who also received at least one dose of Prevenar (PCV7): Pfizer’s (formerly Wyeth Lederle) 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, given before pre-booster blood sample (as optional treatment considered as standard of care), were assigned to the DTPa + Prevenar Group in the booster phase, and subjects who did not receive any dose of Prevenar before pre-booster blood sample were assigned to the DTPa-no Prevenar Group in the booster phase. Some booster phase analyses were only performed on subjects of both pooled sub-groups, renamed as DTPa booster Group, at the time of the analysis..</description>

Subjects from this group who also received at least one dose of Prevenar (PCV7): Pfizer’s (formerly Wyeth Lederle) 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, given before pre-booster blood sample (as optional treatment considered as standard of care), were assigned to the DTPa + Prevenar Group in the booster phase, and subjects who did not receive any dose of Prevenar before pre-booster blood sample were assigned to the DTPa-no Prevenar Group in the booster phase. Some booster phase analyses were only performed on subjects of both pooled sub-groups, renamed as DTPa booster Group, at the time of the analysis..</description>
