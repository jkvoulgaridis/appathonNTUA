      Background:

        -  Stroke, also known as acute cerebrovascular attack, is the leading cause of long-term
           disability worldwide. Stroke survivors are often left with permanent physical and mental
           disabilities.

        -  Many stroke patients receive different therapies in an attempt to improve their
           independence and quality of life. However, current strategies are focused on the acute
           stage after stroke and are of limited influence in improving stroke outcome. One of the
           main problems of patients who have suffered a stroke is the difficulty in using the hand
           on the opposite side of the affected hemisphere of the brain; to date, researchers have
           no successful means to improve the hand function in chronic stages of stroke.

        -  Researchers are interested in developing a pool of individuals for further research into
           hand and motor function after a stroke.

      Objectives:

      - To perform a screening evaluation of patients referred with stroke to determine their
      eligibility for current and future protocols studying the effects of stroke on the nervous
      system and motor function.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals who have experienced a single stroke on only one side of the brain that
      occurred at least 3 months prior to participation in the screening study. Individuals must
      have some residual hand motor function.

      Design:

        -  Participants in this study will be recruited from patient referrals.

        -  Eligible participants will undergo a 4- to 5-hour screening with a medical history,
           physical and neurological examination, stroke evaluation, and an anatomical magnetic
           resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. The screening visit may be done over the course of
           more than one day, if needed for patient convenience or test availability.

        -  In addition to the initial outpatient visit, subjects may remain enrolled in this study
           for up to 15 years and may be contacted to see if they qualify for new branch studies.
           Subjects may be re-examined up to once per year while they remain in this protocol to
           confirm ongoing eligibility. The re-examination visits will involve a neurologic
           evaluation and possible repeat MRI.

        -  No clinical care will be provided under this protocol..

      Objective:

      The purpose of this protocol is to perform a screening evaluation of patients referred with
      stroke to determine their eligibility for current and future protocols aimed at understanding
      the mechanisms underlying plastic changes in the human central nervous system after brain
      lesions like stroke.

      Study population:

      Twelve hundred adult patients with monohemispheric single stroke, that occurred at least 3
      months prior to participation in this screening study and meeting the eligibility criteria
      below will be enrolled.

      Design:

      This is a screening protocol to determine eligibility for other branch protocols.

      Outcome measures:

      The outcome measure is the number of subjects who are eligible to subsequently enroll in HCPS
      studies.
