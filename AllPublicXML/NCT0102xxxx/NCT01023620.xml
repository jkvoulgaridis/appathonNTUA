  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to better understand why people with HIV who have taken drugs for
      HIV begin to show abnormal changes in fat loss or fat gain in their bodies. This condition is
      called lipodystrophy.

      Patients who take medicine for HIV and who have lipodystrophy report loss of subcutaneous
      (sc) fat from the arms, legs, and face and excess fat gain in the neck and truncal region.
      They also more likely to have problems with insulin in the body, high fat levels in the blood
      and diabetes. The reason that lipodystrophy develops is not fully understood although some
      HIV drugs have are very likely the cause. The complications pose an increased risk of fat
      blockage forming in the arteries making you more at risk for heart problems in the future.
      Changes in body fat can cause physical discomfort and psychological distress. Management of
      these problems can be a challenge for the patient's doctor.

      The investigators propose data collection to determine if there is more than one reason why
      this might happen in some people and not in others. Laboratory samples being collected: 1)
      special imaging of the liver; 2) fat collected by needle from the mid thigh and mid-shoulder
      areas; 3) blood samples to measure the virus, t-cells, fats, and other markers of how the
      patient's body is handling the virus.

      This study is being done because science does not fully understand why some patients with HIV
      who take medicines for the virus have abnormal fat loss or gain and some do not. This
      research study is intended to help us better understand why and how this happens.
