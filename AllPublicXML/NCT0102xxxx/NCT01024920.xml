    <measure>Probability Rates of Progression-free Survival at 9 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Progression-free survival after 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival (PFS) at 9 months, calculated as the time (months) from randomisation to the occurrence of disease progression (by RECIST Version 1.1) or death, whichever occurred first.
Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.</description>

    <measure>Objective Response According to RECIST Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of study until the cut-off date for 3 year efficacy analysis</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response was defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by RECIST Version 1.1.
Per RECIST version 1.1. for target lesions and assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Objective Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of study until the cut-off date for 3 year efficacy analysis</time_frame>
    <description>Duration (months) of objective response was measured from the time of first objective response to the time of disease progression (by RECIST Version 1.1) or death, whichever occurred first.
Per RECIST version 1.1. for target lesions and assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR.
For those patients with an objective response, time to response was summarised by the planned imaging time points. A descriptive summary of the duration of response was also produced using Kaplan-Meier estimates.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of study until the cut-off date for 3 year efficacy analysis</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival was calculated as the time (months) from randomisation to death. Overall survival was analysed using the same methodology as for PFS. Patients for whom there was no evidence of death at the time of analysis were censored on the date that they were last known to have been alive.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of study until the cut-off date for 3 year efficacy analysis</time_frame>
    <description>Time to progression is defined as the time period from randomisation to objective tumour progression. Time to progression was analysed using the same methodology as for PFS. Patients with no progression (by RECIST Version 1.1) were censored at the date of the last evaluable imaging.
Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.</description>

    <measure>Time to Treatment Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of study until the cut-off date for 3 year efficacy analysis</time_frame>
    <description>Time to treatment failure was defined as the time from randomisation to objective tumour progression (by RECIST Version 1.1), death, global deterioration of health status requiring treatment discontinuation, or start of new anticancer treatment, whichever came first.</description>

        <description>Duration (months) of objective response was measured from the time of first objective response to the time of disease progression (by RECIST Version 1.1) or death, whichever occurred first.
Per RECIST version 1.1. for target lesions and assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR.
For those patients with an objective response, time to response was summarised by the planned imaging time points. A descriptive summary of the duration of response was also produced using Kaplan-Meier estimates.</description>
