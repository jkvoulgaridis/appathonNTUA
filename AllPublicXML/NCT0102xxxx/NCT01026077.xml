      The Savella Pregnancy Registry is a US based registry designed to monitor pregnancies exposed
      to Savella (milnacipran HCI). This is an observational, exposure-registration and follow-up
      registry designed primarily to estimate the prevalence of major congenital anomalies, and
      secondarily to estimate the prevalence of recognized spontaneous abortions, stillbirths,
      induced abortions, minor congenital anomalies, and any serious adverse pregnancy outcomes
      among pregnancies exposed to Savella as well as adverse outcomes observed during the first
      year of life in off-springs born from these exposed pregnancies. Live offspring are followed
      from birth until age one. The Savella Pregnancy Registry is sponsored by Allergan (formerly
      Actavis PLC and Forest Laboratories Inc.) and managed by Syneos Health.

      Registry enrollment is voluntary and initiated by pregnant patients or their healthcare
      providers (HCP). Patient-initiated reports must be verified by the HCP. Enrollment should
      occur as early in pregnancy as possible, preferably before any prenatal testing has occurred;
      however, enrollment at any time during pregnancy is allowed. Near the estimated date of
      delivery, the Registry prompts the HCP to provide pregnancy outcome data. If a live birth is
      reported, the Registry conducts follow-up with the infant's HCP at outcome, 4 months, and 12
      months of age. If a birth defect is indicated, the Registry requests additional targeted
      follow-up information from the HCP. Data are collected on exposure to Savella, potential
      confounding factors, pregnancy outcome, and pediatric outcome for all live born babies. Cases
      are reviewed and classified according to type of birth defects. Adverse event cases are
      forwarded to Allergan.
