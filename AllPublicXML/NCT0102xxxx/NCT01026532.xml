  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how a special white blood cell, the eosinophil, can
      contribute to asthma. One of the characteristics of asthma is airway inflammation. Airway
      inflammation in asthma may occur when an allergen is inhaled and sets up an allergic reaction
      in the bronchial tubes. This reaction may lead to chest tightness, cough and wheeze. To
      better understand the way in which the eosinophil can cause inflammation, the investigators
      plan to study eosinophils that move in to the lung following an allergic reaction.

    <description>Segmental allergen challenge: Briefly, this procedure will be done during a bronchoscopy. Two airway tubes of the lung will have about 1 teaspoon of allergen put in it while the scope is wedged in an airway tube segment. The allergen will stimulate this portion of the airway tube to produce eosinophils. The scope will then be removed. The bronchoscopy will be repeated two days later to collect lung fluid and biopsy samples from the parts of the lung where the allergen solution was placed.</description>

        Well-controlled allergic subjects with mild-intermittent asthma will be identified and
        undergo inhaled allergen provocation to demonstrate an allergen-specific airway response.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18-50 years

          -  Diagnosis of allergic rhinitis and/or mild asthma

          -  Pre-albuterol forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) of &gt;70% predicted.

          -  Skin test positive to house dust mite (D. farinae), short ragweed or cat hair

          -  Documented negative Tuberculin skin test (PPD) within the last 12 months or a medical
             history that is consistent with a low probability of exposure to tuberculosis (i.e.
             the subject is not a health worker, has not traveled to endemic areas, and has no
             pre-existing medical or social risk factors for tuberculosis).

          -  At least a 20% decrease in FEV1 during the immediate response following inhaled
             antigen challenge

          -  Safety laboratory assessments within normal ranges (labs to include complete blood
             count with differential, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, Prothrombin time, Partial
             Thromboplastin Time and platelet count)

          -  Women of child-bearing potential (WCBP) must have a negative urine pregnancy test
             (urine HCG) within 48 hours of the methacholine challenge at Visit 2, within 48 hours
             of the inhaled allergen challenge at V3 and on the day of the segmental allergen
             challenge on Visit 5. WCBP must agree to use a reliable method of birth control for
             the duration of the study (reliable methods of birth control can include abstinence,
             barrier methods, oral contraceptives, injection contraceptives or skin absorption
             contraceptives).

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, capable and willing to grant written informed
             consent and cooperate with study procedures and requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Major health problems such as autoimmune disease, heart disease, type I and II
             diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension or lung diseases other than asthma. The listed
             health problems are definitive exclusion but decisions regarding major health problems
             not listed will be based upon the judgment of the investigator.

          -  No pre-existing chronic infectious disease.

          -  Any condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator, transient oxyhemoglobin
             desaturation is inadvisable.

          -  Pregnant or lactating females or has a planned pregnancy during the course of the
             study.

             inhibitors and beta-adrenergic antagonists in any form).

          -  Inhaled corticosteroids or oral corticosteroids within 1 month of screening.

          -  Upper or lower respiratory infection within 1 month of screening.

          -  Unstable asthma as indicated by self report of increased symptoms or increased
             beta-agonist use over the 2 weeks preceding the screening visit.

          -  Current smokers (defined as smoked within the last year) or a former smoker with a
             history of &gt;5 pack years.

          -  Obesity as defined by a Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt;30.

          -  Use of an investigational drug within 30 days of entering the study

             unreliable including those with a psychiatric history that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may interfere with the conduct of study procedures.
