    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the current study is to investigate the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)
      in terms of safety and tolerability of BI 6727 in combination with fixed dose BIBF 1120, in
      patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumours.

    <description>The MTD was determined using a 3+3 design with de-escalation. The MTD was defined as the highest dose level at which maximal 1 out of 6 patients experienced DLT in the first course of the escalation nd de-escalation phase. However, all DLT's occurring in the trial were considered for selection of the recommended dose for further development.</description>
