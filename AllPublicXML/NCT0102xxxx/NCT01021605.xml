      The objective of the feasibility study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Hemolung
      RAS in patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure in five groups of patients:

      Group 1: COPD patients with an acute exacerbation and have a 50% likelihood of failure of
      noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) leading to intubation and mechanical
      ventilation

      Group 2: Patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure on invasive mechanical ventilation who
      have either:

        -  Failed two or more weaning attempts OR

        -  Failed one or more weaning attempts and do not wish to be invasively mechanically
           ventilated.

      Group 3: Patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure on noninvasive positive pressure
      ventilation who have failed two weaning attempts and do not wish to be invasively
      mechanically ventilated.

      Group 4: Patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure who in the view of the treating
      physician are declining on optimized non-invasive positive pressure ventilation OR
      demonstrate a complete intolerance of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation for any
      reason and invasive mechanical ventilation is considered undesirable by the treating
      physician.

      Group 5: Patients who are currently invasively mechanically ventilated and in the view of the
      treating physician would benefit from the application of protective lung ventilation, and in
      whom this cannot be achieved without significant worsening of respiratory failure.

    <description>Patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be placed on the Hemolung Respiratory Assist System. Patients will be weaned from non-invasive or invasive ventilation and then the Hemolung RAS. Hemolung support will be provided for up to 7 days. Follow-up exams will be performed every 15 days until hospital discharge or 30 days from completion of Hemolung therapy, whichever is later.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed hypercapnic respiratory failure (PaCO2 &gt;50mmHg(6.7kPa)) and falling into one
             of the five groups

          -  Not severely hypoxemic (PaO2/FiO2 ≥ 200 mmHg on PEEP/CPAP ≤ 5 cmH2O)

          -  Hemodynamically stable: Mean arterial pressure (MAP) &gt; 65 mmHg without vasopressor
             support, or MAP &gt; 60 mmHg with a requirement for vasopressor support that can be
             attributed to sedation or dynamic hyperinflation resulting from mechanical ventilation
             by the treating investigator.

          -  Chronic arrhythmias (e.g., atrial fibrillation) well controlled

          -  Minimum platelet count of 100,000/mm3

          -  Minimum red blood cell count of 2.5 mill/μl
