    <textblock>
      This is an open label, randomized controlled study. We'd like to access the safety and
      effects of empagliflozin compared with linagliptin in new-onset diabetes after kidney
      transplantation patients. Our primary endpoints are kidney related indicators and secondary
      endpoints are glucose and lipid metabolism related indicators and adverse events. We are
      going to recruit 35 patients for each group and follow six months.

    <textblock>
      In recent years, with the development of transplantation technology and immunosuppressive
      agents, kidney transplantation has made considerable progress. However, for metabolic
      disorders after kidney transplantation, such as new diabetes after kidney transplantation,
      there is still insufficient awareness. Since 1964, Starlz et al. first discovered and
      proposed New-onset diabetes after kidney transplantation（NODAT） in patients after renal
      transplantation. Scholars from all countries have paid considerable attention to it. The
      Chinese guidelines indicate that NODAT can increase the risk of graft-related complications,
      such as rejection, graft loss and infection, and ultimately affect the long-term survival of
      the recipient. In addition, NODAT has also been shown to increase the risk of cardiovascular
      events, and cardiovascular disease is associated with more than half of kidney transplant
      deaths. A retrospective study of 567 renal transplant recipients in China showed that the
      incidence of NODAT was 24.2%. It can be seen that the incidence of new-onset diabetes after
      renal transplantation is high and has long-term adverse effects on transplant patients.
      Therefore, there is an urgent need to evaluate and investigate NODAT's therapeutic drug
      regimens.

      According to the study, empagliflozin has a protective effect on the kidney and
      cardiovascular system, but it has not yet been written into the treatment guidelines for
      new-onset diabetes after kidney transplantation. Metformin and linagliptin are frequently
      used in diabetics after renal transplantation, and linagliptin also have a protective effect
      on the kidneys. Therefore, this experiment wanted to compare the effects between
      empagliflozin and linagliptin on kidney protection.
