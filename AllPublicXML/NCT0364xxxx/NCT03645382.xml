  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that steam onion have benefit effects on controlling the blood sugar,
      triacylglycerol (TG) and total cholesterol (TC). In this study, the jeju steam onion examined
      whether it has beneficial effects on reducing body fat of overweight or obesity subjects.

    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted to verify the
      effects of jeju steam onion. Fifty-six healthy male and female subjects aged 20-65 years with
      normal body weight [25.0 kg/㎡ ≤ body mass index (BMI) &lt; 30.0 kg/㎡] were recruited. The basic
      framework of the present study was based on a previous study. A 12-week (at each visit;
      screening, 6-week, 12-week), placebo-controlled, randomized study was conducted with
      overweight subjects (25.0 kg/㎡ ≤ BMI &lt; 30 kg/㎡). Subjects participants were divided into two
      group: either Jeju steaming onion or matching placebo (the baked barley powder).
      Randomization was achieved by computer generated block randomization (placebo : test = 1 :
      1).
