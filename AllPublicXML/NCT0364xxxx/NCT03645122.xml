  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this study are to leverage principles of spike timing-dependent plasticity
      (STDP) via non-invasive stimulation techniques to strengthen corticospinal transmission. Few
      studies have targeted the cortex after stroke in humans, and none have targeted the
      corticospinal-motoneuronal synapse in the spinal cord. This study, therefore, is a novel
      approach to studying neuroplasticity after stroke. Previous work in humans with incomplete
      spinal cord injury demonstrates that the resulting plasticity transiently enhances motor
      output, indicating that there is also therapeutic potential.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability in the United States with 795,000
      individuals suffering a new or recurrent stroke each year. In most cases, disability is
      associated with incomplete motor recovery of the paretic limb. Even with intensive therapy,
      full recovery is often not achieved. Thus, there is a need for mechanistic approaches that
      drive the impaired neuronal targets of retraining to fully harness the corticospinal system's
      adaptive capacity.

      This study will attempt to induce bi-directional STDP in corticospinal-motoneuronal synapses
      serving an intrinsic hand muscle of the hemiparetic limb. Control experiments will be
      completed to provide evidence of the neurophysiological mechanism(s) mediating the effect and
      to examine behavioral effects.

      Individuals who are at least 6 months post first-ever subcortical stroke and have at least
      partial range of motion of the paretic index finger will be invited to participate.

    <description>The subject will modulate force by holding a force transducer between the paretic index finger and thumb to control the path of a virtual object through targets displayed on a computer monitor. Subjects will modify force applied to a transducer in order to align the path of the object through spatial boundaries of ten targets. All ten targets will appear at once. Ten repetitions of the ten targets (orientation of targets will vary each time) will be performed. Performance will be quantified by taking the total actual time the object is overlaid with any part of each target, expressed as a percentage of maximum possible time on target.</description>
