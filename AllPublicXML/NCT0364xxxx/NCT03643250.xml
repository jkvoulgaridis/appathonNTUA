  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine the effect of varying both the portion size and the
      appeal (palatability and presentation) of foods served to preschool children at a meal on the
      outcomes of food and energy intake at the meal.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    We observed reduced intake by the fifth week, so we are shortening the study and simplifying it
    by using a complete factorial design with four conditions.
