      Results of the clinical trial of the combination of Fluzoparib and Apatinib in the treatment
      of gastric cancer animal model and the drug PARP inhibitor alone, PARP inhibitor combined
      with VEGFR inhibitor, Patients with advanced refractory solid tumors with TP53 harmful
      mutations can be expected to be safe and effective in the treatment of Fluzoparib and
