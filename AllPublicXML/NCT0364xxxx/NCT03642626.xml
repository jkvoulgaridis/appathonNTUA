    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study of FDA-approved CAR-T products for patients with hematologic
      malignancies. Patients will be assigned to Arm A and B based on age and diagnosis. Overall
      remission rate, safety events and other endpoints will be calculated for Arm A and B
      separately.
