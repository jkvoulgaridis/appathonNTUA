  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Back pain is often accompanied by changes in function. The performance of individuals with
      their backs on their wills may become more functional. It is believed that the test will
      present good to excellent reliability in individuals with chronic back pain. From this, it
      can be used in the clinic to verify the functional capacity of these individuals.

      This study will be performed to verify the reliability of the functional tests for
      individuals with back pain. A study in which individuals with back pain will be assessed on
      the first day and after the interval of seven days. They should perform the 6-minute walk
      test and answer some questionnaires such as the Roland Morris - disability questionnaire, the
      IPAQ - physical activity level questionnaire and Numeric Rating Scale, after the tests will
      be performed Timed 10-Meter Walk Test and 30 Second Sit to Stand Test. To avoid a random
      error, a minimum sample size of 30 participants is required. For statistical analysis,
      Shapiro-Wilk test will be used for data normalization and the reliability between
      measurements will be calculated through do Intraclass Correlation Coefficients, standard
      error of measurement and Minimal Detectable Change. There were no studies in the literature
      and recorded in the Clinical Trials that evaluated the reliability of these tests for
      individuals with chronic low back pain.
