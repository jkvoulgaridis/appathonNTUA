  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will recruit 40 EGFR-mutant metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients who
      failed any EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

      All recruited patients will receive 1200mg Azetolizumab administered over 60 minutes (1st
      cycle) and 30 minutes (2nd cycle onwards) intravenously, as well as 7.5mg/kg bevacizumab
      administered over 90 minutes (1st cycle), 60 minutes (2nd cycle) and 30 minutes (3rd cycle
      onwards) for every 3 weeks, until radiographically documented disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity as judged by investigators or patient withdrawal.

      The primary objective is to assess the progression-free survival of this treatment
      population, and to identify potential genomic and immunologic biomarkers for treatment
      response. Objective response rate (ORR) will be the primary efficacy endpoint.
