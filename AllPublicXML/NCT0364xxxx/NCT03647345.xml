  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) has been used for the modulation of mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
      patients' cognitive function by altering the cortical excitability. Recently, more
      challenging approaches, such as stimulation of two or more sites or use of dual modality have
      been studied in MCI patients. In this study, simultaneous stimulation using both facilitatory
      rTMS (10Hz) and anodal or cathodal tDCS (dual-mode stimulation) over bilateral dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortices (DLPFCs) was investigated to compare its modulatory effects with single
      facilitatory rTMS stimulation in mild cognitive impairment patients.
