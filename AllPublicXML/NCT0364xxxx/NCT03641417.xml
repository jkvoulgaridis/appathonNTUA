  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery helps patients with severe obesity to lose weight, cures and prevents
      diseases linked to obesity and reduces the risk of death. Unfortunately, 1 in 5 patients do
      not respond well to surgery in terms of weight loss and health gains. Thus, maximising weight
      loss and health benefits after surgery is critical. This study aims to gain insight into the
      role that the appetite-stimulating hormone, ghrelin, plays in driving appetite and energy
      intake in patients with poor weight loss (≤ 20% total body weight) following bariatric
      surgery. This will guide future work to develop pharmacological treatments for obesity, both
      as standalone treatments and adjuncts to bariatric surgery.

      Participants will be invited to attend the Clinical Research Facility at University College
      London Hospital for a screening visit and six study visits. Active ghrelin levels will be
      reduced by inhibiting ghrelin-o-acyl-transferase (GOAT), the enzyme needed to generate active
      ghrelin (acyl ghrelin, AG). Participants will be randomised to receive GLWL-01 (GOAT
      inhibitor) 300mg BD or placebo for a 10 day study cycle. The effect of AG reduction on
      appetite and energy intake will be evaluated through both fixed-energy and ad libitum meal
      tests on day 7 and 10, respectively. Measures of body weight and composition, appetite and
      food cravings will be performed in addition to biochemical profiling of circulating gut
      hormone, adipokine and cytokine levels. Targeted physical examinations and assessment of
      adverse events will be performed. Safety monitoring calls will be conducted 2 and 7 days
      after the last dose. Following a 6-10 week washout period, participants will cross over to
      receive either placebo or GLWL-01 300mg BD and undergo a second study cycle, with all
      measures repeated.
