  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) has been used for the modulation of post-stroke cognitive impairment
      patients' cognitive function by altering the cortical excitability.

      Recently, more challenging approaches, such as stimulation of two or more sites or use of
      dual modality have been studied in stroke patients. In this study, simultaneous stimulation
      using both facilitatory rTMS (10Hz) and anodal or cathodal tDCS (dual-mode stimulation) over
      bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFCs) was investigated to compare its
      modulatory effects with single facilitatory rTMS stimulation in post-stroke cognitive
      impairment patients.
