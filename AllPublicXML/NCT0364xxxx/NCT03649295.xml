  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of conventional speech therapy associated with
      functional electrical stimulation in patients with dysphagia after ischemic stroke. Included
      patients will be divided into two groups, where in the intervention group the speech therapy
      is associated to functional electrical stimulation, and in the control group, the patients
      will receive the conventional speech therapy with electrical stimulation Placebo with
      intensity 0hz.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the 1980's, electrical stimulation has been used for therapeutic purposes in Brazil,
      and, since 1990's, it has been used as a relevant therapeutic tool in the cases of
      oropharyngeal dysphagia in addition to speech therapy. Positive results have been observed in
      the treatment of swallowing disorders, including in patients that carry neurological
      diseases. However, there is no substantial evidences for this interventions.

      In this study, the electrotherapy will be used as a complement to conventional speech therapy
      and performed the application of electrical stimulation protocol in dysphagia, through the
      apparatus Neurodyn Portable TENS/FES (transcutaneous electrical neurostimulation/ functional
      electrical stimulation), which is a transcutaneous neuromuscular stimulator flow TENS/FES
      from two channels with independent intensity adjustment. It is about a non-invasive technique
      with no systemic effect, causing no dependence or undesirable side effects, and consists by
      gentle application in electrical stimulation, through electrodes placed in body areas
      affected by pain or to activate skeletal muscles and produce movements. A channel of
      electrodes will be placed in the submental region and the other channel on the thyroid
      cartilage., in formation of a T. The explication of the procedure in the patient treatment,
      is describing the sensations that he should expect that happened during the stimulation. The
      intensity of necessary flow to apply in the treatment, will depend in the sensation of the
      patient, therefore, it is applicable until the tolerance level or desirable muscular
      contraction. Thus, the treatment should be initiated with minimal levels of intensity, by
      being carefully raised if appropriate effects are achieved on the procedure and according to
      the patient report.

    <description>Anatomical Evaluation:Tongue, palate, pharynx, larynx - normal or specify changes
Functional Evaluation:
Mobility (lips/tongue), tongue's sensitivity, palatine veil's closure - adequate or inadequate
Pharynx - salivary/alimentary stasis
Larynx - normal, decreased mobility, unilateral or bilateral immobility
Deglutition assessment (liquid, thick, pasty and solid foods):
-Delay of swallowing, anterior/posterior escape, stasis in vallecula/pyriform sinuses, laryngeal penetration, laryngotracheal aspiration - present or absent
Functional swallowing: alteration in anatomical or functional evaluation with absence of salivary/alimentary stasis Mild dysphagia: there is also salivary or food stasis in only one consistency with efficient maneuvers such as lowered head, Masako or effortless swallowing Moderate dysphagia: there is also laryngeal penetration to one or more consistencies Severe dysphagia: there is also laryngotracheal aspiration or absence of swallowing reflex</description>

    <description>Measured by the Functional Oral Ingestion Scale (FOIS). FOIS results are rated on a scale of 1 to 7 levels. The levels will increase according to the safe amount of oral diet ingested by the patient safely.
Level1 - nothing by mouth; Level 2 - tube dependent with minimal attempts of Food or liquid; Level 3 - tube dependent with consistence oral Intake of Food or liquid; Level 4 - total oral diet of a single consistency; Level 5 - total oral diet with multiple consistencies but requiring special preparation or compensations; Level 6 - total oral diet with multiplex consistencies without special preparation, but with specific Food limitations; Level 7 - total oral diet with no restrictions.</description>

Captation, anterior and posterior escape, cough reflex and gagging- present or absent
Oral transit time, number of swallowing, laryngeal elevation- adequate or inadequate
Voice normal or &quot;wet&quot;
Functional swallowing- there are changes that do not compromise safe feeding as reduced sensitivity (intra-oral or facial), anterior escape due to small anatomical or functional changes Mild dysphagia- multiple swallowing, inadequate laryngeal elevation, &quot;wet&quot; voice but cough reflex efficient Moderate dysphagia- multiple swallowing, inadequate laryngeal elevation, &quot;wet&quot; voice, weak cough reflex and gagging one or more consistencies Severe dysphagia- when there is no evidence of coughing, swallowing reflexes or gagging difficult to recover</description>
