      -  Apply Mobile APP Intervention ( iCKD APP) to current chronic kidney disease care
           program.

        -  Conduct a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of this
           mobile device on health behavior improvement in chronic kidney disease patients.

      A mHealth app (iCKD APP) was designed to assist CKD patients to monitor their home
      bio-information data. Patients will be randomly assigned into the iCKD APP
      group(intervention) and traditional care group (control). Participants will be randomized
      into an 1:1 manner (intervention : control). Random assignment occurred after the consent and
      initial enrollment interview. Individuals randomized to the iCKD APP will provide with the
      equipment after randomization. Participants will follow for at least 6 months before the exit
      interview.
