  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will help the investigators learn more about the best way to give anesthesia for
      these kinds of surgery. The investigators will be using 2 different groups of medications
      that is commonly used in ACDF surgery, one group has a Narcotic, and the other group does
      not. The investigators wish to test whether a narcotic free anesthetic will result in an
      overall safer surgery, better patient recovery, and satisfaction. The investigators think
      also that eliminating the Narcotic from the Anesthetic regimen will allow patients to recover
      faster after surgery , and consume less pain medicines in the postoperative period.
