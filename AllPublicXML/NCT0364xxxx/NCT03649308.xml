      The aim of this study is to compare negative pressure wound therapy to traditional care after
      split-thickness skin grafting in patients aged over 18.

    <textblock>
      Split-thickness skin grafting (STSG) is one of the most commonly used techniques in
      reconstructive plastic surgery and dermatology. Skin grafts are being used to cover skin
      defects caused by multiple etiologies. Traditionally, patients are immobilized in bed or in
      wheelchair for up to five days after surgery. Long immobilization decreases patients overall
      ability to function and increases the length of the stay in hospital. Negative pressure wound
      therapy (NPWT) have been used successfully in treatment of acute, chronic and diabetic
      ulcers. It is proposed that NPWT increases capillary blood flow, decreases bacterial
      contamination, seroma formation and swelling. Using NPWT on split-thickness skin grafts after
      burns is well documented. It increases skin graft take ratio and speeds up healing. Aim of
      this study is to compare NPWT to traditional treatment after STSG for any indication in
      patients aged 18 to 99. This is a two-arm, multicenter, randomized prospective trial with 160
      patients.
