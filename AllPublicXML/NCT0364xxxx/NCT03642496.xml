  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine the safety, including potential dose limiting toxicities, and
      efficiency of ET019002-T cells and the duration of in vivo survival of ET019002-T cells in
      patients with relapsed/refractory B-Cell Malignancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ET019002-T cell therapy is a novel chimeric T-cell therapy platform that in preclinical
      studies, functionally matches the efficacy of CAR-T cells, but dramatically reduces the
      release of cytokines upon killing of target-positive tumors.The arm of the study is
      experimental i.v. arm:ET019002-T cells administered by intravenous (IV) infusion.The
      intervention is ET019002-T cells(Autologous T cells transduced with lentivirus encoding an
      anti-CD19 (ET019002)-expression construct).
