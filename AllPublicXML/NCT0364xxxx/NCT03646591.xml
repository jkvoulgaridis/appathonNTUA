  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for advanced-stage gastric cancer is justified by various studies,
      however, there was not any large scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) to support it until
      German oncologist introduced a novel regimen(FLOT regimen) in 2017. Investigator assessed the
      FLOT regimen for safety and feasibility in Chinese gastric cancer patients.

      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for advanced-stage gastric cancer is justified by various studies,
      however, there was not any large scale RCT to support it until German oncologist introduced a
      novel regimen(FLOT regimen) in 2017. FLOT regimen was prescribed for German patients and
      various questions are raised by experts from Eastern countries. As the FLOT regimen was
      officially included in NCCN 2018 guidelines, the investigator used standard protocol of FLOT
      regimen on Chinese gastric cancer patients. Safety and feasibility were assessed carefully to
      provide basic data for further large scale studies in China.

    <description>Patients will receive four cycles of the standard dose of FLOT chemotherapy prior to curative gastrectomy. And four cycles of the FLOT chemotherapy is recommended after surgery. Preventive antiemetic and dexamethasone are allowed before chemotherapy, growth factor, or other supportive medicines are allowed for treatment only. Surgical intervention is allowed for acute bleeding or other surgical emergencies.</description>
