    <textblock>
      The LUCINDA Trial is a three-site, phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study of leuprolide acetate (Eligard) in women with Alzheimer's Disease taking a stable dose
      of donepezil (Aricept.) Its objective is to assess the efficacy of a 48-week regimen of
      leuprolide (22.5 mg per 12 weeks) compared to placebo on cognitive function, global function
      and plasma and neuroimaging biomarkers.

      This project aims to re-purpose the safe and well-tolerated gonadotropin-releasing hormone
      (GnRH) analogue Leuprolide Acetate for use in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Leuprolide Acetate is
      currently used in adults for prostate cancer, endometriosis, uterine fibroids and in
      preparation for in-vitro fertilization, and in children for central precocious puberty. The
      purpose of this study to confirm and extend results from a prior phase II study (Bowen et al,
      2015) which demonstrated that Leuprolide halted cognitive and functional decline in a
      subgroup of women with mild-moderate AD who were also taking the acetylcholinesterase
      inhibitor donepezil. Our objectives are to replicate, in the same subgroup, Leuprolide's
      clinical EFFICACY in this prior trial and to add neuroimaging and plasma BIOMARKERS that will
      help elucidate Leuprolide's likely multiple mechanisms of action in AD. These mechanisms
      include decreasing levels of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) based on extensive preclinical evidence
      that decreasing LH preserves cognition and decreases amyloid deposition and tau
      phosphorylation in animal models of AD, as well as new evidence that GnRH analogues may have
      anti-inflammatory effects.
