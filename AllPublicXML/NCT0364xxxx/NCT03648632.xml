      Stereotactic Radiotherapy (SBRT) in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC).

      A Danish phase II study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Combination chemotherapy (e.g. FOLFIRINOX, Gem-Abraxane, Gem-Cap, Gem-S1) is standard of care
      in patients with LAPC but more and more scientific studies point to the fact that patients
      without sign of progressive disease (PD) will benefit from additional radiotherapy and
      especially SBRT.

      The sample size is based on Simon's two stages mini-max design. This design ensures early
      study termination if there is insufficient effect.

      A resection rate less than 10% after SBRT is not clinically acceptable. Assuming a
      significance level at 0.1 (α = 0.1) and a power at 90% (β = 0.10) it can be calculated, that
      16 patients should be included in the first part of the study. The enrolment will continue
      until 16 patients have completed SBRT and have been re-evaluated for resection by CT scan
      (and EUS+LUS, if available). If 1 or less out of the first 16 consecutive patients are being
      resected the investigators will reject our hypotheses and close the study after the first
      stage of accrual. If 2 or more patients are resected, an additional 9 patients will be
      accrued in the second stage. If at least 4 out of 25 patients are resected, a true resection
      rate of 30% cannot be excluded, and the investigators will conclude that the treatment is
      effective enough to continue with future studies.

      To ensure 25 evaluable patients the investigators will include a total of 30 patients.
