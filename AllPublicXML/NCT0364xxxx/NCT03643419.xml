  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to observe the therapeutic effect of near-infrared light
      irradiation on the treatment of acute spinal cord injury in humans, and whether it can
      promote the recovery of neurological function. Half of the patients underwent laminectomy and
      decompression surgery, and the other half of the patients were implanted with irradiated
      fibers for irradiation after surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The annual incidence of spinal cord injury has increased year by year, and there is currently
      no effective treatment.

      Near-infrared light has been widely used in clinical medicine because of its bio-stimulating
      effect, convenient use, harmless to the body, easy to be accepted by patients, and convenient
      for clinical promotion. The near-infrared light biostimulation effect can enhance the
      activity of various enzymes, inhibit inflammatory cells, inhibit neuronal apoptosis, and
      promote nerve regeneration. It has been widely confirmed and widely used in the
      rehabilitation of central nervous system and peripheral nerve injury. However, the position
      of the spinal cord is deep, and the depth of illumination used by laser treatment equipment
      is generally difficult to reach.

      The implantable 360° scattering fiber the investigators developed was implanted in the
      surgical site together with the drainage tube for irradiation treatment without additional
      patient damage.
