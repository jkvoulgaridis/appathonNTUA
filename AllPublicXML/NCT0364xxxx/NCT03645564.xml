  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to measure in patients addressed for Atrial
      Fibrillation (AF) in the Cardiology-Electrophysiology and Cardiac Stimulation Department of
      Bordeaux hospital, the impact of a specialized nurse consultation on their adherence level to
      direct oral anticoagulants treatments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of persons that should take an anticoagulant treatment in France is evaluated at 3
      Billion and at least half of them for an Atrial Fibrillation disease. One of the main issues
      of their prescription is stoke prevention. With the coming of direct oral anticoagulants,
      which does not require repeating controls like it is the case for anti-vitamin K treatments,
      the patient's involvement is a guarantee of therapeutic adherence and good use. Nevertheless
      a good adherence level is seldom reached. This highlights the importance of individualized
      information which must be followed for purposes of accuracy and deepening. Thus as part of
      investigator's activity department that treats about 1000 patients per year for an Atrial
      Fibrillation, the information, use and therapeutic adherence are a priority in the care
      pathway of patients under direct oral anticoagulants. The investigators propose to measure
      the contribution of a specialized nurse consultation in contact with a multidisciplinary team
      on therapeutic adherence. The investigators hypothesis that an individualized and reassessed
      information would allowed a better understanding by the patients of their pathology and care
      and thus a better therapeutic adherence. A control group will present the same care pathway
      than all the patients of the service suffering from Atrial Fibrillation without specialized
      nurse consultation. The second group will benefit of a specialized nurse consultation
      throughout of which an individualized information will be delivered. This information will be
      reevaluated during the usual patient follow-up. All the patients will be followed at 3
      months, 6 months and 1 year as part of the usual care of the service.
