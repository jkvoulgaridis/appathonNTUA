  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety data of AZD8871 in patients with moderate to
      severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study will determine the 24-hour
      efficacy (lung function) profile of AZD8871 600 μg relative to placebo dry powder inhaler
      (DPI) based on trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) following repeated dosing
      (2 weeks). Anoro® Ellipta® (umeclidinium/vilanterol) once daily is included as an active
      control. This study aims at providing a novel approach to the treatment of COPD with greater
      efficacy than single-mechanism bronchodilators, equivalent to long-acting muscarinic
      antagonist (LAMA) and long-acting β2-agonist (LABA) administered as free- or fixed-dose
      combination therapies, with an equivalent or superior safety and tolerability profile.

      This randomized, double-blind, placebo and active-controlled crossover study will be
      conducted at 5 sites in Germany and the United Kingdom (UK). Approximately 180 patients will
      be screened in order to randomize 72 patients into the study. Based on previous studies
      estimate, it is anticipated that 54 patients will be evaluable (study completers) assuming an
      approximate 25% dropout rate. A subset of 36 patients, who will have specifically consented
      for pharmacokinetics (PK), will undergo PK assessments. The study will consist of -

        -  A Screening period: Will last up to 28 days and consists of 2 Screening visits (Visit 1
           and Visit 2) and a run-in period (between a minimum of 14 and a maximum of 28 days; from
           Visit 2 to Visit 3).

        -  Three treatment periods (Visit 3; 14 days each; each separated by a wash-out period of
           42 to 49 days) and

        -  A Follow-up Visit: 42 days (up to 49 days) after last investigational product (IP)
           administration.

      Patients will be requested to stop their usual COPD therapy after signing the informed
      consent form (ICF) at Visit 1 and will be maintained on a mono-component inhaled
      corticosteroid (ICS) therapy, if required. Patients that were taking any LAMA will be
      maintained with ipratropium (34 µg × 2 puffs 4 times per day) between Visit 1 and Visit 2. In
      addition, salbutamol 100 µg will be provided as rescue medication during the study as needed
      (rescue medication has to be discontinued 6 hours before any pulmonary function test). Visit
      1 and Visit 2 could be performed on the same day if no wash-out of prior medication is
      required and the patient visits the site in fasting condition. In case any wash-out of prior
      medication is required, then Visit 2 will be performed after the wash-out is complete. If
      reversibility criteria and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) predicted values are
      fulfilled according to inclusion criteria, the patient will be started on run-in period to
      assess clinical stability. If reversibility criteria or FEV1 predicted values are not met,
      pulmonary function tests could be rescheduled at the latest, up to Day 14. During the run in
      period, all patients will receive ipratropium 34 µg × 2 puffs 4 times per day (must be
      discontinued 8 hours prior to previous any pulmonary function test). A paper diary will be
      used to collect adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medication during run-in and wash-out
      periods.

      Eligible patients will be randomized in 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 6 treatment sequences and
      will receive orally 1 of the following 3 treatments sequence in the form of inhalation powder
      using DPI :

        -  AZD8871 600 µg once daily (double-blind).

        -  Anoro® Ellipta® (55 µg umeclidinium [UMEC]/ 22 µg vilanterol [VI]) once daily
           (double-blind).

        -  Placebo (double-blind). Study treatment administration during all the visits at the
           sites (Day 1, Day 2, Day 8, and Day 14 of each treatment period) will be supervised by
           study personnel.

      During the treatment period Visits, safety and tolerability assessments and pulmonary
      function measurements will be taken pre-dose and up to 24 hours (Day 1) and up to 4 hours
      (Day 8) post-dose, respectively.

      At Visits 3 to 11, a subset of 36 patients will undergo PK assessments. Blood samples will be
      collected pre-dose and up to 24 hours post dose.

      In follow-up visit, AEs, safety laboratory, electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs and physical
      examination will be assessed.

      The study includes 12 visits and the entire study period is scheduled to take from a minimum
      of 6.5 months (182 days) to a maximum of 7.5 months (217 days) for each individual patient.
      The estimated study duration is 12 months.

             at least 6 months prior to Screening) with a history of ≥10 pack-years of cigarette
             smoking [Number of pack-years=(number of cigarettes per day/20)* number of years
             smoked (eg, 1 pack-year=20 cigarettes smoked per day for 1 year)].

          5. Patient with post-bronchodilator FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio &lt;70% based on
             the value reached after inhalation of salbutamol (400 µg) at Visit 2. If criterion is
             not met, the test can be repeated at the latest, up to Day -14.

          6. Patient with post-bronchodilator FEV1 that must be ≥40% and &lt;80% predicted normal
             value at Visit 2. If criterion is not met, the test can be repeated at the latest, up

                  local laboratory.

               -  Post-menopausal; aged ≥50 years and amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more, following
                  cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments.

         11. Male patients should use a condom and spermicide to prevent pregnancy and drug
             exposure of a partner, regardless of the gender or childbearing potential of the
             partner from the day of the first administration of the IP until 3 months after the
             last administration of the IP. In addition to a condom with spermicide, a second
             highly effective method of contraception (oral, intravaginal or transdermal hormonal
             contraceptives, intrauterine device, intrauterine hormone-releasing system, or sexual
             abstinence until 3 months after the last administration of the IP) should be used with
             female partners of childbearing potential. Double barrier methods (a combination of
             male condom with either a cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide) are not considered
             to be highly effective methods of contraception. Male patients with a pregnant partner
             should use a condom and spermicide.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has significant diseases other than COPD, (ie, clinically relevant disease or
             condition or an abnormality in prior ECGs, medical history or physical examinations)
             which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may put the patient at risk because of
             participation in the study or may influence either the results of the study or the
             patient's ability to participate in the study.

          2. Patient has alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency as the cause of COPD.

         13. Patient has clinically significant uncontrolled hypertension (&gt;180 mmHg) as assessed
             by the Investigator.

         14. Patient has seizures or a history of seizures requiring anticonvulsants within 12

             potassium &lt;3.5 mmol/L), which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may either put the
             patient at risk because of participation in the study, or influence the results or the
             patient's ability to participate in the study, or any other safety concerns in the
             opinion of the Investigator. Note: Potassium replacement and re-test is allowed once
             if serum potassium concentration was &lt;3.5 mmol/L at Screening or prior to
             randomisation.

         18. Patient has known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or chronic hepatitis B
             or C infection.

         19. History of malignancy of any organ system, treated or untreated within the past 5
             years, with the exception of localised basal cell carcinoma of the skin.

         20. Patient has known narrow-angle glaucoma.

         21. Patient has a history of drug of abuse within the past 2 years or consuming more than

             for drugs of abuse and alcohol tests at Screening and prior to randomisation.

             Note: If a patient tests positive to any drugs of abuse tests, which cannot be
             explained by use of prescription medication, he/she will be excluded from the study.

             within the last 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to Screening.

             Note: Patient participation in observational studies (ie, studies that do not require
             change to medication or an additional intervention) is not exclusionary.

         26. Previous participation or prior screen failure in the present study.

         27. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca
             staff and/or staff at the study site).

         28. Patient has changed their smoking status (ie, restarted or stopped smoking) or
             initiation of a smoking cessation program within 6 weeks of Screening.

         29. Patient has participated in the acute phase of a pulmonary rehabilitation program
             within 4 weeks prior to Screening or who will enter the acute phase of a pulmonary
             rehabilitation program during the study. A patient in the maintenance phase of a
             pulmonary rehabilitation program is not to be excluded.

         30. Judgment by the Investigator that the patient should not participate in the study if
             the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and
             requirements. Inability to comply with requirements includes having an e-Diary
             completion rate of &lt;70% during the run-in period.
