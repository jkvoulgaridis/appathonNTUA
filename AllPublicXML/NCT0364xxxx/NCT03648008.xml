  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain remains relatively high within 48h for Chinese patients who receive
      video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Multimodal analgesia combines several agents and/or
      techniques to function on diverse nociceptive mechanisms to enhance pain relief and lessen
      side effect. Hydromorphone is a hydrogenated ketone of morphine and approximately 5-10 times
      more potent. There lacks about efficacy and efficiency of hydromorphone in electrical pump
      for patient controlled intravenous analgesic (PCIA).
