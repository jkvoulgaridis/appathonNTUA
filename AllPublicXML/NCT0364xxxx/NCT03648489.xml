  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DICE is a randomised study recruiting 126 women over 3 years from hospitals in the UK and
      Germany. Eligible patients will have tissue based diagnosis of advanced/recurrent ovarian
      cancer (clear cell, endometrioid or high grade serous or carcinosarcoma), have had
      chemotherapy before, and be platinum-resistant (the cancer has returned/grown significantly
      during or within 6 months of platinum-containing chemotherapy).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is for women with ovarian cancer that has come back following treatment, and is
      resistant to platinum chemotherapy. Weekly paclitaxel chemotherapy is standard for these
      women, but there is a need to provide more effective treatments. TAK228 is an unlicensed oral
      drug that blocks the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which is important to the survival and spread of
      cancer cells. When TAK228 is combined with paclitaxel in the laboratory, the anti-cancer
      effect of both is increased. The DICE trial will show whether using TAK228 in combination
      with weekly paclitaxel is more effective at treating the patient population than weekly
      paclitaxel alone. DICE will also look for 'biomarkers' that measure the activity of the
      cancer and the effects of treatment. This may help us understand which women might benefit
      from receiving TAK228 and weekly paclitaxel in future.

      Randomisation will be to one of 2 groups (63 women in each). Treatment is divided into 4 week
      'cycles':

      Group 1: weekly paclitaxel for 3 weeks followed by 1 week rest each cycle

      Group 2: weekly paclitaxel (see Group 1) plus TAK228 for 12 days each cycle

      Women will stop treatment when the cancer grows significantly, there are unacceptable side
      effects, or the investigator and/or patient decides to stop. Women will be followed up until
      6 months after the last patient receiving study treatment stops that treatment.

    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is used to assess the overall quality of life in cancer patients. It consists of 30 questions and 15 domains: 1 global health status (GHS) scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional, Social), and 9 symptom scales/items (Fatigue, Nausea and Vomiting, Pain, Dyspnea, Sleep Disturbance, Appetite Loss, Constipation, Diarrhea, Financial Impact). The EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health Status/QOL scale is scored between 0 and 100, with a high score indicating better Global Health Status/QOL. Negative change from Baseline values indicate deterioration in QOL or functioning and positive values indicate improvement</description>

    <description>EORTC QLQ-OV28 is used to assess the overall health-related quality of life in patients with local or advanced ovarian cancer. EORTC QLQ-OV28 consists of 28 questions evaluated across eight multi-item and 4 single item scales: abdominal/GI symptoms, peripheral neuropathy, hormonal symptoms, body image, attitude to disease/treatment, chemotherapy side effects, and sexuality, and single items scales for indigestion/heartburn, hair loss, upset due to hair loss, and taste. Questions use a 4-point scale (from 1 'Not at All' to 4 'Very Much'). Scores are averaged, and transformed to a 0-100 scale; a higher score represents a more severe overall side effect of treatment</description>
