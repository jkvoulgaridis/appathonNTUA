  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The measurement of markers in the expired breath condensate has proven to be a useful method
      for assessing and monitoring airway inflammation. The aim of this study is to determine the
      amounts of pH in the expired breath condensate of patients with bronchiectasis, and the
      relationship between pH and the severity of bronchiectasis.

      The aim of this study is to determine the amounts of pH in the expired breath condensate of
      patients with bronchiectasis, and the relationship between pH and the severity of
      bronchiectasis. Further clarify the link between EBC pH and the risk of future acute
      exacerbations, mortality and lung function decline through a one-year follow-up. Hoping to
      explore new validated biomarkers of the disease severity and progression in bronchiectasis.
      During the observation, EBC pH and other valid indicators will be measured when patients were
      enrolled. In the subgroup study, these indicators were tested repeatedly in exacerbation
      start, exacerbation recovery (after 14 days of antibiotic therapy), stable2 (at the second
      stable measurement 6 months later). To determine whether it could be used as an &quot;signal
      searching&quot; or &quot;early efficacy&quot; end-point for new antibiotics or anti-inflammatory therapies

        The age of all subjects are older than 18 . The diagnosis of bronchiectasis need reference
        to the guideline published by BTS in 2010 or 2012 China bronchiectasis expert consensus,
        clinical symptoms of cough and expectoration, with or without intermittent hemoptysis, and
        chest CT showed bronchiectasis there.All patients were clinically stable and had no
        evidence of exacerbation for at least 4 weeks before the study and had a negative history
        of allergy. None of patients had reversibility with inhaled salbutamol of 12% or more of
        predicted FEV1; All normal subjects had a negative history of allergy and normal lung
        function, they have no history of any lung disease (except for the history of pneumonia in
        the past time and small pulmonary nodules).
