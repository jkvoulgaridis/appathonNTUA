  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are limited knowledge about the impact of increased pre-operative physical training on
      postoperative physical activity levels as well as on recovery and complication rates after
      bariatric surgery.

      The primary aim of this study is to investigate whether an intervention including individual
      coaching to improve level of physical activity before and after gastric bypass surgery leads
      to a changed of level physical activity post-operatively at eight weeks, one and two years.

      Secondary aims of the study are to investigate whether increased physical activity has
      effects on complication rates, re-admissions and re-operations, post-operative weight-loss,
      gastrointestinal pain, recovery measured as hospital stay, sick-leave and QoL, resumption of
      normal physical activity.

      METHODS 300 patients will be recruited and randomized to an intervention group or control
      group. The patients in the intervention group will receive individual coaching by a physical
      therapist to:

        -  increase physical activity 30 minutes/day (At least 150 min/week)

        -  decrease time spent sitting/lying The patients in the control group will receive
           standard care.

      Before surgery, 6 weeks, and one year after surgery patient will fill in a questionnaire
      including level of physical activity, sick leave, quality of life and gastrointestinal pain.
      In addition blood test will be taken and complication rates recorded.
