  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep propensity was assessed in terms of the duration of a spontaneous episode of
      wakefulness (W). Skin temperatures at six body sites (the abdomen, pectoral region, eye,
      hand, thigh and foot) were measured (using infrared thermography) during nocturnal
      polysomnography in 29 9-day-old preterm neonates (postmenstrual age: 209 9 days). Te
      investigators then determined whether the duration of the W episode depended upon the local
      skin temperatures measured at the start, during and end of the episode.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although sleep is of paramount importance for preterm neonates, care of the latter in a
      neonatal intensive care unit does not favour sleep. Given that several studies in adults have
      described a 'vegetative preparedness to sleep' (in which distal skin vasodilation before
      lights-out promotes rapid sleep onset), the investigators looked at whether or not this
      process operates in preterm neonates. Sleep propensity was assessed in terms of the duration
      of a spontaneous episode of wakefulness (W). Skin temperatures at six body sites (the
      abdomen, pectoral region, eye, hand, thigh and foot) were measured (using infrared
      thermography) during nocturnal polysomnography in 29 9-day-old preterm neonates
      (postmenstrual age: 209 9 days).

    <description>The objective of this study is to evaluate the thermal confort (variability of the heart and respiratory frequencies) of preterm infant placed in a clmosed incubator to reduce the thermal stress of the very premature newborn (&lt; 32 weeks of amenorrhea) during the first 10 days of life.</description>

    <description>The infants are placed in a closed incubator to study the variability of the heart and respiratory frequencies according to the regulation of the incubator and to quantify the time spent outside. Data will be collected during the first 10 days of life of the preterm infant. Skin temperatures at six body sites (the abdomen, pectoral region, eye, hand, thigh and foot) were measured (using infrared thermography) during nocturnal polysomnography in 29 9-day-old preterm neonates (postmenstrual age:
209 9 days). The investigators then determined whether the duration of the W episode depended upon the local skin temperatures measured at the start, during and end of the episode.</description>
