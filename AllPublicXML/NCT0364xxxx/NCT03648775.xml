  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIP50 is a national, multicentre, prospective, observational study, in patients presenting a
      first low energy per trochanteric hip fracture on one side and treated with Y-STRUT® device
      implanted on the contralateral proximal femur as percutaneous internal fixation to prevent
      contralateral hip fracture in case of osteoporosis.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the studied
      medical device by measuring the frequency of patient with a fracture at the implantation site
      within 1 year after implantation.

      A total of 50 patients from France will be enrolled (until December 2020) and followed up to
      24 months.
