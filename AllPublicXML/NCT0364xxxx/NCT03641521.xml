    <textblock>
      A community nutrition trial among a diverse low-income population that tested the effect of
      parent-child cooking nutrition intervention on vegetable intake among 9-12 children.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was a nonrandomized, controlled trial to determine whether a series of 6 weekly
      parent-child vegetable cooking skills classes and parent-led strategies informed by
      behavioral economics (1/week) (intervention group) improved dietary and non-dietary outcomes
      of a racially and ethnically diverse sample of low-income children (ages 9-12) more than a
      vegetable cooking skills program alone (control group).

    <time_frame>change from baseline to 9 weeks post-baseline (i.e., immediate post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Child cooking skills self-efficacy was measured using scales that have shown internal consistency and test-retest reliability in a psychometric evaluation of a cooking-based nutrition education intervention among low-income 9-11 year old children (Cronbach α = ≥ 0.74, test-retest r ≥ 0.66).(Lohse B, Cunningham-Sabo L, Walters LM, Stacey JE. Valid and Reliable Measures of Cognitive Behaviors toward Fruits and Vegetables for Children Aged 9 to 11 Years. J Nutr Educ Behav. 2011;43:42-49. doi:10.1016/j.jneb.2009.12.006). Response options for the child self-efficacy questions: 1 = YES! - 5 = NO!). The child-self-efficacy scale was calculated by summing 8 items measuring self-efficacy. A lower score indicated greater self-efficacy and more positive attitudes toward cooking.</description>

    <description>Parents completed the Cooking Matters for Families Before and After Course Survey to assess change in cooking skills confidence. Internal consistency and ability of the scales to reflect positive self-reported changes were previously among low-income adults (Pinard CA, Uvena LM, Quam JB, Smith TM, Yaroch AL. Development and testing of a revised cooking matters for adults survey. Am J Health Behav. 2015;39(6):866-873. doi:10.5993/AJHB.39.6.14). Response options for the 4 cooking confidence questions: (4 items, 1 = not at all confident - 5 = very confident). An aggregate score for each parent was tabulated by averaging the 4 questions. A higher score indicated greater cooking skills confidence.</description>

The following six behavioral strategies were introduced (one each week) as a segment of each cooking skills session: 1) have your child help prepare vegetables for meals (Child Help), 2) use a plate that shows the amount of vegetables to include for a meal (My Plate), 3) make vegetables visible and accessible by removing other foods from the dining area during the meal and leaving the vegetables (Make Avail/Visible), 4) serve at least 2 vegetables with the meal (Serve 2), 5) serve vegetables before the meal (Serve First), and 6) use a bigger spoon to serve the vegetables (Big Spoon).</description>
