  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study of Nexvax2, in adults
      subjects with confirmed CeD who have been following a gluten free diet for at least 12
      consecutive months prior to screening. This study will evaluate efficacy of Nexvax2
      administered subcutaneously. The study plan consists of 3 periods: a screening period of 6
      weeks, an approximately 16 week treatment period, and a 4 week post-treatment observational
      follow-up.

    <measure>Efficacy of Nexvax2 compared to placebo in reducing Celiac Disease (CeD) associated GI symptoms.</measure>
    <time_frame>79 to 93 days after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the CeD Patient Reported Outcome (CeD PRO) between baseline and day of the first masked food challenge (MFC) containing gluten. The CeD PRO captures patient ratings for a number of CeD-associated symptoms, on a 0 to 10 scale, with 0 being absent or no symptoms, and 10 being the most severe symptoms. The Total GI domain score is calculated as an average of summed average and individual symptom scores relevant to the GI tract, to yield a value of 0 to 10.</description>

    <description>Differences in each of the individual GI item scores in the CeD PRO between baseline and day of the first MFC containing gluten. GI symptoms assessed on the CeD PRO include abdominal cramping, abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, gas, loose stool, and nausea. Each are rated on a 0 to 10 scale, where 0 is absent and 10 is the most severe.</description>

    <description>Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be summarized by treatment arm, severity, relationship to study drug and to known or potential gluten exposure, and phase of treatment and presented as the number and percentage of patients reporting an event(s) as well as the number of events reported.</description>
