  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center, phase 1 safety study to investigate the safety,
      tolerability, seizure control, and quality of life in participants with medically-refractory
      epilepsy who failed epilepsy surgery. These participants will have continued seizures despite
      being at least 3 months post-epilepsy surgery (resective surgery with an intent to cure).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seizures that are refractory to both medical and surgical therapy increase the risk of
      morbidity and mortality in children with epilepsy. At this point in time, options for these
      children are sparse and suboptimal. This hypothesis-driven phase 1 study aims to evaluate the
      use of a mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR] inhibitor, ABI-009, in this subset of
      challenging participants. The underlying hypotheses being tested in trial are: (1) ABI-009 is
      a safe and well-tolerated medication in children who have medically-refractory epilepsy and
      have failed epilepsy surgery, and (2) The addition of ABI-009 therapy to the current clinical
      standard of continued antiepileptic medications results in improved epilepsy control. This is
      unique among trials of anti-epileptic medications in that it also studies mTOR inhibition in
      a non-Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) specific population for whom few additional effective
      therapies exist.

      Upon enrollment, participants will be continued and observed on their pre-existing,
      clinically prescribed antiepileptic drug (AED) regimen for 1 month. At the 1-month mark,
      participants will receive weekly ABI-009 intravenously at different dose levels in cohorts of
      3 participants each using the standard 3+3 dose-finding design. ABI-009 will be continued for
      a total of 3 weeks. ABI-009 will then be discontinued and the participants will be observed
      for an additional 3 months. The investigators intend an expansion of the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) cohort to an estimated additional 6 participants for a maximum possible enrollment
      of 18 participants.

    <intervention_model_description>Participation includes a 4-week baseline period, a 3-week dosing period and a 12-week follow-up period. After baseline participants will receive ABI-009 given weekly IV for 3 weeks. ABI-009 will be tested in cohorts of 3 participants using the standard 3+3 dose-finding design.
Escalation to the next dose level with a new cohort of 3 participants will occur after no DLT was observed. There will be no intra-participant dose escalation allowed. If DLT occurs in a cohort, an additional 3 participants will be recruited to the cohort. If no further DLTs occur, a new cohort of 3 participants at the next higher dose level can be enrolled. If 2/6 participants at dose level 1 experience a DLT, then that cohort will be closed to further enrollment and 3 participants will be enrolled at the next lower dose level, and so on. The MTD is the highest dose level in which ≤1 participant has a DLT.
Once MTD has been determined, MTD cohort will be opened for up to 6 additional participants.</intervention_model_description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent (and assent when applicable) obtained from participant or
             participant's legal representative

          2. Be willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements

          3. Male or female ≥3 and ≤26 years of age at Visit 1 b. Because no dosing or adverse
             event data are currently available on the use of ABI-009 or other mTOR inhibitors in
             participants &lt;3 years of age, these young children are excluded from this study.

          4. Documentation of a diagnosis of medically intractable epilepsy as defined by the
             failure of at least 2 appropriately dosed and tolerated AEDs to eliminate all clinical
             seizures over a 6-month period (prior to epilepsy surgery)

          5. Documentation of resective epilepsy surgery following appropriate pre-surgical
             evaluation

          6. Documentation of continued clinical seizures that persist at least 3 months following
             resective epilepsy surgery. In order to proceed with drug administration, participants
             will have to have had &gt;8 seizures in the last 30 days without 2 weeks of seizure
             freedom, as noted by a daily seizure diary.

          7. Documentation that the participant is not a candidate for OR refuses any additional
             resective epilepsy surgery

          8. Participants must have adequate bone marrow function (ANC ≥1,000/mm3, platelet count
             of ≥100,000/mm3, and hemoglobin ≥9 gm/dL) before starting study drug.

          9. Participants must have adequate liver function (SGPT/ALT ≤5 times ULN and bilirubin ≤5
             times ULN) before starting study drug.

         10. Participants must have adequate renal function, defined as: Creatinine clearance or
             radioisotope GFR &gt;/= 70mL/min/1.73 m2 or a serum creatinine based on age/gender as
             follows:

         11. Participants must have a fasting cholesterol level &lt;350 mg/dL and triglycerides &lt;400
             mg/dL before starting study drug. In case one or both of these are exceeded, the
             participant can only be included after initiation of appropriate lipid lowering
             medication and documentation of cholesterol &lt;350mg/dL and triglycerides &lt;400mg/dl
             before start of study drug.

         12. Participants must have normal oxygen saturation.

         13. The effects of ABI-009 on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic
             dose are unknown. For this reason and because rapamycin is known to be teratogenic,
             female participants of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a female participant become
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should
             inform her treating physician immediately.

               1. Participants of child bearing potential must not be breastfeeding or pregnant as
                  evidenced by a negative pregnancy test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. For females of child bearing potential:

               1. Positive pregnancy test at Visit 1, or

               2. Lactating, or

               3. Unwilling to practice a medically acceptable form of contraception (acceptable
                  forms of contraception: abstinence, hormonal birth control, intrauterine device,
                  or barrier method plus a spermicidal agent), unless surgically sterilized or
                  postmenopausal during the study.

          2. Has any other condition that, in the opinion of the Site Investigator/designee, would
             preclude informed consent or assent, make study participation unsafe, complicate
             interpretation of study outcome data, or otherwise interfere with achieving the study
             objectives.

          3. Participants should not receive immunization with attenuated live vaccines within one
             week of study entry or during study period. Close contact with those who have received
             attenuated live vaccines should be avoided during the ABI-009 dosing period. Examples
             of live vaccines include intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio,
             BCG, yellow fever, varicella and TY21a typhoid vaccines.

          4. HBsAg and HCVAb blood test must be done at screening (HBsAg only needs to be screened
             in patients who have not received the full complement of Hepatitis B immunizations).
             Patients who test positive for Hepatitis C antibodies or the Hepatitis B antigen are
             ineligible. Alternatively, if the patient has received the complement of Hepatitis B
             immunizations, this would suffice.

          5. A known history of HIV seropositivity. HIV-positive patients on combination
             antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic
             interactions with ABI-009. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal
             infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.

          6. Patients receiving chronic, systemic treatment with corticosteroids or another
             immunosuppressive agent. Note: Patients that are currently using inhaled, intranasal,
             ocular, topical or other non-oral or non-IV steroids are not necessarily excluded from
             the study but need to be discussed with the study chair.

          7. Patients who have been previously treated with a systemic mTOR inhibitor for epilepsy.
             Skin cream use with rapamycin or everolimus, however, is permitted.

          8. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to human albumin, ABI-009 or other rapamycins
             (e.g. sirolimus, everolimus, temsirolimus).

          9. Patients receiving any other concurrent anticancer or investigational therapy.
             Participants will be permitted to enroll in the study after a 30-day washout of
             previously used investigational drugs.

         10. Patients with any clinically significant unrelated systemic illness that would
             compromise a participant's ability to tolerate protocol procedures.

         11. Patients with inability to return for dosing and follow-up visits to assess toxicity
             to the study drug.

         12. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, active lung disease, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements. Study Specific Tolerance for
             Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Patients who fail to meet one or more of the inclusion
             criteria or who meet any of the exclusion criteria will not be enrolled in this study.
             Waivers of any of the above study entry criteria will not be granted.
