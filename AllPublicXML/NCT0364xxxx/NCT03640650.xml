  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This real-life Health Economics and Outcome Research (HEOR) study will enable to evaluate the
      economic impact of Dropless therapy for the prophylactic treatment of inflammation and
      infection after routine cataract surgery. This prospective randomized controlled crossover
      open-label study will estimate resource utilization and cost attributable to patients'
      management following a cataract surgery and until last follow-up visit and adherence,
      satisfaction and preference between usual care and Dropless in a real-life setting.

      Data collected will include patients' characteristics and demographics, medical information,
      cataract surgery information, healthcare resource utilization, patients' adherence to topical
      ophthalmic medications as well as patients' satisfaction to both treatment and preference
      between usual care and Dropless. Patients will fill a set of questionnaires at their
      recruitment in the study and at their last follow-up visit for their two cataracts surgery.

    <description>Single used, pre-mixed, centrally compounded injectable that contains 15 mg/ml of triamcinolone acetonide and 1 mg/ml of moxifloxacin. This preservative-free suspension is injected at a dose of 0.2 mg into the posterior chamber, for a total drug delivery of 3 mg of triamcinolone acetonide and 0.2 mg of moxifloxacin. At the time of cataract surgery, Dropless is intended to be injected as a single administration into the anterior vitreous after the insertion of the IOL implant, with a 27 or 30-gauge cannula via a transzonular or transsceral pars plana injection, just before rinsing the viscoelastic fluid.</description>

    <description>This therapy usually comprises an antibiotic, a steroid and in some cases a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Antibacterial drops are usually given at the end of surgery and are continued for one week after the surgery. Steroid drops are usually started the day of surgery and then tapered down over 3 to 4 weeks. When prescribed, NSAIDs are usually started 2 or 3 days before surgery, or started the day of surgery, and continued for 3 or 4 times a day for 3 to 4 weeks.</description>
