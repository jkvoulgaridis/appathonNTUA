  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe haemophilia B (HB) is a bleeding disorder where a protein made by the body to help
      make blood clot is either partly or completely missing. This protein is called a clotting
      factor; with severe HB, levels of clotting Factor IX (nine; FIX) are very low and affected
      individuals can suffer life threatening bleeding episodes. HB mainly affects boys and men
      (approximately one in every 30,000 males). Current treatment for HB involves intravenous
      infusions of FIX as regular treatment (prophylaxis) or 'on demand' treatment. On demand
      treatment is highly effective at stopping bleeding but cannot fully reverse long-term damage
      that follows after a bleed. Regular treatment can prevent bleeding; however it is invasive
      for patients and also expensive.

      This clinical study aims to investigate the long-term safety and durability of FIX activity
      in participants who have been dosed with a new gene therapy product (FLT180a) in earlier
      clinical studies. Following administration, FLT180a results in production of FIX in the
      participants' liver cells which is then released into the blood stream. The aim is to have
      the participants' own body produce levels of FIX that allow for clotting to occur as normal
      as would be seen in a non-HB individual. This would remove the need for prophylaxis or on
      demand treatment following just a single administration of FLT180a.

      Up to 50 participants who have already been administered with FLT180a in the EU and US will
      take part in this study. Participants will be followed up in this trial until they have
      reached 15 years after being dosed. Participants will undergo procedures including physical
      examinations, join assessments, blood tests and liver ultrasounds. Participants will also
      need to complete a diary to document occurrence of bleeding episodes and record the amount of
      Factor IX concentrate they receive. Patient reports outcomes including measures of Quality of
      Life, disability and physical activity will also be collected.
