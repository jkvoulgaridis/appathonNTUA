      Patients with Her2 negative, previously untreated metastatic esophagogastric adenocarcinoma
      will be treated with modified FOLFOX or with modified FOLFOX plus Nivolumab and Ipilimumab.
      The groups will be compared for time until progression of the disease (primary endpoint) as
      well as for response to the treatment, overall survival, safety/tolerability of the treatment
      and quality of life.

      This is a randomized, open labelled multicenter phase II trial. Patients with Her2 negative,
      previously untreated metastatic esophagogastric adenocarcinoma will be randomized to receive
      either modified FOLFOX (Oxaliplatin at a dose of 85 mg/m² iv over two hours (day 1),
      Leucovorin at a dose of 400 mg/m2 iv over two hours (day 1), Fluorouracil at a dose of 400
      mg/m² iv bolus (day 1), and Fluorouracil at a dose of 2400 mg/m² iv continuous infusion over
      44 hours (day 1+2), every 2 weeks) alone or modified FOLFOX plus Nivolumab (240mg &quot;Flatdose&quot;
      i.v. d1 every 2 weeks) and Ipilimumab (1mg/kg i.v. d1 every 6 weeks) or sequential treatment
      (three cycles of induction chemotherapy with modified FOLFOX followed by immunotherapy
      consisting of 4 administrations of Nivolumab at 240mg &quot;Flatdose&quot; i.v. d1 every 2 weeks and 2
      administrations of Ipilimumab at 1mg/kg i.v. d1 every 6 weeks, this sequence may be repeated
      starting two weeks after last administration of immunotherapy once, or, if medically
      reasonable, for an unlimited number of repetitions upon investigator decision; after
      completion or discontinuation of chemotherapy, immunotherapy will be continued consisting of
      Nivolumab at 240mg &quot;Flatdose&quot; i.v. d1 every 2 weeks and Ipilimumab at 1mg/kg i.v. d1 every 6
      weeks) for a maximum of 24 months or until disease progression or inacceptable toxicity or
      end of study treatment.

      The primary objective is to determine the clinical performance of ipilimumab in combination
      with nivolumab and FOLFOX in patients with previously untreated HER2 negative locally
      advanced or metastatic esophagogastric adenocarcinoma in terms of progression free survival
      (acc. to RECIST v1.1).

      Secondary objectives are to determine efficacy in terms of objective response rate (acc. to
      RECIST v1.1) and overall survival, as well as tolerability (acc. to NCI CTC AE v4.03) of the
      experimental regimen. In addition histopathological types and molecular parameters such as
      immune cell composition and PD-L1 expression as determined by quantitative mRNA (RT-PCR) will
      be correlated with efficacy in an exploratory analysis.

      207 subjects (59 in the control arm, and 89 in the experimental treatment group A1 and 59 in
      the experimental treatment group A2) will be randomized.

             to avoid pregnancy for approximately 5 months (30 days plus the time required for
             nivolumab to undergo 5 half-lives) after the last dose of investigational drug.

         15. Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for
             method(s) of contraception for a period of 90 days (duration of sperm turnover) plus
             the time required for the investigational drug to undergo 5 half-lives. The terminal
             half-lives of nivolumab and ipilimumab are approximately 25 days and 15 days,
             respectively. Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must continue contraception for
             approximately 7 months (90 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo 5

             must be willing to refrain from sperm donation during this time.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Malignancies other than disease under study within 5 years prior to inclusion, with
             the exception of those with a negligible risk of metastasis or death (e.g., expected
             5-year OS &gt; 90%) treated with expected curative outcome (such as adequately treated
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix, basal or squamous cell skin cancer, localized
             prostate cancer treated surgically with curative intent, ductal carcinoma in situ
             treated surgically with curative intent)

          2. Subjects with untreated symptomatic CNS metastases. Subjects are eligible if CNS
             metastases are asymptomatic (this includes patients with unknown CNS metastatic status
             who have no clinical signs of CNS metastases) or those with asymptomatic or
             symptomatic CNS who are adequately treated and are neurologically returned to baseline
             (except for residual signs or symptoms related to the CNS treatment) for at least 2
             weeks prior to randomization. In addition, subjects must be either off
             corticosteroids, or on a stable or decreasing dose of &lt; 10 mg daily prednisone (or
             equivalent) for at least 2 weeks prior to randomization. Patients with unknown CNS
             metastatic status and any clinical signs indicative of CNS metastases are eligible if
             CNS metastases are excluded using CT and/or MRI scans, or CNS metastases are confirmed
             but adequately treated as described above.

          3. Subjects with active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects with Type I
             diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune thyroiditis only
             requiring hormone replacement, or skin disorders (such as vitiligo, psoriasis, or
             alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment are permitted to enroll. For any cases of
             uncertainty, it is recommended that the medical monitor be consulted prior to signing
             informed consent.

          4. Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;
             10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14
             days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal
             replacement doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of
             active autoimmune disease.

          5. Prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or anti-CTLA-4

          8. Known Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency

          9. Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder or active infection that, in the opinion
             of the investigator, may increase the risk associated with study participation, study
             drug administration, or would impair the ability of the subject to receive study drug.

         10. Ascites which cannot be controlled with appropriate interventions.

         11. Unstable cardiac disease despite treatment, myocardial infarction within 6 months
