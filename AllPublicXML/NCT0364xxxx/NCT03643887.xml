  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are
      multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs) associated with healthcare settings and are a high
      priority for containment in public health. Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) like VRE
      and CRE lengthen the duration of a hospital stay, increase the cost of hospitalization, and
      increase mortality. Because colonization precedes infection, prevention or treatment of
      VRE/CRE colonization is essential. We propose a treatment approach to promote gut
      decolonization by VRE and CRE without using antibiotics. Participants enrolled in this study
      will be randomized a one-time dose of either study drug or placebo, will be followed for 6
      months, and will submit stool samples for analysis of several outcomes for the trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial assessing the effects
      of one-time oral FMT on the composition and function of the gut microbiome compared to
      placebo in a population of patients with baseline CRE or VRE gut colonization. Participants
      will be adults who have had two consecutive positive stool cultures for VRE or CRE and meet
      all inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients (N=90) will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio.
      Randomization will be double-blinded. Each subject will be followed for 6 months. Stool
      samples will be taken at baseline and from subjects weekly for 4 weeks, then every 4 weeks
      for 8 weeks, then at 6 months regardless of treatment group. All patients will be asked to
      complete a stool diary
