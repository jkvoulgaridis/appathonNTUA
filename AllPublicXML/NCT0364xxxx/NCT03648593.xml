  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized intervention study to promote work recovery and work ability among
      micro-entrepreneurs. The main aim is to investigate if the use of Recovery! -application
      results in better work recovery and work ability than no treatment for micro-entrepreneurs.

      The plan of action of the study merges: 1) the contents that are based on the needs of the
      target population and evidence from research on work related and health behaviour enhancing
      work recovery, 2) theoretical framework for the counselling, 3) counselling methods including
      behaviour change techniques, and 4) tailoring the content and counselling according to trans
      theoretical change model and physical work demands. The intervention is delivered through
      native mobile application designed by using the abovementioned methodology.

      Data are collected by repeated internet-based questionnaires (at baseline, 2 and 6 months
      from the beginning of the intervention) and from the use of mobile application. Furthermore,
      randomly selected persons in two groups (20-30 persons in each) are interviewed. Process
      evaluation is conducted to detect the mechanisms of change and to study why the program
      succeeded or failed.
