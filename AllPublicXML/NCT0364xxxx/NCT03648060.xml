  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed to assess the efficacy of a home-based rehabilitation program using a
      digital kinematic biofeedback system after total hip or knee replacement.

      This is a single-arm prospective study. Patients will be enrolled pre-operatively and will
      perform an 8-week rehabilitation program starting between day 7 and 10 after surgery.

      This program will consist of rehabilitation sessions performed independently by the patient
      at under remote monitoring from a physical therapist.

      Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 4 weeks into the rehabilitation program and at the end
      of the program.

      The primary outcome is the change in patient performance measure through the Timed-up-and-Go
      (TUG) test in comparison with the pre-operative score. Secondary outcomes will be measured in
      terms of: a) patient reported outcomes (Hip or Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) and b)
      range of motion of the relevant joint (hip or knee).
