    <textblock>
      This project explores whether children have better growth and cognitive development when the
      clinic identifies &quot;higher risk&quot; MAM children and support them either with the same treatment
      as SAM children or with the recommended practice: nutrition counseling.

    <textblock>
      This is a cluster-randomized controlled trial taking place in 20 community clinics providing
      malnutrition care in Sierra Leone.

      All participants will be children aged 6-59 months. Control participants will have moderate
      acute malnutrition (MAM), defined as mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) 11.5-12.5. High Risk
      MAM will be defined with a MUAC 11.5 to &lt;11.9 or WAZ&lt;-3.5 or Mother not the caretaker or not
      breastfeeding at &lt;2 years old. Low risk MAM will defined with a MUAC 11.9 to 12.4 with no
      risk factors.

      Control group and low risk group caregiver's will received nutrition education via mother
      care groups every two weeks for 6 weeks and will be followed up 12 and 24 weeks
      post-enrollment.

      High risk group will receive 2 weeks supply of amoxicillin at enrollment and 1 sachet of RUTF
      per day till MUAC is &gt;12.5 or up to 12 weeks of treatment. Their caregiver will also receive
      nutrition education via the mother care groups. The investigators will also follow up with
      the participant at 12 and 24 weeks post-enrollment.

      A subset of the participants in each group will also be enrolled in a cognitive development
      substudy were the investigators will be using a eye tracking performance assessment.
      Investigators will also enroll health adult participants for eye tracking assessment. Adult
      data will be used as a reference when interpreting results.
