    <textblock>
      Background: Type 1 diabetes is one of the most common chronic illnesses among children and
      adolescents. Although, intensive medical care is provided for these patients, some of them
      have poor metabolic control. For example, only 21% of adolescents with type 1 diabetes in the
      USA achieve the recommended average blood sugar concentration (HbA1c&lt;7.5%). This is a major
      problem, since chronic hyperglycemia is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in type
      1 diabetes and causes several serious complications, for example kidney failure, blindness,
      and stroke. Therefore, the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes
      (ISPAD) declared psychosocial factors, to be the most important risk factors of poor type 1
      diabetes Management. Therefore, an instrument is needed to identify children and adolescents
      with poor metabolic control in their course of disease as soon as possible. With an early
      identification of such risk patients, better support can be provided. However, there is no
      such instrument yet for pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes. To fill this gap, a
      questionnaire (FEPB) based on the PAT 2.0© (Psychosocial Assessment Tool; an instrument used
      in oncology) was developed for this project.

      Aim: The aim of this project is to evaluate and validate a new instrument (FEPB) for an early
      identification of children and adolescents with poor metabolic control in their course of
      disease in a longitudinal design.

      Method: The sample consists of children and adolescents (age: 5-18 years), who were newly
      diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (2-4 weeks ago), and who are in care at the University
      Children's Hospital of Zurich. Structured interviews are conducted with the patients and the
      parents are asked to fill out some questionnaires at two times: first, 2-4 weeks after the
      diagnosis (T1) and second 6 month later (T2). With the new instrument (FEPB) a risk score can
      be calculated for each patient at T1. Statistical analysis will be performed to determine
      whether that risk score can predict which patients have poor metabolic control (HbA1c &gt; 7.5%)
      at T2.
