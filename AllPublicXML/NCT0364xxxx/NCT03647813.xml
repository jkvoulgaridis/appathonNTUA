  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      End-stage renal disease patients undergoing hemodialysis can present alteration in flow,
      concentrations and composition of saliva affecting oral health. This randomized
      placebo-controlled trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of photobiomodulation therapy
      (PBM) in salivary parameters in chronic renal failure (CRF) patients undergoing hemodialysis.
      Forty-four patients with CRF on hemodialysis self-responded two questionnaires for oral
      health and salivary gland function perception. Thereafter, patients were clinically evaluated
      for the diagnosis of hypofunction of salivary glands and were randomly allocated into two
      groups: PBM group (n = 21), which received three irradiations of laser at ʎ = 808 nm, 100 mW,
      142 J/cm2 and 4 J per point; and a placebo group (n = 17) that consisted of laser protocol
      with the device switched off. Patients were first submitted to sialometry and after to PBM or
      placebo intervention at baseline, 7 and 14 days. Non-stimulated and stimulated saliva were
      collected for salivary volume investigation and biochemical analysis of total protein,
      calcium and urea concentrations.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 days and 14 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Non-stimulated salivary collection was obtained with patient seated with heads slightly forward and a graduated collector tube positioned under the lower lip for 5 minutes to collect saliva. To obtain the stimulated saliva, patients stayed in the same position and chewed a piece of silicone of a standard size for 5 minutes. All the saliva produced was dispensed in another graduated tube. Salivary volumes were calculated using the difference in weight before and after collection provided a ratio with the volume in milliliters of expelled saliva. An analysis of salivary total proteins, urea and calcium levels were quantified in triplicates using colorimetric analysis with commercially available kits (Bioclin, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais,Brazil) and a spectrophotometer (Anthos 2020 - Asys - Austria) end point methods The absorbance for each marker was measured using the wavelength indicated by manufacture.</description>

    <description>Patients were submitted to three sessions of PBM (baseline, 7 and 14 days). PBMT was administered by a single professional using a continuous wave AsGaAl diode laser (Photon Lase III - DMC, São Paulo, Brazil) with a wavelength of 808 nm (infrared). Irradiation was performed in punctual contact mode (ʎ = 808 nm, 100 mW, 142 J/cm2 and 4 J per point). A total of 20 points were applied in each session/day being three extraoral points in the parotid region (right and left n=6), three points in buccal mucosa (right and left, n=6), two extraoral (right and left, n=4) and two intraoral (right and left, n=4) points in the submandibular and sublingual regions.</description>
