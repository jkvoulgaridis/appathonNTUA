      The phase 2 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of bortezomib in combination with
      lenalidomide as maintenance therapy in high risk newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients
      who receive lenalidomide,bortezomib, and dexamethasone Combination as induction therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of front-line therapy for multiple myeloma (MM) is to substantially decrease tumor
      burden, either in preparation for consolidation with high-dose melphalan therapy with
      autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) or as a means in itself to provide long-term
      disease control. The degree of disease reduction is associated with improved outcome,
      including prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS),both after
      preparation for or after consolidation with ASCT,and in patients not proceeding to ASCT.The
      introduction of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and the immunomodulatory drugs
      thalidomide and lenalidomide has been associated with improved survival. Combinations of
      bortezomib or lenalidomide with conventional anti-MM drugs have demonstrated very high
      overall response rates and quality of response in the front-line setting, as reviewed
      recently.The phase 2 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of bortezomib in combination
      with lenalidomide as maintenance therapy in high risk newly diagnosed multiple myeloma
      patients who receive lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone(VRD) Combination as
      induction therapy.The investigators gave patients subcutaneous bortezomib on days 1, 8,15,
      and 22; oral lenalidomide on days 1 to 21; and oral dexamethasone on days 1, 8, 15 and 12 of
      a 28-day cycle.Patients are allowed to interrupt therapy for collection of stem cells at any
      time after three cycles of induction, and to proceed to stem-cell transplantation after four
      cycles of induction at the discretion of the treating physician.Two months after hematologic
      recovery, nonprogressive patients are to receive consolidation therapy comprising two 4-week
      cycles of VRD.Patients who do not proceed to stem-cell transplantation receive more two
      induction cycles after obtaining maximum response but no less than six cycles totally.
      Responding patients could receive maintenance therapy comprising 4-week cycles of bortezomib
      on days 1 and 15 and lenalidomide on days 1 to 21 at the dose level of 10mg.Participants
      discontinued treatment if participants had progressive disease or unacceptable toxic eff ects
      not controlled with dose modifications.
