  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is commonplace after cardiothoracic
      surgery. A rate control strategy by using short-acting beta blockers is recommended as a
      first-line therapy in patients without hemodynamic instability. Microcirculatory effects of
      POAF and esmolol have not been yet investigated. The investigators made the hypothesis that
      POAF without hemodynamic instability would induce microvascular dysfunction which could be
      reversed by intravenous esmolol.

    <measure>effects of POAF without hemodynamic instability on near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) parameters in combination with a vascular occlusion test</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>NIRS parameters were restoration speed and desaturation speed. Desaturation speed and resaturation speed of the study were assessed during POAF without esmolol and after a stabilization period of 45 min between each dose of esmolol. An automated pneumatic cuff inflator was positioned at the upper extremity of the ipsilateral upper limb. After completion of a baseline set of measurements for each patient, a rapid arterial occlusion of the upper limb was provoked by inflation of the pneumatic cuff at 50 mmHg above the systolic arterial pressure, up to the StO2 value decreases to 40% or for a maximal period of 10 minutes. The arterial cuff was then rapidly deflated to initiate reperfusion.</description>
