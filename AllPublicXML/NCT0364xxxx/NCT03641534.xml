  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis and severe malaria together contribute to an estimated 13 million deaths annually, a
      great burden of which is in low-income countries. Optimal fluid management is critical yet
      remains one of the most challenging clinical care elements as volume overload precipitates
      pulmonary edema and volume restriction may exacerbate acute kidney injury. These
      complications of sepsis and severe malaria significantly increase mortality, particularly in
      resource-limited settings lacking mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy.
      Point-of-care ultrasound and passive leg raise testing are two easily implementable, safe and
      non-invasive clinical bedside fluid assessment tools that could be applied towards developing
      a fluid management algorithm in low resource settings. Similarly, simple tissue perfusion
      measures can facilitate understanding of precise indications or contraindication to fluid and
      vasopressor therapy.

      However, the performance of these tools has yet to be confirmed in these settings. Accurate
      assessment of pulmonary tolerance and fluid responsive patients could aid to tailor
      vasopressor and fluid therapy to the patient condition and disease phase, thus preventing or
      detecting iatrogenic pulmonary edema and other pulmonary complications. As there is currently
      limited evidence supporting fluid management recommendations for severe malaria and sepsis in
      low-resource settings, the potential application of these management tools could optimize
      supportive therapy and improve outcomes in these populations.

      The main activity proposed is a prospective, observational study of patients with sepsis and
      severe malaria to describe the relationship between fluid therapy and vasopressor therapy
      against measures of tissue perfusion and pulmonary congestion in adult patients with severe
      malaria or severe sepsis. In addition, the study will assess the performance of simple
      bedside clinical tools assessing fluid responsiveness, pulmonary congestion and peripheral
      tissue perfusion.

      The data from this observational study will facilitate the preparation of a follow-up study
      to test a clinical algorithm to guide individualized fluid and vasopressor administration.

      This will be a single center, prospective, longitudinal, observational study of patients with
      sepsis or severe malaria. It is planned that this initial observational study will inform a
      follow-up intervention study, based on the observational study findings (Lung Ultrasound and
      Passive Leg Raising- guided Vasopressors and Fluid Management in Patients with Sepsis and
      Severe Malaria). The follow-up study will propose testing of a clinical algorithm to
      individualize titration of vasopressors, diuretics and fluids based on the simple tools
      evaluated during the observational study.

      The expected duration of study patient participation is 30 days. Patients will be assessed
      every 6 hours until fever clearance, parasite clearance (in malaria patients) and GCS
      normalization (score of 15) on two consecutive assessments. Thereafter, patients will be
      assessed daily until discharge or death with one follow-up visit at 14 days and a follow-up
      call at day 30. The prospective, observational recruitment phase of the study is expected to
      last 15 months.

      Hematocrit and peripheral blood parasitemia in thin and thick films will be assessed at T=0
      (enrolment) then 6-hourly until parasite clearance (two consecutive negative thick smears per
      500 white blood cells). Plasma creatinine will be measured 24-hourly for 72 hours, at
      discharge and day 14. Venous blood gas and lactate will be assessed 6-hourly until lactate &lt;2
      mmol/L.

      Arterial blood gas will be collected at T0 and after 24 hours if the subject is in
      respiratory distress, defined as respiratory rate &gt; 30 breaths per minute and SpO2 &lt;92% on
      room air. More frequent hematological and biochemical measurements may be done if clinically
      indicated at the discretion of the treating clinician. Plasma cell-free hemoglobin (CFH) will
      be analyzed at hour 0, 6, 24, 48, 72 and day 7 in the severe malaria group and only hour 0 in
      sepsis and uncomplicated malaria groups. Blood cultures and additional microbiology assays
      will be drawn at enrolment and performed locally.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        I. Sepsis criteria:

        The sepsis criteria include the severe sepsis and septic shock categories according to 2012
        Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. Due to a possible delay in obtaining all the
        enrolment sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score variables necessary to fulfil
        the criteria for the latest 2016 sepsis definition, the 2012 Surviving Sepsis Campaign
        criteria and the quick SOFA tool will be used for inclusion. However, after study
        completion, when all admission SOFA scores will be available, all patients will be
        re-scored according to the Sepsis 3 definition.

        Inclusion criteria for sepsis:

          1. Documented or suspected infection

          6. Within 24 hours of hospital or ICU admission

        Note: Positive blood or urine cultures not required as eligibility criteria due to limited
        microbiology laboratory availability.

        II. Severe malaria criteria Using modified World Health Organization criteria for severe
        falciparum malaria, as defined previously.

          -  Any P. falciparum or P. vivax parasitaemia in adults, detected by asexual stages on a

             auscultation xi. Spontaneous bleeding xii. Generalized convulsions (≥2 in 24 hours)

          -  Fully informed written consent obtained, including written informed consent from
             relative or parent/guardian in case of reduced consciousness and/or age &lt; 16 years.

          -  Age ≥12 years
