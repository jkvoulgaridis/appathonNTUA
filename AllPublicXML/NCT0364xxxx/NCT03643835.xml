  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exertional heat stroke (EHS) is an emergency medical condition that is prevalent in military
      soldiers, athletes, and laborers. It is diagnosed when the rectal temperature is above 40°C
      with the presence of central nervous dysfunction (altered mental status). The gold standard
      method of care for EHS is immediate onsite whole body cooling using cold-water immersion
      (cooling rates &gt;0.15°C•min-1), which is reported to have the highest cooling rate. In the
      treatment of EHS, selecting a cooling modality with a high cooling rate becomes crucial to
      minimize the time above the critical threshold of body temperature at 40°C to less than 30
      minutes for the best chance of survival and to minimize the severity of prognosis. However,
      in situations where cold water immersion is not feasible (in certain military, firefighter,
      or other remote settings), other cooling modalities must be available that have a cooling
      capacity similar to that of cold-water immersion. In this proposed study, the investigators
      aim to examine the cooling rates of the Polar Breeze® device (developed by Statim
      Technologies, LLC, Clearwater, FL) compared to rotating ice towels, a cooling method often
      recommended by sports medicine professionals as an alternative to cold-water immersion, and
      passive rest in participants with exercise-induced hyperthermia.
