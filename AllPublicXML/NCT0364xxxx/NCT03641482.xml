    <textblock>
      Background: Alveolar osteitis is one of the most frequent complications after lower third
      molar extraction, and is usually accompanied by inflammation, pain and poor wound healing.
      Several local interventions have been used to reduce these complications with limited
      effectiveness.

      Purpose: To clinically evaluate the use of propolis extract, nanovitamin C and nanovitamin E
      gel for the prevention of surgical complications related to impacted lower third molar
      extraction.

      Methods: A randomized, triple-blind, split-mouth, pilot study is being performed in patients
      needing bilateral lower third molar extraction with similar surgical difficulty. Surgical
      extractions are randomly being performed and NBF gingival gel (TG) or placebo (PBG) are
      randomly being applied inside postextraction sockets by a blinded surgeon. The patients are
      being instructed to apply it 3 times/day in the surgical wound for 7 days. One month later,
      the contralateral wisdom tooth is being extracted and the opposite gel is being applied.
      Alveolar osteitis (AO) is being diagnosed following Blum's criteria. Swelling is being
      assessed by measuring the facial perimeter. Wound healing is being evaluated with a
      semi-quantitative scale as good, satisfactory or insufficient. Postoperative pain is being
      recorded using a visual analog scale (VAS) for 7 days. Analgesic pill intake is being
      recorded by each patient. Variables are being registered by a blinded researcher to 3M
      extractions at one, two, three and seven postoperative days.
