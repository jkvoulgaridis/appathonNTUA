  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Sodium Fluoride imaging (using Positron
      Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography - PET-CT) is able to predict disease progression in
      acute aortic syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute Aortic Syndrome encompasses multiple aortopathies, including aortic dissection,
      intramural haematoma and penetrating aortic ulcers. Acute aortic syndrome has a three year
      mortality approaching 25%. To date, other than the initial aortic diameter, there are no
      accurate methods of establishing the risk of disease progression in patients with acute
      aortic syndrome.

      In vascular disease, microcalcification occurs in response to necrotic inflammation. Using
      computed tomography and positron emission tomography (PET-CT), early microcalcification can
      be identified using uptake of the radiotracer 18F-sodium fluoride. This can identify high
      risk-lesions in the aorta, coronary and carotid arteries, and appears to be indicative of
      necrotic and heavily inflamed tissue. In abdominal aortic aneurysms, 18F-sodium fluoride
      binding predicts aortic expansion and the risk of aneurysm rupture or requirement for
      surgical repair.

      The study investigators, therefore, propose to evaluate the ability of 18F-sodium fluoride to
      identify regions of necrotic inflammation in acute aortic syndrome to predict aortic
      expansion and disease progression.

      Control patients with a normal calibre aorta will be recruited from the National Abdominal
      Aortic Aneurysm Screening Programme and Vascular Out-Patient Clinics. Patients with acute
      aortic syndrome and chronic aortic disease will undergo clinical assessments and 18F Sodium
      Fluoride PET/CT scans at baseline and 12-months. Clinical follow-up will continue for up to 3
      years from recruitment.
