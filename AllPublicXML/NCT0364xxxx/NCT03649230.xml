    <textblock>
      This Canadian, multi-centre, prospective, observational real-world study is designed to
      collect patient-reported outcome data on the use of Akynzeo® (netupitant/palonosetron) for
      the prevention of nausea and vomiting in oncology patients receiving highly emetogenic
      chemotherapy (HEC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess quality of life using the Functional Living Index of Emesis (FLIE)
      questionnaire and generate Real World Evidence in support of existing clinical trial data,
      including effectiveness and safety of Akynzeo® in the real world setting for the prevention
      of Chemotherapy Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV) in patients receiving highly emetogenic
      chemotherapy (HEC).

    <description>The Functional Living Index - Emesis questionnaire is a patient reported outcome (PRO) validated tool with the objective of assessing the impact of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting on patient's daily function.
Questionnaire consists of a nausea domain and a vomiting domain of nine items each where the patient should rate how much nausea and vomiting have affected the quality of life. For each question the patient will rate how much nausea (or vomiting) has affected an aspect of his quality of life during the past five days. Each question uses a visual analogue scale (where 1= no emesis-7=a great deal).
Assessed by patient following day 5 of each cycle.</description>
