  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Dopamine is a natural chemical in the brain that may influence eating behavior and physical
      activity. Researchers want to measure the brain s dopamine activity and understand how it
      differs in people with obesity.

      Objective:

      To better understand how brain function, particularly dopamine activity, relates to body
      weight and eating behavior.

      Individuals may be able to participate if they:

      Have a BMI of at least 18.5 kg/m2

      Are weight-stable and generally healthy

      Are between ages 18-45 years

      Have normal blood pressure

      Are not using illegal drugs (based on urine drug screen)

      Are not following a special diet

      Do not have metal implants

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Questionnaires and an interview to see if it is safe to have a PET/MRI scan

        -  Fasting blood and urine tests

        -  Participants will eat a special diet given to them for the 5 days before their inpatient
           visit.

      Participants will have a 5-day inpatient visit. Some days include blood and urine tests. Each
      day includes surveys and tests to measure habits and likes/dis-likes. A sample schedule may
      be:

      Day 1: Participants will wear a monitor that uses a needle below the skin to measure glucose.
      Their body fat will be measured with low-dose x-rays

      Day 2: Participants will have a PET scan. They will lie on a table that slides in and out of
      a donut-shaped scanner. They will be injected with a small amount of a radioactive substance
      and wear a cap on their head.

      Day 3: Participants will have an MRI. They will lie on a table that slides in and out of a
      scanner.

      Day 4: Participants will have another PET scan. This time, they will drink a milk shake
      during a break from the scanner. Then, they will go back inside the scanner for the end of
      their scan.

      Day 5: Participants will wear a hood for up to 40 minutes to measure their breathing. They
      will also drink special water and collect samples of their urine to measure the rate they
      burn energy.

      For 12 months after the visit, participants will track their weight and physical activity
      daily using a special scale and activity monitor. A few times over the year, the study team
      will send participants special activity monitors to use for 7 days at a time.

      Participants will have an in-person 1-day follow-up visit. This includes most tests except
      for PET scanning....

    <textblock>
      Evidence from neuroimaging studies indicates that aberrant functionality in brain regions
      that support reward processing and habit formation may be related to an individual's eating
      behavior and obesity propensity. In particular, our previous research found that increased
      dopamine D2 receptor binding potential (D2BP) in the dorsal and lateral striatum was
      positively related to opportunistic eating behaviors, body fat, and body mass index (BMI).
      However, our findings were contrary to highly-cited previous reports of D2BP correlating with
      BMI in the opposite direction. The primary aim of this study is to elucidate the reasons for
      the conflicting results that used somewhat different methodologies.

      Specifically, our previous study used positron emission tomography (PET) to measure D2BP
      using the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist radioligand [18F]fallypride following a period of
      dietary stabilization and 3 hours after a standardized breakfast. Reports finding
      correlations between D2BP and BMI in the opposite direction have typically investigated
      subjects with higher BMI using the D2 receptor antagonist radioligand [11C]raclopride.
      Furthermore, previous studies were typically conducted in the fasted state, but the subjects
      prior food intake was not wellcontrolled. The present study will attempt to resolve the
      controversy by measuring D2BP using both [18F]fallypride and [11C]raclopride in 39 adults, 13
      within each of three BMI strata to represent a large BMI range, under controlled overnight
      fasting conditions following a period of dietary stabilization. The primary aims are to
      estimate the mathematical relationship between striatal D2BP and BMI and determine the
      within-subject correlations of D2BP derived from [18F]fallypride and [11C]raclopride.
