  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate, in a double-blind randomized controlled trial, whether initiating treatment
      with ultra-low-dose quadruple-combination therapy (&quot;LDQT&quot;) will lower office blood pressure
      more effectively, and with fewer side effects, compared to initiating standard dose
      monotherapy as per current guidelines in patients with hypertension.

      Primary hypothesis: A combination pill comprising four types of blood pressure lowering
      medications, each at one-quarter standard doses, will lower office blood pressure more
      effectively than initiating patients with standard dose monotherapy as per contemporary
      clinical practice guideline recommendations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will investigate whether initiating treatment with ultra-low-dose
      quadruple-combination therapy (LDQT; including candesartan 2 mg, amlodipine 1.25 mg,
      indapamide 0.625 mg, and bisoprolol 2.5 mg) will lower automated office blood pressure and
      24-hour ambulatory blood pressure at 12 weeks more effectively, and with no increase in side
      effects, compared to initiating standard dose monotherapy (candesartan 8 mg) in adults with
      raised blood pressure (SBP&gt;130 mmHg or DBP&gt;80 mmHg) and without cardiovascular disease. Our
      preliminary data from a short-term (4-week) crossover trial of 18 participants suggest that
      LDQT lowers office blood pressure by 22/13 mmHg on average compared with placebo with no
      difference in serious adverse events. Effects on 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure were
      similar.

      The investigators will perform this phase II, single site, randomized controlled trial in a
      network of federally qualified health centers in Chicago because this population bears a
      disproportionate burden of blood pressure related diseases, and the investigators have
      previously successfully conducted clinical studies in this population.

      While the investigators hypothesize this intervention will be easily implemented and
      efficacious for all patients and clinicians, the investigators will explore variation in
      treatment effect by potential moderating variables, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, and
      health literacy level. Beyond examining efficacy, the investigators also plan to assess
      feasibility of implementing this intervention in a clinical setting by simultaneously
      evaluating implementation outcomes of acceptability, preferences, and lessons of LDQT among
      patients and clinicians.

             automatic office BP device OR, 2) Recorded daytime average SBP 130-149 mmHg or DBP
             80-99 mmHg on 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring.

          -  Previous diagnosis of coronary artery disease, stroke, or heart failure.

          -  Presence of significant proteinuria (based on 3+ proteinuria via spot urinalysis or
             &gt;300mg/dL of proteinuria based on random urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio testing
             of 300 mg/g)

          -  Evidence of secondary cause of hypertension e.g., renal artery stenosis; significant
             renal impairment (eGFR &lt;50 ml/min/1.73 m2), raised serum potassium (above lab normal
             limit of 5.5 mEq/L).

          -  Women who are pregnant, breast feeding or of childbearing potential and are not using
             and do not plan to continue using medically acceptable form of contraception
             throughout the study (pharmacological or barrier methods).

          -  Concomitant illness, physical impairment or mental condition which in the opinion of
             the study team / primary care physician could interfere with the conduct of the study
             including outcome assessments.

          -  Participation in a concurrent interventional medical investigation or pharmacologic
             clinical trial. Patients in observational, natural history or epidemiological studies
             not involving an intervention are eligible.

          -  Participant's responsible primary care or other responsible physician believes it is
             not appropriate for participant to switch current monotherapy.

          -  Inability or unwillingness to provide written informed consent.

          -  Unable to complete study procedures, including 24-hour ABPM.
