  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies evaluating the effectiveness of continuous wound infusion (CWI) to manage
      postoperative pain following laparoscopy are markedly lacking. Especially, there was no study
      comparing CWI and placebo in treating gynecologic laparoscopy. Therefore, the investigators
      conducted this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to investigate whether CWI
      of local anesthetics was an effective strategy for enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS),
      compared with placebo in patients undergoing benign gynecologic laparoscopy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic surgery has become an acceptable alternative for open surgery in treating benign
      gynecologic diseases. One of most important advantages of laparoscopy is a reduced
      postoperative pain compared with open surgery. Moreover, postoperative pain plays an
      important part in the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathway. Although the length of
      hospitalization and recovery period after laparoscopy tends to be shorter, postoperative pain
      can still be an important issue.

      Recently, continuous wound infusion (CWI) providing a constant flow of local anesthetic
      directly a surgical wound postoperatively has been widely used to reduce pain after cesarean
      section and open surgery. Studies evaluating the effectiveness of CWI to manage postoperative
      pain following laparoscopy are markedly lacking. Especially, there was no study comparing CWI
      and placebo in treating gynecologic laparoscopy. Therefore, the investigators conducted this
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to investigate whether CWI of local
      anesthetics was an effective strategy for ERAS, compared with placebo in patients undergoing
      benign gynecologic laparoscopy.

In all participants, the surgeon inserted a 20-gauge, 6.5-cm, multi-holed soaker catheter through an introducer needle after closure of the transumbilical fascia. The catheter was located in the deep subcutaneous space, above the fascia near the skin incision. In the experimental group, an elastomeric pump filled with local analgesic solution (total volume 100ml) containing 750mg ropivacaine .</description>
