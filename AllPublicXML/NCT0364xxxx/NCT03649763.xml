  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will evaluate the latency of onset and duration of sensory-motor block in
      patients undergoing hand surgery. Patients will be randomized to receive nerve blocks of the
      distal forearm or of the distal and proximal forearm. Local anesthetic will be injected to
      anesthetise the median and ulnar nerves in the distal forearm (1-injection site group) or the
      median and ulnar nerves in the distal and proximal forearm (2-sequential injection sites
      group) to accomplish anesthesia for surgery on the hand.
