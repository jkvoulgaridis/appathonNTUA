  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators wish to test the hypothesis that treatment with Lemtrada is
      associated with alterations in immune homeostasis in favor of multiple regulatory leukocyte
      populations which persist long after completion of the treatment phase. Specifically, the
      investigators propose that regulatory B-cells are induced rapidly following the first course
      of treatment with Lemtrada, that this occurs prior to induction of other regulatory
      populations, and that these cells are functionally capable of regulating immune responses.
      The investigators also propose that there is a concomitant induction of functional regulatory
      T-cells and alternatively-activated monocytes during the first year after treatment giving a
      &quot;blanket&quot; enhanced regulatory immune profile. This study is designed primarily to identify
      possible mechanisms by which Lemtrada acts to modify the immune environment in recipient
      patients, as such the &quot;outcome&quot; measures are all immunological.

        We will recruit 125 individuals with clinically definite MS, defined by the revised
        McDonald criteria (35). Patients in each cohort will be enrolled from those currently being
        seen by physicians at the University of Southern California, Department of Neurology.
