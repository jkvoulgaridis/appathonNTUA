  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of ozanimod after repeated dosing on
      blood pressure and heart rate response to a single-dose administration of pseudoephedrine
      (PSE) in healthy adult subjects.

      Study Design This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
      Approximately sixty eligible subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 fashion with
      30 subjects in each treatment group.

      Subjects will receive placebo or ozanimod once daily (QD) for 30 days. On Day 30, a single
      oral dose of pseudoephedrine (PSE) 60 mg will be co-administered with placebo or ozanimod.

      Study Population The study will enroll approximately 60 healthy men and non-pregnant,
      non-lactating women, ages 18 to 55 years, inclusive, with a body weight of at least 110
      pounds (50 kg) and body mass index within the range of 18.0 to 30.0 kg/m2, inclusive.

      Length of Study The study duration is 65 ± 2 days.

               -  Negative serum pregnancy test at Screening and Day -2 (women of child-bearing
                  potential [WOCBP] only).

               -  Postmenopausal (defined as 2 years after the last period and follicle-stimulating
                  hormone [FSH] &gt; 40 IU/L).

             Must agree to practice a highly effective method of contraception throughout the study
             until completion of the 75-day Safety Follow-up. Highly effective methods of
             contraception are those that alone or in combination result in a failure rate of a
             Pearl index of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly.

                  be oral, intravaginal, or transdermal

               -  Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation,
                  which may be oral, injectable, implantable

               -  Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine hormone-releasing system

               -  Bilateral tubal occlusion

             acceptable methods of contraception. Female condom and male condom should not be used
             together.

          4. Male subjects must agree to refrain from donating sperm during the study and until
             completion of the 75-day Safety Follow-up.

          5. Subject has a body weight of at least 110 pounds (50 kg); body mass index (BMI) within

             Day -2.

          8. Subject must be able to comprehend and provide written informed consent, and must be
             able to comply with the requirements of the study, including the study visit schedule
             and other protocol requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

             at Screening.

          2. Subject has a presence or history of any abnormality or illness that, in the opinion
             of the investigator, may affect absorption, distribution, metabolism, or elimination
             of the study drugs or would limit the subject's ability to participate in and complete
             this clinical study.

          3. Subject has a history of clinically significant or unstable vascular disease, or a
