  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this proposal is to use an in-home, smartphone-enabled, hand-held
      spirometer to determine the FEV1% predicted ranges that predict the Yellow Zone threshold.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesizes that objective lung function tracking at-home, using a portable
      spirometer in addition to conventional symptom monitoring (in which asthmatic patients
      self-report and track their own symptoms), will result in more reliable detection of
      exacerbation in children 6-15 years old with asthma.

      This is a 44-week, single arm, blinded nonrandomized trial to determine clinically relevant
      ranges in FEV1% predicted that correlate with the Yellow Zone of the Asthma Action Plan.

      A total of 100 pediatric subjects (between the ages of 6 and 15 years old) with
      physician-diagnosed mild or moderate persistent asthma treated on controller therapy will be
      enrolled from the ED, Inpatient Units, Pulmonary Medicine Clinic, and Allergy/Immunology
      Clinic at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital San Francisco.

      Primary Specific Aim

      To determine the FEV1% predicted changes that correspond with a change from the Green to
      Yellow Zone.

      The primary outcome will be Yellow Zone episodes, as identified by the occurence of any of
      the following:

      Symptom Diary score &gt; 4 ATAQ score &gt; 1

      Secondary Specific Aim

      To determine the FEV1% predicted changes that correspond with a change from the Yellow to Red
      Zone.

      The secondary outcome will Red Zone episodes, as identified by the occurence of any of the
      following:

      ED or Urgent Care visit Administration of systemic (oral, IM, or IV) corticosteroids
      Hospitalization
