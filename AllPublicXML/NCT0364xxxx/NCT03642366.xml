  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, 3 parallel arms, clinical trial. All
      patients will be PDE5I users or ex-users. After 1 month wash-out period, ED patients will be
      screened, in order to randomize 51 men with vasculogenic ED. Patients will be randomized in 3
      groups (17 subjects in each group) to receive shockwave treatments (12 sessions for all
      subjects, 5000 shockwaves at each session, at energy level 7), three times a week (total of 4
      weeks) without treatment interval. One group will be sham-control at energy level 7 whereas 2
      groups will receive active treatment.Three identical standard probes (probes A, B, C) will be
      used for the study, 2 of them active and one sham. Starting at first LiST session and
      finishing at the final week of LiST sessions, subjects will receive Tadalafil 5mg for 4 weeks
      daily. Total treatment period = 4 weeks. The IIEF-ED domain will be evaluated at Visit 1 and,
      consequently, at baseline and all follow up visits together with the SEP diaries.
