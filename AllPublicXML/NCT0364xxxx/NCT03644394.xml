  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Implantable Myoelectric Sensors (IMES) system is an investigational device intended to
      improve signal quality and consistency of myoelectric signals for prosthetic control in
      individuals suffering from an above elbow (transhumeral) amputation. The sensors pick up
      myoelectric signals intramuscularly and therefore signal quality is not affected from
      electrode replacement, perspiration, or artefacts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Implantable Myoelectric Sensors (IMES), the surgical tools implantation, and the external
      equipment used to control an electromechanical prosthetic device, together comprise the IMES
      System (investigational product, medical device).

      Each IMES acts as an independent differential amplifier consisting of custom electronics
      housed within a biocompatible, hermetically sealed ceramic cylinder with metal end caps. The
      end caps serve as electrodes for picking up EMG activity during muscle contraction. Reverse
      telemetry (via a coil around the arm) is used to transfer data from the implanted sensor, and
      forward telemetry is used to transmit power and configuration settings to the sensors. The
      coil and associated electronics are housed within the frame of a prosthesis. A control system
      that sends data associated with muscle contraction to the motors of the prosthetic joints is
      housed in a belt-worn, battery-powered device. A cable attaches the control unit to the
      prosthetic frame.

      An IMES is implanted into each targeted muscle that will be used to control a function of the
      prosthetic arm. Two IMES devices are needed for each DOF. For example, one device would
      control fingers opening and another device would control fingers closing.
