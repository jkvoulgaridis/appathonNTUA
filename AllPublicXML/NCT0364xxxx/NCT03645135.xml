    <textblock>
      This is a RCT with 2 intervention arms. In the first arm, the control arm, patients will be
      asked to complete a short questionnaire after their visit, to elicit demographic information
      and perceived involvement in care. The second arm, the intervention arm, will be asked to
      list 2 goals for their visit and complete a short questionnaire after their visit, to elicit
      demographic information and perceived involvement in care.
