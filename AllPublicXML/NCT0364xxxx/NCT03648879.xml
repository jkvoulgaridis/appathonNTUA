  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      People with hereditary gastric cancer syndrome are at increased risk of getting cancer in
      their stomach. These people should have regular endoscopies and biopsies to check for cancer
      if they are choosing to keep their stomach. Researchers want to see if they can improve the
      detection of cancer by endoscopy. Improved endoscopies could better detect early signs of
      cancer in people with this syndrome.

      Objective:

      To see if a small microscope attached to an endoscope to inspect the stomach lining is better
      than regular endoscopy to find the first signs of cancer in the stomach.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older who have a personal or family history of a hereditary gastric cancer
      syndrome or have a mutation that is known to lead to gastric cancer

      Design:

      Participants will be screened over the phone or in person with:

        -  Personal and family medical history

        -  Review of their medical records

      Participants will have a physical exam. Then they will be put under general anesthesia. They
      will have an endoscopy. A lighted tube will be inserted into the mouth and go down to the
      stomach. First, the standard device will be used. Then participants will be injected with
      fluorescein. This is a contrast agent. Then the microscope will be added to the tube and the
      endoscopic evaluation of the stomach will be repeated. During the procedure, biopsies will be
      taken from different areas of the stomach. Participants will be observed for a few hours
      after the procedure.

      About 14 days after the endoscopy, participants will be asked to return to the clinic for a
      follow-up visit. This visit can also be conducted over the phone.

      Background:

      Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC) syndrome is caused by a germline mutation in the
      CDH1 gene. Carriers of this mutation have a 56-70% lifetime risk of developing gastric
      adenocarcinoma. Current international guidelines recommend endoscopic screening of CDH1
      mutation carriers that consists of systematic biopsies of an otherwise normal appearing
      stomach. However, this approach lacks sufficient sensitivity for detecting intramucosal foci
      of signet ring cells (SRC), which are pathognomonic of HDGC syndrome. The goal of the current
      study is to utilize confocal endoscopic microscopy (CEM) for screening the gastric mucosa in
      this high-risk population.

      Objective:

      Determine if confocal endoscopic microscopy (CEM) will afford greater sensitivity for
      detection of SRC foci in CDH1 germline mutation carriers.

      Eligibility:

      CDH1 germline mutation carriers, or those who meet clinical criteria for HDGC testing but
      have tested negative for a CDH1 gene mutation or those who have other germline mutations
      suspected to be, or reported to be, associated with HDGC (e.g. CTNNA1).

      Design:

      Phase II, single-institution study of CEM for detection of intramucosal SRC foci compared to
      current systematic gastric mapping procedure.
