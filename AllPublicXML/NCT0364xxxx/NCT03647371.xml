      The purpose of this study is to assess the usefulness of the Thyromental Height Test in
      prediction of difficult intubation using videolaryngoscopy and double lumen endotracheal
      tubes in patients scheduled for elective thoracic procedures.

    <textblock>
      Successful and fast intubation are crucial for the safety of general anaesthesia. Failed
      intubation and acute hypoxia remain among the major contributing factors of anaesthesia
      related deaths. Difficult intubation prevalence in literature is very inconsistent and varies
      between 1.5-20% of cases in general population, to even 50% in obese Thai population.

      There is a number of anthropometric scales and tests used for predicting difficult
      intubation. However, none of them appears to be sensitive and specific enough to effectively
      predict difficult intubation.

      Recently, simple and non-invasive test predicting difficult intubation was
      introduced-thyromental height test (TMHT). It shows promise as a more effective substitution
      for frequently cited anthropometric measures. It is based on the height between the anterior
      border of the thyroid cartilage and the anterior border of the mentum, measured while the
      patient lies in the supine position with closed mouth The main objective of the trial is to
      assess the clinical usefulness of TMHT in prediction of difficult intubation using
      videolaryngoscopy and double lumen endotracheal tubes in patients scheduled for elective
      thoracic surgical procedures. The secondary aim is to evaluate usefulness of other commonly
      used predictive tests associated with difficult intubation.

      During routine, preoperative anaesthetic visit thyromental height, thyromental distance,
      sternomental distance and Mallampati scale score are assessed. Then, during videolaryngoscopy
      and intubation, score in Cormack-Lehane scale and occurrence of difficult intubation are
      noted.

    <description>The height between the anterior border of the thyroid cartilage (on the thyroid notch just between the 2 thyroid laminae) and the anterior border of the mentum (on the mental protuberance of the mandible), in supine position with mouth closed, measured with a depth gauge during routine preoperative anaesthetic visit.</description>

    <description>During videolaryngoscopy the laryngeal view is graded in Cormack-Lehane Scale by the laryngoscopist. Grade I is assigned when the glottis is fully visible, grade II when the glottis is partially visible, grade III when only the epiglottis is visible and grade IV when neither glottis nor epiglottis is visible.</description>
