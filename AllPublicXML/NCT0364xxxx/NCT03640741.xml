  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The motivation results from the fact, that an intra-abdominal pressure is correlated with
      cerebral perfusion, in a mechanism of reducing venous outflow. Moreover, elevated
      intra-abdominal pressure leads to increase in intracranial pressure and decrease of cerebral
      perfusion pressure.

      The main aim of the study was to investigate an influence of increase in intra-abdominal
      pressure on cerebral oxygenation measured with the use of non-invasive optical technique.

      The investigators applied time resolved near infrared spectroscopy device in order to
      estimate changes in hemoglobin concentration in a brain during gynecological procedure that
      involves laparoscopy. The optodes were positioned on a forehead on left and right hemisphere.

      The measurements were carried out during whole medical procedure, including anesthesia, start
      and stop of insufflation of abdominal cavity with carbon dioxide (CO2), surgical procedure,
      release of CO2 and waking up a patient. In those studies the special emphasis was put on a
      period of insufflation of abdominal cavity with CO2.
