  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frequent sports events causing more injuries in athletes causing decline in their
      performance. Injuries around knee joint are common. Strength training of hamstring and
      quadriceps are effective tool in rehabilitation. The multi-speeds and multi-angles strength
      training plans were used to see the effects on symptoms and performance in athletes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 69 athletes with knee pain were recruited and randomly divided into two groups. 50
      athletes completed the training programs, 25 in each group. Data was also collected from
      healthy athletes for normative values. International Knee Documentation Committee subjective
      knee evaluation form was used to report the athlete's knee condition and severity of symptoms
      including pain. Biodex isokinetic system was used for isokinetic and isometric strength
      trainings and kinetic data collection. Physical performance of an athlete was assessed by
      components of fitness through two commonly used tests: Illinois agility run test and vertical
      jump test. The athletic single leg stability test was used to assess the stability of
      athletes on Biodex Balance System.

    <intervention_model_description>Athletes were randomly assigned into two groups: Isometric (ISOM) and Isokinetic (ISOK). A coin was flipped at start of data collection for the first patient to be assigned odd number and included in isometric group. Later on odd and even numbered patients were included in specific group. Additionally, data was collected from healthy athletes doing their training at Pakistan Sports Board, called healthy control group. Due to ethical constraints knee pain athletes were not included as control subjects</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change in Agility Run Test time</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline through completion an average of 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The agility run test was conducted by placing cones at the non-slippery surface. The time to complete the test was recorded by using stop watch. A 10 Meter distance in figure of 8 was made on ground with help of cones. Time taken to complete was recorded in seconds.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change in Vertical Jump test height</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline through completion an average of 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Vertical jump test was conducted by using the measuring tape placed on wall. Athletes were standing along the wall and the standing height, the highest level of finger touching the wall was recorded initially. Athlete then jumped vertically and marked on the wall and performed three repetitions. The greatest difference between initial standing height and after jump height was recorded as score of vertical jump.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change in Athletic single leg stability test</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline through completion an average of 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The athletic single leg stability test was used to assess the stability of athlete conducted by using Biodex Balance System SD (Biodex Medical Systems, Inc. NY, USA). Athletes were standing on involved leg and platform setting was at level 4. Athletes performed 3 repetitions of 20 seconds each with 10 seconds rest between the repetitions to complete the test. Overall stability index, anterior posterior index, and medial lateral index were recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in Peak Torque value (FT-LB)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline through completion an average of 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Highest muscular force output at any moment during a repetition. Peak torque indicates the muscle's maximum strength capability. This is also equivalent to a 1-repetition maximum (RM) isotonic strength test.</description>

    <description>Knee pain athletes were assessed by The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) 2000 Subjective Knee evaluation form and were assigned into ISOM group. ISOM group participants were involved in isometric strengthTraining at angle of 30°,45°,60° of knee flexion for 5 maximum contraction for both hamstring and quadriceps. 10 sessions were given on alternate day basis by using Biodex Isokinetic system.</description>

    <description>Isokinetic strength program included strength training at 5 different velocities from slow to fast. Participants were trained on speed of 30°/sec, 90°/sec, 150°/sec, 210°/sec and 270°/sec. Flexion and extension movements were completed with 5 repetitions at each speed.
Participants of isometric strength training group performed isometric contractions at 30°, 45° and 60° of knee flexion with five repetitions at each angle for both hamstring and quadriceps.</description>
