  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to o evaluate the role of conventional and advanced MRI sequences in diagnosis of
      idiopathic temporal lobe epilepsy including identification and lateralization of
      epileptogenic focus.

      Patients with history of partial seizures with or without secondary generalization attending
      at outpatient clinic or admitted at Neurology department of Assuit University Hospital will
      be included in the study MRI study will be done for each patient. MR imaging will be
      performed on a 1.5-T MR imaging unit (Siemens, Sembra medical system,German).

      Prospectively completed data forms will be analyzed and compared. Statistical tests
      appropriate to the nature of the data will be used.

      All patients will not be subjected to risk of any kind during this study. All patients' data
      will be confidentially kept. Approval of the ethical committee of Faculty of Medicine, Assiut
      University.

      An informed consent will be taken from all patients included in this study. The research will
      be conducted only by scientifically qualified and trained personnel.

      The procedures included in this study have been already used in hospital and centers in and
      outside Egypt
