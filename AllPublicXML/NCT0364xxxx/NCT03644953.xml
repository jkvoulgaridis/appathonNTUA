  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will prospectively investigate the feasibility, safety, and transfusion
      requirements of adding hydroxyurea to simple chronic transfusions for patients with sickle
      cell anemia already on chronic transfusions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, prospective study of hydroxyurea added to simple chronic transfusions,
      combination treatment termed hydroxyurea and transfusion (HAT). The primary objective of the
      study is to determine the feasibility of HAT for patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA)
      currently being treated only with simple transfusions for stroke prevention. Secondary
      objectives include: to evaluate the safety of HAT and to determine if HAT decreases
      transfusion requirements in this patient population. Exploratory objectives include: to
      evaluate with HAT changes in pre-transfusion laboratories and biomarkers of cerebrovascular
      disease progression, and to describe changes on brain imaging.

    <description>Participants will be started on hydroxyurea 20 ± 2.5 mg/kg/day in addition to continuing simple chronic transfusion every 4 weeks ± 1 week. Hydroxyurea will be dose escalated to achieve a HAT target dose (HAT-TD). Hydroxyurea will be increased by 5 mg/kg/day after 8 weeks of a dose if HAT-TD is not achieved (maximum daily dose 2,000 mg). After HAT-TD has been achieved, minor dose increases may occur if subject grows a significant amount to maintain the same mg/kg dose.</description>
