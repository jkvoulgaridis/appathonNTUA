  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dyspnea, the sensation of breathing discomfort or shortness of breath, is one of the main
      symptoms for patients affected by Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), particularly
      during exercise. Previous study show that chest wall vibration decrease dyspnea in COPD
      patients and precisely when applied during the inspiration phase, called &quot;in-phase vibration&quot;
      (IPV) which provide vibration directly on intercostal muscles. These findings have been
      obtained in laboratory context and the intercostals muscles vibration has been tested only in
      single phases of breathing, during inspiration with IPV and during exhalation with
      out-of-phase vibration (OPV). None study has evaluated the effect of a continuous chest wall
      vibration (CCWV), namely muscles vibration during the whole cycle of breathing, on dyspnea in
      patients with COPD in a clinical context. Continuous high frequency vibration has been proven
      to reduce myoelectrical manifestation of fatigue, probably modifying the centrally driven
      motor unit recruitment hierarchy, in healthy subjects.

      Moreover, CCWV is a modality of provide vibration more suitable and cost-effective in a
      clinical context than single-phases vibration that requires specific instruments for the
      detection of breathing phases and the coupling with vibration device.

      On these bases, the investigators hypothesized that CCWV at high frequency, applied during a
      cycle ergometer training program, could decrease dyspnea and enhance the exercise tolerance
      in COPD patients. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of high
      frequency CCWV on dyspnea and exercise tolerance in patients with COPD patients compared to
      usual care and to sham intervention.

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline respiratory muscles strength at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum inspiratory pressure / Minimum expiratory pressure.
Maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) are global measures of maximal strength of respiratory muscles and they are respectively the greater pressure which may be generated during maximal inspiration and expiration against an occluded airway. The way to measure maximal respiratory pressures is very simple, using a hand-held mouth pressure meter in cmH2O.
Higher values represent a better outcome</description>

    <description>BODE Index.
Is a multidimensional 10-point grading system that predicts the risk of death from any cause and from respiratory causes among patients with COPD. It is composed by subscales, combined to compute a total score as follows:
FEV1 (% of predicted): 0 (≥65); 1 (50-64); 2 (36-49); 3 (≤35). Distance walked in 6 minutes (m): 0 (≥350); 1 (250-349); 2 150-249); 3 (≤149). MMRC dyspnea scale:0 (0-1); 1 (2); 2 (3); 3 (4). Body-mass Index: 0 (&gt;21); 1 (≤21).
Range: 0-10 Higher scores indicate a worse outcome (higher risk of death)</description>
