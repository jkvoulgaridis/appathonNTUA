  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the pilot study is feasibility, usability and safety assessment of VR Mind
      intervention. In particular the subject of assessment will be:

        -  the length of the laboratory session utilizing virtual reality exposure (feasibility),

        -  the ergonomics and ease of use for both patients and system operators (usability),

        -  the frequency of side effect occurrence as a result of virtual reality exposure (ie.
           Vertigo) (safety).

      The results pilot study will be used in the designing a clinical trial aimed for testing
      efficacy and safety of VR Mind intervention.

      In this study, investigators will test the software developed by Tomorrow Sp. z o. o., named
      VR Mind. The software utilizes the concept of virtual reality exposure therapy to treat
      social anxiety disorder. The pilot investigators will be tested for the feasibility,
      usability and safety of the system in order to obtain information useful in further designs
      for the clinical trial. The research consists of four laboratory sessions. The first and the
      last session will be dedicated to participant assessment. During the second and third session
      the virtual reality scenarios (2 x 10 minutes for each session) will be presented to
      participants. The participants will be playing a role of someone who is giving a speech
      (Public speaking scenario) and someone who is speaking on a phone in public (Telephoning in
      public scenario).

    <measure>Safety_1: occurrence and severity of simulator sickness</measure>
    <time_frame>During 2nd and 3th laboratory session within 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Simulator sickness is expected adverse effect of the VR. Hence, the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ; Kennedy, Lane, Berbaum, Lilienthal, 1993) will be administered as a primary outcome measure to evaluate safety of the VR intervention.
Total SSQ score equal to or higher than 10 will be used as a preliminary cut-off for simulator sickness (Balk et al., 2013). Individual scores will be corrected for baseline (pre-VR) symptom severity. Only items with a pre-VR - post-VR increase will contribute to a final SSQ score. All post-intervention SSQ scores &gt;10 will be analyzed further for its association with study drop-outs and other intervention required. The adverse effect will be classified as:
mild (no intervention required, all VR sessions completed),
moderate (any intervention needed, e.g. session termination),
severe (hospitalization required),
life-threatening / death. Any unexpected adverse effects will be recorded by a physician and classified as described above.</description>

    <description>Clinical Global Impression (Guy, 1976) - is a single item, 7 point scale used by clinicians to asses the severity of illness, where 1 is labeled as &quot;Normal, not at all ill&quot; and 7 is labeled as &quot;Among the most extremely ill patients&quot;.</description>

    <description>Patient Global Impression - is a single item, 4 point scale used by patients to asses their impression of severity of their illness and quality of their functioning in everyday life, where 1 is labeled as &quot;Normal&quot; and 4 is labeled as &quot;Severe&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>During 1st and 4th session within 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS; Leibowitz, 1987)
The scale is composed of 24 items, depicting various social situations. For each item, participants assess their fear (from 1 - &quot;No fear&quot; to 4 - &quot;Severe&quot;) and avoidance (from 1 - &quot;Never&quot; to 4 - &quot;Usually&quot;).
LSAS has 3 scores, summing the results for particular items - fear (0-72), avoidance (0-72) and total score (0-144).</description>
