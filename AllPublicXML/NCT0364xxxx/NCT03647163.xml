  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I safety run-in study designed to determine the safety of VSV-IFNβ-NIS in
      combination with pembrolizumab, followed by expansion to examine efficacy of combination
      therapy in patients with refractory NSCLC or HNSCC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The safety run-in portion of this study is designed to identify the optimal dose of
      VSV-IFNβ-NIS in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with solid tumors, and follows the
      3+3 design. The expansion portion will use one-sample binomial designs to assess the efficacy
      of the combination in pateints with refractory NSCLC or HNSCC. The optimal dose determined in
      the dose escalation portion of the trial will be used as the starting dose for the expansion
      portion. The primary endpoint of the dose escalation portion of this trial is to find the
      optimal dose of VSV-IFNβ-NIS+pembrolizumab. For the expansion portion of the trial, the
      primary endpoint is RECIST 1.1 confirmed response.
