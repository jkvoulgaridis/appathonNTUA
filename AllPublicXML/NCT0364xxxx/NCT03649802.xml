    <textblock>
      Investigators will examine arterial stiffness and pulse waveform analysis. Subjects with
      vitamin D insufficiency will be recruited. A double blind randomized controlled study will
      examine the effects of standard dose vitamin D3 (800 IU) versus higher dose vitamin D3 (5000
      IU)-given on a daily basis.In order to understand mechanisms of action by which vitamin D
      would improve arterial stiffness investigators will use biomarkers. Oxidative and
      inflammatory stress will be measured by plasma F2-isoprostanes and Sulforaphane levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease disproportionately impacts the elderly. Current practice targets
      vascular disease with aggressive lipid lowering combined with brachial BP regulation, but has
      only achieved a modest degree of success. There is a need to intervene at a much earlier
      stage. Increased arterial stiffness is a marker for subclinical vascular disease and a
      sensitive predictor of ischemic stroke in the elderly. Vitamin D deficiency is linked to an
      increased risk of vascular disease.

      There is an urgent need for well controlled randomized interventional studies in healthy
      elderly individuals demonstrating that vitamin D levels can improve vascular function in
      healthy elderly with vitamin D insufficiency. High dose vitamin D (5000 IU) replacement is
      required to improve systemic inflammation which may contribute to arterial stiffness and
      vascular aging.

      The hypothesis is that daily 5000 IU vitamin D3 will regress or at least prevent progression
      of arterial stiffness as assessed by the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity. Furthermore,
      investigators postulate that this improvement will be linked to improved oxidative and
      inflammatory status. Investigators will measure plasma measurements of Sulforaphane and
      plasma F2-isoprostane to assess the anti-oxidative mechanisms by which vitamin D could
      influence arterial stiffness.
