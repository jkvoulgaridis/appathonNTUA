    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well antiandrogen therapy, abiraterone acetate, and
      prednisone with or without neutron radiation therapy work in treating patients with prostate
      cancer. Hormone therapy such as antiandrogen therapy may fight prostate cancer by blocking
      the production and interfering with the action of hormones. Abiraterone acetate may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as prednisone, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Neutron radiation therapy uses high energy neutrons to kill tumor cells and shrink
      tumors. It is not yet known whether antiandrogen therapy, abiraterone acetate, and prednisone
      with or without neutron radiation therapy may work better in treating patients with prostate
      cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive ADT per standard of care. Beginning 2 months after start of ADT,
      patients also receive abiraterone acetate and prednisone per standard of care for at least 6
      months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive ADT, abiraterone acetate, and prednisone as in Arm I. Beginning 8-10
      weeks after starting ADT and within 1 week of starting abiraterone acetate, patients also
      undergo 3-5 fractions of neutron radiation therapy for 2 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 weeks for 6 months.

    <description>Percent change in peripheral blood effector T-cells will be calculated by measuring the difference of the percent peripheral blood effector T-cells for each patient between two time points: pre-treatment and post-treatment (3 months after start of ADT, which is also 1 month post-radiation in the radiation arm). Unpaired two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test, depending on distribution of the percent change, will be used to test the null hypothesis that the percent change in peripheral blood effector T-cells is equal between the two arms.</description>
