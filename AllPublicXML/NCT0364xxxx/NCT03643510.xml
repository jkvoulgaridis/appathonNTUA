             release of personal information.

          -  Patient must consent to the collection of archival tumor tissue for biomarker testing.
             Availability of archival tissue for biomarker testing must be confirmed by the site
             prior to screening of patient. Suitability of archival tissue that was not FFPE must
             be discussed with the Principal Investigator. Archival tissue consists of either a
             minimum of 10 FFPE slides or FFPE tissue block. Patients with no available archival
             tissue (or if the sample is difficult to obtain) may undergo a tumor biopsy to meet
             eligibility criteria, as long as the patient consents to this procedure and the biopsy
             can be obtained with minimal risk and discomfort to the patient.

             treatment complications

          -  Patients who have:

               -  History of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, ventricular tachycardia,
