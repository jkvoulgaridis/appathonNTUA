  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will investigate toxicity in patients treated with a
      Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor and radiotherapy. Patients with advanced
      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) can be included when treatment with a PD-1 inhibitor is
      indicated according to national guidelines. Included patients will receive stereotactic
      radiotherapy to one or two tumour lesion(s) in addition to the PD-1 inhibitor, and toxicity
      is the primary endpoint.

      This phase II study will investigate NSCLC patients (stage III-IV, palliative treated) where
      treatment with a PD1-inhibitor is indicated according to national guidelines. Patients will
      be treated with a check-point inhibitor combined with radiotherapy (6 Gy x 3) towards lesions
      (1-2). Atezolizumab is available and reimbursed in the public health system. The radiotherapy
      dosing is significantly lower than standard stereotactic radiotherapy, and is in accordance
      with other studies reported in ClinicalTrials.gov. Such a fractionation will putatively
      induce immunogenic cell death, while being a safe treatment, not likely to induce significant
      side effects.

      Whereas the primary endpoint in our clinical study will be toxicity, the secondary endpoints
      include response rates, overall survival, safety and tolerability, quality of life,
      progression-free survival and duration of response. In addition, exploratory endpoints will
      include immunological response, tumor evolution and dynamics in the tumor microenvironment
      during treatment, imaging, and biomarkers of clinical response.

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 3 months

          -  A tumour lesion suitable for radiotherapy treatment

          -  Adequate organ function based on clinical examination and lab values (Hb &gt;9.0,
