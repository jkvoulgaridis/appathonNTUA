      Objective of the study

      The main objectives of this project are:

        1. To assess the influence of mental fatigue on a return-to-play test battery in healthy
           population

        2. To assess the influence of mental fatigue on brain functioning during a balance and
           reaction time task in healthy population In a later stage, these experiments could be
           carried out in a clinical context (e.g. in an ankle sprain population).

      The researchers will use a randomized, placebo controlled, counter-balanced, cross-over
      design.

      Thirteen healthy subjects will visit the lab 3 times. On the first visit (familiarisation
      trial), the investigators will collect the participants' characteristics. The participants
      will also be familiarized to the procedures and materials of the experiment during this first
      visit. The second and third visit contain the experimental setup and will proceed as follows:
      first, the participants will fill in a mental fatigue scale (M-VAS) and motivation scale.
      Next, the subjects will carry out a functional test battery (hop test, vertical jump test,
      Y-balance test, and a balance reaction-time test). Session rate of perceived exertion (RPE)
      is measured to indicate how fatigued the participants feel because of the test battery; also,
      M-VAS is collected once more. Then, a short cognitive task (Flanker task) is followed by
      either a long intensive cognitive task (90 minutes Stroop task) or control task (90 minutes
      documentary). Afterwards, participants have to carry out the Flanker task, fill in M-VAS
      (2x), perform the same test battery, fill in session RPE and one final fatigue scale (Nasa
      TLX). Heart frequency and EEG will be measured continuously during the trials.
