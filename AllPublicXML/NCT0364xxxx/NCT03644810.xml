    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the potential association between pain catastrophizing thoughts and the
      ability to dampen pain via endogenous descending inhibition. Half of the participants are
      persons with chronic low back pain and the other half are age and gender-matched controls

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain catastrophizing is a cognitive feature commonly seen in various musculoskeletal pain
      population and is considered an important factor to account for in rehabilitation. The
      ability to dampen pain via endogenous pain modulatory mechanisms is likewise known to be
      reduced in musculoskeletal pain conditions.

      Studies utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have demonstrated that the
      supraspinal areas involved in pain-related cognitive processing to a great extent overlap
      with those involved in endogenous pain modulation. Therefore, it is plausible that factors
      such as pain catastrophizing thoughts may affect the nervous systems ability to dampen pain.

      Chronic low back pain is the single clinical problem with the biggest impact in the modern
      society. Previous studies have demonstrated that pain catastrophizing and reduced endogenous
      pain inhibition are part of the clinical picture. However, previous studies have never
      investigated a potential relationship between these two factors.

    <measure>Changes in pressure pain thresholds (determined with pressure algometry) before and after the cold pressor test</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure Pain Thresholds (PPT) are assessed before and after the cold pressor test
PPT measure the pressure needed to experience the first instance of pain. For this purpose, a pressure algometer (a pistol-like device with a 1cm2 contact surface) is used. Higher levels of pressure reflect lower pain sensitivity.
In the cold pressor test, the subject is asked to submerge one hand into circulating water (constant temperature: 4 degrees C) for 2 minutes. When removing it from the water, the subject is asked to indicate the perceived pain using a numeric rating scale (see below). Before and after the cold pressor test, the PPT measurements are performed. The difference in PPT values before and after the cold pressor test is used in the correlation analysis described in outcome 1.
The numeric rating scale is used to determine the perceived pain intensity from the cold water. The scale is runs from 0 - 10 where 0 is anchored with no pain and 10 reflects the worst pain imaginable</description>

    <description>The pain catastrophizing score by filling out the pain catastrophizing scale.The pain catastrophizing scale consists of 13 sentences describing pain-related thoughts or feelings. These are divided into 3 domains: rumination, magnification and helplessness. The subject is asked to indicate how how well each sentence applies for them: 0 = not at all, 1 = to a slight degree, 2 = to a moderate degree, 3 = to a great degree and 4 = all the time.
The total score on the questionnaire can lie between 0 - 52 where a higher score indicates higher levels of pain catastrophizing thoughts.</description>
