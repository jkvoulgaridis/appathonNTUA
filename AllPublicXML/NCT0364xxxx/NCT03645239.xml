  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 20% women who undergo cesarean delivery would suffer from severe post-operative
      pain, which may further increase their risks from developing postpartum depression.
      Predictive factors such as pre-operative pain, age and anxiety could significantly contribute
      to post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and pain in general surgery, however little
      information is available with regards to cesarean delivery. The investigators would
      investigate the risk factors of causing post-operative emesis after cesarean delivery, and to
      reaffirm that there is a positive correlation between pain on local anesthetic injection,
      presence of mechanical temporal summation (MTS) and post-Cesarean pain scores.

      Approximately 1 in 5 women who undergo cesarean delivery would suffer from severe
      post-operative pain, which may further increase their risks from developing postpartum
      depression. Predictive factors such as pre-operative pain, age and anxiety could
      significantly contribute to post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and pain in general
      surgery, however little information is available with regards to cesarean delivery. Previous
      studies demonstrated that pain scores upon local anesthetic injection is positively
      correlated to post-cesarean pain scores. Additionally, anxiety, anticipated post-operative
      pain score and anticipated medication need are also found to be promising risk factors to
      post-cesarean pain management.

      The investigators would investigate the risk factors of causing post-operative emesis after
      cesarean delivery, and to reaffirm that there is a positive correlation between pain on local
      anesthetic injection, presence of mechanical temporal summation (MTS) and post-Cesarean pain
      scores. 200 parturients undergoing cesarean delivery and requiring regional anaesthesia will
      be recruited at KK Women's and Children's Hospital. Pain and anxiety assessment will be
      conducted via visual analogue scoring (VAS), MTS assessment and a series of questionnaires.
      After the delivery, all patients will be given appropriate analgesia, and the pain score at
      movement will be recorded. Secondary outcomes include pain scores at rest, analgesia
      consumption, time-to-first-rescue analgesia, opioid-related side effects, patient
      satisfaction and postpartum depression.

    <description>Pain scores (Numeric Rating Scale 0-10) at 6-10 weeks follow-up evaluations. Zero being no pain, and 10 being the worst pain possible.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain vulnerability in both groups: Pain Catastrophizing Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>7 weeks (Upon recruitment until 5-14 days after delivery)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment will be done via Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) questionnaire before surgery. Pain catastrophizing refers to the negative thought processes patients have when they are exposed to pain or painful experiences. The PCS is a 13-item scale, with each item rated on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (all the time). It is broken into three subscales being magnification (0-12), rumination (0-16), and helplessness (0-24). A higher value in each subscale indicates a higher tendency to that subscale (worse outcome).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mechanical Temporal Summation as measured by von Frey filament in both groups</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day (10 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment will be done via Mechanical Temporal Summation assessment before surgery. A 180 gram von Frey filament is applied on the subject's forearm. Patient will then be asked to rate the pinprick pain score on a verbal rating scale, 0-100. Following this, 10 consecutive touches at random locations are applied with a 1 second interstimulus interval and within a 1 cm diameter circle. The patient will then be asked to rate the 10th pain score (0-100). The Mechanical Temporal Summation Score is obtained by the difference between the 11th pain score and the 1st pain score. If the score is greater than zero, the patient is implied to have presence of Mechanical Temporal Summation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) before and after delivery</measure>
    <time_frame>6 -10 weeks after delivery</time_frame>
    <description>Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a 10-item self reporting scale to evaluate the postnatal depression. Participants are asked to respond according to how they have felt in the past seven days. Each item is measured on a 4-point scale (0-3), with a total score in the range of 0 to 30. A higher total score indicates a greater degree of depressive symptoms. A score of 10 and above indicates clinically significant depressive symptoms.</description>
