    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a prospective, open label, single arm oncological phase I/II trial in
      patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and WNT signaling alterations. The trial consists of
      two parts: Part A is a phase I study investigating the safety of DKN-01 administered as mono-
      as well as combination therapy with sorafenib in a 2 step dose escalation.Part B is a phase
      II study to investigate the anti-tumor activity and safety of DKN-01 in patients with
      advanced HCC. DKN-01 is administered at the recommend phase II dose (RP2D) for monotherapy
      and at the recommend phase II dose for combination therapy established in Part A.

      Part A is a phase I study investigating the safety of DKN-01 administered as mono- as well as
      combination therapy with sorafenib in a 2 step dose escalation. Up to 20 patients with
      advanced HCC will be included in Part A. Tumor assessment will be performed every 8 weeks.The
      first 10 patients (cohort 1) will start with IV infusion of 300 mg DKN-01 on day 1 and 15
      (monotherapy for 28 days). DLTs will be determined. After cycle 2 of monotherapy patients of
      cohort 1 will continue with combination of 300 mg DKN-01 IV on day 1 and 15 and sorafenib
      (recommended dose 800 mg per day or at discretion of the investigator) until disease
      progression. After 2 cycles of combination therapy and prior to the start of the next cohort
      DLTs will be determined. Part B is a phase II study to investigate the anti-tumor activity
      and safety of DKN-01 in patients with advanced HCC. DKN-01 is administered at the recommend
      phase II dose (RP2D) for monotherapy and at the recommend phase II dose for combination
      therapy established in Part A. Depending on the tolerability, the doses may be different for
      monotherapy and for combination therapy. Up to 50 additional patients with advanced HCC may
      be enrolled in Part B. Every 8 weeks tumor assessment will be performed. If progression of
      disease (PD1) is observed with DKN-01 monotherapy, patients will continue on study receiving
      DKN-01 at the recommend phase II dose for combination therapy.

             contraception for non-pregnant WOCBP partner) with their partners throughout the study
             and for 18 months after last dose of study drug and agree to inform the Investigator

             abnormality that in the opinion of the Investigator would preclude safe participation
             in the study; patients with pacemakers where QTc is not a reliable measure will
             require an evaluation by a cardiologist to exclude co-existing cardiac conditions
             which would prohibit safe participation in the study.

          -  Symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) malignancy or metastasis. Patients with
             treated CNS metastases are eligible provided their disease is radiographically stable,
             asymptomatic, and they are not currently receiving corticosteroids and/or
             anticonvulsants. Screening of asymptomatic patients without a history of CNS
             metastases is not required.

          -  Known osteoblastic bone metastasis. Screening of asymptomatic patients without a
