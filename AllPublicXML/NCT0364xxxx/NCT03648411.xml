  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A cross-sectional study will be conducted in selected 2 sentinel sites for assessment of drug
      resistance falciparum and vivax among asymptomatic infection in migrant workers in Myanmar.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although malaria prevalence is decreasing in Myanmar, drug resistance threatens the malaria
      elimination by 2030 especially high risk persons including migrant population. Previous study
      indicated that asymptomatic malaria parasite carried drug resistance gene such as K13 mutant
      that is genetically responsible for artemisinin resistant falciparum malaria. These
      asymptomatic carries may be a source to spread the disease and it is very important to
      conduct the surveillance on drug resistance status among high vulnerable persons.
      Unfortunately, there is no study to assess the drug resistance molecular markers in
      asymptomatic malaria among migrant workers in Myanmar. Therefore, this study fulfills the
      gaps of knowledge on important of asymptomatic hidden infection exploring to formulate the
      recommendation for elimination of malaria in Myanmar.

      In this study, asymptomatic infections are screened by rapid diagnostic test, microscopy and
      molecular methods.
