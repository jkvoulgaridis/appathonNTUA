  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To prove that total knee arthroplasty can be performed with little, if any need for opioids
      by using a combination of patient education, optimized pre-op and post-op pain and recovery
      protocols. The goal being opioid-free total knee arthroplasty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All study patients will receive a standardized protocol

        -  All surgical procedures performed by single surgeon using same implants, approach,
           pre-op and post-op optimization, and simplified pain protocol at a single hospital or
           surgery center

        -  Will attempt to minimize the number of anesthesiologists to further control variability
           in care

      Methods:

        1. Pre-op Optimization

             -  All patients enroll in education program

             -  All patients have optimized BMI, hemoglobin, albumin, glucose control-A1C, and
                blood pressure

        2. Total Joint Procedure

             -  Tourniquet-free cemented total knee arthroplasty is performed with intra-articular
                block

        3. Data Collection

             -  Electronic medical record chart review

             -  Pre-op assessment and Post-op assessment (post anesthesia care unit (PACU), Phase
                II-prior to discharge

             -  Phone calls after discharge

             -  Follow-up assessment in surgeon's office

             -  Swift path / KOOS JR surveys

        4. Pain Management Regimen

             -  pre-op physical therapy teaching

             -  post-op multimodal pain regimen

    <description>Pain level is measured by the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for pain utilizing minimum number 0 to maximum number 10 (0 represents no pain and 10 represents worst pain imaginable). The higher the number reported the worst the pain/outcome. This will be used to assess patient's level of pain relating to opioid use and recovery.</description>

    <measure>Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Short Form (KOOS JR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (preoperative); 6 weeks post surgery; 12 weeks post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Short Form (KOOS JR) is a survey that is an assessment and questionnaire that rates a patients joint pain, stiffness and function in daily living. Patients answer questions about joint stiffness, pain and daily activities using the following scoring values: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=extreme. The values for all questions are added up to get a raw score that ranges from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 28. This raw score is converted to an interval score using a provided table. The interval score ranges from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 100 where 0 = total knee disability and 100 = perfect knee health. The higher the score on scale from 0 to 100 the better the outcome.</description>

    <description>Swift path is an Educational tool (diary) for patients undergoing total joint replacement, that patients follow from the initial booking of surgery through their recovery. It guides patients through potential risks involved with joint surgery, through a multimodal pain management protocol for pain prevention and through recovery.</description>

        <title>Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Short Form (KOOS JR)</title>
        <description>The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Short Form (KOOS JR) is a survey that is an assessment and questionnaire that rates a patients joint pain, stiffness and function in daily living. Patients answer questions about joint stiffness, pain and daily activities using the following scoring values: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=extreme. The values for all questions are added up to get a raw score that ranges from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 28. This raw score is converted to an interval score using a provided table. The interval score ranges from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 100 where 0 = total knee disability and 100 = perfect knee health. The higher the score on scale from 0 to 100 the better the outcome.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline (preoperative); 6 weeks post surgery; 12 weeks post surgery</time_frame>
        <population>311 patients reported KOOS JR scores at baseline which was prior to surgery. At 6 weeks 379 patients reported scores. At 12 weeks 341 patients reported scores.</population>
