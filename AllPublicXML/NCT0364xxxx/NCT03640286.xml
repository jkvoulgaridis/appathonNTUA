  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, double blind sham controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of
      vestibular nerve stimulation (VeNS), combined with a lifestyle modification program, compared
      to a sham control and a lifestyle modification program as a means of reducing excess body
      weight and body fat.

      The purpose of this investigation device study is to collect data to support regulatory
      submissions, primarily in the United States of America (USA), but it may also be used to
      support submissions in other regions, including the European Union (EU).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In total there will be approximately 200 patients enrolled on the study around both sites. At
      the UCSD site there will be a total of about 106 total subjects (53 active treatment and 53
      control subjects) who are randomized into the treatment protocols having passed the screening
      criteria. At the UU site there will be a total of about 94 total subjects (47 active and 47
      control subjects).

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of non-invasive electrical vestibular nerve
      stimulation (VeNS), together with a lifestyle modification program, as a method of reducing
      excess body weight and body fat, as compared to a sham control with both study arms
      incorporating a lifestyle modification program.

        -  Allocation: Randomized

        -  Endpoint classification: Efficacy Study

        -  Intervention Model: Parallel Assignment in 1:1 active to control allocation

        -  The aim of the study is to recruit a total (i.e. across both sites) of 200 participants
           that pass the screening process and are randomized into the treatment protocols. With a
           dropout allowance of 10% this should generate a minimum of 90 active treatment and 90
           control subjects. (In order to achieve adequate numbers, Neurovalens Ltd. estimate that
           the clinical site may have to consent (i.e. enroll into the study) up to 150 subjects at
           the UCSD site, in order to achieve adequate numbers, it is estimated that the clinical
           site may have to consent (i.e. enroll into the study) up to 150 subjects at the UU site,
           as the baseline screening can only take place after the formal consent process as the
           baseline screening can only take place after the formal consent process.) The
           designation of treatment across the two study sites will be as follows:

             -  USCD: a total of about 106 subjects who pass through screening and are randomized
                (53 active treatment and 53 control subjects);

             -  University of Ulster: a total of about 94 total subjects who pass through screening
                and are randomized (47 active and 47 control subjects).

        -  Masking: Double Blind (Subject, Nursing staff, Dietician, Co-coordinators, Outcomes
           Assessor and any other study staff who have contact with the subject)

        -  Data from both sites will be collated at the end of the studies and analysis will be
           performed on one data set.

      Study staff will train the subject on how to use their study device. Specifically this will
      include: how to first prepare the skin over the mastoid processes with an alcohol wipe; a
      demonstration of where to place the hydrogel electrodes; how to access the VeSTAL study app
      and pair the iPod (using Bluetooth) to the device; how to operate the device using the app;
      and how to use the up/down buttons on the device if unable to use the study app. Study staff
      will provide subjects with a printed copy of the IFU and also highlight its location as a PDF
      on the iPod. The Device Use Schematic will also be highlighted to the subjects - it will only
      be as a PDF on the iPod.

      Also study staff will demonstrate to the subjects: how to charge the device; to dispose of
      used electrodes after a stimulation session; how to store unused electrodes in a sealed
      manner so they do not dry out; how to turn the device on and off using the power button; and
      how to use the app or power button to pause a stimulation session.

      Subjects will be asked to try and use their allocated device for an hour every day, and at
      least five times a week. Theoretically it is thought that the device may be more effective if
      used while sitting upright (as opposed to lying flat), due to the orientation of the otolith
      organs. As such subjects will be encouraged to use the device while sitting upright, and also
      in the evening as sometimes people can feel a bit soporific after vestibular stimulation.
      Subjects will be instructed not to walk around, operate machinery or drive while using their
      device.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 27 kg/m2

          2. Males or Females. Note females of child-bearing potential must have a negative urine
             pregnancy test at screen and also just before each DXA scan. (As DXA involves a small
             dose of ionizing radiation). They should agree to follow a physician-approved
             contraceptive regimen for the duration of the study period (other than DMPA injections
             as this causes weight gain).

          3. 22-80 years of age inclusive on starting the study. (In order to comply with FDA
             guidance:
             https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm08
             9740.htm#s6)

          4. Ability and willingness to complete all study visits and procedures; in particular an
             agreement to engage with: trying to use the device on a daily basis; the hypocaloric
             diet weight loss program; and this provided weight loss support and mentoring.

          5. Agreement not to use of prescription, or over-the-counter, weight loss preparations
             for the duration of the trial.

          6. Agreement not to start smoking or vaping tobacco for the duration of the study.

          7. Access to Wi-Fi (to connect iPod to internet)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of vestibular dysfunction.

          2. History of bariatric surgery, or gastric resection.

          3. History of skin breakdown, eczema or other dermatological condition (e.g. psoriasis)
             affecting the skin behind the ears.

          4. History of weight loss device implantation (e.g. VBloc Maestro or Abiliti).

          5. Use of a non-invasive weight loss device (e.g. Modius)

    <ipd_description>Data will be transferred in an encrypted PDF format. Trial staff will be given direction on how to share the trial data and given access to one specific section of a controlled cloud service which is controlled via role based access. Once they have authenticated with the service and the service verifies that they have the correct role to access the system they will be directed to a single webpage within the application where they will be able to upload the encrypted PDF. This PDF is generated on the fly and is therefore not stored in another location that could become compromised. Generating the PDF on the fly means that the source data is extracted from the database, processed and delivered in the context of a single request. These data will be transferred for each subject when they complete participation in the study.</ipd_description>
