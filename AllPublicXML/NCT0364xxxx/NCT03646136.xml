    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare outcomes for women in two study arms that
      include retaining the cystoscopy distending fluid after minimally invasive hysterectomy
      verses completely emptying the cystoscopy distending fluid. The outcomes being measured for
      research purposes include the time spent to first spontaneous urination after surgery, rate
      of indwelling catheter insertion, length of recovery room stay, the amount of bladder
      discomfort immediately postoperative and over the first 24 hours postoperative, bladder
      symptoms over the first 24 hours postoperative, and patient satisfaction.

    <textblock>
      Acute urinary retention can be a common postoperative complication following hysterectomy.
      One of the many benefits of minimally invasive surgery is shorter hospital stay following a
      major procedure such as laparoscopic or robotic hysterectomy. An important postoperative
      milestone before discharge from the postoperative anesthesia care unit (PACU) is spontaneous
      voiding. If unable to spontaneously void due to urinary retention, insertion of an indwelling
      catheter may be required. Awaiting a spontaneous void in the recovery room can lead to longer
      hospital and PACU stays, greater cost, and patient dissatisfaction. At the conclusion of
      traditional laparoscopic or robotic-assisted hysterectomy, intraoperative cystoscopy is
      performed to evaluate for urologic injury. One possible strategy to more quickly facilitate a
      postoperative spontaneous void is to retain the cystoscopy distending fluid at conclusion of
      cystoscopy rather than emptying the bladder of the distending fluid. Although there is no
      published research investigating voiding time following laparoscopic or robotic hysterectomy
      using strategies such as backfilling the bladder before removal of the indwelling catheter or
      retaining the cystoscopy distending fluid following diagnostic cystoscopy.
