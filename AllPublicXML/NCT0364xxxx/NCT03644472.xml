    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of a one time dose of inorganic nitrate
      (supplied in the form of beetroot juice) on blood vessel function and resting blood pressure
      in healthy, postmenopausal women who are within 5 years of menopause. Participants will drink
      beetroot juice and a placebo juice on separate visits where blood pressure and blood vessel
      function will be measured.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Due to the loss of
      estrogen, women experience a unique accelerated rise in cardiovascular disease risk factors
      following menopause. Postmenopausal women represent a population at heightened risk for
      cardiovascular disease development. Function of the endothelium has been shown to decline
      across the menopause transition, resulting in less production of nitric oxide. As such the
      investigators are investigating a potential therapeutic strategy in women have recently
      undergone menopause to boost nitric oxide availability.
