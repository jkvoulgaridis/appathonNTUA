  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large number of patients presenting to the emergency department will have an invasive or
      potentially painful treatment (suture, urinary catheterization, reduction of dislocation or
      fracture). This care is a source of pain and anxiety for patients.

      Since 1998, the management of pain is a public health priority in France. Law No. 2002-3003
      of 4 March 2002 on the rights of the sick and the quality of the health system has made pain
      management a right: &quot;Everyone has the right to receive care to relieve his pain. This must be
      in all circumstances prevented, evaluated, taken into account and treated &quot;.

      In emergency departments, the use of antalgic drug treatments and local anesthetics is
      systematic.

      Other techniques to create diversions proposed in the recommendations of the French Society
      of Emergency Medicine for the management of wounds in emergencies can be used to improve the
      experience of patients: the use speech during the gesture or certain forms of hypnosis.

      Pain and anxiety are two important factors to integrate to improve the management of patients
      in emergencies.

      To improve pain and anxiety, distraction is a technique that can be used. Virtual reality is
      a distraction technique not yet frequently used but studied. It combines the visual and the
      auditory allowing immersion in a virtual world thanks to a helmet retranscribing a
      three-dimensional image. The diversion of attention through the use of virtual reality allows
      the patient to immerse themselves in a fictional environment through a mask on the eyes
      inhibiting the vision of the outside world and a headphone reducing external sounds and
      reinforcing the mechanism of 'immersion.

      The use of the virtual reality headset has already shown benefits during pain care in burn
      patients and children.

      The virtual reality headset has not yet been studied as a distraction tool for invasive and
      potentially painful care in emergencies.

    <description>The study population will consist of consecutive pre-screened patients when they arrive at the emergency department at the level of the host nurse. The emergency physician who will be in charge of the patient gives the patient the information form and ensures the absence of contraindication, responds to the patient's questions and collects his free, informed and express consent.
Once the patient is included, the group (with or without virtual reality) of the patient's participation in the study will be notified by the reception nurse and emergency referral:
- Arm 1 (usual care): the procedure of care will be the same as usual.</description>

    <description>The virtual reality headset can be used for 45 minutes with the need to pause for 5 minutes if the gesture lasts longer. The VR sequence will be complete when the end of the programmed time is reached to preserve the patient's immersion. The patient will be able to see the final sequence at the end of the gesture in order to get used to the real world again. The programs and their durations will be adjusted to the duration of the gesture concerned. Regarding the pain, anxiety and satisfaction visual analogue scales, they will be performed just after the removal of the VR helmet.
Virtual reality videos are from Healthy Mind® software. The videos are contemplative with three kinds of relaxing landscapes accompanied by a sound universe specifically composed to relax the patient. The patient can choose one of three interactive worlds (an Asian garden, a forest or a mountain).</description>
