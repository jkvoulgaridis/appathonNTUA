    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of KD025
      in subjects with Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (cGVHD) after at least 2 prior lines of
      systemic therapy
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 2, open label, randomized, multicenter study in subjects with cGVHD who have previously
      been treated with at least 2 prior lines of systemic therapy. Approximately 166 subjects with
      active cGVHD will be randomized (1:1) to receive treatment with one of two KD025 regimens:

        -  Arm A: KD025 200mg QD

        -  Arm B: KD025 200mg BID

      With Amendment 2, the sample size was increased from approximately 126 subjects, with
      additional subjects to be enrolled as follows:

        -  20 adolescents

        -  20 adults into a site-specific Companion Study to collect biospecimens

      These additional subjects will also be randomized (1:1) to Arm A or Arm B.

      Randomization will be stratified according to prior cGVHD treatment with ibrutinib (Yes / No)
      and severe cGVHD at baseline (Yes / No). Subjects may receive treatment in 28-day treatment
      cycles until clinically significant progression of cGVHD. Subjects who have not achieved a
      response after 12 cycles of KD025 should be withdrawn if in the Investigator's judgment there
      is no evidence of clinical benefit. Subjects will undergo evaluations as outlined in the
      Study Assessments table (Appendix A). The primary endpoint is the overall response rate (ORR)
      with responses as defined by the 2014 National Institute of Health (NIH) Consensus
      Development Project on clinical trials in cGVHD.

    <description>Analyses will include: Number of subjects with a ≥7 point reduction, Number of subjects with a ≥7 point reduction on 2 consecutive assessments and Duration of a ≥7 point reduction. Symptom burden will be assessed on Day 1 of each cycle starting on Cycle 1 Day 1, as well as at the EOT visit. The questionnaire asks subjects to indicate the degree of bother that they experienced due to symptoms in seven domains potentially affected by chronic GVHD (skin, eyes, mouth, breathing, eating and digestion, energy, and emotional distress). The response will be determined based on clinician assessment specifically for each of affected organ as a Complete Response, Partial Response or Progression.</description>
