  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease and the leading cause of
      disability in industrialized countries. Therapeutic approaches to prevent the development and
      progression of osteoarthritis are disappointing and very limited. New therapeutic
      alternatives seem essential to better manage his daily life. Non-drug approaches, including
      psycho-corporal approaches are increasingly used in the management of chronic pain.

      Mindfulness is a technique of attention training, which is to focus one's attention on the
      present moment and to examine the sensations that come to mind, how they appear, how they
      last time, and how they disappear.

      Regarding rheumatological pathologies, a Mindfulness Program (MBSR) has shown its
      effectiveness in chronic pain; and in particular in osteo-articular localization, such as
      chronic low back pain. A recent study found a correlation between a pre-disposition to
      mindfulness and less pain and / or better quality of life in patients with knee
      osteoarthritis. However, to the knowledge of investigator, no study has evaluated the
      effectiveness of an intervention based on a mindfulness training program as a therapeutic
      alternative in osteoarthritis of the knee or hip.

      The goal of investigator is to evaluate, using a randomized, controlled study, the effect of
      a mindfulness program (according to the MBSR protocol) on pain, function, psychological state
      and quality of life patients with knee or hip osteoarthritis

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement in WOMAC pain before and after the program in the MBSR group compared to control group. The WOMAC is a validated index in the assessment of lower extremity osteoarthritis, by the system of rating the answers to questions by a visual analogue scale from 0 to 100 mm. It is possible to calculate the scores in each domain (pain, stiffness and function) or for the whole WOMAC. This is a self-administered questionnaire completed by the patient.</description>

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The responder rate is defined by an improvement of 20%, with an absolute variation ≥ 10mm, on 2 of the following 3 measures: WOMAC pain, WOMAC function and / or overall assessment of disease activity by the patient.
The overall evaluation of the patient's disease activity is performed on a 100 mm horizontal visual analogue scale (0 = inactive disease, 100 = highly active disease). It is used for the global assessment of the activity of the disease by the patient.</description>

This questionnaire was supplemented by questions aimed at clarifying the socio-demographic profile of the participants as well as the use of care services.</description>
