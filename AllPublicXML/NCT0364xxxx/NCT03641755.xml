    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of drugs as a possible treatment for breast
      cancer with a BRCA mutation.

      The interventions involved in this study are:

        -  Sapacitabine (CYC682)

        -  Olaparib (Lynparza™)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II clinical trial. A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of an
      investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the
      investigational intervention to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the
      intervention is being studied. It also means that the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration) has not approved the combination of Olaparib and Sapacitabine as a treatment
      for any disease.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved Olaparib as a treatment for
      metastatic HER2 negative breast cancer with a BRCA mutation. Olaparib is an inhibitor of PARP
      (poly [adenosine diphosphate-ribose] polymerase), which means that it stops PARP from
      working. PARP is an enzyme (a type of protein) found in the cells of the body. In normal
      cells when DNA is damaged, PARP helps to repair the damage.

      The FDA has not approved Sapacitabine for use in patients including people with this type of
      cancer. Sapacitabine and drugs of its class have been shown to have antitumor properties in
      many types of cancer, e.g., leukemia, lung, breast, ovarian, pancreatic and bladder cancer.
      Sapacitabine may help to stop the growth of some types of cancers.

      In this research study, the investigators are evaluating the safety and effectiveness of
      Olaparib in combination with Sapacitabine in BRCA mutant breast cancer.

             after the last dose of sapacitabine and/or olaparib. Men must agree to use two highly
             effective forms of contraception for the duration of study participation and 3 months

             listed in Section 5.5.3.4.

          -  Participants must be willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of
             the study, including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations.

          -  Participants enrolling to the phase II portion of the trial must be willing to undergo
             a biopsy at baseline; if their disease is not accessible for biopsy they are still
             eligible to participate.

          -  Any previous treatment with a PARP inhibitor, including but not limited to olaparib.

          -  Any previous treatment with sapacitabine.

          -  Patients who have had prior systemic chemotherapy, immune therapy, or investigational
             therapy within 3 weeks of study entry. Endocrine therapy must have been discontinued
             at least 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. Patients may receive bisphosphonates or
             denosumab during the study.

          -  Patients who have received prior radiotherapy within 1 week of study entry.

          -  Participants with active pneumonitis.

          -  Patients who have undergone major surgery or have ongoing persistent toxicities within
             2 weeks prior to study entry. Patients must have recovered to baseline or ≤ Grade 1
             from any effects of any major surgery prior to study entry with the exception of any
             grade of alopecia and persistent grade ≤ 2 peripheral neuropathy

          -  For enrollment during phase II: patients who have received more than 3 prior lines of
             cytotoxic chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Prior treatments with hormonal therapy
             and non-hormonal targeted therapy are allowed and not counted as a prior line of
             cytotoxic chemotherapy. For the purposes of this protocol, the combination of an
             aromatase inhibitor and everolimus is not considered cytotoxic chemotherapy.

          -  Patients with a history of treated central nervous system (CNS) metastases are
             eligible, provided they meet all of the following criteria:

               -  Disease outside the CNS is present

               -  No clinical evidence of progression in the CNS since completion of CNS-directed
                  therapy

               -  Minimum of 2 weeks between completion of radiotherapy and Cycle 1 Day 1

               -  Recovery from significant (≥ Grade 3) acute toxicity with no requirement for
                  escalating doses of corticosteroid over the 7 days prior to treatment start.

               -  Participants requiring concomitant use of known strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g.
                  itraconazole, telithromycin, clarithromycin, protease inhibitors boosted with
                  ritonavir or cobicistat, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir,
                  telaprevir) or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. ciprofloxacin, erythromycin,
                  diltiazem, fluconazole, verapamil). The required washout period prior to study
                  entry is 2 weeks.

          -  Participants requiring concomitant use of known strong (e.g. phenobarbital,
             enzalutamide, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine
             and St John's Wort) or moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g. bosentan, efavirenz, modafinil).
             The required washout period prior to study entry is 5 weeks for enzalutamide or
             phenobarbital and 3 weeks for other agents.

          -  Participants with a QTcF of &gt;470 msec on screening ECG.

          -  Participants with a personal or family history of long QT syndrome.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because olaparib and sapacitabine are
             agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is
             an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with the study agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued if
             the mother is treated with olaparib or sapacitabine and for one month after receiving
             the last dose.

          -  Participants with known active Hepatitis B, C, or known HIV positive status.

          -  Participants unable to swallow orally administered medication and participants with
             gastrointestinal disorders that are likely to interfere with absorption of the study
             medications in the opinion of the treating investigator (e.g. malabsorption syndrome
             or major stomach or bowel resections).

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to sapacitabine or olaparib.

          -  Patients with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
             or with features suggestive of MDS/AML.

          -  History of a previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord blood
             transplantation.

          -  Patients with a history of a second primary malignancy, with the following exceptions:
             adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancers, curatively treated in situ cancer of the
             cervix, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast, stage 1 grade 1 endometrial
             carcinoma, and any other solid tumor or lymphoma (without bone marrow involvement)
             diagnosed ≥ 5 years prior to study entry and treated with no evidence of disease
             recurrence; other exceptions may exist following agreement with the principal
             investigator who believes disease recurrence is unlikely.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Participants who are involved in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to
             both pharmaceutical company staff and/or staff at the study site).
