      QUILT 3.091 Chordoma Vaccine: Phase 1B/2 NANT Chordoma Vaccine vs Radiation in Subjects with
      Unresectable Chordoma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The NANT Chordoma Vaccine regimen will be administered in 2 phases, an induction and a
      maintenance phase.

      Subjects will continue induction treatment for up to 1 year. Those who have a confirmed
      complete response (CR) in the induction phase will enter the maintenance phase of the study.
      Subjects who experience ongoing stable disease (SD) or an ongoing partial response (PR) at 1
      year may enter the maintenance phase at the Investigator's and Sponsor's discretion. Subjects
      may remain in the maintenance phase of the study for up to 1 year.

      In the randomized component of the phase 2 portion of the study, the control arm will be
      treated with radiation according to established SoC protocols as determined by the
      Investigator.

      In the phase 2 single-arm component of the study, subjects will be enrolled in the first
      stage of Simon's two-stage optimal design. If the study proceeds to the second stage of
      Simon's two-stage optimal design, additional subjects will be enrolled in the second stage.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 18 years.

          2. Able to understand and provide a signed informed consent that fulfills the relevant
             IRB or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) guidelines.

          3. Histologically-confirmed recurrent or unresectable chordoma that would require
             radiation as a primary means for treatment.

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.

          5. Have at least 1 measurable lesion of ≥ 1.0 cm.

          6. Must have a recent formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor biopsy specimen
             following the conclusion of the most recent anticancer treatment and be willing to
             release the specimen for prospective and exploratory tumor molecular profiling. If an
             historic specimen is not available, the subject must be willing to undergo a biopsy
             during the screening period, if considered safe by the Investigator. If safety
             concerns preclude collection of a biopsy during the screening period, a tumor biopsy
             specimen collected prior to the conclusion of the most recent anticancer treatment may
             be used.

          7. Must be willing to provide blood samples prior to the start of treatment on this study
             for tumor molecular profiling and exploratory analyses.

          8. Must be willing to provide a tumor biopsy specimen 8 weeks after the start of
             treatment for exploratory analyses, if considered safe by the Investigator.

          9. Ability to attend required study visits and return for adequate follow-up, as required
             by this protocol.

         10. Agreement to practice effective contraception for female subjects of child-bearing
             potential and non-sterile males. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must agree
             to use effective contraception for up to 1 year after completion of therapy, and non-
             sterile male subjects must agree to use a condom for up to 4 months after treatment.
             Effective contraception includes surgical sterilization (eg, vasectomy, tubal
             ligation), two forms of barrier methods (eg, condom, diaphragm) used with spermicide,
             intrauterine devices (IUDs), and abstinence.

        Randomized component only - 11. Must be able to be classified into at least 1 of the below
        3 categories: i. Recurred within 6 months after treatment, ii. Have metastatic disease,
        iii. Meet ≥ 4 of the histopathologic and immunohistochemical criteria: • Poorly
        differentiated histopathologic sub type, • Mitotic figures ≥ 3, • Apoptosis present. •
        Prominent nucleoli present, • Necrosis present, • Ki67 ≥ 6%, • p53 ≥ 25%

        Single-arm component only 12. Must have progressed on or after radiation monotherapy in the
        randomized portion of the study OR been ineligible for the randomized portion but had
        progressed or experienced unacceptable toxicity on SoC prior to enrollment on the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Serious uncontrolled concomitant disease that would contraindicate the use of the
             investigational drug used in this study or that would put the subject at high risk for
             treatment-related complications.

          2. Systemic autoimmune disease (eg, lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis,Addison's
             disease, or autoimmune disease associated with lymphoma).

          3. History of organ transplant requiring immunosuppression.

          4. History of or active inflammatory bowel disease (eg, Crohn's disease, ulcerative
             colitis).

          5. Inadequate organ function, evidenced by the following laboratory results: a. Absolute
             neutrophil count &lt; 1,000 cells/mm^3, b. Uncorrectable grade 3 anemia (hemoglobin &lt; 8
             g/dL), c. Platelet count &lt; 75,000 cells/mm^3, d. Total bilirubin greater than the
             upper limit of normal (ULN; unless the subject has documented Gilbert's syndrome), e.
             Aspartate aminotransferase (AST [SGOT]) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT [SGPT]) &gt; 2.5
             × ULN (&gt; 5 × ULN in subjects with liver metastases), f. Alkaline phosphatase levels &gt;
             2.5 × ULN (&gt; 5 × ULN in subjects with liver metastases, or &gt;10 × ULN in subjects with
             bone metastases), g. Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL or 177 μmol/L, h. Serum anion gap &gt;

             medication; unstable angina; congestive heart failure of New York Heart Association
             grade 2 or higher; or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication. Subjects with
             uncontrolled hypertension should be medically managed on a stable regimen to control
