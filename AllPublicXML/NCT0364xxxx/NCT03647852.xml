  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IgA vasculitis is relatively common in children,especially in Asian countries. Abdominal
      manifestation could be severe, including bleeding, pancreatitis,appendicitis and intestinal
      intussusception. Delayed diagnosis could be fatal and cause severe complications.Nowadays no
      guidelines for those with severe abdominal manifestations in China.However, the most used
      treatment is steroid. For those severe forms are methylprednisolone pulse, IVIG,
      immunosuppressants and blood purification. Given the fact that different strategies lead to
      different endings which varies in cost, adverse effect and clinical outcomes in different
      medical centers, it is necessary to give birth to a useful and feasible strategy. This
      clinical trial is a muti-center, randomized,controlled prospective study.Patients with
      gastrointestinal disease will be recruited in three children's medical centres in Shanghai
      and will be randomized to two groups: MP group and IVIG group. Cost effect and clinical
      outcomes will be evaluated. Blood purification will be evaluated as a remedy when MP and IVIG
      fail to cure.
