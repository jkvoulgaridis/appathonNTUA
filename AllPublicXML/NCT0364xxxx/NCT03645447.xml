  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be looking at whether a taste test device can be used as a diagnostic aid for
      depression. Taste tests will be carried out before and after first use of an antidepressant
      (prescribed by the patient's GP) and then again a month later a further taste test will be
      conducted. The results of these tests will be assessed to see if they correlate with the
      outcome of validated mood questionnaires carried out at the first and second visits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research shows a clear link between taste sensitivity and depression, based on chemistry
      shared by the tongue and the brain. (Heath, T.P., Melichar, J.M., Nutt, D.J., Donaldson L.F.
      (2006) Human taste thresholds are modulated by serotonin and noradrenaline). The aim of this
      study is to investigate the use of a taste test in the diagnosis of depression and to predict
      drug effectiveness.

      A device is being developed to automate the taste test with different concentrations of salt,
      sweet, bitter and sour solutions. A test is carried out before and after ingesting a probe
      drug (first prescribed antidepressant) to assess change in taste. Standard validated
      questionnaires are used to assess mood on the day the first antidepressant is ingested and
      one month later.

      The first 30 participants will have taste tests conducted out not only via the device
      described above, but also via a paper flow chart which similarly determines the order in
      which taste solutions are presented to the participant to determine taste acuity.

      The study is a single centre, open label study using the patient's prescribed antidepressant
      as a probe with the primary objective of replicating previous results obtained, without the
      use of a device, and using paroxetine. The study is powered to test 240 patients with the
      provision built in to the protocol for an interim analysis after 120 patients have been
      tested. This will lead to the generation of a robust diagnostic algorithm.

      Patients will be followed up for repeat taste testing after 28 days (Â±7 days) of usual
      clinical care, and follow up questionnaires will be completed at that visit. Patients will be
      asked to complete a feedback questionnaire about their user experience and satisfaction with
      treatment alone.

    <intervention_model_description>Taste tests will be undertaken, in order to establish taste thresholds. Observation of changes in taste thresholds with change in mood following antidepressant treatment may help develop a diagnostic test for depression. The taste test will not assist diagnosis of depression for the group of participants in this study, so the primary purpose is not described as diagnostic.</intervention_model_description>
