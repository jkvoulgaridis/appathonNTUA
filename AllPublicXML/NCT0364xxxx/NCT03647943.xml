  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the use of a new brain stimulation tool called
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). tDCS is a new technique used to stimulate the
      brain. The investigators believe that it may help to change brain function in individuals
      with anorexia nervosa. The brain stimulation occurs outside the head. The tDCS procedure
      involves applying a small amount of electrical current across the scalp, for a short period
      of time. This small electrical current is able to change the electrical activity inside areas
      of the brain. In the current study, the investigators will ask participants to complete
      computer-based brain training sessions. While participants do the brain training exercises,
      they will receive either real tDCS for &quot;sham&quot; tDCS. &quot;Sham&quot; tDCS means that participants might
      feel sensations like tingling or vibrations from the tDCS machine, but will not actually
      receive the electrical current. Investigators will also ask participants to complete several
      tests to assess changes in brain function. The information gained from this study will help
      investigators to understand how tDCS could be used to improve brain function and learning in
      individuals with anorexia nervosa.

    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment-related adverse events will be assessed by CTCAE v4.0 criteria. Participant dropout will be examined in effort to evaluate whether individuals with AN will tolerate the procedures and remain in the study. This will be evinced by less than 20% dropout over the course of active tDCS and cognitive training.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18+ years

          -  Documented enrollment in residential-level treatment at The Emily Program and meeting
             criteria for AN (BMI &lt;18.5).

          -  Participant must be capable of giving informed consent, based on University of
             California San Diego (UCSD) Brief Assessment of Capacity to Consent (UBACC)39 risk
             assessment, which has been uploaded to ETHOS.

          -  Sufficient spoken English so as to be able to comprehend testing procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Substance abuse in the participant

          -  Neurological condition or other developmental disorder

          -  Serious psychiatric disorder known to affect brain functioning and cognitive
             performance

          -  Medical instability, which will be evident based on required admittance status in the
             residential treatment facility from which participants will be recruited. (The Emily
             Program residential treatment patients are followed closely by a medical provider, who
             routinely assesses medical stability throughout the duration of each patient's stay in
             the treatment facility; therefore, if a participant is not currently a patient in this
             setting and/or has been recently discharged from residential treatment setting due to
             medical need to receive higher level of care/inpatient-level care, they will be
             excluded from enrollment in this study).

          -  MRI contraindication [based on Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR)
             prescreening protocol]

          -  tDCS contraindication (e.g., history of craniotomy, history of metallic cranial
             plates, screws, implanted devices).
