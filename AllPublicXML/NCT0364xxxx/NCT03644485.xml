  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to confirm non-inferiority of delayed Prograf treatment to
      standard Prograf treatment in the incidence of delayed graft function (DGF) within 1 week
      between the 2 immunosuppressive (IS) treatment groups: delayed or standard Prograf together
      with induction therapy, and then convert to Advagraf usage in donation after cardiac (or
      circulatory) death (DCD) kidney transplant recipients.

      This study will also compare the clinical outcome within 6 month post-transplant between the
      2 IS treatment groups and compare the safety throughout study period between the 2 IS
      treatment groups.
