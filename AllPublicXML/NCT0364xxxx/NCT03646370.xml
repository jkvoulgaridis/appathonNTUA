      Switching patients with HIV infection from tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) to a tenofovir
      alafenamide (TAF) based drug regimen can provide many safety benefits including preserving
      bone mineral density and kidney function. This study will examine metabolic changes that
      patients may encounter due to the switch in medication regimens and the maintenance of viral
      suppression.

      Many providers of HIV medicine are switching patients from TDF to TAF containing ART regimens
      for safety reasons including significant improvements in bone health and kidney function that
      have been demonstrated in clinical trials.1-3 Multiple studies have evaluated the efficacy
      and safety of switching from TDF to TAF based regimens, but most allowed other components of
      the ART regimen to change in addition to TDF which may confound study results. For example, a
      recent meta-analysis demonstrated that TDF accompanied by ritonavir or cobicistat boosting
      was associated with higher risks of bone and renal adverse events and lower rates of
      virologic suppression in comparison to TAF. In contrast, when ritonavir and cobicistat were
      not used, there were not efficacy differences and only marginal safety differences between
      tenofovir agents.4 Additionally, measures of treatment success aside from maintaining
      virologic suppression including requirements for additional regimen changes due to
      tolerability, cost and access have not been formally evaluated. Furthermore, aside from renal
      function and bone health, comprehensive evaluations of metabolic changes following TDF to TAF
      switches have not been performed. Specifically, alterations in weight, body mass index, and
      glycemic control have not been studied in patients switching from TDF to TAF in clinical
      trials and changes in cholesterol and cardiovascular disease risk have had only minimal
      assessment.5 Weight gain most commonly occurs following the initiation of ART in treatment
      na√Øve patients, but has been noted in virologically suppressed patients making certain ART
      changes. Weight gain following TDF to TAF switches was not measured in clinical trials, but
      has been noted anecdotally within our clinic population and is believed to warrant additional
      investigation.

      In terms of cholesterol and cardiovascular disease risk, previous clinical trials have
      identified differences in serum cholesterol measurements in patients receiving TDF and TAF,
      but formal assessments of the resulting potential differences in cardiovascular disease risk
      have not occurred:

        -  The first trial was a phase II, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multi-center
           study that compared the safety and efficacy of TAF and TDF.6 The active-controlled arm
           received elvitegravir 150mg, cobicistat 150mg, emtricitabine 200mg, and TDF 200mg
           (E/C/F/TDF). The study arm received elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and TAF
           (E/C/F/TAF). Subjects receiving E/C/F/TAF experienced more Grade 3 or 4 increases in
           low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) (9% vs. 3%). However, the median increase in
           fasting LDL was similar between groups (+17 vs. +11 mg/dL, p=0.11). Significant
           differences were observed for total cholesterol (+30 vs +17 mg/dL, p=0.007) and
           high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (+7 vs +3 mg/dL, p=0.023), but the total cholesterol:HDL
           ratio remained similar for both treatment arms.

        -  A second phase II, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy multicenter trial compared
           darunavir 800mg/cobicistat 150mg/emtricitabine 200mg/TAF 10mg (D/C/F/TAF) to darunavir
           800mg, cobicistat 150mg, and co-formulated emtricitabine 200mg/TDF 300mg (D+C+F/TDF).7
           More than 230 subjects were screened, and 153 were randomized 2:1 to receive either
           D/C/F/TAF (n=103) or D+C+F/TDF (n=50). The primary efficacy outcome was virologic
           suppression at weeks 24 and 48. Safety and tolerability were assessed through renal,
           bone, and metabolic measurements. At the end of the trial, fasting lipid changes from
           baseline were greater in the TAF group at week 48 for total cholesterol (+40 vs. +5
           mg/dL, p&lt;0.001), LDL (+26 vs. +4 mg/dL, p&lt;0.001), HDL (+7 vs. +3 mg/dL, p=0.009), and
           triglycerides (+29 vs. -5 mg/dL, p=0.007). The total change in total cholesterol:HDL
           ratio was again comparable between groups (0 vs. -0.2, p=0.15).

        -  A randomized, active-controlled, open-label study assessed the safety and efficacy of
           switching virologically suppressed HIV-infected patients from their TDF-based regimen to
           E/C/F/TAF.8 The study assessed 601 patients who were randomized 2:1 to receiving
           E/C/F/TAF (n=402) or maintain their current regimen of FTC/TDF plus atazanavir boosted
           with cobicistat or ritonavir (n=199). Again, patients receiving E/C/F/TAF had
           statistically significant median increases in total cholesterol (+23 vs. + 5 mg/dL,
           p&lt;0.001) and in LDL (+9 vs -1 mg/dL, p&lt;0.001). Additionally, the proportion of patients
           who initiated lipid-modifying agents was greater in the E/C/F/TAF group but was not
           statistically significant (8.5% vs. 5%, p=0.14).

      In each trial, it is evident that patients receiving TAF have greater elevations in serum
      cholesterol levels in comparison to TDF. However, the majority of trials also note that the
      total cholesterol:HDL ratio appears to be similar among TDF and TAF recipients. This value
      has been used by investigators to suggest that differences in cardiovascular disease risk are
      unlikely to be present among TDF and TAF recipients despite considerable increases in total
      cholesterol, LDL and triglycerides levels in TAF recipients. The current ACC/AHA guidelines
      on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk in
      adults, do not recommend the use of the total cholesterol:HDL ratio to determine risk for
      cardiovascular disease.9 Rather, they recommend using the atherosclerotic cardiovascular
      disease (ASCVD) scoring system, which incorporates cholesterol values in additional to other
      factors that influence cardiovascular disease risk. This level of cardiovascular disease risk
      assessment has not been performed and assessed for TAF and TDF in clinical trials.

      The current study is significant because it will add to the current clinical knowledge of TAF
      in terms of efficacy, safety and tolerability. It will evaluate treatment success when
      patients have isolated TDF to TAF switches by analyzing virologic and immunologic responses
      in addition to the need for subsequent regimen changes due to poor tolerability, cost
      restriction or access limitations. This study will also provide a comprehensive assessment of
      potential metabolic changes following isolated TDF to TAF changes. This includes changes in
      the incidence of metabolic syndrome, alterations in cholesterol and cardiovascular disease
      risk, changes in weight and body mass index (BMI), and changes in glycemic control and renal
      function.
