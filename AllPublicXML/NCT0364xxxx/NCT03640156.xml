  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the efficacy of a single-dose of exogenous oxytocin administration on
      socially adaptive mirror-motor mapping in participants with Autism Spectrum Disorders. A
      placebo-controlled cross-over trial will be conducted: each participant will receive both a
      single-dose of placebo and oxytocin in two sessions separated by one week. The order of nasal
      spray will be randomised across participants. Mirror-motor mapping will be assessed by
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a standard technique to investigate mirror system
      activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The brain's action observation network or 'mirror system' supports a variety of
      socio-cognitive functions, as it enables us to internally simulate and understand others'
      actions, emotions and intentions. Generally, mirror responses are larger upon the observation
      of actions accompanied by relevant information for the observer, such as direct eye contact
      from the actor. In other words, 'mirroring' is adaptively modulated according to the social
      salience of the observed actions (i.e. it is socially adaptive).

      Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are known to endure difficulties with
      correctly recognizing eye contact as a communicative cue. Instead, they tend to experience
      eye contact as stressful and arousing. It is therefore hypothesized that, upon the
      observation of actions combined with salient gaze cues from the actor, these mirroring
      processes will not be adaptively modulated in participants with ASD.

      As appropriate processing of eye contact is a key aspect of (non-verbal) communicative
      behavior, the investigator will investigate the efficacy of a single dose of intranasal
      oxytocin administration for enhancing socially-adaptive mirroring in ASD. Oxytocin is a
      neuropeptide that acts as a regulator social brain areas. On a behavioral level, it is known
      to enhance the saliency of observed social cues and to improve prosocial behavior. As such,
      it is regarded a promising intervention for alleviating the social and communicative deficits
      in ASD.
