  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, it will be investigated how psychological stress evoked by skydiving affects
      the intestinal permeability in 20 healthy subjects. Participants attend two visits: 1)
      Skydiving visit, 2) Negative control visit. At all visits, saliva samples, blood samples, and
      faecal samples are collected, and the multi-sugar permeability test is performed. In this
      test, participants drink a sugar solution and then collect urine for 5 and 24 h. The ratio of
      the sugars detected in the urine is a reflection of the intestinal permeability. Saliva
      samples are collected for assessment of cortisol, a stress marker. Blood and faecal samples
      are collected for assessment of markers of intestinal barrier function and inflammation.
