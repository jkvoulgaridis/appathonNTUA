    <textblock>
      This prospective study is a pilot study for evaluating a guidance system that aims to
      facilitate high-quality echocardiographic acquisitions.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the feasibility for non-expert users
      (medical professionals but non-certified sonographers) to acquire parasternal, apical and
      subcostal views of suitable quality by using an existing ultrasound device (CE-marked,
      available in the market) and an additional guidance system (software prototype + probe motion
      tracking device). Such a system will help the user to place the probe on the patient and
      provide guidance for optimal acquisition of parasternal, apical and subcostal views.

      The secondary objective of this study is to assess the feasibility for non-expert users to
      reproduce a simple clinical protocol by using an existing ultrasound device and the same
      additional guidance system.
