  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies revealed changes in the pattern of cortical electrical activity of patients
      with Parkinson's disease (PD) and suggested that these changes may be dependent on the
      phenotypes of the disease and other related factors. A greater understanding of cortical
      electrical activity in PD patients may be relevant to guide professionals about the
      therapeutic use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). The present study
      aims to evaluate the pattern of brain activity of PD patients and to correlate the findings
      with the disease phenotypes and with other clinical characteristics. For this, volunteers
      with PD and healthy will participate in a single experimental session in which behavioral and
      electrophysiological assessments will be performed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy individuals, after reading and signing the free and informed consent will be
      submitted to a single session to obtain the normal neurophysiological and behavioral
      endpoints and thus compare with those obtained in individuals with PD. All volunteers
      (healthy and patients) will be submitted to a behavioral and neurophysiological evaluation
      through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG).

      The neurophysiological evaluation will be conducted during &quot;ON&quot; (with medication) and &quot;OFF&quot;
      (without medication) period, by transcranial magnetic stimulation by single pulse (EMT-p) and
      by EEG. TMS can perform different measures for the study of cortical excitability. The
      analysis of the motor cortex excitability will be held by: (i) determination of motor
      threshold (ii) the amplitude of the motor evoked potential (MEP). Since the assessment of the
      cortex activity will be held by: (i) power spectrum density (PSD) of all frequencies bands.75
      For evaluation with the TMS (Neurosoft - Russia) volunteers will be instructed to sit in a
      chair and get comfortable position. Initially single TMS stimuli will be administered over
      the motor cortex to determine the cortical representation area of the first dorsal
      interosseous muscle (FDI) - MEP region whose response occurs more intensely observed by
      electromyography. The electrodes with 10 mm diameter should be placed on the belly of the
      target muscle and the reference electrode is placed in the interphalangeal joint of the
      thumb. All care for the acquisition of electromyographic signal will be taken according to
      the criteria of Surface Electromyography for the Non-invasive Assessment of Muscles (SENIAM).

      For the location of the representative FDI muscle cortical region coil with an angle of 45
      degrees is positioned at a distance of 20% of Cz point (according to the international system
      for marking 10-20) bring into the contralateral muscle to be evaluated. For all evaluations
      the same coil is used, the figure-eight angled in order to avoid measurement bias. To assess
      cortical excitability of both hemispheres, the following measures are carried out: resting
      motor threshold (RMT) and motor evoked potentials (MEP).

      For EEG assessment, the electrodes will be positioned on the scalp of the individual,
      according to the international 10-20 marking system, maintained with the maximum impedance of
      10kΩ. During the acquisition of the electroencephalographic signal, a motor imagery and
      execution protocol will be performed, in both upper limbs. The collected data will be further
      processed and analyzed by MATLAB® software for Windows.

      For behavioral assessment the following scales and tests will be performed during &quot;ON&quot; (with
      medication) and &quot;OFF&quot; (without medication) period: Parkinson's disease sleep scale; Geriatric
      Depression Scale; Edinburgh Handedness Inventory; International Physical Activity
      Questionnaire; Timed up and go test; Berg Balance Scale; Unified Parkinson's disease Rating
      Scale sessions II and III.

    <description>to determine the resting motor threshold (RMT), the minimum of stimulator output necessary to emit 5 pulses with amplitudes above 50 microvolts in 10 trials. The investigators will use the motor threshold assessment tool to perform RMT assessment. Motor threshold means a measure of pyramidal neurons.</description>

    <time_frame>before and 1 hour after the medication ingestion.</time_frame>
    <description>to measure the MEP, the intensity of the magnetic stimulator will be adjusted to 120% of RMT and 20 stimuli will be registered. The volunteer will be sitted, completely relaxed. The amplitude means of evoked potentials will determine the MEP.</description>

    <time_frame>before and 1 hour after the medication ingestion.</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluation of the basic functional mobility of individuals will be performed by the Timed up and go test. It is analyzed the time spent by the individual to get up from a chair with arms, walk for three meters and return to the chair. Higher time values and step numbers represent a greater risk of falls.</description>

    <description>The balance of individuals will be assessed through the Berg Balance Scale, which comprises 14 items with a score of 0-4 each from 0 (worst) to 4 (best performance), used to assess dysfunction in balance and independence in life activities daily.</description>

    <measure>Change in motor impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>before and 1 hour after the medication ingestion.</time_frame>
    <description>The Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) will be applied to assess the motor performance of individuals. It is the most commonly used scale for assessing the severity of PD. In the present study, the UPDRS session III will be analyzed, comprising 14 items with a score of 0-4 each, from the best to the worst motor performance. According to the scores presented in UPDRS, patients will be classified as: (i) tremor-dominant or (ii) with postural instability and gait difficulty.</description>

    <measure>Sleep quality</measure>
    <time_frame>before the medication ingestion.</time_frame>
    <description>PDSS is composed by 15 questions that assess nocturnal disorders caused by PD symptoms, whose scores vary from 0 (zero), considered as the worst perception of sleep quality, and 10 (ten) the best. Overall scores less than 82 or less than five in each subitem may be indicative of changes in sleep quality</description>

    <measure>Depression level</measure>
    <time_frame>before the medication ingestion.</time_frame>
    <description>The scale is one of the most sensitive and reliable for the detection of depression in the elderly and PD patients. It is a 30-question scale that assesses the individual's perception of their feelings in the last week. Individuals can be classified according to the following extracts: absence of depression (0-9 points); mild depression (11-20 points); severe depression (21-30 points).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Handedness</measure>
    <time_frame>before the medication ingestion.</time_frame>
    <description>For the determination of the handedness, the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory will be used, consisting of 10 questions about the manual preference in performing 10 tasks usually performed by most people. Positive values are considered for the right hand and negative for the left hand. A score of +10 points will be awarded if the patient performs activity exclusively with the right hand and -10 points if performed exclusively with the left. For activities performed with both hands, +5 points to the right and -5 points to the left, the inventory can total 100 positive or negative points. The sum is represented by the manual preference index, which should be&gt; 70 if right dominance and ≤ -70 if left dominance.</description>

    <measure>Physical activity level</measure>
    <time_frame>before the medication ingestion.</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the level of physical activity performed by the individual, including daily and occupational tasks, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) will be applied. The long version has 27 questions, subdivided into four dimensions of physical activity (work, transportation, domestic activities and leisure) and a session related to the time released sitting during the week. Individuals who perform physical activity within the current recommendation (at least 30 minutes a day, most days of the week), with the sum of at least 150 minutes per week of at least moderate intensity physical activity.</description>
