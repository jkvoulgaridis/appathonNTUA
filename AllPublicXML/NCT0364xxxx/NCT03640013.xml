  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preformed metal crowns (PMCs) have high success rates in restoring primary molars in children
      but they were not generally used by dentists, especially in developing countries due to its
      demand of high clinical skills with the conventional technique (CT). The biological approach,
      Hall technique (HT), requires less training and can be placed by less experienced dental
      operators including therapists. Previous studies were mainly carried out in developed
      countries. The aims were to investigate and compare the efficacies and cost-effectiveness of
      PMCs placed by these two techniques.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective randomised control trial design was used. The study was carried out in a dental
      practice in Sudan, an under-developed country with lower social economic group. Children
      between 5-8 years were invited and selected if they met the inclusion criteria. Only those
      who had 1-2 carious primary molars needing PMCs were randomised. The PMCs were placed by a
      dentist in the CT arm and by a therapist in the HT arm. The children were follow up every 6
      months up to 2 years. The demographic details, periodontal health, occlusion, children
      anxieties, and procedure time were recorded. The Kaplan-Meier survival rates for each arm
      were calculated. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated using the
      results and the local salaries

    <description>The intervention involves removal from the primary molar and a preformed metal crown is placed using glass ionomer. The subject is then asked to bite until crown is seated. No occlusal adjustment is carried out.</description>

    <description>The procedure involves administering local anesthetic and the intervention involves remoal of caries from the affected primary molar. The tooth is then reshaped and contoured to to enable a preformed metal crown placement. Occlusal and marginal fit is improved by crimping the metal crown to improve fit. The preformed metal crown is cemented with glass ionomer restorative material and occlusion finally checked. The subject is then asked to bite on a cotton roll for two minutes until the cement has set.</description>
