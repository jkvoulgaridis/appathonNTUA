      Multisite Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) testing the efficacy of the Promoting Resilience
      in Stress Management (PRISM) intervention among Adolescents and Young Adults receiving
      hematopoietic cell transplantation for hematology malignancy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The experience of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for hematologic malignancy among
      Adolescents and Young Adults (AYAs) is particularly difficult because age-related
      developmental challenges of identity, relationships, and vocation may add to the burden of
      cancer. Compared to other age-groups, AYAs have poorer psychosocial outcomes including
      increased anxiety and depression and poorer adherence to oral immunosuppressive medications.
      These outcomes may, in turn, predispose AYAs to disease-related morbidity and mortality such
      as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and/or cancer-relapse. A potential barrier to improving
      these experiences may be that AYAs have few opportunities to develop the personal resources
      needed to handle adversity. We have previously developed the &quot;Promoting Resilience in Stress
      Management&quot; (PRISM) intervention for AYAs with serious illness. This manualized, brief
      intervention is delivered in 4, 30-60 minute, one-on-one sessions, followed by a Parent/
      Caregiver/ Spouse/ significant other inclusive meeting. It targets skills in
      stress-management and mindfulness, goal-setting, positive reframing, and meaning-making. All
      of these skills are associated with improved patient well-being in other populations, and
      preliminary findings from a recently closed phase II randomized controlled trial among AYAs
      with newly diagnosed cancer suggest PRISM is associated with improved health-related quality
      of life. This study will build on our prior experience and fill a critical knowledge gap
      regarding PRISM's impact among AYAs receiving HCT. Thus, we will conduct a multi-site
      randomized controlled trial among N=70 AYAs (n=35 PRISM and n=35 usual care; ages 12-24
      years), with the primary trial outcome of patient-reported symptoms of anxiety and
      depression. Secondary outcomes will include the cost-effectiveness of the intervention in
      this population and the impact of the intervention on parent well-being. Exploratory outcomes
      will assess patient adherence to oral chemotherapy. We hypothesize that AYAs who receive
      PRISM will report fewer mixed affective symptoms and demonstrate better adherence, while
      their parents report improved quality of life and psychological distress. We also anticipate
      the intervention will be cost-effective. In sum, this study offers an opportunity to expand
      the body of knowledge regarding methodologically rigorous and evidence-based psychosocial
      interventions and standards of care for AYAs with hematologic malignancies. Ultimately, this
      research has the potential to reduce the burden of cancer in these vulnerable populations.

    <measure>Hospital Anxiety &amp; Depression Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6-months</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS assesses mixed affective symptoms in patients with serious illness. The scale consists of 7 questions for anxiety and 7 for depression. Each is scored from 0-3, for a total range of 0-21 points per subscale. &quot;Caseness&quot; of anxiety and depression is defined as ≥8 points, with sensitivity/specificity of 0.8/0.9 for anxiety and 0.8/0.8 for depression.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6-months</time_frame>
    <description>The MSAS measures the presence, severity, frequency, and extent of bother from 32 symptoms Likert scales assess physical and psychological symptoms. Total- and sub-scores are calculated as an average and normalized to a scale of 0-100, with higher scores representing higher symptom burden.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PedsQL Generic Core and Cancer-Related Quality of Life Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6-months</time_frame>
    <description>The PedsQL 4.0 Generic and 3.0 Cancer Module include 50 items evaluating health-related quality of life of AYAs with cancer. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale and total scores transformed to a 0-100 scale with higher scores representing better HRQOL. Internal consistency ranges from 0.75 to 0.92.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6-months</time_frame>
    <description>The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) measures inherent resiliency. Two items from the original 25-item CD-RISC were used to create a brief, 2-item scale (the CD-RISC2), namely items 1 (&quot;Able to adapt to change&quot;) and 8 (&quot;Tend to bounce back after illness or hardship&quot;). Each item consists of a 5-point Likert scale (scored from zero to four). The 2-item scale has a total of 10 points, with higher scores reflecting greater perceived resilience.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cost-Effectiveness of PRISM intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>6-months</time_frame>
    <description>The main cost-analyses will determine the total, per-patient, 6-month costs of PRISM versus usual care. Using Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) we will then estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). QALYs will be calculated with Health Utilities Index scores. The HUI consists of 15 total queries to assess 2 systems; scoring is based on standard gamble utilities, with scores from 0 (health-state preference equivalent to death) to 1 (perfect health). Costs will be measured with a study-specific cost-of-care checklist adapted from consensus guidelines to track direct and indirect patient costs.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hope Scale Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>6-months</time_frame>
    <description>The Snyder &quot;Hope&quot; Scale measures &quot;the overall perception that one's goals can be met.&quot; The instrument scored on an 8-point Likert scale (score range 0-64). Higher scores imply greater levels of hopeful thought patterns.</description>

    <measure>Parent Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7 scores)</measure>
    <time_frame>6-months</time_frame>
    <description>Parent Anxiety: This 7-item survey is commonly used to identify cases of generalized anxiety disorder and to assess symptom severity. GAD-7 score range from 0 to 21, with scores of ≥5, ≥10, and ≥15 representing mild, moderate, and severe anxiety symptoms levels, respectively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parent Depression (PHQ-8 scores)</measure>
    <time_frame>6-months</time_frame>
    <description>Parent Depression: This 8-item survey is scored on a 4-point Likert scale and the sum (0- 27) indicates the degree of depression, with scores of ≥5, ≥10, and ≥15 representing mild, moderate, and severe depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parent quality of life (SF-36 scores)</measure>
    <time_frame>6-months</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 incorporates 8 concepts: physical functioning, body pain, limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems as well as emotional well-being and social functioning, energy, fatigue and general health perceptions. Scores will be summed and normalized to a 100 point (0-100) scale, with higher scores indicating higher quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Impact of PRISM on oral adherence to GVHD medications</measure>
    <time_frame>6-months</time_frame>
    <description>Exploratory aim: This study will use the medication electronic monitoring system (MEMS) monitoring device to evaluate real-time medication adherence. Participants will store prescriptions for their primary GVHD prophylaxis in study-dispensed MEMS bottles and caps. Digital data with each cap-opening will be tracked and matched to prescription records to evaluate adherence, with a threshold of &gt;90% indicating adherent versus non-adherent behavior.</description>
