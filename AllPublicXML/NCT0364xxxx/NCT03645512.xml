      The Corporate Athlete® Resilience (CAR) Training Program is a 1-day training program that
      uses a holistic approach that focuses on moving between stress and strategic recovery to help
      build resilience and enable higher performance.

      The purpose of this RCT is to determine whether the CAR Training Program has significant
      impact on nurses' resilience and stress mindset in their personal lives and their working
      environment. Knowledge from this study can be applied to interventions in the future to
      improve resilience behavior.

    <textblock>
      The ongoing nursing shortage in the U.S health care system is a multifaceted issue. One
      factor leading to the nursing shortage is high turnover, particularly among critical care
      nurses due to their experiences with stressful work environments, ethical dilemmas, and high
      rates of patient morbidity and mortality. There is also a high prevalence of psychological
      disorders, such as anxiety, depression, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) among
      critical care nurses. Consequences of turnover and low nurse staffing include lower quality
      of care, lower patient satisfaction, increased medical errors, increased rates of health care
      associated infections, and higher 30-day mortality rates.

      Resilience is defined as &quot;the ability to adapt to life's ever-changing landscape and recover
      quickly from the stressors and potential stressors&quot;. It is a learned psychological
      characteristic that can be used to bounce back after disruption and successfully adapt to
      stressful work experiences in a positive manner.
