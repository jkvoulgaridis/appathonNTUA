  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The occurrence of arterial hypertension (AH) during pregnancy is a major cause of fetal,
      neonatal and maternal morbidity and mortality in western countries. It is estimated that
      about 10% of pregnancies are complicated by AH (80 000 women / year in France). It is
      therefore essential to diagnose AH with certainty in order to set-up appropriate care and
      follow its evolution.

      The objective of this study is to show the interest of self-measurement with teletransmission
      for long-term follow-up of hypertensive pregnant women (at high risk of preeclampsia) by
      avoiding repeated, prolonged visits or hospitalizations and to optimize the intervention of
      health professionals by providing them with reliable data.

      A multicenter, randomized, controlled study will be conducted in women presenting with mild
      to moderate hypertension without preeclampsia followed throughout their pregnancy by either
      self-measurement with teletransmission or by conventional follow-up in hospital consultation.

    <description>Patients in the distant follow-up group, perform the measurement of blood pressure at their home, on a daily basis, in complying with the &quot;rule of 3&quot; stated by the Haute Autorité de Santé (French Health Authority) : i.e. 3 consecutive measurements in the morning and in the evening, after a period of rest Measurements are performed using a blood pressure monitor Bluetooth-connected to a tele-communicating box which automatically and securely transmits the data to the healthcare team via a secure web platform.
A trained nurse or midwife participating in the project will daily consult the blood pressure values and alert history through a secure web interface. If a threshold value is exceeded (and depending on the alert), a consultation will be scheduled (unexpected consultation) and notified to the patient.</description>

    <description>Standard care includes several follow-up visits in the maternity wards where the patient is cared for and at a frequency set by the coordinating physician on a case-by-case basis depending on the severity of the AH.
During the follow-up visits, the following examinations will be carried out in the maternity services in charge of the patient. Examinations will be conducted routinely as part of a follow-up pregnancy.</description>
