  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EDUMICILOR is a monocentric prospective pilot study for patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD).

      During the study, patients will participate in an online therapeutic education program.

      They will first have an appointment with a nurse to establish a personalized educational
      diagnosis. Then they will participate in the online therapeutic education program for about 6
      months (depends on the educational needs, expectations and patient's availabilities).

      The main objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of an online therapeutic
      education program for IBD patients.
