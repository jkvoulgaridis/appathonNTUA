    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this project is to investigate the effectiveness of daily acute
      intermittent hypoxia therapy (dAIH), coupled with massed practice training, to improve
      upper-extremity function in individuals with chronic incomplete cervical SCI.

      Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the effectiveness of a combined intervention utilizing dAIH and
      massed practice upper extremity training on arm and hand function in individuals with
      incomplete tetraplegia.

      Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the effectiveness of a combined intervention utilizing dAIH therapy
      and robotic rehabilitation device-administered upper-extremity training on arm and hand
      function in persons with incomplete tetraplegia.

    <description>The Graded Redefined Assessment of Strength, Sensibility and Prehension (GRASSP) is an extensive and validated impairment and functional measure which is able to detect subtle neurologic changes in individuals with spinal cord injury.
Specifically, it evaluates the domains of sensation, strength, quality of different grip patterns and the ability to complete a variety of functional tasks.</description>

Once fitted with the mask, initial recordings of heart rate, blood pressure, and arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) will be taken. The sequence of hypoxia will consist of 60- 90 seconds of 9-10% O2 (FiO2 0.09), alternating with 60- 90 seconds of 21% O2 (normoxic air FiO2 0.21). The delivery of hypoxia and normoxic air mixtures will be repeated up to 18 times per session each, for a total of up to 45 minutes, to maintain SpO2 at 80-90%.</description>

    <description>Address gross upper extremity movements, grip and pinch strength, and coordination.
Tasks utilized may include, but are not limited to: lifting a weighted can, squeezing, cutting paper, popping bubble wrap, translating different resistance clothespins, etc. The ultimate goal of the session is to achieve a total of 300 repetitions during training. Task difficulty may be progressed (making it more difficult), if the participant is able to achieve &gt;100 repetitions in less than 15 minutes, on two different occasions. A task may be made easier if the participant is unable to achieve 50 repetitions of a task within 15minutes. Progressing a task may include: changing the task, addition of resistance, increasing the range of motion required for a task to be deemed successful, increasing/decreasing the size of the object used. The number of total repetitions and any item progressions will be recorded.</description>

    <description>The Rapael Smart Glove is a virtual reality hand exoskeleton rehabilitation device. The tasks selected will address gross movement and hand function during a 45 minute session. Additional time may be required for device set up and activity selection/modification. Tasks utilized will include, but are not limited to: fly swat, throwing darts, squeezing an orange, catching a baseball, and floating fish. Tasks will be modified based on participants' perceived fatigue and challenge levels, as determined by a rating from 0-10. The participant goal will be to maintain the task difficulty between a 5-8/10 range. This would depict a moderate to difficult task rating, but an ability to complete the task. Progressing a task may include: changing the task, addition of resistance, increasing the range of motion required for task success, and increasing the duration of contraction. The number of total repetitions and activity outcomes will be recorded.</description>

             (cylindrical grasp, lateral key pinch, and tip to tip pinch), on at least one upper
             extremity.

          5. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign an informed consent.

          6. At least a 10% change in isometric elbow strength above baseline, after a single bout
             of Acute Intermittent Hypoxia (AIH), during screening.

             infraction, or known carotid/intracerebral artery stenosis.

             extremity musculature within the last 3 months. Participants will need to refrain from
