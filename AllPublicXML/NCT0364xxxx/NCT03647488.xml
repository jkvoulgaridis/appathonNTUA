  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical research study and the purpose of the study is to learn whether the
      combination of the drugs capmatinib plus spartalizumab helps to control lung cancer better
      compared to a single agent chemotherapy (docetaxel) and whether it is safe when given to
      patients with NSCLC.

      Capmatinib is an oral drug that is called a &quot;targeted&quot; medicine: this means it targets
      particular processes, which may not be working properly in the cancer cells in your body
      (called dysregulation) and which may be causing your disease.

      Spartalizumab is an antibody (a kind of protein that binds to a specific &quot;target&quot; protein).
      By blocking its &quot;target&quot; protein, called PD-1, spartalizumab may increase the activity of a
      certain type of cells in your immune system, which may reduce the growth of your tumor.

      Docetaxel is a standard chemotherapy medicine commonly used to treat your type of lung
      cancer. This standard, anti-cancer medicine is a cytotoxic chemotherapy that is being
      compared with capmatinib and spartalizumab.

      The reason for this study is to find out which of these two treatments (combination of
      capmatinib plus spartalizumab OR docetaxel alone) helps to control lung cancer better.
