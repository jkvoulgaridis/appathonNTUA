  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The burden of colorectal cancer (CRC) is unequal among various populations within the United
      States. This inequality is most notable among African Americans, who exhibit the highest CRC
      mortality of all US populations. This study aims to evaluate a community-based intervention
      to educate, assess risk, and overcome barriers to screening among African Americans who are
      45 years or older with no personal history of CRC, adenomas, or inflammatory bowel disease
      and have no family history of CRC.

      Barriers being assessed include: Need for establishing care with primary care physician, need
      for financial assistance, need for reminder calls, need for transportation, need for
      appointment coordination, and need for education about colonoscopy preparation and procedure

      After reviewing the existing literature this study team believes that the proposed strategy
      is inherently unique, thus amenable to experimental inquiry.

      The study will provide much needed data to define the extent to which the proposed
      multi-faceted approach may be effectively deployed to the target population. This includes
      the acquisition of data to evaluate the educational program, for which improvement in
      knowledge may be tested objectively using the study design, as well as survey and feasibility
      data which is pivotal for improving the strategy.

      The 11 steps for completing cancer screening are listed below:

        1. Demographic/Socio-economic information

        2. Knowledge assessment and education

        3. Risk assessment questionnaire &quot;Am I Average Risk?&quot;

        4. Do I need screening colonoscopy?

        5. Barriers to colorectal cancer screening

        6. Outreach program evaluation

        7. Participants data entered in REDCap database

        8. Communication with primary care provider and navigator

        9. Participant navigation

       10. Evaluation of navigation services

       11. Program monitoring

    <description>After participants complete the Pre-test, an educational session will be presented by a trained caregiver, delivered in a lecture-style manner with Power Point projection of educational material. The slides in this presentation will be scripted to mitigate variability among different presenters. Topics addressed in the presentation include: CRC basics (including brief anatomy), data on disparity, risk factors, screening modalities, preventative measures, population disparities of CRC, colonoscopy exam and other screening tests. The emphasis will be on CRC risks factors and prevention. All required information that is needed to correctly answer post-test questions is embedded within the presentation.</description>
