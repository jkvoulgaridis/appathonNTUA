  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To descride the clinical presentation, diagnosis, management and complications of children
      with a deep neck infection. A retrospective chart review was conducted at the Montpellier
      hospital in France. All children aged less than 18 years who had been admitted with a
      diagnosis of cervical phlegmon, tonsillar abscesses, retropharyngeal or parapharyngeal
      abscesses between January 2015 and December 2017 were included. The investigators collected
      the demographic, biological, radiological data and treatment received of the patients to the
      admision. The results of the bacteriological samples were collected. The investigators
      compared our results to those of the 10-year cohort. The investigators wish to compare the
      duration of hospitalization and the duration of the fever enter the group treated by alone
      antibiotic and the group treated by antibiotic and surgical drainage
