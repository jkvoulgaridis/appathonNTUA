    <textblock>
      This study investigated the effect of listening to self-selected music on anxiety and
      physiological responses in patients prior to gastroscopy. A randomized controlled trial was
      conducted, in which patients scheduled for gastroscopy in a medical center located in Taipei,
      Taiwan, were enrolled. The experimental group listened to self-selected music with earphones
      for 15 min before the procedure, whereas the control group rested for 15 min. Blood pressure
      (BP), heart rate, respiratory rate, and anxiety level were measured immediately before and
      after the intervention.

      Potential study patients were referred from physicians. The research assistant described the
      study's purpose and procedure to the patients and explained their right to refuse or withdraw
      from the study without jeopardizing their procedure. In addition, the privacy of each
      patient's data was ensured by storing the data in a file that required a password to access.
      Personal identification was by no means included in the data file. In addition, the
      participants were assured that their data would not be used for purposes other than this
      research.

      After obtaining their consent, the participants were randomly assigned into the music group
      or the control group by drawing lots. We brought the participants to a separate and quiet
      room in the waiting area to prevent environmental interference. First, the participants
      completed the study questionnaire; then, the research investigator measured their
      physiological parameters. The participants in the music group selected the music they
      preferred from different genres, namely Chinese pop, Taiwanese songs, western classical ,
      light music, western pop, and nostalgic music. If a participant had no particular preference,
      music with a low tone, regular rhythm (approximately 60-80 beats per minute), and soft melody
      (light music, 5%) was used, as recommended by a previous study. During the 15-min
      intervention period before the gastroscopy procedure, the experimental group rested by
      listening to music and sitting on a comfortable chair, whereas the control group rested only
      by sitting on a comfortable chair. After the 15-min intervention, the patients' anxiety and
      physiological parameters were reassessed.

    <description>Anxiety was measured using the Chinese version of the 20-item State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-State Anxiety Scale (STAI-S), which demonstrated high reliability (Cronbach's alpha of 0.91) in patients with anxiety disorders.32 Total scores for state anxiety ranged from 20 to 80; higher scores indicated higher levels of anxiety.</description>
