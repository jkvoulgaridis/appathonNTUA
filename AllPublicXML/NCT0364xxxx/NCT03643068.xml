    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety of orally administered KSP-QRH-E3-IRDye800 (Peptide 919288G), a
      topically administered Li-Cor IRDye800CW labeled heptapeptide dimer (KSP/QRH Dimer) specific
      for human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR).

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IA study of the safety of an orally administered KSP-QRH-E3-IRDye800 (Peptide
      919288G) heptapeptide dimer for detection of neoplastic tissues in multiple areas of the
      gastrointestinal tract in humans. The investigators intend to enroll 25 evaluable subjects.
      The investigators expect to be able to enroll about 2-3 subjects per week, so the study
      should take about 2-3 months to complete.

      Interested, healthy subjects ages 25-100 who respond to recruitment advertising on
      UMHealthResearch.org and appear to be eligible based responses to inclusion/exclusion
      criteria questions will be scheduled for a study visit at MCRU. At the study visit, the
      subjects will review and sign the informed consent and eligibility will be confirmed. If
      eligible, subjects will provide a blood sample for clinical labs and a urine sample for
      urinalysis, as well as have an EKG. A negative urine pregnancy test for women of
      child-bearing potential is required to be eligible. Eligible subjects will consume the
      reconstituted KSP-QRH-E3-IRDye800 (Peptide 919288G). After 5 minutes, subjects will drink a
      minimum 4-8 ounces of tap water and vital signs will be taken. Subjects will remain in MCRU
      for observation for 30 minutes. Vital signs will be recorded after 30 minutes, and another
      EKG will be conducted. Subjects are required to return to MCRU to have a repeat blood draw
      for clinical labs and urinalysis within 24 to 48 hours after KSP-QRH-E3-IRDye800 (Peptide
      919288G) ingestion. The study team will conduct a verbal assessment for toxicity at this
      visit.

    <description>The first three subjects will receive lyophilized powder reconstituted with 5 mL of 0.9% NaCl, 0.6 mg of KSP-QRH-E3-IRDye800 (Peptide 919288G) total. For the first three subjects, 3.34 mL of KSP-QRH-E3-IRDye800 (Peptide 919288G)will be discarded. The 1.66 mL of KSP-QRH-E3-IRDye800 (Peptide 919288G)remaining in the syringe will be administered by squirting it into the mouth of the subject.</description>

    <description>Following a safety review of the first three subjects receiving 0.6 mg dose, the remaining 22 subjects will receive the full 1.8 mg dose of KSP-QRH-E3-IRDye800 (Peptide 919288G) reconstituted in 5 mL 0.9% NaCl. These 22 subjects will receive all 5 mL of the peptide solution in a syringe for administration. The agent will not be reconstituted until the subject is ready to squirt the peptide into his or her mouth via syringe. They will be asked to wait 5 minutes and then drink at least 4-8 oz of tap water.</description>
