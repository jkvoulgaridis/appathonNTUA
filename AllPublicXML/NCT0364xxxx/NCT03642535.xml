      Background Actinic keratoses (AKs) are often treated separately, lesion by lesion. However,
      in the past years, AKs have been described as a field disease and not limited to single
      clinically apparent lesions. Treatment should therefore target an area of field change which
      may treat the subclinical AKs and reduce the risk of development of further AKs, second
      tumours, and local recurrence.

      Objectives The investigators sought to investigate whether field ALA-PDT of facial actinic
      keratosis would prevent new AKs, in comparison with a lesion area receiving the same ALA-PDT,
      in patients with clinical signs of field cancerization.

      Methods Eighty patients, previously diagnosed as having AKs of the face, were randomized
      distribution into two groups. 10% aminolaevulinic acid (ALA)-PDT for field treatment was on
      one group and for a lesion area (Vehicle control cream was applied to the non-lesion area)
      was on the other group. During the next 5-year period of follow up, patients were clinically
      evaluated for new AKs.

    <description>Scales and crusts were gently removed by curettage, and the lesions to be treated were scraped carefully to avoid bleeding. Immediately afterwards, a 1-mm thick layer of 10% ALA was applied to the all face. The area was covered with an occlusive dressing for 3 h, after which the remaining cream was removed with saline gauze, and the red fluorescence of porphyrins was visualized with Wood's lamp. Treatment area (all face)was then separately illuminated with red light-emitting diode lamps with peak emission at 630 nm and total light dose of 100 J/cm2. The treatment is once a week for total 3 times. The patients then follow up in clinic 3 years after their treatment to have the number of actinic keratoses counted.</description>
