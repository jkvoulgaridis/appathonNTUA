  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among major risk factors for stroke and major cardiovascular diseases, hypertension needs to
      be managed proactively as it can be controlled with the aid of proper drugs. There are still
      many occasions with unsatisfactory result of hypertension control even though a wide class of
      antihypertensive drugs are available. This is because factors affecting the effects of
      selected antihypertensive drugs such as the underlying disease, other concomitant
      medications, and treatment compliance of each patient are different. Especially, the timing
      for treatment initiation should vary depending on the risk of cardio-cerebrovascular disease,
      and studies on target blood pressure (BP) criteria require study results in actual treatment
      setting with a broad range of patients. The recent hypertension clinical practice guidelines
      published by American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA)
      reduced the target BP to 130/80 mmHg, indicating the needs for more aggressive efforts in
      hypertension treatment. However, studies in Koreans must be preceded before applying such new
      overseas guidelines; thus, this study has been designed to establish clinical materials
      reflecting treatment setting in Korea. In this study, patients with uncontrolled hypertension
      whose antihypertensive regimens are changed to ARB-based therapy (ARB monotherapy or
      ARB-containing combination therapy) will be followed to assess the treatment trend, treatment
      effect, and risk of cardiovascular disease.
