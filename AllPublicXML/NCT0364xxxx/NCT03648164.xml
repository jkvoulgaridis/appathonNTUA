      CREATION Health encompasses eight whole-person care principles: Choice, Rest, Environment,
      Activity, Trust, Interpersonal-Relationships, Outlook, and Nutrition. An existing initial
      tool consisting of 74 items related to the eight CREATION Health principles and college
      students' wellbeing were generated by subject/methodology experts. To develop the CREATION
      Health Assessment Tool for College Students (CHAT-CS), this initial tool needs to be
      finalized through item reductions and validations in the population of college students.

      CREATION Health encompasses eight whole-person care principles: Choice, Rest, Environment,
      Activity, Trust, Interpersonal-Relationships, Outlook, and Nutrition.

      Based on these principles, a health and wellness program, CREATION Health Wellness Program
      was developed. Since then various education/training plans using mind-body-spirit approaches
      have been implemented for different populations. Recently the Adventist Health System has
      plan to assess Adventist university students' health wellbeing and develop strategies to
      intervene and thus improve their overall wellbeing. However, literature review found that
      measures of these eight CREATION Health principles are often discrete and inconsistent.
      Therefore, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive, consistent assessment tool.

      An existing initial tool consisting of 74 items related to the eight CREATION Health
      principles and college students' wellbeing were generated by subject/methodology experts. To
      develop the CREATION Health Assessment Tool for College Students (CHAT-CS), this initial tool
      needs to be finalized through item reductions and validations in the population of college
      students.

If an item is not correlated (&lt;.30) with other items, then consider eliminating this item
If an individual item has a weak loading on all factors (.39 or less), consider removing
If an item has a high loading (.40 or more) on multiple factors, consider modification or elimination</description>
