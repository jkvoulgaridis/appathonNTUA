    <textblock>
      Background:

      Treatment outcomes for people with pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma are often poor. The
      drug LMB-100 can attack and kill cancer cells. The drug pembrolizumab helps the immune system
      fight cancer. Together, these drugs might help people with these cancers.

      Objective:

      To test if pembrolizumab given after LMB-100 shrinks tumors in people with pleural or
      peritoneal mesothelioma.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older with pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma that has not responded to
      platinum-based therapy

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Tumor sample. Participants will have a biopsy if one is needed.

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood, heart, and urine tests

      X-rays and scans: Participants will lie on a table. A machine will take pictures of the body.

      Participants will receive LMB-100 by IV on days 1, 3, and 5 of two 21-day cycles. They will
      be observed for up to 2 hours after each infusion. They will receive drugs like Benadryl,
      Tylenol, and Zantac to help with side effects.

      Starting with the 3rd cycle, participants will receive pembrolizumab by IV on day 1 of each
      21-day cycle for up to 2 years.

      Participants will have blood and urine tests, heart tests, and chest x-rays at least once per
      cycle. They will have scans every 6 weeks.

      Participants may opt to provide tumor biopsies before starting the first cycle, after 2
      cycles of LMB-100, and after 2 cycles of pembrolizumab.

      Participants will a follow-up visit 4-6 weeks after their last drug dose of the study drug.
      This includes blood and heart tests and scans. They may then have scans every 6 weeks.

      Participants will be contacted once a year for follow-up.

      Background:

        -  LMB-100, and a closely related immunotoxin, SS1P, also targeting mesothelin, have been
           studied in previous Phase 1 clinical studies for mesothelioma and pancreatic cancer.

        -  LMB-100 has demonstrated anti-tumor efficacy against several mesothelin expressing tumor
           models including mesothelioma PDX models

        -  PD-1 (encoded by the gene Pdcd1) is an Ig superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA-4
           that has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of
           its ligands

        -  The PD-1 receptor-ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress
           immune control. The normal function of PD-1, expressed on the cell surface of activated
           T-cells under healthy conditions, is to down-modulate unwanted or excessive immune
           responses, including autoimmune reactions.

        -  In immune-competent mice bearing human mesothelin expressing tumors local administration
           of LMB-100 with CTLA-4 blockade eradicates murine tumors by promoting anti-cancer
           immunity.

        -  LMB-100 treatment increase CD8+ T cell infiltration in murine lung adenocarcinoma tumors
           that express human mesothelin.

        -  Combination treatment with LMB-100 plus anti-PD1 results in greater anti-tumor efficacy
           in murine lung cancer model

        -  Pembrolizumab is an anti PD-1 antibody that has demonstrated responses of long duration
           in clinical trials and has generally been well-tolerated

        -  It is hypothesized that the anti-mesothelin immunotoxin LMB-100 followed by
           pembrolizumab will result in greater anti-tumor efficacy in patients with mesothelioma.

      Objectives:

      - To determine the objective response rate of sequential therapy with LMB-100 followed by
      pembrolizumab in subjects with pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma.

      Eligibility:

        -  Histologically confirmed epithelial or biphasic pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma (with
           &lt;50% sarcomatoid component) not amenable to potentially curative surgical resection.

        -  Subjects must have at least one prior chemotherapy regimen that includes pemetrexed and
           cisplatin or carboplatin.

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

        -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.

        -  Adequate organ and bone marrow function

        -  Prior PD1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatment is prohibited

        -  Chemotherapy within 4 weeks or radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to start of study
           therapy is prohibited.

        -  Subjects with active CNS metastasis are excluded

        -  Subjects with active autoimmune disease for which they had received systemic treatment
           during the previous 2 years receiving systemic glucocorticoids (excluding daily
           glucocorticoid-replacement therapy for conditions such as adrenal or pituitary
           insufficiency) are excluded

        -  Subjects with active interstitial lung disease, or a history of pneumonitis for which
           they had received glucocorticoids are excluded

      Design:

        -  This is an open-label, single center phase II study of LMB-100 followed by pembrolizumab
           in subjects with advanced pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma who have progressed on
           standard therapies.

        -  Subjects will receive LMB-100 at the single agent MTD on days 1, 3 and 5 of a 21-day
           cycle for 2 cycles and pembrolizumab 200 mg on day 1 of each subsequent 21-day cycle
           until disease progression (on or after pembrolizumab) or intolerable toxicity for a
           maximum of 2 years (unless second course initiated).

        -  Tumor biopsies will be performed at baseline, at the end of cycle 2 and at the end of
           cycle 4 to evaluate changes in the tumor immune microenvironment following treatment
           with LMB-100 and pembrolizumab.

        -  Up to 35 evaluable subjects will be enrolled

             disease.

          -  If participant received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the
             toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting study treatment.

          -  The effects of LMB-100 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and
             because anti-PD-1 antibodies such as pembrolizumab are assumed to be teratogenic:

          -  A male participant must agree to use contraception during the treatment period and for
             at least 180 days after the last dose of study treatment and refrain from donating
             sperm

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        - Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent
        or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study
        treatment.

        Note: Participants who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study may
        participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous
        investigational agent.

          -  Has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with
             previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically
             stable, i.e. without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging
             (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically

             excipients.

          -  Subjects who have received prior therapy with LMB-100, an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or
             anti-PD-L2 agent or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory
             T-cell receptor (e.g., CTLA-4, OX-40, CD137).

          -  Has received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy including investigational agents
             within 4 weeks prior to start of study therapy.

          -  Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study treatment.

          -  Has had a prior pneumonectomy

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug.
             Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles,
             mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus
             Calmette-Guerin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza
             vaccines (e.g., FluMist(R)) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy
             (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of
             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to start of study therapy.

          -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g.., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease(ILD) that
             required steroids or has current pneumonitis/ILD

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject s
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  A WOCBP who has a positive urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to start of
             study therapy (see Appendix B). If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed
             as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. Note: in the event that 72 hours
             have elapsed between the screening pregnancy test and the first dose of study
             treatment, another pregnancy test (urine or serum) must be performed and must be
             negative in order for subject to start receiving study medication.

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 180 days
             after the last dose of trial treatment. Pregnant women are excluded from this study
             because LMB-100 + pembrolizumab are agents with the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with LMB-100 +
             pembrolizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with
             LMB-100 + pembrolizumab. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in
             this study.

          -  Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus. HIV positive patients will be
             excluded due to a theoretical concern that the degree of immune suppression associated
             with the treatment may result in progression of HIV infection. (Note: No HIV testing
             is required)

          -  Has a known history of Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]
             reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA [qualitative] is
             detected) infection. or active HBV or HCV infection. (Note: No testing for Hepatitis B
             and Hepatitis C is required.)

          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment
             within the past 2 years. Note: Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin,
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in situ (e.g. breast carcinoma,
             cervical cancer in situ) that have undergone potentially curative therapy are not
             excluded.

          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.
