  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oocyte quality is a key limiting factor in female fertility which is primarily reflected in
      morphological features. Centrally located cytoplasm granulation (CLCG) is one type of
      cytoplasmic dimorphism exhibited by oocytes that could be linked to pesticide exposure with a
      significant risk of decreased ICSI outcomes.

      This retrospective study included 633 women who were part of an intracytoplasmic spermatozoa
      injection (ICSI) program between 2009 and 2011. The participants lived in the Picardy region
      of France and had been exposed to pesticides. The participants were divided in two groups
      based on prevalence of oocytes with CLCG (LCLCG [n= 83]: low prevalence of oocytes with CLCG
      under 25%. HCLCG [ n= 68]: high prevalence of CLCG over 75%). The embryological and clinical
      outcomes were analysed for both groups and were calculated using the difference between the
      two values.

    <description>The aim of the present study was to investigate the ICSI outcomes of couples presenting different CLCG prevalence's of retrieved oocytes (low prevalence of CLCG; fewer than 25% [LCLCG] and high prevalence of CLCG; over 75% [HCLCG]) and its correlation to pesticide exposure zones in the region of Picardy, France.</description>

        The population in the retrospective study consisted of 633 couples who attended a
        reproductive medical center and who were part of an ICSI program between 2009 and 2011. The
        study population is described in Table

        1. In the selected couples, women were normo-responders (oocyte cohort over 5), under 35
        years old, living in the Picardy, France region, and exhibited CLCG after oocyte morphology
        evaluation which was confirmed by a second embryologist (Fig. 1
