    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3, prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled,
      study product withdrawal study comparing the efficacy of ADV7103 versus placebo in preventing
      the development of metabolic acidosis defined by serum bicarbonate level in pediatric (6
      months to &lt; 18 years of age) and adult (18 to 65 years of age) subjects with primary dRTA.

      The study will target enrolling at least 4 subjects in each of the following age groups: 6
      months - 23 months; 2-11 years, and ≥ 12 years. Subjects will be in the study for up to 21
      weeks. After screening and enrollment, subjects will participate in an 8-12 week open label
      period where there dose of ADV7103 will be titrated to effect, then continued for the
      remainder of the open label period. Periodic measurements of bicarbonate and potassium levels
      will be collected during this period. Following the open-label period, subjects will enter a
      6-day randomized withdrawal period. For this portion of the study, subjects will be admitted
      to an inpatient setting. A follow-up period up to four weeks on re-established therapy
      completes the trial. Subjects will have the opportunity to subsequently enter a long-term,
      open label extension.
