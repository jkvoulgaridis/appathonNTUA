  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly half (47%) of patients with mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit report
      having dyspnea. This respiratory distress, with a feeling of &quot;thirst for air&quot;, often reaches
      unbearable limits and is a major factor in the deterioration of the quality of life and the
      prognosis of patients. Physiopathological mechanisms of dyspnea are beginning better
      understood and have analogies with those of pain. Like pain, dyspnea often persists despite
      appropriate treatment of the cause, because of perceptual dysfunction related to changes in
      cortical excitability and neuronal plasticity and requires specific treatments. Studies have
      shown that Transcranial Stimulation by low Current (tDCS) was able to modulate the perception
      of acute pain induced and chronic pain. The tDCS modulates the functioning of a whole set of
      brain structures including the anterior cingulate gyrus, the prefrontal cortex, the thalamus
      and the brain stem, some of which have an established role in the central integration of pain
      and dyspnea. The investigators have recently demonstrated that the application of tDCS on the
      primary cortical motor area reduces the excitability of the central neurological pathways
      dedicated to the respiratory muscles in healthy subjects. The investigators therefore
      hypothesize that tDCS could relieve dyspnea in intensive care. In this research project, the
      investigators propose to evaluate the efficiency of tDCS on dyspnea in patients admitted to
      intensive care unit, having sepsis and mechanically ventilated.
