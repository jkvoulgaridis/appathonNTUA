  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prolonged alcohol use results in drinking despite resultant problems and adverse
      consequences. The investigators propose to test a laboratory model of human seeking despite
      aversion to use as an early marker of disease onset, and as a tool for study of its neural
      functional substrates, and identification of effective treatments.

      The long-term goal for this project is to establish a model of alcohol seeking despite
      aversion (SDA) as a platform for the laboratory testing of novel pharmacologic and behavioral
      interventions that can be used among those with the highest risk, but who have yet to
      progress to treatment-resistant drinking. The objective of this application is to test SDA
      across multiple levels of analysis. The investigators consider SDA as an early marker of
      alcohol use disorder progression that is related to lifetime drinking history, alcohol use
      disorder risks, and brain physiology. The investigators have completed a pilot study
      demonstrating that SDA can be objectively quantified via an intravenous alcohol
      self-administration task, in which operant work for identical incremental alcohol rewards is
      paired with aversive stimuli. This preliminary data supports the central hypotheses that
      behavior in the SDA model is attributable to lifetime alcohol exposure, is related to alcohol
      use disorder risk factors and phenotypes, and reflects alterations in neural system function.
      In this project, SDA will be measured along with recent drinking history, negative
      affect-based rash action (i.e. negative urgency, including action with respect to alcohol
      use), and self-rating of the effects of alcohol. The rationale for this work is that it would
      lead to the first objective, well-validated measure of SDA in humans.

    <ipd_description>After publication of the main findings, a de-identified dataset will be made available through direct requests as described above; a statement to this effect will be included in all published manuscripts.
The current proposal utilizes the Seeking Despite Aversion Task, a newly developed Computer-Assisted Infusion System (CAIS) protocol that integrates delivery of visual stimuli into the Constant Attention Task and optical markers for evoked response potential generation. This task, like other CAIS protocols, will become part of the portfolio of CAIS programs that our lab makes available to other scientists once our specific funded use of this protocol is completed. Modified versions of this protocol could be provided to other investigators prior to completion of this project as long as these projects do not directly compete.</ipd_description>

    <ipd_access_criteria>Data and Resource Sharing Plan - Indiana Alcohol Research Center (IARC)
Consistent with its past history, the IARC continues to make available its data and resources to investigators engaged in alcoholism research outside of Indiana University. Detailed procedures are available on request. In brief, investigators must submit a written request specifying in adequate detail the specific resource(s) required and a study protocol indicating the specific aims, scientific rationale, methods and procedure, and analysis of results; a signed IARC Resource Utilization Agreement Form; and for studies involving human subjects, Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval if needed for the proposed study. The request will be reviewed by the IARC Steering Committee. Investigators must agree to acknowledge the Indiana Alcohol Research Center (P60 AA007611) as the source of the resource in all resulting publications.</ipd_access_criteria>
