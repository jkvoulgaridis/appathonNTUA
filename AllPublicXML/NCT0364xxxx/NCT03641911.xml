    <textblock>
      In SICU, Siriraj hospital there were no protocols place for the management of pain. All
      decisions were made according the attending physicians.

      There were no information about incidence of inappropriate pain management in SICU due to
      lack of validated tool for assessment.

      To date, Thai-version of BPS and CPOT were validated, the incidence of inappropriate pain
      management in SICU, Siriraj hospital should be assessed.
