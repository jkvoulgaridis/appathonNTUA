      To characterize the impact of Atrial fibrillation (AFib) and Atrial Flutter (AFl) on signals
      measured using a wearable cardiac monitor prototype device.

      To evaluate the relationship of AFib/AFl symptom severity with various physiologic signals
      measured from the wearable cardiac monitor prototype device.

      The is a non-randomized feasibility study that will enroll up to 50 participants with an
      ongoing episode of AFib/AFl and are referred for a cardiac ablation or electrical
      cardioversion procedure. A maximum of 20 persistent AFib, 20 paroxysmal AFib, and 20 AFl
      participants will be enrolled, not to exceed 50 total. There will be up to three data
      collection visits.

      Visit 1 will occur on the same day as enrollment and prior to the cardiac ablation or
      electrical cardioversion procedure. This allows collection of physiologic signals while the
      patient is in AFib or AFI.

      Visit 2 will occur after the cardiac ablation or electrical cardioversion procedure; no
      earlier than the day after the cardiac ablation or electrical cardioversion procedure and no
      more than 4 months after the day of the procedure.

      Visit 3 is optional, and may be scheduled upon sponsor's request, which will take place at
      least 5 months after the previous (second) data collection visit.
