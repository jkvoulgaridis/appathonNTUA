  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung neuroendocrine tumor (LNT) represents approximately 20% of all lung cancers. The
      classification of LNT relies upon morphology. Recently, in the World Health Organization
      (WHO) classification, Ki-67 rate has been proposed for classi fication. It is, however, known
      that Ki-67 count has a poor interlaboratory reproducibly. For that reason, our team has
      looked for a new biomarker.

      GLUT1 protein a facilitative glucose transporter protein which has ubiquitous expression in
      mammalian. GLUT1 is overexpressed in many human cancers. But, no study has evaluated the
      GLUT1 staining as an aid diagnosis in LNT.

      The team have assessed the GLUT1 immunohistochemical staining in 36 LNT and to assess its
      diagnostic value.

        Between 2009 and 2014, 36 consecutive patients underwent a surgical resection or biopsy of
        pulmonary neuroendocrine tumor at University Hospital of Amiens: 5 cases of atypical
        carcinoid tumor; 13 cases of typical carcinoid tumor; 8 cases of small cell neuroendocrine
        carcinoma; and 10 cases of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. Clinical data were obtained
        from retrospective review of medical records: population characteristics (age, gender) and
        tumor size
