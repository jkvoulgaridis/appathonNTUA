  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is a chronic condition that causes the most childhood disabilities on
      worldwide. Impairment in movement and posture development seen in children with CP it causes
      difficulties in performing activities and affect in emotional, social, and cognitive
      abilities cause limited participation in everyday life. The ICF-CY child is divided into five
      categories: body structure and functions, activities, participation, environmental and
      personal factors, it is treated holistically. Initially, children with CP have adopted the
      view that environmental factors can also affect functionality, while focusing on the
      treatment of motor disorders to reduce activity and participation limitations in
      physiotherapy and rehabilitation applications. Environmental factors; the environment in
      which the child lives, his family, the devices he uses, health and care services, and
      government policies. These factors vary according to each country's own cultural and economic
      opportunities. The investigator planned to do this study because we found that there is a
      need for a comprehensive study of children with SP in Turkey, which does not reveal the
      relationship between environmental factors and activity and level of participation.

      The study consist of two phases:

        1. European Child Environment Questionnaire (ECEQ) will translate in to Turkish in the
           first phase.

             -  Forvard translation (translate to Turkish from English)

             -  Expert opinion (Turkish version will control by expert)

             -  Back translation (Turkish version will translate to English)

             -  Cultural adaptation Validity and reliability study will done

        2. The relationship between environmental factors and activity and participation will be
           investigated in the second phase.

      Eligibility Criteria

        -  2-18 years old

        -  Cerebral palsy diagnosed

        -  Children or family who understand and speek Turkish language

        -  Children or family who know writing and reading

        -  Volunteer to join the study

      Outcome Measures

        1. Clinical classifications:

           Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) for classifying gross motor function
           levels Manuel ability classification system (MACS) for classifying fine motor function
           levels Communication Function Classification System (CFCS) for classifying communication
           function levels Eating Drinking Abilities Classsification System (EDACS) for classifying
           eating and drinking functions levels will be used

        2. Activity evaluation:

           Gross Motor Function Measurement (GMFM) Pediatric Evaluation of Disabilty Inventory
           (PEDI) will be used

        3. Participation:

           Life Habits Questionnaire (Life-H) will be used

        4. Environmental factors:

      European Child Environment Questionnaire (ECEQ) Impact on Family Scale (IPFAM) will be used
