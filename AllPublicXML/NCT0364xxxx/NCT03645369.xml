  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fifty-five patients received three subcutaneous heparin injections (165 injections) by the
      same investigator using additional techniques such as mechano-analgesia and cold application,
      and without any additional techniques.

    <textblock>
      The abdomen was divided into four quarters. The first, second, and third SC heparin
      injections were applied from the right abdominal region using ShotBlocker®, left abdominal
      region with an ice pack, and lower abdominal region without any additional application,
      respectively. All the injection sites were circled using a skin marking pen (r = 5 cm).

      All the injections were administered following a standard procedure. Pain and satisfaction
      were assessed immediately after the injection by using the VAS score. Ecchymosis was assessed
      with an ecchymosis measurement tool at 48 and 60 hours after the injection (Figure 3).

    <measure>Pain Intensity Measure via VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after injection</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS was used to measure pain intensity. The VAS was composed of a 10-cm long line, which had subjective descriptive expressions on both sides (0 cm: no pain and 10 cm: unbearable pain). The individual was asked to make a sign on the line indicating the degree of the pain. The numerical values were recorded by the researcher.</description>
