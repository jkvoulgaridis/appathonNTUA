      This study will examine the effect of detraining as a clinical tool to prevent recurrence of
      lone paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) and improve quality of life. Persons who engage in
      endurance activity with AF will be randomly assigned to undergo an 8-week period of
      detraining or encouraged to maintain their current level of exercise. Participants will
      receive a handheld device called AliveCor that can record an electrical tracing of the heart
      rhythm by pressing down with ones' thumbs. The amount of arrhythmia and symptoms will be
      recorded. The research team hypothesizes that among athletes with lone AF, an 8-week period
      of detraining will not affect atrial fibrillation recurrence or quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common tachyarrhythmia amongst athletes. Atrial
      fibrillation is associated with poor subjective health among Masters athletes, and negatively
      interferes with athlete's sporting activities. The decrease in physical performance during AF
      episodes is attributed to the loss of atrial contribution to cardiac output related to
      irregular and decreased diastolic filling, and loss of sympathetic and parasympathetic
      control over heart rate.

      There is a paucity of studies that examine the role of exercise in the treatment of atrial
      fibrillation among athletes. Detraining is the deliberate act of reducing volume of exercise
      to observe subsequent changes in cardiac indices over time or the partial or complete loss of
      training of induced anatomical, physiological and performance adaptions. Detraining is
      primarily employed as a diagnostic tool to help differentiate Athletes' heart from cardiac
      pathology. The role of detraining as a therapeutic modality is ill-defined and not well
      studied. There is a dearth of studies that examine the role of exercise in the treatment of
      atrial fibrillation among athletes. To date, only two observational studies (Furlanello and
      Hoogsteen) have suggested detraining as a potential treatment for AF among athletes. It is
      important to note the limitations of these studies: 1) observational study design 2) athletes
      were not systematically instructed to decrease exercise volume or 'detrain' 3) AF was not
      objectively assessed 4) pre and post measures of QOL were not recorded AF. Hoogsteen et al.,
      surveyed 30 athletes about exercise and AF symptomatology at the time of diagnosis and 9
      years later. At the time of the survey 30% of athletes noted a reduction in bouts of AF with
      a decrease in sporting activity. However, 43% of the athletes did not notice any relationship
      between reduction in activity and AF recurrence. This study was limited by the small sample
      size, selection bias due to symptomatic athletes responding, and AF recurrence based solely
      on subjective responses.

      Detraining has been shown to decrease premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and
      non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) burden amongst elite athletes. After a 3-month
      detraining period, PVCs and NSVT decreased by eighty and ninety percent, respectively. The
      same group of athletes experienced a prolonged suppression of PVCs and NSVT at 1-year after
      retraining. While detraining is often suggested to athletes with AF, there is little evidence
      to support this practice. To date, only small case series and individual case reports exist.

      This study aims to examine the effect of detraining as a clinical tool to prevent recurrence
      of lone paroxysmal AF (with no traditional AF risk factors and a structurally normal heart)
      and improve quality of life. Persons who engage in endurance activity with AF will be
      randomly assigned to undergo a 10-week period of detraining or encouraged to maintain their
      current level of exercise. Participants will receive a (1x 2.5 inch) handheld device called
      AliveCor that can record an electrical tracing of the heart rhythm by pressing down with
      ones' thumbs. The amount of arrhythmia and symptoms will be recorded. The research team
      hypothesizes that among athletes with lone AF, a 10-week period of detraining will not affect
      atrial fibrillation recurrence or quality of life.

    <description>AF symptom severity score at baseline, after completion of 8 weeks of either control or detraining, and at completion of 24 weeks of post-intervention monitoring. Measured using the Cardiovascular Society Severity of Atrial Fibrillation (SAF) Scale which identifies the presence of symptoms, the association of symptoms with AF, and the affect these symptoms have on the patients functionality. Based on the patient's responses, an SAF class of 0-4 is assigned. Class 0 refers to a patient who is asymptomatic with respect to AF while a class 4 patient has symptoms attributed to AF that have a severe effect on the patient's general quality of life.</description>

The questionnaire is comprised of 12 questions (4 focused on the extent to which patients are bothered by symptoms associated with AF, 2 focused on the extent to which patients feel limited in their daily life due to AF, and 6 focused on the difficulty that patients feel in doing daily activities due to AF) responded to on a 7-point scale where 1 represents being not at all bothered, limited or experiencing no difficulty, and 7 represents being extremely bothered, limited or experiencing extreme difficulty.</description>

    <description>General QOL will be assessed using the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) at baseline, after completion of 8 weeks of either control or detraining, and at completion 24 weeks of post-intervention monitoring. The SF-12 is a validated survey that was designed as a condensed version of the RAND 36-item Short Form Health Survey Instrument (SF-36) and provides two scores: physical and mental health composite scores (PCS &amp; MCS). The scores are computed on a scale from 0 to 100 where a score of zero represents the lowest level of health measured and 100 represents the highest level of health. For both the PCS and MCS, the responses from the 12 questions are combined and scored in such a way that they compare to an American national norm of 50.0 (with a standard deviation of 10.0).</description>
