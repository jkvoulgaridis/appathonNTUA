  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide a process and outcome evaluation of the HMRF
      grant-funded Connections program. Phoenix Houses of New York, Inc. has been given a new grant
      to continue and refine its successful Connections program which equips single and coupled
      participants with significant substance use disorders (SUD) with the skills and knowledge
      needed to (1) create and/or sustain healthy relationships/marriages, (2) equip participants
      with the skills and knowledge to raise children in a functional and healthy environment, (3)
      improve their financial stability, job readiness and employability to improve economic
      self-sufficiency and responsibility, and (4) reduce relationship stress and strain on
      interactions between co-parents.

      The process evaluation will focus on:

        -  Documenting project implementations and determining efficient replication methods for
           effective program components,

        -  Monitoring completion of overall program goals and objectives, and

        -  Allow for quality improvement during the five year grant cycle.

      The outcome evaluation which focuses on participant level impact will ask the following:

        -  Does participation in evidence-based relationship education improve healthy relationship
           skills for single or coupled enrollees?

        -  Does participation in partner education and support classes improve co-parenting
           relationship?

        -  Do participants have better attitudes toward their ability to manage money (i.e.
           savings, paying bills) after workshops in financial literacy and other money management
           services?

        -  Do participants have improved attitudes on their own employability after workshops
           targeted at job readiness?

        -  Does participation in job readiness preparation translate into improved employment
           prospects or readiness factors? (Readiness factors may include increased family assets
           and economic status.)

        -  Does participation in family care management sessions improve marriage/relationship,
           child and family well-being?

        -  Does participation in parenting education improve parenting skills and attitudes toward
           parenting? Does participation in parenting education improve commitment to parenting and
           children?
