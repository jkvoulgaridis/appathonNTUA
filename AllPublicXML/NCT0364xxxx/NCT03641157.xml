  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Obtaining airway security holds the utmost importance in anesthesia. Specific
      predictive tests or findings for difficult airway are not defined for various pediatric age
      groups. Anthropometric measurements are defined parallel to percentile curves in different
      age groups.

      Aim: The aim of this study is to find out the value of body mass index and anthropometric
      measurements in prediction of difficult laryngoscopy in children by comparing to direct
      laryngoscopic evaluation of Cormack-Lehane test.

      Methods: Following institutional ethics committee approval and informed consent of parents of
      108 patients (ages 0-3years), undergoing elective surgery were included in this study.
      Weight, height, body mass index and head circumference of the patients were measured and
      percentiles were recorded, prior to induction.

      Following standard anesthesia induction with thiopental all patients received 0,6 mg.kg-1
      rocuronium intravenously. After sufficient time for neuromuscular relaxation laryngoscopy
      performed and Cormack-Lehane scores recorded. All recorded parameters were compared with
      Cormack-Lehane scores.
