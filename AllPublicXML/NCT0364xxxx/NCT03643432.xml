  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is an effective treatment modality for many chronic conditions. The effectiveness of
      prescribed exercise can be limited by adherence to exercise programmes. Older people are more
      likely to have a long term, or multiple long term conditions, for which exercise is a
      treatment option. The investigators know that exercise engagement after discharge from
      hospital or physiotherapy is poor in older people. In addition to this there may be specific
      factors that affect exercise adherence in older people. Exercise adherence interventions can
      be viewed as behaviour change interventions, as their aim is to change the behaviour of the
      patient. However many interventions lack theoretical underpinning. This study will test the
      feasibility of a brief behavioural assessment underpinned by the COM-B behaviour change
      model, in addition to targeted adherence approaches based on that assessment. Participants
      will be randomised between usual care, and the behavioural assessment intervention arm.
      Adherence to the exercise programme given in physiotherapy will be recorded in both groups at
      6 and 12 weeks. Feasibility of recruitment, retention and acceptability of the intervention
      will also be assessed. A subsection of participants will also take part in a qualitative
      interview, this will explore participants experience of the trial intervention, in addition
      to the participants experience of attempting to adhere to an exercise programme.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The design of this study, is a a two arm feasibility randomised controlled trial.
      Participants will be randomised between usual care, or the intervention arm which will
      consist of a brief behavioural assessment and recommended adherence strategies based on the
      outcome of the assessment. A sub sample of the population will undergo a qualitative
      interview to assess acceptability of the intervention

      Potential research participants will be invited to take part in the study with an invitation
      letter, along with the PIS and a reply slip. These will be sent out with information about
      their physiotherapy appointment, which they would normally receive.

      After time to consider the study and ask any questions, if participants are happy to take
      part, an appointment will be made to take consent and collect baseline measures. This will
      take place at the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, if possible just prior to their physiotherapy
      appointment in order to limit disturbance to the participant. If this is not possible the
      appointment to collect consent and baseline data will be at a time convenient to the patient.
      At this appointment, signed consent will be recorded and baseline data collected. This will
      involve the participants completing some questionnaires.

      Treatment allocation will be decided on the basis of the physiotherapist the participant is
      seeing. (Before the start of the study all physiotherapist taking part in the study will be
      randomly assigned to deliver either usual care or the intervention arm). Those participants
      in usual care will undergo physiotherapy as normal, the only additional thing they will be
      asked to do, is to complete an exercise diary for up to 12 weeks.

      Those in the intervention arm will be asked to complete 4 short questions related to exercise
      and treatment expectations. These will be completed in the waiting room prior to the
      physiotherapy appointment. The participant will be assessed and given treatment as normal in
      physiotherapy. After they have been given an exercise programme as part of their treatment,
      they will be asked to complete a further 7 short questions related to the exercise programme,
      and their motivation and intention to undertake it. On the basis of the answers to these
      questions and also in addition to any discussion with the physiotherapists, one or more
      adherence approaches may be suggested. The approaches are 'review of exercise programme',
      'review of method of delivery', 'cues', 'reminders', 'discussion of barriers and problem
      solving', 'motivational interviewing', 'decision balance sheets', 'behavioural contract' and
      'goal setting review'. The participants in the intervention group will also be asked to
      complete an exercise diary for up to 12 weeks.

      Participants in both groups will be followed up at 6 weeks and 12 weeks after their initial
      physiotherapy appointment. the follow appointment will consist of completing some
      questionnaires and to collect exercise diaries (12 week follow up). For the majority of
      participants this will be the end of the study. However a small sub-sample of participant
      will be invited to take part in an interview. This will last no longer than 1 hour, and will
      aim to explore the views of participants regarding the study, and also about trying to stick
      to an exercise programme. Participants will be given time to consider taking part in this
      additional interview, and will be asked to provide signed consent. Once they have finished
      the interview, they will be finished in the study.

Exercise adherence intervention: Before their physiotherapy appointment participants will be given four short questions to answer. Following this the participant will be assessed as normal. As part of the treatment they will be given an exercise programme as standard within physiotherapy. Following this participants will be asked to answer a further seven short questions; depending on the answers to both sets of questions, and on any discussion based on the answers, the physiotherapist will suggest one or more adherence approaches from a list of suggestions. These are; Review of exercise programme; Review of method of delivery; Cues or prompts; Discussion of barriers and problem solving; Motivational interviewing, Decision balance sheets; Behavioural contract; Goal setting review; Monitoring telephone call; Reminders.</description>

        <description>This self-report questionnaire measures motivation for exercise, it measures forms of intrinsic and extrinsic regulation of exercise behaviour. It consists of 24 questions, each question is scored from 0 to 4, these scores can be summed to give various subscale scores, or all questions can be used by summing scores and multiplying by its subscores weighing to obtain the relative autonomy index (RAI) score. The RAI score can range from -24 to 24. A higher score indicating greater relative autonomy and a lower score indicating more controlled regulation.

          <description>The intervention arm will consist of a brief behavioural assessment and recommended adherence strategies based on the outcome of the assessment.
Exercise adherence intervention: Before their physiotherapy appointment participants will be given four short questions to answer. Following this the participant will be assessed as normal. As part of the treatment they will be given an exercise programme as standard within physiotherapy. Following this participants will be asked to answer a further seven short questions; depending on the answers to both sets of questions, and on any discussion based on the answers, the physiotherapist will suggest one or more adherence approaches from a list of suggestions. These are; Review of exercise programme; Review of method of delivery; Cues or prompts; Discussion of barriers and problem solving; Motivational interviewing, Decision balance sheets; Behavioural contract; Goal setting review; Monitoring telephone call; Reminders.</description>
