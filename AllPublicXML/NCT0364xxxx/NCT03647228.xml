    <textblock>
      This Phase 1/2a study is a double-blinded (subject and Investigator), randomized,
      placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single and multiple nebulized doses of IONIS-ENaCRx.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in 3 parts: a single ascending dose (SAD) leading to a multiple
      ascending dose (MAD) in healthy volunteers, followed by a MAD in patients with cystic
      fibrosis. The study will enroll up to 88 participants.

      The study will consist of 4 single-dose randomized cohorts. Participants enrolled will
      receive a single inhaled dose of the Study Drug (IONIS-ENaCRx or placebo) on Day 1.
