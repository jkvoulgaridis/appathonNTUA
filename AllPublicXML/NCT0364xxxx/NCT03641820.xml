      To investigate the occurrence of cognitive dysfunction in cancer patients with pain in
      China.Analysis of patients with different cancer pain, different analgesic drugs and
      different treatments are associated with the severity of cognitive dysfunction, to provide
      relevant evidence for the next screening, prediction, prevention and treatment. In order to
      achieve the purpose of improving the quality of life of cancer patients.

      Cross-sectional survey in patients with cancer pain is used in the outpatient clinics and
      wards of five cancer hospitals in China.

      This study is to survey the incidence of cognitive dysfunction in Chinese cancer patients,
      and the related factors of cognitive dysfunction, demographic characteristics (economic
      situation, education, gender, age), disease status (tumor type, staging) ), analgesic
      treatment (NRS score, with or without analgesic drugs, analgesic drug name, dose), anti-tumor
      treatment (with or without anti-tumor treatment, surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, time
      interval from last treatment, chemotherapy drugs) and so on.
