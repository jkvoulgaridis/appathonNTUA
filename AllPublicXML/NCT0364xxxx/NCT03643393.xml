  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Incarceration and necrosis of rectal prolapse is rare and often requires urgent management.
      Perineal rectosigmoidectomy (Altemeir procedure) is a reasonable technique for this
      condition. The need for a diverting stoma depends on the patient's condition and the
      experience and judgement of the surgeon. A literature review was performed to determine
      optimal management of incarcerated and necrotic rectal prolapse, and to determine the
      indication for fecal diversion.

    <description>In an Altemeier perineal rectosigmoidectomy, a full-thickness circumferential incision is made in the prolapsed rectum about 1-2 cm from the dentate line (see the image below). The hernia sac is entered, and the prolapse is delivered. The mesentery of the prolapsed bowel is serially ligated until no further redundant bowel can be pulled down. The bowel is transected and either hand-sewn to the distal anal canal or stapled with a circular stapler. Before anastomosis, some surgeons plicate the levator ani muscles anteriorly, which may help improve continence.</description>
