  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A fundamental challenge for healthcare is to achieve a balance between decreasing the misuse
      of opioids and associated harms while optimizing patient care, including the provision of
      multidisciplinary treatments for chronic pain. However, despite recommendations that
      non-pharmacological interventions are rudimentary in the management of chronic pain, the
      literature describing which psychosocial interventions are best practice is nearly
      non-existent. Most of the psychosocial treatments that target either CNCP or opioid misuse
      are very general and broad-based therapies. However, there is a lack of evidence-informed
      direction guiding which psychosocial treatments should be adapted to this specialized
      population and thus, further research is needed.

    <textblock>
      This project is a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an Integrated Psychosocial Group
      Treatment (IPGT) in patients with chronic pain who are at risk for opioid misuse. IPGT is a
      comprehensive approach that blends evidenced-based psychosocial treatments for chronic pain
      and opioid misuse and addresses each issue individually, but also the interconnections
      between the overlapping problems. IPGT consists of 6 weekly group sessions of motivational
      interviewing and behavioral change, self-management, and pain education focused on
      appropriate adherence to treatment and resisting urges to misuse prescription medications.
      The intervention also entails an education session on knowledge pertaining to overdose and
      naloxone distribution. This study will involve the randomization of 40 patients to receive
      either: (1) treatment as usual (TAU; n=20); or (2) integrated psychosocial group intervention
      (IPGT; n=20). This study will: (1) establish feasibility; (2) demonstrate acceptability; and
      (3) demonstrate preliminary efficacy for an integrated psychosocial group treatment model for
      patients with chronic pain who are at risk of opioid misuse. The data generated from this
      study will also serve as a foundation for future implementation to support a subsequent
      fully-powered RCT.

    <description>Acceptability will be determined with the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire, a 16 item 5-point Likert scale. All items will be summed up in each subscale and divided by the total number of items to calculate composite scores. The median value of 3.0 will be used as a comparison to determine whether or not the experimental group mean composite scores differ from the hypothesized mean.</description>

    <description>Active Comparator: (n=15) Treatment as Usual
The treatment as usual or control group refers to the standard of care that patients receive for their chronic pain which allows patients to discuss chronic pain with their providers at their discretion. Although highly variable, providers can recommend and prescribe pharmacologic, non-pharmacologic approaches for pain. This study will not interfere in any way with usual care. No additional treatment will be provided to participants allocated to the control group.</description>

    <description>Experimental: IPGT (n=15) Integrated Psychosocial Group Treatment
IPGT consists of 6 weekly group sessions of motivational interviewing and behavioral change, self-management, and pain education focused on appropriate adherence to treatment and resisting urges to misuse prescription medications. The intervention also entails an education session on knowledge pertaining to overdose education and naloxone distribution. Topics covered in IPGT include: Pacing and goal setting, negative thinking, coping with stress and anxiety, sleep enhancement techniques, managing set-backs, and chronic pain and your life.</description>
