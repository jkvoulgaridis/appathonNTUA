  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study examines the efficacy of a brief intervention for problematic Internet use
      based on Motivational Interviewing (MI) and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in a sample of
      students screened proactively in vocational schools in Northern Germany. Participants will be
      randomized in an intervention and a control group. It is hypothesized that after 12 months,
      participants of the intervention group fulfill less DSM-5 criteria for Internet use
      disorders, spend less time in the Internet, and suffer from less negative consequences caused
      by the problematic Internet use, compared to the control group.

    <textblock>
      Problematic Internet use is an increasing problem, especially in younger age groups. A
      population-based study revealed elevated prevalences in adolescents and young adults. The
      present study aims to provide an intervention for this vulnerable group to change the
      problematic Internet use. This is suggested to prevent the development of more severe forms
      of dependence. Brief interventions using MI and elements of CBT have shown to be an adequate
      method to change addictive behaviors.

      For the recruitment, students of vocational schools in the states of Schleswig-Holstein and
      Hamburg in Northern Germany are screened proactively in classes. Participants fulfilling at
      least 21 points on the Compulsive Internet Use Scale (CIUS) receive a diagnostic telephone
      interview. If fulfilling at least 2 DSM-5 criteria, participants will be randomly allocated
      to two conditions: (1) Intervention group with up to three telephone counseling sessions
      based on MI, (2) Control group receiving a booklet on problematic Internet use. Outcome
      measures are a reduction of DSM-5 criteria for Internet use disorders, a reduction of time
      spent on the Internet, and a reduction of negative consequences caused by the problematic
      Internet use. The efficacy of the intervention will be examined after 6 and 12 months in
      follow-up interviews.

    <description>World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS) 2.0 (Adapted Version for problematic Internet use):
4 items ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 10 (strong impairment)
2 items estimating the days of impairment in the past 12 months (time frame will be adapted to the time frame in the assessment)

    <description>Negative Consequences-Questionnaire from the Criminological Research Institute of Lower Saxony:
8 items ranging from 1 (much worse) to 5 (much better)
Maximum sum score ranges from 8 to 40
The questionnaire is inversely coded, so higher outcomes provide a better outcome
For change of negative consequences, the difference between the sum scores in the follow up assessments and baseline will be measured</description>
