    <textblock>
      A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design trial will be used to test
      the effect of exenatide on alcohol self-administration and craving following a priming dose
      of alcohol. The specific objective of this research is to determine whether exenatide has
      effects on alcohol consumption.

    <textblock>
      This proposal is intended to answer the call for accelerating drug development by exploring
      the potential of a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist, exenatide, as a candidate
      medication for the treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder. There is now substantial preclinical
      evidence that GLP-1 agonists can attenuate behaviors that model both the consumption and
      seeking of several commonly abused substances including alcohol, cocaine, and nicotine. This
      study is intended to accelerate medication development for Alcohol Use Disorder by testing a
      commercially-available and well-tolerated agent at a fraction of the cost of new drug
      discovery. None of the FDA-approved Alcohol Use Disorder medications or off-label Alcohol Use
      Disorder medications target this GLP-1 pathway, making exenatide a promising compound for
      Alcohol Use Disorder drug development.

      The primary aim of this study is to test the effects of exenatide on alcohol
      self-administration and craving among heavy drinkers. In this within-subjects crossover
      design, 36 heavy drinkers will be randomized to exposure order (exenatide or sham injection)
      prior to completing two alcohol self-administration trials. Subjects will receive a priming
      drink of alcohol and will have access to 8 drinks over a 2-hour period. The investigators
      anticipate that subjects will consume less alcohol following the administration of exenatide
      compared to when they receive a sham injection. Significant exenatide-induced reductions in
      drinking will be considered to be an indication that this drug may have value as an Alcohol
      Use Disorder medication. This study may provide a rationale for phase II randomized
      controlled trials testing exenatide with a treatment-seeking Alcohol Use Disorder population.
      These results may also help to spur further clinical investigation of the effects of
      exenatide and other available GLP-1 agonists on the factors implicated in the regulation of
      alcohol consumption.

    <masking_description>Nursing staff at the general Clinical Research unit will not be blinded to the study medication. These nurses' only role in the study will be providing injections of the study drug. All other staff will be blinded to medication assignments. The sham injection will be a needlestick using the exenatide multi-dose syringe with no drug injected. Note that the volume of fluid injected for a 5mcg dose is only .08ml. It is not expected that subjects will sense this volume of fluid (or lack thereof) during the injection. Subjects will be shielded from seeing the injection to maintain the blind. The individual who administers medication will not participate in subject evaluation to maintain the study blind.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol Consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Alcohol consumption will be measured by using a graduated cylinder to determine the amount of alcohol given to the subject that was not consumed. This outcome will be measured as standard drink units. A standard drink contains approximately 0.6 fluid ounces of pure alcohol.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol Cravings</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Alcohol craving will be measured by self report with the Visual Analog Scale . The Visual analog scale is a straight line with one end meaning no alcohol craving and the other end meaning intense alcohol craving. The Participant marks a point on the line that matches their amount of alcohol craving.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood Glucose</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of subjects with blood glucose values below 50 mg/dl will be compared within subjects using the McNemar's test. We hypothesize that there will be no difference in blood glucose levels between the alcohol Challenge Trials.</description>
