  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although there exist interventions that therapeutically impact suicide risk, the connection
      of individuals at elevated suicide risk to mental health care services remains an ongoing
      challenge. One persistent barrier to mental health service utilization is help-seeking
      stigmaâ€”that is, having negative beliefs about the implications of seeking help for mental
      health problems (e.g., &quot;Seeking help means that I am weak&quot;). Thus, to enhance mental health
      service use among at-risk individuals, efforts are needed to target help-seeking stigma.
      Preliminary data from our research group indicate that a novel computerized intervention
      based on cognitive therapy principles can demonstrably reduce help-seeking stigma and
      increase connection to care among young adults with untreated psychiatric disorders. However,
      this intervention has not been tested among individuals who are currently experiencing
      suicidal ideation and are not engaged in mental health treatment. Testing the efficacy of
      this computerized intervention among young adults at increased risk for suicide is necessary
      to address the unique challenge of linking at-risk individuals to potentially life-saving
      treatments. To this end, this study aims to test the efficacy of a brief web-based
      intervention, cognitive bias modification for help-seeking stigma (CBM-HS), designed to
      increase mental health help-seeking intentions and behaviors. A total of 78 young adults with
      current suicidal ideation who are not currently in treatment and who report elevated levels
      of help-seeking stigma will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) CBM-HS; (2)
      CBM-Placebo (i.e., a sham CBM condition analogous to a placebo pill in a pharmaceutical
      trial); or (3) psychoeducation. Participants will complete assessments at baseline,
      mid-intervention, post-intervention, and 2-month follow-up to determine the efficacy of
      CBM-HS in: (a) modifying stigma-related cognitions around mental health help-seeking and
      service use and (b) increasing treatment initiation and engagement. Moreover, we will test if
      reductions in stigma-related cognitions mediate the relationship between study condition and
      subsequent help-seeking behaviors. Findings from the proposed pilot randomized controlled
      trial have the potential to enhance connection to care among young adults at elevated suicide
      risk. Importantly, the brief, web-based nature of the intervention enhances its
      acceptability, feasibility, and scalability. Should CBM-HS demonstrate efficacy in reducing
      help-seeking stigma and enhancing connection to care among at-risk individuals, it has the
      potential to serve as a useful tool in suicide prevention efforts.

    <time_frame>2-Month Follow-Up</time_frame>
    <description>The 11-item Perceived Stigma and Barriers to Care for Psychological Problems Scale (PS) measures the extent to which various concerns might affect an individual's decision to seek psychiatric treatment. Items are rated on a 5-point scale; scores are summed and higher scores (range: 11-55) indicate greater perceived barriers to care. Individual PS items will also be evaluated consistent with past research.</description>

    <description>CBM-HS is a 15-minute web-based intervention designed to alter maladaptive cognitions related to mental health help-seeking. In this task, individuals are presented with a series of statements regarding beliefs about using mental health services (e.g., &quot;Seeking help for my problems means I am weak&quot;). Individuals then select &quot;True&quot; or &quot;False&quot; in response to each statement. Incorrect responses (i.e., demonstrating help-seeking stigma) are followed by corrective feedback. Conversely, correct responses (i.e., promoting help-seeking) are positively reinforced (e.g., &quot;That's right! You are correct!&quot;). Participants in this condition will complete three separate 15-minute CBM-HS sessions.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to this condition will review psychoeducation on mental health literacy, mental illness stigma, and treatment options. Readings will be compiled from resources available in the public domain. The duration of self-directed psychoeducation will be comparable to the duration of study tasks for individuals in the CBM-HS study condition (i.e., three 15-minute sessions).</description>

    <intervention_name>Cognitive Bias Modification</intervention_name>
    <description>Cognitive bias modification (CBM) interventions typically involve the completion of brief, web-based tasks in which individuals are presented with a series of stimuli (e.g., words, sentences) and trained to respond in a manner that is positive or neutral, rather than negative and unhelpful. CBM interventions rely on the premise that repeated reinforcement of adaptive cognitions and a reshaping of negative cognitions enhance functioning and reduce distress.</description>
