  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new strategy for treatment of late radiation damage is to develop methods aimed at
      stimulating the regenerative capabilities of irradiated tissues. Since the main pathogenetic
      mechanism of the development of late radiation damage is the death or damage of the
      replicative mechanism of stromal cells (SC), a justified approach can be considered as
      transplantation of intact SC. Currently, there is convincing evidence in the scientific
      literature that the injection of intact autologous SCs into the zone of fibrosis surrounding
      the chronic radiation ulcer leads to the healing of a wound defect.

      An Initiative Clinical Trial. Introduction of autologous regenerative cells of adipose tissue
      for the treatment of post-irradiation vaginal-rectal fistula. It is assumed that patients
      will be included in the project within 12 months; the monitoring of each patient will last
      for 6 months; the total duration of the clinical part of the study will be 18 months; The
      total duration of the clinical trial including the preparatory phase and the writing of the
      report is about 24 months. It is assumed that at least 16 patients aged 20 to 75 years who
      have verified diagnosis of post-irradiation vaginal-rectal fistula will participate in this
      pilot project. The aims of the clinical trial are to preliminarily assess the safety,
      effectiveness and quality of life of patients after introducing autologous regenerative cells
      of adipose tissue for the treatment of post-irradiation vaginal-rectal fistula.

    <description>Quality of life estimated by validated questionnaire: The Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36). SF-36 is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health.
The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.
The eight sections are:
vitality
physical functioning
bodily pain
general health perceptions
physical role functioning
emotional role functioning
social role functioning
mental health</description>

European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C-30 with module for proctitis-23 is a questionnaire developed to assess the proctitis-specific quality of life of cancer patients. Each subscale values varies from 1 to 4. Lower values represents better life quality. Total score is computed by summarizing of subscales.</description>

    <description>Autologous regenerative cells of adipose tissue obtained by enzymatic digestion of lipoaspirate are injected diffusively in the submucosal plane of the rectum and vagina with a sharp 27G needle. Adipose tissue that has not been subjected to enzymatic processing is injected through the punctures on the skin into the deep layers of the rectovaginal septum by means of cannula of 1.0-1.2 mm in diameter, 70 mm in length, 0.1-0.2 ml in one retrograde pass of the cannula.</description>
