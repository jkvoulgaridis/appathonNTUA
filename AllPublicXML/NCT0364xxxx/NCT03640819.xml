    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this prospective, multicentre study is to determine whether the involved
      node can be marked using black carbon dye and successfully identified at the time of surgery.
      The secondary aims are to determine the concordance between the tattooed node and sentinel
      node, migration of black dye into other nodes, and false-negative rate of tattooed node (in
      patients undergoing ALND after NACT).

      Pretreatment evaluation of axillary lymph nodes and marking of biopsied nodes in patients
      with newly diagnosed breast cancer is becoming routine practice. Tagging of biopsied axillary
      lymph nodes with metal markers, similar to what is done for suspicious breast lesions, is
      being adopted in clinical practice. The need to mark a positive axillary lymph node becomes
      especially relevant in cases where neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is anticipated so that
      these nodes may be identified at the time of surgery. Measures that improve both the accuracy
      of nodal evaluation after NACT and the ability to assess treatment response are desirable in
      order to tailor therapies for breast cancer treatment. The investigators sought to test
      tattooing of biopsied axillary lymph nodes with a sterile black carbon suspension (Spot dye).
      The concept is based on the experience in the gastrointestinal tract wherein tattooing is
      widely used for marking lesions or tumours biopsied during endoscopy. India ink tattoos of
      colonic lesions remain identifiable over a long period of time. Spot is routinely used in the
      UK for tattooing gastrointestinal tract lesions and is used to mark the axillary lymph nodes
      in breast cancer by some centres in the US and Europe. The intraoperative success of
      identifying tattooed axillary lymph nodes and their concordance to sentinel nodes will be
      determined.

    <description>Tattooing (marking) of biopsied node with carbon dye (SPOT dye) at the time of fine needle aspiration or core biopsy or separate visit under ultrasound guidance. The dye will be injected in the cortex of the node and the perinodal tissue under ultrasound guidance. Patients will undergo standard (routine) armpit surgery and may receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy as planned by the clinical team. This could be removal of a few lymph glands (sentinel node biopsy) or removal of all the lymph glands (axillary lymph node dissection) in the armpit. The surgeon will try to identify and remove the tattooed lymph gland at the time of planned armpit surgery.</description>
