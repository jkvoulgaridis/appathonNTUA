  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the synergic therapeutic effect of thiazolidinediones and SGLT2 inhibitor on
      nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, the effect of empagliflozin 10mg, pioglitazone 15mg
      monotherapy and combination therapy n patients with type 2 diabetes and fatty liver will be
      compared and analyzed.

      This study included a total of 60 patients (20 per subgroup) for randomized controlled trials
      with prospective, open label, randomized, single-institution clinical trials.

      The drug will be maintained for a total of six months. The primary endpoint is the difference
      of liver fat change measured by MRI-PDFF in co-localized regions of interest within nine
      liver segments between three groups.
