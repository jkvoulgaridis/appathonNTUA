      BACKGROUND: Wrist fractures are a common upper extremity injury treated by hand therapists.
      Currently, there is a dearth of published literature supporting the use Fluidotherapy® to
      improve pain and range of motion (ROM) in wrist fracture patients. \OBJECTIVE: This pilot
      study was conducted to determine the effects of one 15-minute bout of performing active range
      of motion (AROM) exercises in Fluidotherapy® (EXFT) versus AROM exercises (EX) alone on pain
      levels and AROM in wrist fracture subjects. METHODS: Eight subjects diagnosed with a wrist
      fracture (distal radius fracture, distal radius/ulna fractures, or distal ulna fracture) and
      referred to outpatient rehabilitation/occupational therapy were recruited upon his/her
      initial therapy evaluation. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between EX and
      EXFT groups in all outcome variables except for self-reported numeric pain scores (p=0.03*)
      and a trend towards significance in pronation AROM (p=0.06**). Even with a small sample size
      (n=8) there were significant differences in self-reported pain between the two groups.
      CONCLUSION: This study confirms that even after one 15-minute bout of AROM exercises in
      Fluidotherapy® treatment, patients report improved pain tolerance and may be useful in pain
      management techniques after a wrist fracture.

      BACKGROUND: Wrist fractures are a common upper extremity injury treated by hand therapists.
      Fluidotherapy® is a high intensity heat modality consisting of a dry whirlpool of finely
      divided solid particles suspended in a heated air stream, the mixture having the properties
      of a liquid. Currently, there is a dearth of published literature supporting the use
      Fluidotherapy® to improve pain and range of motion (ROM) in wrist fracture patients. More
      importantly, there is no evidence for the reduction of perceived wrist pain or improved ROM
      after only one 15-minute bout of Fluidotherapy®. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study was conducted to
      determine the effects of one 15-minute bout of performing active range of motion (AROM)
      exercises in Fluidotherapy® (EXFT) versus AROM exercises (EX) alone on pain levels and AROM
      in wrist fracture subjects. METHODS: Eight subjects diagnosed with a wrist fracture (distal
      radius fracture, distal radius/ulna fractures, or distal ulna fracture) and referred to
      outpatient rehabilitation/occupational therapy were recruited upon his/her initial therapy
      evaluation. Patients with closed reductions, open reductions, internal fixation, and/or
      external fixation were included as well. Subjects were randomly assigned to either the EXFT
      group or the EX group. A numeric pain scale (0-10) was used to assess perceived pain and AROM
      measurements using a goniometer were taken for pronation, supination, flexion, extension,
      radial deviation, and ulnar deviation immediately prior to intervention and after
      intervention. RESULTS: EX Group Pre-Treatment results: Pain 4.0 (± 1.82); Supination AROM
      75.5 (± 10.90); Pronation AROM 75 (± 7.02); Flexion AROM 34.5 (± 9.88); Extension AROM 43.5
      (± 8.96); Radial Deviation AROM 18.75 (± 9.43); Ulnar Deviation AROM 23.5 (± 4.36); Exercise
      in Fluidotherapy® Group Pre-Treatment results: Pain 2.5 (± 2.08); Supination AROM 65 (±
      18.70); Pronation AROM 81.25 (± 6.29); Flexion AROM 40.25 (± 17.23); Extension AROM 38.5 (±
      12.07); Radial Deviation AROM 21.25 (± 10.31); Ulnar Deviation AROM 26.25 (± 12.5); EX Group
      Post-Treatment results: Pain 4.5 (± 2.52); Supination AROM 81.75 (± 9.18); Pronation AROM 79
      (± 3.46); Flexion AROM 36.25 (± 9.84); Extension AROM 50.5 (± 15.42); Radial Deviation AROM
      21.5 (± 9.94); Ulnar Deviation AROM 23.75 (± 5.19); Exercise in Fluidotherapy® Group
      Pre-Treatment results: Pain 0.75 (± 0.98); Supination AROM 72.5 (± 14.43); Pronation AROM
      86.25 (± 4.79); Flexion AROM 47.5 (± 15.54); Extension AROM 51.25 (± 8.54); Radial Deviation
      AROM 25.5 (± 12.80); Ulnar Deviation AROM 29 (± 8.41); There were no significant differences
      between EX and EXFT groups in all outcome variables except for self-reported numeric pain
      scores (p=0.03*) and a trend towards significance in pronation AROM (p=0.06**). Even with a
      small sample size (n=8) there were significant differences in self-reported pain between the
      two groups. CONCLUSION: The application of heat, massage, sensory stimulation, levitation,
      and pressure oscillations seem to provide patients pain relief and improvements in range of
      motion after AROM exercises in Fluidotherapy®. This study confirms that even after one
      15-minute bout of AROM exercises in Fluidotherapy® treatment, patients report improved pain
      tolerance and may be useful in pain management techniques after a wrist fracture.
