    <textblock>
      In recent years there has been a significant increase in cesarean sections. This is not
      without complication in subsequent pregnancies such as placenta previa, placenta accrete,
      scar pregnancy, dehiscence or uterine rupture. Uterine rupture during trial of labor after
      cesarean section is an uncommon but potentially catastrophic, life threatening event. It is
      thus of importance if the investigators were able to predict the risk of uterine rupture.
      Imaging studies including ultrasound, hysterography and sonohysterography have been used to
      evaluate the scar from a prior cesarean before pregnancy, there is no consensus as to which
      of them is the preferred method but it is known that cesarean section scars can be detected
      reliably by ultrasound imaging. Previous studies have shown that sonographic lower uterine
      segment thickness is a strong predictor for uterine scar defect and could represent a high
      risk of uterine rupture during a trial of labor in women with prior cesarean section. There
      is a likely association between large defects in the scar after cesarean delivery detected by
      transvaginal ultrasonography in non pregnant women and uterine rupture or dehiscence in
      subsequent pregnancy.

      The knotless barbed suture was FDA approved in 2004. Knotless barbed sutures are monofilament
      sutures with barbs cut into them. These sutures self-anchor, maintaining tissue approximation
      without the need for surgical knots.

      The objective of this study is to determine whether there is a difference in the lower
      uterine segment thickness between uterine scars sutured with two types of sutures, to
      determine whether there is a difference in the size of the scar defects.

      Methods: Two hundred and two women will undergo transvaginal ultrasound examination 3 and 6
      months after delivery: 101 women will have undergone cesarean section in which the Vicryl
      suture was used, 101 women will have undergone cesarean section in which the KBS suture was
      used. The ultrasound examiner will be blinded to the use of the suture. The investigators
      will measure the myometrial thickness 3 months and 6 months after the delivery and compare
      the results between the 2 groups.

      The assumption is that the findings of the study will be useful in counseling concerning
      Trial of Labor after Cesarean (TOLAC). To the best of the investigators' knowledge, there are
      no published data on the risk of uterine rupture predicted based on the myometrial thickness
      measured in the non-pregnant patient when the knotless barbed suture was used in the cesarean
      section. Previous studies have examined the applicability of low uterine segment measurement
      in the third trimester in the prediction of a uterine defect during trial of labor
