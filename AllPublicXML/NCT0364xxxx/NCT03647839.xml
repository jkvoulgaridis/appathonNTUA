    <textblock>
      This Phase II research project will test the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of an
      experimental drug combination: either nivolumab and BBI608 or nivolumab and BNC105 in
      patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have previously failed standard of care
      treatment.

      This is an open‐label, multicentre, parallel phase II study designed to assess the efficacy
      of the combination of nivolumab and BNC105 and the combination of nivolumab and BBI‐608.
      Patients with microsatellite stable adenocarcinoma of colorectal origin that is not
      resectable are eligible and will be randomised in the ratio of 1:1 using permuted block
      randomisation with stratification by screening ECOG performance status (0 or 1) to receive
      either nivolumab and BNC105 or nivolumab and BBI‐608.

      The expected sample size is 90 patients over a 24 month recruitment period.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has a histological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of colorectal origin.

          2. Has documented microsatellite stable tumour as assessed by PCR or IHC.

          3. Metastatic disease that is not resectable.

          4. Male or female patients &gt; 18 years of age at screening.

          5. Failed in any sequence or combination oxaliplatin, fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan with
             or without bevacizumab where failure is defined as progression or toxicity precluding
             further therapy.

          6. For patients with ras/b‐raf wild type tumours: failed anti EGFR therapy (cetuximab
             and/or panitumumab) where failure is defined as progression or toxicity precluding
             further therapy. Patients with b‐raf mutant tumours and/or right sided primary tumours
             may have received anti‐EGFR therapy but this is not mandated.

          7. Patient has measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1.

          8. Metastatic lesion(s) amenable to biopsy, this cannot be the sole site of measurable
             disease.

          9. ECOG performance status 0 or 1.

         10. Adequate organ and hematologic function within 7 days of randomisation, defined by:

               1. Neutrophils &gt; 1.5 X 109/L

               2. Platelets &gt; 80 X 109/L

               5. Albumin &gt;30g/L

               6. Creatinine clearance ≥ 50ml/min(Cockcroft‐Gault).

         13. No other malignant disease apart from non‐melanotic skin cancer or carcinoma in situ
             of the uterine cervix or any other cancer treated with curative intent &gt;2 years
             previously without evidence of relapse.

         14. Female patients of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 24 hours prior to randomisation. If the urine test is positive or

             Patients of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized
             or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.

         16. Male patients with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use an
             adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through
             7 months after the last dose of study therapy.

         17. Patient has provided written informed consent including consent for tumour biopsies

          7. Patient has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory
             abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the patient to participate.

          8. Has received prior therapy with an anti‐PD‐1, anti‐PD‐L1, anti‐PD‐L2, anti‐CD137, or
             anti‐Cytotoxic T‐lymphocyte‐associated antigen‐4 (CTLA‐4) antibody (including
             ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T‐cell co‐stimulation
             or checkpoint pathways).

          9. Has a known history of HIV (HIV 1/2 antibodies). Formal testing is only required if
             there is significant clinical suspicion of HIV.

         10. Known active brain metastases (unless adequately treated with surgery and/or
             radiotherapy &gt;30 d prior and asymptomatic).

         11. Significant vascular events within the previous 6 months (unstable angina, myocardial
