  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a crossover study to determine the possible factors that might be related to the
      development of diabetes in CF and examines the relationship between pancreatic fatigue if
      any, and the development of diabetes. In addition hormones affecting the release of insulin
      and stomach motility will be studied to determine if there is a variation in response to
      solid and liquid meals and if this variation increases as fatigue progresses.

      The main purpose of this study is to look at possible additional factors that might be
      related to the development of Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes (CFRD), that in itself is a
      unique entity and to identify an appropriate test to diagnose CFRD. There is well
      demonstrated evidence of delayed insulin release and peak in individuals with CF, the cause
      of which is not fully explained.

      With a view to determine the cause of this phenomenon the aims of this study are:

        1. To determine whether pancreatic fatigue contributes to this delayed insulin release and
           peak that is seen in patients with cystic fibrosis.

        2. Should a glucose tolerance test be done at a later time in the day, as against first
           thing in the morning as is the current accepted standard?

        3. To determine if gastric emptying has a role to play in the development of CFRD?

        4. To study the hormone release response to a glucose challenge and the patterns of change
           through the day.

        5. To study the relationship of these hormones to gastric emptying and the development of
           diabetes.
