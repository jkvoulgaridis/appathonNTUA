      A midwife-led continuity model of care was implemented in governmental maternal facilities in
      Palestine. Midwives from the hospitals provided outreaching caseload ante- and postnatal care
      to women in rural villages clinics and homes. This study investigated if the model had impact
      on important maternal and neonatal health outcomes. A retrospective cohort design was used.

      Background: A midwife-led continuity model of care was implemented in governmental maternal
      facilities in Palestine. Midwives from the hospitals provided outreaching caseload ante- and
      postnatal care to women in rural villages clinics and homes. This study investigated if the
      model had impact on important maternal and neonatal health outcomes.

      Method: A retrospective cohort design was used. Nablus governmental hospital, Rafidia's
      medical records were reviewed and data extracted involving 2199 women with singleton
      pregnancies, residing in rural villages, and their new-born babies born between January 2016
      and February 2017. Outcomes were limited to the available information in the hospital`s birth
      registry. Important maternal outcomes were postpartum anaemia (Hb &lt;11), mode of delivery and
      induction of labour. Important outcomes for new-borns were premature delivery &lt; 37 weeks,
      birth weight &lt; 2500g and 1500g and referral to neonatal intensive care unit. Outcomes were
      compared between women receiving the midwife-led continuity model of antenatal care and women
      receiving regular care.
