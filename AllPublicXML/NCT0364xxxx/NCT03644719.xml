  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years ketamine abuse becomes prevalent in youth in some Asian countries. Chronic
      ketamine abuse may lead to uropathology and cognitive impairments. No pharmacological
      interventions have been identified as effective for treating ketamine abuse or helpful in
      achieving or maintaining abstinence from ketamine. Cognitive-behavioral treatment is
      currently an important psychosocial intervention for addictive problems. This study aimed to
      test whether a brief cognitive-behavioral training program has a positive influence on stage
      transitions among ketamine abusers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      409 ketamine abusers were recruited in this study, with 285 ketamine abusers participated in
      a 6-hour brief cognitive-behavioral intervention and 124 ketamine abusers attended
      educational lectures on ketamine abuse. A brief cognitive-behavioral intervention was applied
      to teach ketamine abusers about stimulus control, refusal skills, communication skills,
      decisional balance, and infectious diseases prevention. Stage of Change and knowledge about
      ketamine were assessed before and after the intervention.

    <intervention_model_description>Two arms were used to examine the relative effect of the cognitive behavioral skills training (CBSR) and a time slot for education as usual (EAU). The CBST consists of six sessions. The first session is intended to establish rapport, build therapeutic cohesion through ice-breaking activities, and educate participants about the drug regulations stated in the Statute for Drug Hazard Prevention and Control. The following four sessions are devoted to interactively practicing refusal skills, communication skills, decision-making skills, and positive conflict resolution skills. The final session is to review what has been learned and reminds participants about the association of drug use with HIV/HCV.</intervention_model_description>
