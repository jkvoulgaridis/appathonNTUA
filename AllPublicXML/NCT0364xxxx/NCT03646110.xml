    <textblock>
      Minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) has been gradually adopted as a feasible and effective
      treatment option for esophageal cancer. Previously the investigators have published the
      adoption of single-incision approach both in the thoracoscopic and laparoscopic phases in MIE
      (SIMIE).The preliminary clinical results showed that SIMIE can provide an equivalent
      perioperative outcome whereas reduced the wound pain on the days 7 after surgery as compared
      to MIE performed with multi-incision (MIMIE). The goal of the current study was to conduct a
      prospective randomized trial to compare the perioperative outcome and survival of SIMIE and
      MIMIE.

    <textblock>
      Surgery remains the main stay of treating esophageal cancer. However, esophagectomy is a
      complex and technical demanding surgical procedure harboring substantial morbidity and
      mortality. Minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) has been gradually adopted as a feasible
      and effective treatment option for esophageal cancer. The standardized procedure including
      lymph node dissection, esophageal mobilization and reconstruction can be effectively
      performed under minimized wound incision whereas rendering the patients a possibility of
      faster postoperative recovery and reduced risk of perioperative postoperative pulmonary
      complication. The procedure of MIE including the thoracoscopic and laparoscopic phases which
      are usually performed multiple incisional wounds. Previously the investigators have published
      the adoption of single-incision approach both in the thoracoscopic and laparoscopic phases in
      MIE (SIMIE). The preliminary clinical results showed that SIMIE can provide an equivalent
      perioperative outcome whereas reduced the wound pain on the days 7 after surgery as compared
      to MIE performed with multi-incision (MIMIE). The goal of the current study was to conduct a
      prospective randomized trial to compare the perioperative outcome and survival of SIMIE and
      MIMIE.
