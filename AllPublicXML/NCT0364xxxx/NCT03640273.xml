      1. To compare the effectiveness of Prapchompoothaweep crude drug at 3,000 mg per day and
           Loratadine 10 mg per day for treatment in Allergic Rhinitis patients. (Clinical Trial
           Phase II)

        2. To evaluate the safety and adverse effect of Prapchompoothaweep crude drug at 3,000 mg

      this study is a double blind randomized controlled trial study.

      the volunteers will be divided into 2 groups. One is received Prapchompoothaweep crude drug
      capsule at 1,000 mg 3 times a day before meals and the other is received Loratadine 10 mg per
      day before meals. it takes 6 weeks to complete the project for each volunteers.

      Before enrolling, volunteers will stop using any anti-histamine drug for 1 week (wash-out
      period). All volunteers will be followed up in the 3rd and 6th week to evaluate the efficacy
      and adverse effect after received drugs.

      The researcher will record characteristic data such as gender, age, BMI, vital signs and
      symptoms . The adverse effect will be monitored by hematology test e.g. liver function test,
      renal function test, lipid profile and blood sugar test.
