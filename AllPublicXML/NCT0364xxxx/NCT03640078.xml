  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) are essential serum markers in the diagnosis of
      vasculitis. Indirect immunofluorescence with microscope reading by two readers is the
      reference technique for their detection. In the AP-HM immunology laboratory we are looking
      for ANCAs in more than 7000 sera per year. The reading of the slides is time-consuming,
      dependent operator, and lacks standardization. In order to optimize these parameters, we
      propose the automation of ANCA reading by using a robotic platform developed in our
      laboratory and called ICARE (Immunofluorescence for Computed Antibodies Rational Evaluation).
      This microscopic imaging platform with automated reading is currently used in daily routine
      for the detection of anti-nuclear autoantibodies.

      The objective of the project is to establish an algorithm allowing i) to automatically and
      reproducibly discriminate the positive ANCAs from the negative ANCAs and ii) to propose to
      the biologist a fluorescence aspect. The investigators will then validate this algorithm on
      2000 consecutive routine samples sent to the laboratory for ANCA research.

      The usual care will not be changed, only a phase of acquisition of the images will be added
      to the analysis.

      The investigators expect to use this algorithm &quot;ICARE / ANCA&quot; in daily hospital routine and
      thus optimize the results with a real economic impact is 50% less reading time.

      international scientific journal, a patent filing and an exploitation with an industrial
      partner.
