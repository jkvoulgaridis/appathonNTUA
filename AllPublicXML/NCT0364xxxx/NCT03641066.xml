  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A convenience sample of 20 participants, 18 years or older healthy individuals were
      recruited. Participants were excluded if they report being pregnant or being treated for a
      musculoskeletal injury. After explanation of the study and consent were obtained, each
      participant completed background information and the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool
      (CAIT). Participants began by completing a 1 minute, 3mph walking gait assessment while
      unbraced, followed by a 2-minute, 6mph unbraced running assessment. Following the unbraced
      condition participants were randomly assigned into 1 of 4 conditions: [1] Active Ankle 329
      Ankle Sleeve, [2] AS1Pro, [3] Eclipse 1, or [4] Eclipse 2. Participants placed an assigned
      brace on each ankle and then repeated the walking gait and running assessments. After this
      test the participants filled out a 10-item satisfaction questionnaire, and then were randomly
      assigned a second brace. The protocol was repeated until they have completed the walking,
      running, and satisfaction survey in all 4 brace conditions.

    <description>Each participant will complete a baseline analysis of 1 minute of walking and 2 minutes of running, repeated 4 more times wearing 4 different braces. The analysis will be completed on the Walker View Treadmill, which used 3D camera technology to capture lower body kinematics. The treadmill also has load cells built in to capture gait characteristics</description>
