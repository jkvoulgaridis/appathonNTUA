  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new diagnostic imaging test, positron emission
      tomography (PET), with a different radioactive form of iodine called iodine-124. This form is
      able to accurately measure the amount of radioactive iodine uptake in the cancer. If the new
      test determines sufficient radioiodine uptake in the cancer, treatment will continue as
      usual. However, if the new test shows only low radioiodine uptake, a decision may be made
      that the benefit from radioiodine therapy is insufficient and that another form of therapy is
      preferred.

    <description>Patients will be administered 124I and undergo serial PET imaging consisting of up to 4 individual PET/CT scans. In a set of 10 patients, consent will be sought to obtain additional PET/CT scans during the week of 131I therapy. In this study group, patients will receive an additional 4 to 7 mCi 124I tracer dose, alongside the 131I radioiodine therapy dose, for the purpose of imaging radioiodine lesional uptake during therapy. This will be the first study to compare the predicted lesion radiation absorbed doses in Gray derived from a pre-therapy test imaging dose to an imaging dose administered concomitant with 131I radioiodine therapy.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult thyroid carcinoma patients who have had a total thyroidectomy, histology
             confirmed by pathology.

          -  Adult thyroid carcinoma patients have metastatic disease or suspicion for metastatic
             disease, or are under a protocol intended to explore re-induction therapy for 131I
             uptake, and are about to undergo Thyrogen-assisted dosimetry, unless Thyrogen-assisted
             dosimetry is not required per standard of care.

          -  The patient and physician are planning to administer 131I for therapy if persistent
             radioiodine-avid metastases are present.

          -  All subjects must have measurable disease, documented within the previous six months
             by ultrasonography (US), MRI, FDG PET/CT, or CT scanning.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age less than 18 years.

          -  Patients who are pregnant.
