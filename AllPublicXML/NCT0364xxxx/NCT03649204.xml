  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD), a disabling condition, affects 800,000 Canadians. People
      with PAD suffer from poor quality of life due to leg pain, which makes walking difficult.
      They also have a high risk of heart disease. In November of 2017, the University of Ottawa
      Heart Institute (UOHI) launched Canada's first specific walking rehabilitation and
      cardiovascular risk reduction program dedicated to patients with PAD.

      An on-site, supervised exercise program to improve walking endurance and quality of life in
      PAD has been shown to be successful. However many patients are not able to participate in the
      on-site program due to barriers such as transportation, parking, or other commitments.
      Recently, a home-based walking program has also been shown to significantly improve walking
      endurance and quality of life among people with PAD. It was decided that a hybrid program,
      that has a short on-site program followed by a home-based program may allow more patients to
      participate and have the highest chance of success.

      The goal is to develop a new hybrid program for medical care in PAD patients in order to: (a)
      improve their walking distance, (b) improve their quality of life and (c) improve their
      cardiovascular risk.

      As part of this study the investigators will enrol 50 participants with PAD. Participants
      will be randomized to the hybrid walking program (HY-PAD) or to the wait list control group
      (WLC). If randomized to the HY-PAD group participants will take part in on-site
      therapist-supervised exercise (3 times/week for weeks 1-4), followed by a home-based exercise
      program with weekly telephone coaching from an assigned therapist (weeks 5-12). If randomized
      to the WLC group participants will receive a pamphlet with information about walking for PAD,
      and continue their usual care.

At the end of week 4, participants in the HY-PAD group will receive an updated home exercise prescription for the duration of the program (weeks 5-12), following the same principles as above. The therapist will call the participants once a week (15min/call) for weeks 5-12.</description>
