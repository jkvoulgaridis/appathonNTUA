    <textblock>
      This study is a multicentric, comparative, randomized, investigator-blinded, parallel group
      study to demonstrate the non-inferiority of Vismed® Gel Multi 0.3% in comparison with Vismed®
      Multi 0.18% in terms of cornea and conjunctiva staining (Oxford score) on patients with
      moderate to severe ocular dryness, after 35 days of treatment.

      Evaluation of the non-inferiority of Vismed® Gel Multi 0.3% in comparison with Vismed® Multi
      0.18%, in terms of cornea and conjunctiva staining (Oxford score), on worse eye, between Day
      0 and Day 35.

      Evaluation of the non-inferiority of Vismed® Gel Multi 0.3% in comparison with Vismed® Multi
      0.18%, in terms of cornea and conjunctiva staining (Oxford score), on worse eye, between Day
      0 and Day 35.

        -  Comparison of Day 35 versus Day 0 and Day 84 versus Day 0 for each product and
           comparison between products for the following parameters:

             -  Evolution of cornea and conjunctiva staining (Oxford score) on worse eye.

             -  Evolution of DEQ-5 score (5-items Dry Eye Questionnaire).

             -  Evolution of Van Bijsterveld score (Lissamine green staining) in worse eye.

             -  Evolution of Schirmer test result in worse eye.

             -  Evolution of Tear film Break-Up Time (TBUT) in worse eye.

             -  Evolution of ocular dryness severity by evaluation of each main symptom by the
                patient and total score of all symptoms

             -  Evaluation of treatment performance by the investigator and the patient.

        -  Evaluation of the average frequency of use over 84 days for both products.

    <intervention_model_description>Parallel Assignment Because the comparator will be in commercial packaging, the blinding of the subject is not possible.
However, the study will be blinded for the investigator: evaluations will be done by an independent investigator, different than the person who will distribute the product. Subjects will be identified by a patient number. Each patient number will be associated to a treatment number, according to a randomization list provided before the beginning of the clinical investigation, and randomized either in one of both treatment groups (Vismed Gel Multi 3% or Vismed Multi 0.18%).</intervention_model_description>
