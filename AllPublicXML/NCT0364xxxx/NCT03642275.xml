  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 6.5 million people have heart failure (HF) in the United States, and 960,000
      new cases are reported each year. HF is one of the most common hospital diagnosis among older
      adults. About 40% of patients are readmitted within 1-year following their first admission
      for HF and hospitalization accounts for approximately 80% of the costs of HF management. This
      pilot study aims to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a
      patient-centered mobile health (mHealth) technology intervention in older adults with chronic
      heart failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single site, two-arm, pilot randomized controlled trial that aims to examine the
      feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of a mobile phone-based intervention
      compared to usual care in older adult patients with HF (≥50 years). Forty (n=40) patients
      from the University of Illinois Hospital &amp; Health Sciences system will be enrolled in the
      study, randomly assigned to the intervention or usual care group, and followed for 60 days.
      Patients in the intervention group will receive the Heart Failure Health Storylines mobile
      app developed by Self Care Catalysts in collaboration with the Heart Failure Society of
      America, three connected health devices from Fitbit and Nokia that interface with the mobile
      app, and tailored text-messages targeting health beliefs, self-care efficacy, and knowledge
      about HF. The control group will receive standard care which involves patient education and
      outpatient follow up with physical and laboratory examinations as needed. The primary study
      outcome is change in self-care and quality of life. Secondary outcomes include hospital
      re-admissions and emergency room visits.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Self-care at 30 and 60 days</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 30 and 60 days</time_frame>
    <description>Self-care will be measured with the Self-Care Heart Failure Index (SCHFI) v.6.2,87 which includes 3 subscales: self-care maintenance (10-items), self-care confidence (6-items), and self-care management (6-items). Standardized scores in each scale range from 0 to 100. A total score of ≥70 indicates adequate self-care.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) at 30 and 60 days</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 30 and 60 days</time_frame>
    <description>HRQoL will be measured with the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (23-items) that quantifies physical function, symptoms (frequency, severity and recent change), social function, self-efficacy and knowledge, and quality of life. Lower scores indicate worse HRQoL.</description>
