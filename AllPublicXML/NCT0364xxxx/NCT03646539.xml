  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of an evidence-based smartphone
      application (app) for the management of mood compared to treatment as usual alone among 135
      women who have been discharged post-delivery from Labor and Delivery at Stanford Children's
      Health - Lucile Packard Children's Hospital. Using psychometrically validated surveys for
      depression, postpartum depression, and anxiety, this study will evaluate whether the
      smartphone app has a differential effect on the mental health of postpartum women as compared
      to treatment as usual.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention is a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) based automated conversational agent
      available as a mobile device smartphone application. When a user logs in with the app, it
      asks questions about that user, such as how they're feeling, and the user is able to type
      their response, similar to texting or messaging. The app is then available for use by the
      user anytime (24 hours per day 7 days per week), and will check in with the user to encourage
      mood tracking followed by tailored delivery of CBT-based tools and other general
      psychoeducation. This smartphone app interacts with conversational tones, and offers empathy
      and behavioral pattern insight to users. The app's artificial intelligence becomes more
      specific to a user over time, based on conversations. The app allows patients are able to
      immediately process and receive empathy for significant events and removes barriers
      traditionally limiting treatment access (cost, stigma, health care system navigability, and
      lack of childcare or transportation).
