  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To avoid or decrease the rate of complications in preterm infants after disconnection from a
      mechanical ventilation (extubation), non-invasive respiratory support is routinely used.
      While infants are most commonly extubated to nasal continuous positive airway pressure
      (NCPAP), high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) has emerged as an attractive alternative. However,
      research regarding the safety and efficacy of HFNC in the most extreme preterm infants is
      limited. Therefore, we hypothesize that immediately after extubation, measures of heart rate
      and respiratory behavior may be useful to investigate for any differences between HFNC and
      NCPAP.

    <textblock>
      Infants will be studied 30 min after extubation on both modes of support, provided in a
      random order. A transition period of 15 min between modes will be given. For each mode,
      recordings will be performed for 40 minutes. Analysis of these recordings will be done off
      line.

    <description>HFNC therapy will be delivered with a system that provides heated, humidified high flow of gas through a tube that maintains the temperature and humidification. This intervention will involve the delivery of gas (air/oxygen) at a high flow rate, using an adequate nasal cannulae size and a cannula/nostril diameter ratio between 0.5-0.8.</description>

    <description>NCPAP will be provided as either bubble CPAP or through a ventilator, and will deliver a regulated pressure of gas (air/oxygen) to the patient through infant binasal prongs as interface. Nasal prong sizes will be chosen according to manufacturer recommendations.</description>
