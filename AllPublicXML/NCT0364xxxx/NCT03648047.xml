  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to compare the clinical outcomes of a mixed home-based rehabilitation
      program after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, incorporating face-to-face sessions as well
      as sessions performed with a novel digital kinematic biofeedback system against conventional
      in-person home-based rehabilitation, with the intent of reducing the need for face-to-face
      sessions.

      The investigators hypothesize that the clinical outcomes of such a program will be at least
      similar to those of conventional rehabilitation.

      Patients will be enrolled pre-operatively and then randomized into 2 groups: experimental
      group and conventional rehabilitation group. Both groups will perform a 12 to 16-week
      rehabilitation program starting immediately after surgery.

      Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 8 and 12 weeks. In patients where a decision is made
      to extend the program to 16 weeks, another assessment will be made at this point.
