  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are

        -  to evaluate the image quality and robustness of a whole-body MRI protocol by using an
           innovative partially automatic algorithm (DOT engine), that automatically optimizes
           protocol parameters depending on body region (e.g. thorax versus abdomen)

        -  to compare lesion detectability between wb-MRI and the gold standard positron emission
           tomography (PET)/CT

        -  to compare patient comfort between PET/CT and wb-MRI using a dedicated questionnaire

        -  to compare duration of image acquisition with regards to cost-effectiveness

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Whole-body imaging becomes increasingly important in oncologic patients not only for primary
      cancer staging, but also for assessment of response to therapy. So far, PET/CT is a key
      method to assess cancer-related changes of metabolism in tumors, which is crucial for
      response evaluation and to differentiate between benign and malignant lesions. Limitations of
      PET/CT include the assessment of sclerotic bone metastasis, which often do not show increased
      tracer uptake. Certain organ metastasis (especially in brain and liver) are also barely
      detectable due to physiologically increased uptake. Moreover, both CT and administration of
      radioactive tracer are associated with radiation exposure for patients. Whole-body MRI
      (wb-MRI) including functional techniques (e.g. Diffusion-weighted Imaging (DWI) to evaluate
      cell density) enables a functional staging and therapy assessment without use of ionizing
      radiation. Advantages to assess sclerotic bone lesions and organ metastases have been
      confirmed in recent literature. Limitations of MRI include detection of lesions in organs
      with high susceptibility and motion like the thorax.

    <description>- Primary outcome will be the organ based malignant lesion detectability (Thorax, Abdomen). This will be quantified as a dichotomous variable (present/absent) for MRI and PET/CT.
Outcome will be based on two board certified radiologists. In case of disagreement, consensus will be taken. Results will be obtained in a single reading after inclusion of 50 patients. Readers will be blinded to clinical patient data and results of PET/CT.</description>

    <description>Secondary outcome will be the number of lesions (Hereby, more than 5 lesions per organ will be regarded as diffuse organ involvement (e.g. diffuse bone metastasis)). Moreover, subjective image perception (e.g. image quality (1-5), quality of lesion demarcation (1-3), diagnostic confidence (1-3) will be assessed. A dedicated questionnaire to assess patient comfort and compare patient acceptance of MRI and PET/CT will be evaluated.</description>
