  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TCR-T cell therapy experienced a breakthrough for treating tumors in recent years. Phase I /
      II trial of NY-ESO-1-specific TCR-T treatment for synovial sarcoma and melanoma conducted by
      the Rosenberg team at the National Cancer Institute showed that 61% Synovial cell sarcoma and
      55% melanoma had therapeutic responses. These and lots of clinical achievements indicate that
      TCR-T cell therapy can target a variety of tumors including solid tumors without any severe
      side effects found in CAR-T trials.

      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a kinds of head-neck malignant tumor, which used to appear
      mostly in southern China (especially in Fujian and Guangdong and Guangxi provinces). Most
      patients with NPC show evidence of infection with the Epstein Barr virus (EBV) before or at
      the time of their diagnosis. EBV is found in the cancer cells of almost all patients with
      advanced stage NPC, and play a role in causing and inducing the disease program and
      development. The cancer cells infected by EBV are able to hide from the body's immune system
      and escape destruction. We want to see if EBV antigen special T cells (YT-E001) could
      recognize and kill special parts of EBV infected cells, and finally inhibit the tumor
      recurrence or metastasis of NPC patients.

      This study will focus on the NPC highly expressed EBV antigen such as LMP1, LMP2 and
      EBNA1，the high affinity TCR target the above EBV antigen were screened from the healthy donor
      using the sorting and single cell cloning technique. Then, using the lentivirus to transduce
      the TCR gene to the autologous T cells.

      This study will investigate the safety and tolerability of EBV-TCR-T cell therapy in subjects
      with NPC who had received prior therapy for their disease but their disease has progressed or
      relapsed.

      The chemotherapy we will use for lymphodepletion is a combination of cyclophosphamide and
      fludarabine. Cyclophosphamide and fludarabine are the chemotherapy agents most commonly used
      for lymphodepletion in immunotherapy clinical trials.

      This Phase I/II study is designed as single dose pilot trial evaluating the safety and of
      EBV-TCR-TT cell therapy in subjects with NPC who have received prior therapy for their
      disease but the disease has progressed or relapsed. Anti-tumor activity and other exploratory
      objectives will be assessed. Subjects enter from a Screening Protocol and are positive for
      HLA- A02:01/24:02/11:01, and EBV serum positive. Subjects will receive cytoreductive
      chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine on days -6 and -4 followed by infusion of
      dose of about 2×108 EBV-TCR-T(YT-E001).

      Subjects will stay in hospital for safety and efficacy assessment daily from T cell infusion
      (Day 0) through Day 7, and then weekly until week 4 and then at 8 weeks every 8 weeks until
      progression of their disease or the end or termination of trial.
