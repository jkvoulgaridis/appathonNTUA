  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single-arm, multi-center, phase II study of SHR-1210 in metastatic
      colorectal cancer patients with the recurrent lesion(s) post-surgery or the untreated mCRC.

      SHR-1210 is a humanized monoclonal antibody against Programmed death 1(PD-1).BP102 is a
      humanized recombinant monoclonal IgG1 antibody.

      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of the subjects
      who given the combination therapy.
