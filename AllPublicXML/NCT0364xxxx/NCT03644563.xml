  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will screen people for oncogenic oral Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection and
      antibodies to form a cohort of people who may be at increased risk of HPV-oropharyngeal
      cancer (HPV-OPC). The investigators will follow these individuals prospectively to evaluate
      oncogenic oral HPV persistence, risk factors, and biomarkers for persistence.

    <textblock>
      This study will provide one of the first estimates of long-term oral HPV natural history, and
      the effect of biologic and behavioral risk factors, including HIV, on this natural history.
      Phase 1 of the study will screen approximately 1500 people for oncogenic oral HPV biomarkers.
      Phase 2 of the study will follow only those subjects with oncogenic oral HPV infection and/or
      HPV serum oncogene antibodies from Phase 1 (and those previously identified as having
      oncogenic oral HPV infection in a previous study) with annual follow-up for oncogenic oral
      HPV persistence.

      Understanding persistent oncogenic oral HPV infection is the focus of this study.
      Understanding which factors drive oral HPV infection to become persistent or progress to
      malignancy is critical to determine who is at high risk for oropharyngeal cancer and may
      benefit from screening and prevention. It is presumed that persistent oncogenic oral HPV
      infections are necessary for progression to HPV-OPC.

      The study is led by Dr. Amber D'Souza and Dr Carole Fakhry (Johns Hopkins) and participants
      are being enrolled in Baltimore MD (Johns Hopkins) and in New York (Mt. Sinai site PI Dr.
      Brett Miles).

      Oral rinse sample: a sample of oral exfoliated cells will be collected using 10 mL of
      saline.Oral rinse samples will be tested for HPV DNA and/or RNA.

      Saliva sample: Saliva sampling kits designed to preserve HPV (OraGene RNA kit from DNA
      Genotek) will be used to collect oral samples from all participants.

      Urine sample: Urine will be tested for HPV DNA as a surrogate for genital HPV infection.

      Blood collection: Each sample will be tested for HPV antibodies. Capsid antibodies will be
      measured using virus like particle-based ELISA assays. Antibodies to the E6 and E7 proteins
      will be measured in a glutathione capture ELISA assays.

        Target sample size: 1500 (phase 1), ~250 (phase 2) Inclusion of women and minorities:
        Primary enrollment is restricted to men, given their higher risk of infection (see
        eligibility criteria). However, the investigators expect to enroll women with cervical
        dysplasia and partners of patients with HPV-related cancer (~125 expected women enrollees).
        Enrollment is across many different sources (geographically, and by clinic type), and is
        inclusive of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. Enrollment is not stratified by race
        but the investigators expect to enroll at least 175 minorities in the study.

        Participants in the Phase 1 Screening

        Inclusion criteria:

        In order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of the
        following criteria:

          -  18 and older (enrollment at most sites will be restricted to 30 and older since this
             demographic has the highest prevalence of infection; however, individuals and/or
             partners of someone with an HPV-related cancer, for example, are at increased risk so
             will be enrolled in the larger age range).

          -  Willing to be contacted to arrange follow-up visits, if determined to be eligible for
             phase 2

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        In addition, individuals must meet at least one of the following criteria:

          -  Male, aged 30 and older, with 2 or more lifetime oral sex

          -  History of anal or genital dysplasia or cancer

          -  Partners of someone with an HPV-related cancer (HPV-positive OPC, anal cancer or
             genital cancer)

          -  Known oncogenic HPV-positive biomarker from prior studies or testing, regardless of
             number of partners.

        Exclusion criteria:

        An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation
        in this study:

          -  Presence of medical or psychiatric condition affecting ability to give voluntary,
             informed consent.

          -  Participants who do not speak English cannot enroll because the consent and study
             survey are only available in English. However, if there is a hearing, literacy or
             minor fluency issue and the participant requests assistance from a family member or
             the study coordinator, this individual may still enroll and receive this assistance to
             ensure they fully hear and understand everything being asked.

          -  History of head and neck cancer

        Participants in the Phase 2 Follow-Up

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Oncogenic oral HPV infection and/or HPV serum oncogenic antibodies detected in phase 1

          -  Willingness to complete annual follow up visits

        Exclusion criteria:

        â€¢ Unable to complete annual follow up visits
