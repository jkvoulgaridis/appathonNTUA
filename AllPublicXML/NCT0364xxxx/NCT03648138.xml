  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare different sugary drink labels to see which most influence
      knowledge, beliefs, purchase intentions and choices. Parents of children ages 6-11 will shop
      in a virtual convenience store after being randomized to 1 of 4 conditions: 1) calorie
      labels; 2) text warning labels; 3) graphic sugar warning labels; or 4) graphic health
      warning. This study will provide data comparing the influence of sugary drink text warning
      labels and two kinds of graphic warning labels.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hypothetical beverage choice</measure>
    <time_frame>The survey will take up to 20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will select a beverage to purchase in the virtual store. Our outcome will be the percentage of parents choosing a 20-ounce sugary drink for their child</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Likely to serve or buy these beverages:</measure>
    <time_frame>The survey will take up to 20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Item: &quot;How likely are you to serve or buy this product for your child in the next 4 weeks?&quot; This will be answered on a 7-point Likert scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parent feels good serving the beverages</measure>
    <time_frame>The survey will take up to 20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Item: &quot;Serving this product to my child would make me feel like I am doing something good for my child.&quot; This will be measured on a 7-point likert scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Child enjoyment of beverages</measure>
    <time_frame>The survey will take up to 20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Item: &quot;How much do you think your child would enjoy this product?&quot; This will be answered on a 7-point likert scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health beliefs and risk perceptions index</measure>
    <time_frame>The survey will take up to 20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>We will create this outcome by summing responses to the following 7 health perception questions 6 prompted with the statement &quot;Drinking this product often wouldâ€¦&quot;. The statements end with the following health belief and risk perception language: &quot;lead my child to gain weight,&quot; &quot;increase my child's risk of heart disease,&quot; &quot;increase my child's risk of diabetes,&quot; &quot;make my child feel energized,&quot; &quot;help my child focus at school&quot;, and &quot;help my child live a healthy life.&quot; The other item is: &quot;How healthy do you think this product is for your child?&quot; Responses to questions about weight gain, heart disease, and diabetes will be reverse coded, so higher scores on the index will indicate a stronger positive health perception of the beverages. These will be scored on 7-point likert scales.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Estimate of how many teaspoons of added sugar are in the beverages</measure>
    <time_frame>The survey will take up to 20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This variable will be measured continuously based on a text box provided to participants.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived amount of added sugar in beverages</measure>
    <time_frame>The survey will take up to 20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This variable will be measured on a 3-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;too little for my child&quot; to &quot;too much for my child&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Noticing the label</measure>
    <time_frame>The survey will take up to 20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will respond &quot;yes,&quot; &quot;no,&quot; or &quot;I don't know&quot; to the item: &quot;When you selected a beverage to buy for your child at the beginning of this survey, did you notice any labels on the beverages other than calorie information?&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived label influence</measure>
    <time_frame>The survey will take up to 20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will respond: &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no,&quot; or &quot;I did not notice any labels&quot; in response to the question of whether the label influenced their purchase.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Favor or oppose sugary drink warning label policy</measure>
    <time_frame>The survey will take up to 20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>We will compare the percentage of participants in favor of (combining somewhat favor and strongly favor), opposed to (combining somewhat oppose and strongly oppose), or neutral about the policy based on the following question: &quot;Would you favor or oppose a government policy requiring a warning label to be placed on beverages with added sugars?&quot; Ratings will be from -2 to 2.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Likelihood of label changing thoughts</measure>
    <time_frame>The survey will take up to 20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Item: &quot;If this government warning label were on a beverage, how much would it change your thoughts about the healthiness of that beverage for your child?&quot; This will be measured on a 5-point Likert scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Encourage you to give fewer beverages to your child</measure>
    <time_frame>The survey will take up to 20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Item: &quot;If you saw this government warning label on a beverage, would the label encourage you to serve your child that beverage less often?&quot; The responses will be measured on a 5-point Likert scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>How much do you trust the information on this label</measure>
    <time_frame>The survey will take up to 20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Item: &quot;How much do you trust the information on this label?&quot;. Responses will be measured on a 7-point Likert scale.</description>
