      The CSP-1001 study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the InnAVasc arteriovenous
      graft (AVG) when implanted in and used for hemodialysis in participants suffering from end
      stage renal failure (ESRD). The InnAVasc AVG is implanted and used similar to other standard
      of care dialysis grafts currently on the market. However, the InnAVasc AVG has been uniquely
      designed to potentially allow for immediate needle access (same day as implant surgery as
      opposed to 2-4 weeks of waiting), to potentially reduce excessive bleeding from the graft
      after dialysis, and it may provide protection from improper or missed needle cannulation
      attempts.

      The CSP-1001 study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the InnAVasc arteriovenous
      graft (AVG) when implanted in and used for hemodialysis in participants suffering from end
      stage renal failure (ESRD). The InnAVasc AVG is implanted and used similar to other standard
      of care dialysis grafts currently on the market. However, the InnAVasc AVG has been uniquely
      designed to potentially allow for immediate needle access (same day as implant surgery as
      opposed to 2-4 weeks of waiting), to potentially reduce excessive bleeding from the graft
      after dialysis, and it may provide protection from improper or missed needle cannulation
      attempts.

      This clinical investigation is a prospective, multi-center, single arm, non-randomized study.
      Participants with ESRD who require hemodialysis and are suitable for an AVG for hemodialysis
      access will be eligible for inclusion in the study. Suitable participants will be implanted
      with an InnAVasc AVG in the forearm or upper arm using standard vascular surgical techniques.
      The graft will be placed in a &quot;straight&quot; (soft &quot;C&quot;) configuration in the upper arm, or looped
      configuration in the forearm (forearm loop) or upper arm (axillary loop). Twenty-six (26)
      participants will be enrolled to be implanted with the InnAVasc AVG from up to 7
      investigational sites in the United States.

      The primary effectiveness endpoint of secondary graft patency will be assessed at 6 months
      but the total study duration is 24 months. The primary safety endpoint will include
      characterization of dialysis graft adverse events over 6 months. It is hypothesized that the
      InnAVasc AVG will provide a secondary patency rate similar to the current standard of care
      dialysis access grafts on the market, but will have the potential to reduce needle
      cannulation-related adverse events and complications.

             immunosuppressive therapy is acceptable;
