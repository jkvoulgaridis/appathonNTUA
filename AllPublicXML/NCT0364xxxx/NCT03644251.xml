  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Discogenic pain is pain originating from a damaged vertebral disc and be caused by
      inflammation, dehydration of the nucleus pulposus, decreased disc height, annular tears and
      impaired mechanical function of the disc.Non-operative treatment may include traction,
      steroid therapy, methylene blue injection and ablative therapy. However, there are few high
      quality studies evaluating these treatments for reducing discogenic low back pain and most
      clinical trials failed to detect significant differences between treatments and placebo
      therapies. Hence, there remains an unmet clinical need.
