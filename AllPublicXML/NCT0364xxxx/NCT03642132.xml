    <textblock>
      JAVELIN Ovarian PARP 100 (B9991030) is an open-label, randomized study designed to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of avelumab in combination with chemotherapy followed by maintenance
      therapy of avelumab in combination with talazoparib versus an active comparator in
      treatment-naïve patients with locally advanced or metastatic ovarian cancer (Stage III or
      Stage IV). On March 19, 2019, Sponsors alliance announced the discontinuation of the ongoing
      Phase III study, and the decision was based on several factors, including previous announced
      interim results from JAVELIN Ovarian 100 study (B9991010). Patients who remain in B9991030
      study will continue receiving their randomized treatment assigned and will be monitored for
      appropriate safety assessments until treatment discontinuation.

      JAVELIN Ovarian PARP 100 (B9991030) is an open-label, international, multi-center, randomized
      study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of avelumab in combination with
      chemotherapy followed by maintenance therapy of avelumab in combination with talazoparib
      versus an active comparator in treatment-naïve patients with locally advanced or metastatic
      ovarian cancer (Stage III or Stage IV). The primary endpoint is progression-free survival
      (PFS) as determined based on blinded independent central review (BICR) assessment per RECIST
      v1.1.

      On March 19, 2019, Sponsors alliance announced the discontinuation of the ongoing Phase III
      JAVELIN Ovarian PARP 100 study. The alliance has notified health authorities and trial
      investigators of the decision to discontinue the trial. The decision was based on several
      emerging factors since the trial's initiation, including the previously announced interim
      results from JAVELIN Ovarian 100 study (B9991010), which was stopped due to futility of
      efficacy at a planned interim analysis on 21 December 2018. The alliance determined that the
      degree of benefit observed with avelumab in frontline ovarian cancer in that study does not
      support continuation of the JAVELIN Ovarian PARP 100 trial in an unselected patient
      population and emphasizes the need to better understand the role of immunotherapy in ovarian
      cancer. Additional factors include the rapidly changing treatment landscape and the approval
      of a PARP inhibitor in the frontline maintenance setting. The decision to discontinue the
      JAVELIN Ovarian PARP 100 trial was not made for safety reasons.

      Patients who remain in the study will continue receiving investigational products according
      to their randomized treatment assignment and will be monitored for appropriate safety
      assessments until treatment discontinuation.

             reason within 4 weeks prior to randomization and/or incomplete recovery from surgery.

          -  Prior radiotherapy to any portion of the abdominal cavity or pelvis. Prior radiation
             for localized cancer of the breast, head and neck, or skin is permitted, provided that

          -  Prior targeted therapy (including but not limited to vaccines, antibodies, tyrosine
             kinase inhibitors) or hormonal therapy for management of their ovarian, peritoneal
             primary or fallopian tube carcinoma.

          -  Prior organ transplantation including allogenic stem cell transplantation.

          -  Diagnosis of Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS).

          -  Known symptomatic brain metastases requiring steroids. Patients with previously
             diagnosed brain metastases are eligible if they have completed their treatment and
             have recovered from the acute effects of radiation therapy or surgery prior to study
             enrollment, have discontinued corticosteroid treatment for these metastases for at
             least 4 weeks and are neurologically stable.
