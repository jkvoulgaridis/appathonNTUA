  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: As the aging of the population aggravating, the ratio of the elderly in empty
      nest family has reached 50%, particularly in big and medium size cities, it is as high as
      70%. The elderly in those families where no child living inside, elderly living alone,
      including an individual living alone or living with spouse are known as empty nester. The
      diversity of food consumption of empty nester is always poor, with single and simple meals,
      especially for the consumption of &quot;core food&quot; (fish, meat, egg, milk, vegetables and fruits),
      and the quantity and variety of consumption is very limited, which make the elderly be prone
      to be deficient of high quality protein and micronutrient. In 2005, the World Health
      Organization (WHO) brought up a new concept for the universally exiting problem of vitamin
      and trace elements intake deficiency among people, namely Hidden Hunger. With age increasing,
      multiple causes such as single eating pattern, empty nest lifestyle and chronic diseases lead
      to long term intake deficiency of protein and micronutrient of the elderly, which will
      further result in various symptoms of nutritional deficiency. Therefore, it is particularly
      important for the empty nester to have sufficient energy, high quality protein and multiple
      micronutrients to prevent hidden hunger and sarcopenia, thus avoiding the health problem and
      life quality decreasing caused by them.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mini Nutritional Assessment short-form (MNA®-SF) score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>MNA®-SF is a validated nutrition screening and assessment tool that can identify geriatric patients age 65 and above who are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition. The Screening score(max. 14 points) is 12-14 points indicates &quot;Normal nutritional status&quot;, 8-11 points indicates &quot;At risk of malnutrition&quot;, 0-7 points indicates &quot;Malnourished&quot;.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle mass--The change of percentage of skeletal muscle mass</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The skeletal muscle mass of the participants were assessed using a multiple-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) instrument (InBodyS10; InBody, Shanghai, China). Percentage of skeletal muscle mass (PSM) is the ratio of skeletal muscle mass to ideal skeletal muscle mass which is defined according to the height and the standard BMI of each patient. Normal PSM standard is defined as values in the range of 90-110%. We defined low skeletal muscle mass (Sarcopenia) as values &lt;90% of the standard.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of BMI</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Weight in kilograms was measured during the study. Height in meters was measured at the baseline. Weight and height will be combined to report BMI in kg/m^2.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle strength--The change of Calf circumference</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Calf circumference(CCF) was measured with a soft tape, the measurement standard is divided into less than 31 cm and 31 cm or greater.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle strength--The change of Grip strength</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Grip strength with a calibrated grip force meter to measure the grip strength of the dominant hand. The cut-off of grip strength is 26 kg for men and 18 kg for women.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle strength--6 meters gait speed</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A standard stopwatch is used to measure the subject's 6 meters gait speed for 3 times, and the average pace is then calculated. The intercept value of step speed is 0.8m/s.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hidden Hunger Assessment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>There are two parts in Hidden Hunger Assessment Scale. Part A includes the options for 10 dietary behaviors, giving 3 behavioral frequency choices (&gt; 3 times per week, 5 points; 1 to 3 times per week, 3 points; never, 0 points), score ranges from 0 to 50 which are evaluated and classified into three categories. Part B includes 17 options on the manifestation of micronutrient deficiencies, giving three frequencies of occurrence to score (consecutive, 0 points; occasionally, 3 points; never, 5 points). The result ranges from 0 to 85, while different ranges were evaluated and defined differently. The scores of Part A and B of the participants were summed up and separated into three definition: &lt;70 as &quot;obvious hunger requesting immediate intervention&quot;, 70-123 as &quot;existing hidden hunger requesting improvement&quot;, and &gt; 123 as &quot;no hidden hunger &quot;.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of DETERMINE score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The DETERMINE is checklist to find out if someone you know is at nutritional risk. The checklist is based on warning signs described. DETERMINE is the first letter of all warning signs: Disease, Eating poorly, Tooth loss/month pain, Economic hardship, Reduced social contact, Multiple medicines, Involuntary weight loss/gain, Needs assistance in self care, Elder years above age 80.
The total score is 21. 0-2 scores means good, recheck your nutritional scores in 6 months.
3-5 scores you are at moderate nutrition risk. Recheck your nutritional scores in 3 months.
6 or more scores means you are at high nutrition risk. Bring this checklist the next time you see your doctor, dietitian or other qualified health or social service professional. Talk with them about any problem you may have. Ask for help to improve your nutritional health.</description>

    <measure>Questionnaire--Healthy lifestyle questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Healthy lifestyle questionnaire be designed by investigator. 24 questions cover healthy lifestyle, that are about disease, fallen, infection, allergy, drink alcohol, smoke, eating habit, activity intensity/frequency, sleep quality, emotion etc.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Questionnaire--Self-satisfaction questionnaire</measure>

    <description>The self-satisfaction questionnaire be completed by subject. The questionnaires be used to evaluate self-rate satisfaction for stool pattern, sleep, health status, quality of life, energy level, vitality level, daily activities. There are some questions to get the state of the stool pattern and sleep. Others are evaluated in the percentage.</description>
