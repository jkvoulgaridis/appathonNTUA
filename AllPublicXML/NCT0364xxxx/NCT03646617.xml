      The main purpose of this study is to determine the safety of combining ipilimumab and
      nivolumab with hypofractionated radiotherapy to a single tumor in patients with metastatic
      melanoma. Another purpose of this study is to determine the effect of ipilimumab, nivolumab
      and hypofractionated radiotherapy on the cancer as compared to ipilimumab and nivolumab.

             hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, interstitial lung disease,
             or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
