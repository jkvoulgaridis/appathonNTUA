      Women hospitalized for preterm labor require clear information about prematurity.

      This study assessed whether or not specific written information about prematurity delivered
      at admission to the unit combined with an oral explanation from a pediatrician would decrease
      women's anxiety compared to an oral explanation alone. This was a prospective, single-center
      observational study.Women were included in the high-risk pregnancies department and
      distributed into two groups: receiving ''only oral'' information for a prenatal clinical
      consultation with a senior pediatrician or receiving ''combined'' oral information + a
      booklet about prematurity given to the women at admission. The primary endpoint was the
      change in anxiety-state (before and after the information procedure) evaluated by the State
      Trait Anxiety Inventory-Y (STAI-Y).
