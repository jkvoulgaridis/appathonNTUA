  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have severe crowding that require four premolars extraction will be treated in
      this study. The efficacy of the clear aligners and vestibular fixed appliances will be
      assessed. The treatment result of these two different methods will be explored using the Peer
      Assessment Rating (PAR) in two different times (T0: Before treatment, T1: After treatment)
      and the American Board of Orthodontics Objective Grading System (ABO-OGS) after treatment
      (T1).

      There are two groups:

      First group (Experimental): the patients in this group will be treated using clear aligners.

      Second group (Control): the patients in this group will be treated using fixed appliances.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For years, orthodontists and dentists have used removable appliances for orthodontic
      treatment. Today, with the CAD/CAM technology, clear aligners treat a broader range of cases
      with greater precision. They consist of a series of plastic aligners that are intended to
      replace conventional wire and bracket technology for many orthodontic cases. Each custom
      manufactured aligner exerts gentle, continuous forces to move teeth incrementally from their
      original state to a final, treated state. Each aligner is worn for about two weeks, then
      replaced by the next in the series until the final position is achieved.

    <description>The PAR index will be used to provide objective assessment of treatment success. Each set of dental models prepared before and after treatment for each case will be occluded in maximum intercuspation and a calibrated PAR ruler is used to assign a value to each of the PAR index components: contact displacement in the upper and lower labial segment (UAS), overjet (OJ), overbite (OB), medline deviation (MID) and right and left buccal occlusion (RBO, LBO). Then the weighted PAR index score will be calculated according to the American wightining system as follows: UAS times 1, RBO and LBO times 2, OJ and OB times 3 and MID times 2. A perfect occlusion would receive a score of zero, a score from one to nine indicates that good dental relationships are present; a score above 40 indicates severe malocclusion.</description>

    <description>Eight domains are evaluated:
Alignment: No more than 2 points shall be subtracted for any tooth when it is poorly aligned; Marginal Ridges: The total number of deductions shall be subtracted from 32 to give the score for this domain; Buccolingual inclination: If the mandibular lingual cusps or maxillary buccal cusps are more than 1 mm from the straight edge surface, 1 point shall be subtracted for that tooth; Occlusal Contacts: If a cusp is out of contact with the opposing arch, 1 point is subtracted for that tooth; Occlusal relationships. The total number of deductions are subtracted from 24 to give the score for occlusal relationships; Overjet; Interproximal contacts. If no interproximal spaces exist, then no points are subtracted; and Root angulation: Any deviations in roots' angulations will cause a deduction form the general score. Finally, a case that loses more than 30 points will be considered a failure. A case that loses less than 20 points will be considered acceptable.</description>
