  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Herbal medicine represents an alternative for treating dyslipidemia. The aim of this project
      was to evaluate the PC-300 tea (Eryngium heterophyllum egelm + Amphipterygium adstringens)
      against hypertriglyceridemia.

      Baseline samples of serum total cholesterol and triglycerides were obtained and measured
      again after 1 month of treatment with the following two alternatives: 1) PC-300, one cup half
      an hour before eating, and 2) bezafibrate 200 mg/d.

      It was a descriptive, prospective, longitudinal, and comparative clinical study developed at
      Ciprés Grupo Médico S.C. (CGM), Toluca, Mexico, from January 2014 to December 2014.

      Patients with hypertriglyceridemia were invited to participate in the study. Voluntary
      subjects were assigned sequentially into two treatment groups: 1) fibrate (bezafibrate) 200
      mg/day, and 2) PC-300 tea, one cup half an hour before eating.

      Patients were measured (m) and weighed (kg) (Obi, México). Body mass index (BMI) was
      calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared. Blood pressure was measured with a
      calibrated sphygmomanometer (Welch Allyn, USA) after 5 min of rest.

      All of the patients were given a low lipid diet. Calculated kcal were based on ideal weight
      minus 200 kcal/day if overweight.

      Results were expressed as mean ± Standard deviation (SD). Differences between initial vs.
      final values were compared with the Mann-Whitney U test. The normality hypothesis was tested
      using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. A p value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant. All tests
      were performed with the SPSS ver. 23 statistical software program.
