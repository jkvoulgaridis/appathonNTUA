    <textblock>
      A prospective, open-label, multi-cohort, non-randomized, multicenter Phase 2 study evaluating
      adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with TIL LN-144 (Lifileucel)/LN-145 in combination with
      pembrolizumab or TIL LN-145/LN-145-S1 as a single therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LN-144 (Lifileucel)/LN-145/LN-145-S1 is an adoptive cell transfer therapy that utilizes an
      autologous TIL manufacturing process for the treatment of patients with advanced unresectable
      or metastatic melanoma, advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and non-small
      cell lung cancer. The adoptive cell transfer therapy used in this study involves patients
      receiving a nonmyeloablative (NMA) lymphodepletion regimen, followed by infusion of
      autologous TIL followed by the administration of a regimen of IL-2. Patients in Cohorts 1A,
      Cohort 2A, and Cohort 3A will receive TIL plus pembrolizumab. Patients in Cohorts 1B and
      Cohort 3B will receive TIL as a single therapy.
