  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine the efficacy and safety of DNA methylation
      level in embryos during blastocyst embryo screening. Subjects with blastocysts on day 5-7 of
      embryo culture will be biopsied. A Freeze-all strategy and a single frozen blastocyst
      transfer will be performed till all study-specific embryos have been transferred. Then whole
      genome bisulfate sequencing will be performed on all cells that obtained from biopsy.

      This is a pragmatic randomized clinical trial, the purpose of this clinical trial is to
      determine the efficacy and safety of DNA methylation level in embryos during blastocyst
      embryo screening.Subjects with blastocysts on day 5-7 of embryo culture will be biopsied.A
      Freeze-all strategy and a single frozen blastocyst transfer will be performed till all
      study-specific embryos have been transferred. Then whole genome bisulfate sequencing will be
      performed on all cells that obtained from biopsy. The investigators will perform bisulfate
      sequence for two to seven blastocysts from one couple. The methylation level and genomic copy
      number variation will be analyzed by using the methylome data. Embryos with aneuploid
      chromosomes will be rejected for embryo transfer to uterus. The investigators preliminary
      results indicate that the optimal level of whole-genome DNA methylation is 0.30 Â± 0.02.
      Therefore, embryo with methylation level closest to the optimal level (from one couple
      patients) is the one for embryonic transfer to uterus. In the control group, euploid embryos
      selected by preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) will be used to transfer to uterus.
