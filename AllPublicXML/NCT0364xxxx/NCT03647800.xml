  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      APVO436 is being studied in this Phase 1/1b, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation study
      to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic and clinical activity of APVO436
      monotherapy in: 1) patients with AML that have relapsed on prior therapy or are refractory to
      therapy and are not candidates for intensive chemotherapy or transplant, and 2) patients with
      MDS that have &gt; 5% blasts in the bone marrow or blasts in the peripheral blood who have also
      failed prior therapy with an hypomethylating agent (HMA).

      The primary objective of the Phase 1 part of the study is to determine the recommended dose
      of APVO436 administered intravenously to patients with AML or MDS. The primary objective of
      the Phase 1b part of the study is to evaluate the clinical activity of APVO436 in patients
      with AML or MDS.

      Phase 1 - Open-label, Dose Escalation: The dose escalation stage of the study will test
      step-dose and/or split-dose regimens infused weekly over 10 dose levels (cohorts). Cohorts 1
      to 10 will follow a 3 + 3 design. The next cohort is started after patients in the previous
      dose cohort have completed the first cycle of dosing and an evaluation for dose-limiting
      toxicities (DLTs) during the first cycle has been completed.

      Phase 1b - Expansion: The recommended-dose from Phase 1 will be further examined in 2
      expansion cohorts consisting 24 AML patients (Cohort 1) and 24 MDS patients (Cohort 2).
      Patients will receive APVO436 intravenously weekly for six 28-day cycles, unless disease
      progression, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent occurs earlier. Patients with
      evidence of clinical benefit at the end of Cycle 6 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity
      may also continue on study for up to 12 total cycles at the discretion of Investigator (6
      cycles in addition to the initial 6 cycles).

The second part is a Phase 1b open label expansion study to assess the clinical activity and safety of the dose established in the first part of the study in additional patients with AML or MDS. Patients will receive APVO436 intravenously (IV) weekly for up to six 28-day cycles, unless disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent occurs earlier.</intervention_model_description>

             procedure.

          2. Age ≥ 18 years

          3. Histologically confirmed AML or MDS:

               1. AML - relapsed or refractory AML and refuses or is not a candidate for intensive
                  chemotherapy (due to prior failure or not eligible due to expected intolerance)
                  or allogeneic transplant

               2. MDS - relapsed or refractory MDS with &gt; 5% blasts in the marrow or any blasts in
                  the peripheral blood. Patients must have failed prior treatment with an HMA
                  (azacitidine, decitabine, or other HMA agent); failure is defined as intolerance
                  to HMA, lack of response [no complete remission (CR) by at least 6 cycles], or
                  have IWG-defined progressive disease during or after treatment with an HMA.

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2

          5. Life expectancy of &gt; 2 months in the Investigator's opinion

             aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 3 × ULN

          9. Prothrombin time (PT) / international normalized ratio (INR) and partial
             thromboplastin time (PTT) &lt; 1.5 × ULN

             contraception during the study and for 2 months after last study drug administration.
             Adequate contraception means less than 1% chance of pregnancy may occur with proper
             use of the method(s).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any central nervous system (CNS) (cerebral/meningeal) disease related to underlying
             malignancy

             allogenic transplant. Patients must be &gt;90 days from transplant and have been on no
             immunosuppressive therapy for &gt;30 days. Topical corticosteroids for minor skin rash
             (&lt;5% body surface area) is acceptable. Prior solid organ transplant is acceptable
             provided the patient is on no immunosuppressive therapy.

          6. Any therapy or experimental treatment for MDS or AML within 7 days of the first dose
             of study drug. Must have recovered to Grade ≤ 1 from any Grade 2 to 4 toxicity from
             previous treatment. The use of hydroxyurea is acceptable and does not exclude the
             patient.

         14. Any uncontrolled medical condition, including but not limited to:

               1. Symptomatic congestive heart failure ≥ Class III (New York Heart Association
                  Functional Classification)

               2. Uncontrolled hypertension

               3. Unstable angina

         15. Substance use disorder, psychiatric, cognitive, or any other condition that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, would pose a risk to the patient's safety, may compromise
             the patient's ability to understand and comply with the protocol or provide informed
             consent, or interfere with the study evaluation

         16. Any difficulty complying with protocol requirements that may increase the risk
