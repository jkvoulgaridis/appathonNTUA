      To determine efficacy and safety of peanut oral immunotherapy in adults with peanut allergy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      25 adults with peanut allergy, as confirmed by double blind placebo controlled food challenge
      (DBPCFC), will undergo peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT) with peanut flour.

      An additional 15 untreated peanut allergic adults will be recruited as comparator group for
      skin prick tests and mechanistic studies/immunological assays.
