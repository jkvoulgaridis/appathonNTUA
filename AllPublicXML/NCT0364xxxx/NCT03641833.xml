  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of cognitive decline occurs in 53% of patients after cardiac surgery. Causes of
      POCD can be various: age, duration of cardiac bypass, medicaments and many others. The aim of
      this study is to determine factors causing postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) and to
      identify which of them are most important

      Prospective case-control study included patients undergoing cardiac at Clinic of Cardiac,
      Vascular and Thoracic Surgery, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences. Inclusion criteria
      is: 1) cardiac output &gt; 35%; 2) no agents affecting central nervous system; 3) no
      neuropathology; 5) no multiple organ dysfunction. Patients will have to perform mini mental
      state examination (MMSE), Trial making, addenbrooke tests before and 7 days after surgery.
      Brain biomarkers glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) and neurofilaments will be taken after
      induction, 24 and 48 hours after surgery. Transcranial Doppler will be performed to evaluate
      a.cerebri media blood flow speed during surgery.

      After these test, the investigators are going to examine data about patient and operation,
      recognize factors causing POCD and identify the most important of them.
