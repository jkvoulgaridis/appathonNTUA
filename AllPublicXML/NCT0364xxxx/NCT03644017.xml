  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 study, designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the WRAPSODY
      Stent Graft for the treatment of venous outflow circuit obstructions in the veins of the arm
      or thoracic central veins of subjects who receive chronic dialysis treatment for end stage
      renal disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of a screening period in which subject eligibility will be determined.
      Approximately 50 subjects meeting the study entry criteria will be enrolled. Placement of the
      WRAPSODY stent graft will follow the procedure. Post study procedure subjects will have
      planned follow-up visits at 30 days, 3, 6 and 12months, and additional visits as referred by
      the subject's dialysis facility.

      The primary study safety endpoint will be the proportion of subjects without any localized or
      systemic safety events through 30 days that affect the access or venous outflow circuit and
      resulted in surgery, hospitalization, or death. Subjects will continue to be followed up to
      12 months for supplementary information.

          3. Subject is undergoing chronic hemodialysis or other forms of renal replacement therapy
             including transplantation and has one of the following being used: a. AV graft placed
             in the arm ≥30 days prior OR b. Mature fistula in the arm with at least one successful
             dialysis session completed

          4. Angiographic evidence of stenosis

          5. The target lesion has ≥ 50% stenosis

          6. Subject has clinical or hemodynamic evidence of a venous outflow stenosis or
             obstruction

          7. Full expansion of an appropriately sized standard angioplasty balloon has been
             achieved during primary angioplasty at the target lesion prior to enrollment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has undergone an intervention (surgical or percutaneous) of the AVF/AVG &lt;30
             days from the date of the initial study procedure

          2. Subject has had a previous stent or stent graft placed in the venous outflow circuit
             ≤30 days from the date of the initial study procedure

          3. Active hemodialysis access is not in the arm

          4. A pseudoaneurysm is present within the target lesion

          5. Target lesion is in SVC, IJV, under the clavicle, across the elbow, in the needling
             segment of AVF or AVG anastomosis, located within a stent

          6. Lesions, other than the target lesion, in the venous outflow circuit with &gt;30%
