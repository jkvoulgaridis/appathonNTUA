  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of commonly
      used over-the-counter products and the effects of the products on skin health.

      Participant will apply commonly used skin product on skin for a period of time with or
      without light challenge. The investigators will perform clinical assessments of the skin
      associated with product application as well as assess these changes with and without light
      challenge. Skin biopsies will be obtained following standard medical practice and will be
      used to analyze skin markers related to photoaging, pigmentation, oxidative stress, and other
      dermatologic conditions.
