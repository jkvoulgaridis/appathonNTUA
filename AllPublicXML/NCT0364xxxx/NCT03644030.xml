  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In general, malnutrition in surgical patients is associated with a higher risk of
      postoperative infections, decreased immune response, more cardiac complications, prolonged
      mechanical ventilation , and a higher rate of reimportation due to several other
      complications than lead to an increase in morbidity and mortality, a prolongation of the
      total hospitalization time in the ICU[intensive care unit ] and the chamber, and a delay in
      the healing of the surgical trauma .

      The presence of a low percentage of lean mass, as calculated by the technique of bioelectric
      conductivity, practically means a small percentage of muscle tissue. However, muscle tissue
      is an important, if not the only source of amino acids for both protein synthesis and
      gluconeogenesis in stress conditions, such as surgery and the first postoperative days. Thus,
      post-operative patients in general, and cardio-operated patients, in particular, having a low
      lean mass have minimal reserves to the stress requirements, resulting in an increased risk of
      complications.

      In the last few years, the most reliable indicator of malnutrition- in addition to the lean
      mass index - began to be considered the phase angle, which is also calculated when measuring
      the bioreduction of electrical conductivity, although there is a very recent challenge . The
      phase angle expresses the relationship between the electrical reactance, i.e. the state of
      the cell membrane, to resist the permeability and the resistance, i.e. the restriction to the
      flow of the electrical current through the body, mainly related to the water of the tissues .
      Like the FFM[fat-free mass]- index, the phase angle uses the total water of the tissues, and
      thus also reflects the cell mass. In addition, however, it also measures the resistance of
      cell membranes, so it also evaluates their quality and is therefore considered to be a
      reliable indicator of poor nutritional status , although some also maintain demur due to the
      possible poor distribution of extracellular fluid in cardiological patients.

      From all of the above, it appears that there are some gaps in the evaluation of the patients
      who are going to undergo cardiac surgery regarding their nutritional status, both because the
      classic nutrition control indicators are not fully documented as being reliable for these
      patients, and there are no studies to monitor and compare body composition directly to any
      other index postoperatively.

      The study protocol-mandated baseline data will include demographics, comorbidities,
      EuroSCORE[European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation] II, C-reactive protein, left
      ventricular ejection fraction (by transthoracic echocardiography) and peak expiratory flow
      rate (assessed by spirometry). Physical performance status will be assessed by APACHE [Acute
      Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation] II score. Furthermore, SOFA [Sequential
      [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment] score will be assessed preoperatively and up to
      7th postoperative day.

      Preoperatively and on the 7th postoperative day, the following parameters will be calculated
      or measured and then recorded:

        -  Anthropometric data including body height, weight and waist circumference measurement,
           estimation of waist/circumference ratio and calculation of body mass index [BMI].

        -  Nutritional status will be assessed by MUST[Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool] score

        -  Body composition analysis using bioelectrical impedance analysis [BIA], will be
           performed for the calculation of FFM [fat-free mass] and fat mass [FM] indicators,
           intracellular, extracellular and total water [ICW, ECW, TBW] and phase angle parameter
           [PhA]. Additionally, muscular power will be assessed by handgrip strength [HGS], the
           upper third triangle perimeter and skin fold thickness will be measured.

        -  Daily calorie and protein needs of each patient will be calculated

      During hospitalization, the following parameters will be recorded:

        -  Type of diet [parenteral, intestinal, oral]

        -  Post-operative infections involving respiratory system, medieval space, sternum trauma,
           lower limb trauma (if present) and endocarditis.

        -  The occurrence of organ dysfunction or sepsis. Sepsis is defined as a life-threatening
           organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. For clinical
           operationalization, organ dysfunction will be represented by an increase in the
           Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 2 points or more,
           which will be associated with an in-hospital mortality greater than 10%.

        -  Thromboembolic events such as stroke, peripheral venous thrombosis and pulmonary
           embolism.

        -  Acute renal failure.

        -  Re-operation for bleeding.

        -  Need for inotropic or vasoactive support.

        -  Hospitalization data (intubation&gt; 24 hours, duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU
           stay, duration of hospital stay, in-hospital mortality

    <description>Phase angle [PhA(°) = (reactance/electrical resistance) × (180°/Π)] will be measured in degrees using bioelectrical impedance analysis and check whether it can be considered as a reliable indicator of the nutrition status of cardiac surgery patients undergoing cardiac surgery during the preoperative and postoperative periods. PhA will be calculated by using the sum of impedance and reactance of the right arm, trunk, and right leg and based on the following equation, PhA(°) = (Reactance/Resistance) × (180°/Π). Π is the mathematical value of 3.1415 and This conversion is performed to convert the final value from radians into degrees.The normal range of phase angle is 5.84 ± 0.75.The primary change is the reduction of the mean phase angle postoperative by 1.0 unit (standard deviation ± 2.0) and this leads to increased morbidity, mortality.</description>
