  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this trial are:

        -  To evaluate the effect of a high-calorie, high-fat meal on the single-dose
           pharmacokinetics (PK) of milademetan

        -  To evaluate the effect of a standard meal on the single-dose PK of milademetan

      The key secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single-dose
      milademetan in all treatments.

      The duration of the study for each individual participant will be approximately 8 weeks from
      the start of Screening (within 28 days prior to dosing of study drug on Day 1) through the
      final Follow-up visit or phone call. Participants will remain in the Clinical Research Unit
      (CRU) from Study Day -2 through Study Day 20 (a total of 22 days and 21 nights).

      Participants will receive 3 single doses of study drug (at least 1 week apart) over the
      course of 15 days.

      At the investigator's discretion, participants may be asked to return to the CRU 14 days (±2
      days) after final dose of study drug for a follow-up visit.

      The end of the study is defined as the date of final follow-up visit of the last subject
      undergoing the study.
