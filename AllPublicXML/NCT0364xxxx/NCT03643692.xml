    <textblock>
      The Adaptive, Real-time, Intelligent System to Enhance Self-care of chronic diseases (ARISES)
      project will use type 1 diabetes (T1DM) as an exemplary case study to demonstrate safety,
      technical proof of concept and efficacy of a novel mobile platform. Combining wearable
      sensors and smartphone technology, a range of biological, environmental and behavioural data
      will be analysed to provide real-time therapeutic and lifestyle decision support. Using
      Case-Based-Reasoning (CBR), the system will be adaptive and personalised with the ability to
      learn from previously encountered scenarios. Ultimately, ARISES aims to empower
      self-management of chronic illness and limit the complications associated suboptimal
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>

      ARISES will target self-management to optimise glucose control through insulin dose
      recommendation (therapeutic advice), exercise and stress support, hypoglycaemia prevention
      through timely snack recommendation and behavioural change through educational support
      (lifestyle advice).

      Semi-structured focus meetings comprised of patients with T1DM, clinicians, engineers and
      experts in human-computer interaction will provide a forum to establish the essential
      usability requirements to incorporate into the ARISES mobile interface. The design will focus
      on ensuring access to decision support is intuitive and efficient while maintaining sight of
      real-time glycaemia outcomes. The design and implementation of the user-interface will be
      assessed in a series of usability validation studies.

      Clinical studies will be conducted in two phases. The first phase will be an observational
      study using wearable technologies to collect data and evaluate blood glucose correlations
      against physiological and environmental case parameters. Useful associations will assist the
      development of the CBR/machine learning algorithm and identify wearable devices for the final
      ARISES platform.
