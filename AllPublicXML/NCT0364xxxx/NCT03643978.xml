  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess differences in choice of treatment (and the rationale behind it),
      physical function, pain intensity, satisfaction, and decision regret between orthopedic
      patients who review a decision aid during their visit and those that do not. Decision aids
      for 23 different conditions are included.

      Patients visiting an orthopeadic surgeon in one of our 4 affiliated offices in a large urban
      area in the United States are invited to participate over a 4 month period. All
      English-speaking patients, between 18 and 89 years old, visiting an orthopeadic surgeon with
      a new problem, for which either invasive or non-invasive treatment is possible and a DA is
      available are asked to participate in this study. Exclusion criteria are non-English speakers
      or a clear preference for a treatment option by surgeon or patient. Patients will be randomly
      assigned to either the intervention or the control group in a 1:1 ratio using an Excel random
      number generator. Patients in the intervention group go over the DA during the visit, once
      the surgeon has identified the diagnosis. After the diagnosis is set, the surgeon steps out
      of the visit and steps back in when the patients has reviewed the DA. The surgeon and the
      patient go over the treatment options and a decision will be made. After the visit, all
      patients, both in the intervention and control group, are asked to fill out a survey. Two
      weeks after enrollment a research assistant calls all patients for a follow up questionnaire.

    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Physical Function Computer Adaptive Test (directly after visit)</measure>
    <time_frame>From enrollment till two weeks after visit</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire that measures patients self-reported capability of physical activities.
This Questionnaire is a CAT: Computerized Adaptive Test. Participant responses guide the system's choice of subsequent items from the full item bank (121 items in total in adult bank). Although items differ across respondents taking CAT, scores are comparable across participants.
CAT will continue until either the standard error drops below a specified level, or the participant has answered the maximum number of questions (12), whichever occurs first.
A score of 50 is the average for the United States general population with a standard deviation of 10 because calibration testing was performed on a large sample of the general population. Range scores 19-76. Higher scores is better physical function.</description>

it was the right decision
I regret the choice that was made

The choice did me a lot of harm
The decision was a wise one</description>
