      No study have evaluated the efficacy and safety of airway clearance therapy (ACT) and
      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) under bronchoscope for bronchiectasis.

      This study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of tran-bronchoscopy airway
      clearance and bronchoalveolar lavage in the treatment of moderate to severe bronchiectasis
      with acute exacerbation:A randomized, prospective cohort study.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ACT combined with BAL for
      bronchiectasis patients with acute exacerbation through the whole study process, which will
      provide a high quality of evidence-based strategies for the treatment, revision and
      optimization of international and domestic clinical guidelines for bronchiectasis. All the
      participants will be required to check the various efficacy and safety indicators.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Willing to join in and sign the informed consent form.

          2. The diagnosis of bronchiectasis need reference to the definition of &quot;European
             Respiratory Society guidelines for the management of adult bronchiectasis.&quot; published
             by The European respiratory journal in 2017, defined by the presence of both permanent
             bronchial dilatation on computed tomography (CT) scanning and the clinical syndrome of
             cough, sputum production and/or recurrent respiratory infections.

          3. Pulmonary exacerbation in patients with bronchiectasis was required to meet three or
             more of the following key symptoms for at least 48h: Cough; Sputum volume and/or
             consistency; Sputum purulence; Breathlessness and/or exercise tolerance; Fatigue
             and/or malaise; Haemoptysis, and a clinician determines that a change in
             bronchiectasis treatment is required.

          4. According to the researchers, the subjects were willing and able to follow the
             protocol and were able to tolerate bronchoscopy.

          5. Patients with good compliance: the subject must be willing to follow the test plan
             requirements in the research center to complete all the assessment of the visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1.Pregnant or lactating women; 2.Hypogammaglobulinemia or other autoimmune diseases;
        3.Clinical diagnosis of ABPA; 4.Non tuberculosis mycobacteria positive 2 years before;
        5.allergies or allergic to a variety of drugs; 6.poor compliance or can not cooperate
        judged by doctors; 7.participated in other clinical trials for nearly three months; 8.The
        researchers considered that the subject had other circumstances that were unfit to attend;
        9.Suffering from a significant disease or condition outside of bronchiectasis, as judged by
        the researchers, may lead to subjects at risk due to participate in the study,or the
        disease that have an impact on the research result and the ability of subjects to
        participate in this study; 10.Bronchoscopy contraindication; 11.Patients with heart, liver
        and kidney, nervous system, endocrine and other systemic diseases, may not be able to
        adhere to the completion of the study, or will affect the research process; 12.Patients who
        refused to sign informed consent after targeted explanation
