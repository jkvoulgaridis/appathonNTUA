      The SPINEREG study is a prospective observational study. Eligible patients are subjects
      undergoing spine surgery at the participating institutions.

      Baseline health status and follow-up health status are recorded at pre-established steps.

      Data from surgery and patients PROMs are registered on the database; the main timepoints are:
      pre-surgery, surgery, 3-6 month after surgery, 1-2-5-10-15-20 years after surgery.

    <measure>Spinal function (Oswestry Disability Index score)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 years</time_frame>
    <description>Oswestry Disability Index score (ODI). Each topic category is followed by 6 statements describing different potential scenarios in the patient's life relating to the topic. The patient then checks the statement which most closely resembles their situation. Each question is scored on a scale of 0-5 with the first statement being zero and indicating the least amount of disability and the last statement is scored 5 indicating most severe disability. The scores for all questions answered are summed, then multiplied by two to obtain the index (range 0 to 100). Zero is equated with no disability and 100 is the maximum disability possible.</description>

    <measure>Reliability of the data collected in SpineReg</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This project was based on the retrospective analysis of patients prospectively enrolled in a spinal surgery registry, SpineREG. The study aims to evaluate the equivalence of the PROMs registered in SpineREG using two different formats: paper vs. electronic version. Through the comparison between the data electronically provided in SpineREG and the paper questionnaires, the accuracy, reliability and validity of the data were evaluated.</description>
