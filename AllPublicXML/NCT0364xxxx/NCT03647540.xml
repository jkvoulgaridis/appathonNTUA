    <textblock>
      The fluorescent laparoscopic technique would be applied to the radical resection of gastric
      cancer at the junction of esophagus and stomach, and compared with the traditional
      laparoscopic radical resection of gastric cancer to find a better surgical method for
      patients

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        - 1. All cases should be diagnosed as adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junctionncer by
        histology. The tumor is within 1 cm above or 2 cm below the anatomic cardia. The clinical
        stage is T1-3, Nx, M0 for gastric cancer which can undergo the laparoscopic surgery.

        2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale 0-2 3. Heart, lung, liver, and kidney
        function can tolerate operation 4. Patients and their families are able to understand and
        be willing to participate in this clinical study and to sign informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1. history of stomach malignant disease 2. recent diagnosis of other malignant tumors
        (except for papillary carcinoma of the thyroid gland and basal cell carcinoma of the skin)
        3. patients with obstruction, perforation, bleeding requiring emergency surgery 4. a
        history of abdominal surgery (which makes it difficult to perform laparoscopic procedures),
        severe systemic disease such as diabetes, severe chronic lung disease, cirrhosis, other
        malignant diseases 5. combined stomach multiple carcinomas 6. with a history of serious
        mental illness 7. pregnant or lactating women 8. The researchers believe that the patients
        are unsuitable to participate in the researchers with other cases.
