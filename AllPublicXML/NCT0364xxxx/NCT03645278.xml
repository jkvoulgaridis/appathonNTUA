  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the last four decades, several classes of diuretics have been the first line option for
      the therapy of widespread hypertension. However, all the classes of diuretics cause
      alteration of potassium homeostasis. The primary objective of this study is to assess the
      safety and tolerability of SHR0532 tablets in healthy subjects. In addition, this study will
      provide information on Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of SHR0532 tablets in healthy
      subjects.
