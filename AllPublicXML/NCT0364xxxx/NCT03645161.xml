      In respiratory allergy patients, skin prick test results of local rat and mouse allergen
      extracts are not significant different from imported ones

      Many researches proposed that rodent deteriorate symptoms in patients with respiratory
      allergy who sensitized. The test that can identify rodent sensitization will be very useful.
      The investigators found lots of problems from imported mouse and rat allergen extract, eg.
      expensive cost and hard to find importing agency in Thailand. Making own local allergen
      extract will be the good solution for the country. This study aim to compare the results of
      locally rat and mouse allergen to imported ones.
