  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is a common disorder.
      Some studies have indicated that acupuncture may ameliorate the symptoms of CP/CPPS. However,
      results are varied and range widely, perhaps due to different modes of assessment including
      timepoints, places of assessment, and especially subjective scales. We propose to determine
      the efficacy of acupuncture relative to sham acupuncture for patients with CP/CPPS, and
      compare different modes of assessment regarding the therapeutic effects of acupuncture.

      Methods: Sixty patients with CP/CPPS will be randomly assigned to receive either acupuncture
      or sham-acupuncture (30 patients, each). Treatment will be conducted 3 times/week, for 4
      weeks. The primary outcomes will each be the change from baseline of the total NIH (National
      Institutes of Health) CPSI (Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index) score associated with 3 modes
      of assessment: Mode 1, the scale recorded at the hospital within 10minutes after the last
      session of 4 weeks of acupuncture treatment, in the company of the outcome assessors; Mode 2,
      the scale recorded the same day, but not at the hospital; and Mode 3, the scale recorded at
      the hospital 1 to 3 days after the last acupuncture session. The 3 key secondary outcomes
      include will be the 3 modes assessment of the changes from baseline of the NIH-CPSI total
      scores in the acupuncture group at week 4 after treatment. Analysis was by
      intention-to-treat, and multiplicity was controlled for with a step-down closed-testing
      procedure.

    <description>The National Institutes of Health-chronic prostatitis symptom index (NIH-CPSI) has a total score range from 0 to 43 and higher scores indicate more severe symptoms. The 9 items of this scale are stratified into 3 domains which are pain/discomfort (location/type, frequency and severity, 0-21 points), urinary symptoms (10 points) and quality of life (0-12 points). Mode 1, the scale is recorded at the hospital within 10minutes after the twelfth (last) treatment of the 4-week treatment period, in the company of the outcome assessors.</description>

With patients prone, after routine sterilization, bilateralBL33 will be inserted to a depth of 50 to 60mm with a 30° to 45° angle in an inferomedial direction using needles (0.30mm in diameter, 75mm in length). Bilateral BL35 will be inserted to a depth of 50 to 60mm with a slightly superolateral direction using needles (0.30mm in diameter, 75mm in length). BL23 and SP6 will be inserted vertically to a depth of 25 to 30mm using needles (0.30mm in diameter, 40mm in length). Manipulation of the needles by lifting and thrusting combined with twirling and rotating evenly will be performed until deqi occurs, defined as a sensation of soreness, numbness, heaviness, and ache. Manipulations will be applied every 10minutes and each session will last for 30minutes.</description>
