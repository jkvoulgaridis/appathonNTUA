  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to determine i) the effect of rhythmic entrainment of speech
      with hand gestures and auditory rhythmic cues on intelligibility and speech naturalness in
      Spanish-accented speakers of English in two pathology groups: ataxic dysarthria and
      hypokinetic dysarthria secondary to idiopathic Parkinson's disease; and ii) the extent to
      which speech rate and effort are control parameters of entrainment. These objectives will be
      achieved with the following specific aims:

      Specific Aim 1: Determine the effect of three rates of hand gestures and auditory rhythmic
      cues and the degree to which learning and carry-over occur.

      Specific Aim 2: Determine the effect of increased speech effort, operationalized as clear
      speech, and the interaction effect of clear speech with hand gestures and auditory rhythmic
      cues.

      Specific Aim 3: Investigate the perception of speech rhythm and its relationship to
      entrainment.

      Specific Aim 3: Investigate the perception of speech rhythm and its relationship to
      entrainment.

      The protocol calls for 12 talkers to participate in a single case experimental design: 6
      Spanish-accented speakers of English and 6 native English speakers, and each language group
      consisting of 2 healthy controls, 2 adults diagnosed with ataxic dysarthria and 2 adults
      diagnosed with hypokinetic dysarthria secondary to idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Sixty
      monolingual healthy adult listeners will rate intelligibility, accentedness, and ease of
      understanding.

    <description>Intelligibility = the accuracy with which a listener understands a speaker. It will be measured by having the subjects undergoing the therapy (&quot;the talkers&quot;) read 28 phrases using accompanying gesture or auditory cues and listeners will transcribe the sentences. The number of words accurately transcribed / the number of words in the phrase = intelligibility score for each phrase per listener</description>

    <measure>Ease of understanding</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately upon completion of the therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Ease of understanding = the ease with which listeners understand the speakers. It will be measured by having the subjects undergoing the therapy (&quot;the talkers&quot;) read 28 phrases using accompanying gesture or auditory cues and listeners will rate how easy it is to understand the talkers using a 0 to 9 visual analog scale with 0 = very easy and 9= very hard, for each phrase per listener</description>

    <measure>Speech naturalness</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately upon completion of the therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Speech naturalness = the degree to which the listeners consider the speakers to have natural or unnatural speech. It will be measured by having the subjects undergoing the therapy (&quot;the talkers&quot;) read 28 phrases using accompanying gesture or auditory cues and listeners will rate how natural-sounding the talker sounds by using a 0 to 9 visual analog scale with 0 = very natural and 9 = very unnatural, for each phrase per listener</description>
