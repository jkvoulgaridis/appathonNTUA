  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that schedules that most disrupt the normal circadian rhythm have the most
      harmful consequences. Firefighters positive for a sleep disorder have a higher risk of
      depression and anxiety; they report more traffic accidents, falling asleep during driving,
      and worth health felt. Furthermore, some studies suggest that sleep disorders are risk
      factors for cardiovascular disease. This activity is responsible of a worth quality of sleep
      that could induce a lower effectiveness of emergency response. The consequences of this
      schedules on sleep and health of French firemen have never been studied.
