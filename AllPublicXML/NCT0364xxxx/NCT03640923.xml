  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is necessary to better understand the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
      genome sequences by gametes without replication-competent virus transmission. In fact, HIV
      endogenization could be protective. Some studies are supporting this hypothesis, one shew the
      presence of HIV genome sequences in spermatozoa, and others show that HIV-positive &quot;Elite
      controllers&quot; patients have HIV genome sequences without a replication competent virus. One
      study found HIV genome sequences without a replication-competent virus in the cells of an
      HIV-negative child whose mother is a non-sick HIV-positive. We will conduct a prospective
      descriptive and analytical study over a period of 2 years, from September 2018 to November
      2020. We will explore by FISH method in the IHU Méditerranée-Infection laboratory, Marseille,
      the presence or absence of HIV genome sequences without a replication-competent virus in
      epithelial cells of children with parents are infected by HIV. Children included must be
      under 12 months of age, followed at Robert Debré Hospital, Paris or Timone Enfant Hospital,
      Marseille because of a parental HIV infection. They must have the recommended blood tests to
      assess their HIV status and the parents consent should be written. Subsequent progression to
      HIV infection or not will be followed and a statistical study will be conducted to establish
      a link between the presence of endogenized HIV genome sequences in epithelial cells and the
      developpement or not of HIV infection.
