      Dose escalation/PK study (Phase Ib) will follow a traditional 3+3 design with evaluable
      participants enrolled at each dose level: Cohort 1 (1000mg, BID), Cohort 2, (1000mg, TID),
      and Cohort 3 (1500 mg, TID). The food-effect study will be one-week add-on study at the
      beginning of the dose escalation/PK study. Dose expansion study (Phase 2) will proceed to
      treat at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) up to 2 years or until tumor progression,
      unacceptable toxicity, death or participants withdrawal. Participant may continue receiving
      treatment beyond 2 years at the discretion of investigator.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed histopathology of recurrent gliomas that were originally diagnosed as,
             Glioblastoma (WHO Grade IV), Astrocytoma (WHO Grade III), or Oligodendroglioma (WHO
             Grade III). Participants with an initial diagnosis of a lower-grade glioma are
             eligible if a subsequent biopsy was determined to be glioblastoma.

          -  Unequivocal radiographic evidence of tumor progression by MRI as per the RANO criteria
             within 14 days prior to registration.

          -  At least one measureable lesion per RANO.

          -  Prior radiotherapy

             Cockcroft-Gault equation.

          -  Must be ≥ 18 years of age.

          -  Life expectancy (as assessed by the Investigator) at least three months.

          -  Capability of swallowing oral medication (4-6 size 0 capsules twice or thrice a day).

             years, are eligible.

          -  Have received treatment within the last 28 days with a drug that has not received
             regulatory approval for any indication at the time of study entry.

          -  Serious concomitant systemic disorders (for example, active infection or abnormal
             electrocardiogram (ECG) indicative of cardiac disease) that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would compromise the safety of the participants and his/her ability to
             complete the study.

          -  with abnormal sodium, potassium, or creatinine levels ≥ grade 2.

          -  with PT/PTT or INR above the upper limit of normal, unless treated with anticoagulants
             (e.g. warfarin). In such cases coagulation parameters (INR) should be monitored weekly
             for the first six weeks of the study.

          -  Inability to comply with protocol or study procedures.

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  For participation in a food effect cohort, uncontrolled Diabetes Type I or
