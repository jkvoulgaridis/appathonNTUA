  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study investigators will examine the effect of dose related to exercise therapy for
      pain in healthy adult humans. An acute pain model will be employed to study the effect of
      exercise dose on pain. Acute pain models are currently used to study pain (both acute and
      chronic) in human samples as there is currently no chronic pain model.

    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a randomized controlled trial with repeated measures. The effect of
      exercise dose on pain: subjects will be randomly assigned to one of four exercise groups: 1.)
      no exercise (control); 2.) low dose exercise (3x/week); 3.) moderate dose exercise (5x/week).
      4.) high dose exercise (10x/week).

    <description>Subjects' constant heat pain intensity rating will be assessed using a (45 degree Celsius, 3cm x 5cm heating block applied to the forearm and calf for 3 seconds). Following the stimulus, subjects will rate the intensity of the pain associated with the stimulus using a visual analog scale numbered at 0 and 10, where &quot;0&quot; represents &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;10&quot; represents &quot;the worst pain imaginable&quot; (0=minimum score, 10 maximum score).
