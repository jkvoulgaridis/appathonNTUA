      navigation laser is a novel fundus imaging and laser treatment method that allows imaging
      (infrared, colour, fluorescein angiography) and integrated laser treatment of the retina.
      Besides documentation, precision,safety and patient comfort,the main theoretical advantages
      lie in retina navigation.This randomized, parallel controlled, clinical-trial aims to
      evaluate treatment effect and safety of navigation laser photocoagulation for mild diabetic
      macular edema compared with traditional laser. The primary outcome measures is the
      Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of the participants at 1 year after treatment. Besides,
      the slit-lamp examination, tonometry, funduscopy, and OCT, FFA, ICGA examinations will also
      be compared between different groups to find the advantage of navigation laser .

    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Participants pain intensity will be immediately measured by Visual Analogue Scale/Score （VAS）after treatment.The VAS is a straight horizontal line of fixed length（100 mm）. The ends are defined as the extreme limits of the parameter to be measured (pain) orientated from the left (0) to the right (100).The patient marks on the line the point that participants feel represents their perception of their current pain intensity.the VAS score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 100mm line between the &quot;0&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity.the following cut points on the pain VAS have been recommended: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain(5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75-100 mm) .</description>
