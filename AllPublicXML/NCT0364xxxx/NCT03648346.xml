  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a single center, double-blind, randomized, parallel group, multiple ascending
      dose study in 16 healthy male volunteers. Subjects will receive multiple eye drop doses
      during 14 days of the treatment (HL217 or placebo according to the randomization). There will
      be 2 cohorts of 8 subjects (6 HL217 vs 2 placebo) receiving the following doses:

        -  Cohort 1 : two drops of 3 mg/mL of the treatment in one eye twice a day (low dose),

        -  Cohort 2 : two drops of 3 mg/mL of the treatment in one eye 4 times a day (high dose).

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of HL217 after multiple
      eye drop administrations at different doses in healthy subjects.
