  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project seeks to investigate the effects of a single acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH)
      session on respiratory and non-respiratory motor function and EMG (electromyography) activity
      on patients with ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) and healthy controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most ALS patients survive less than 5 years after diagnosis, and the main cause of death is
      respiratory failure. The investigators are interested in the therapeutic potential of acute
      intermittent hypoxia (AIH) for individuals with neuromuscular diseases, such as ALS. More
      than two decades of research indicates AIH elicits meaningful respiratory and non-respiratory
      motor recovery. Acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) consists of alternating periods of breathing
      mildly hypoxic (lowered oxygen concentration) and normoxic (normal oxygen concentration) air.

      The investigators propose to study mechanisms of respiratory plasticity associated with a
      single presentation of mild AIH. The fundamental hypothesis guiding this proposal is that
      even a single AIH trial improves respiratory (and non-respiratory) motor function in ALS
      patients procedure. Participants will then be asked to breathe air with reduced oxygen for
      short periods of time, for a duration of 45 minutes. The activity of your muscles and your
      heart function will be monitored throughout the procedure.

    <measure>Maximal Respiratory Pressures</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Hours</time_frame>
    <description>Maximal voluntary static contractions of the inspiratory or expiratory muscles against a closed valve, measured at the mouth. Sniff nasal inspiratory pressure measures inspiratory force generation at the nose.The test will be repeated until 3 measurements are obtained within 10% variability; a minimum 20-second rest will be provided between hypoxic episodes.</description>

    <measure>Maximal Voluntary Grip Force</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Hours</time_frame>
    <description>Maximal static voluntary handgrip contractions will be evaluated in a seated position with the arm at the side and elbow flexed to 90 degrees. The test will be repeated until 3 measurements are obtained with &lt;10% variability, and a minimum 15-second rest between measurements.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Minute Ventilation</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Hours</time_frame>
    <description>A pneumotachograph and pressure transducer connected to the face mask will record breath-by-breath flow, volume, mouth pressure, and breathing rate. After achieving a stable tidal volume, 5 minutes of tidal breathing will be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ventilatory Drive</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Hours</time_frame>
    <description>Respiratory drive will be estimated with pressure generation against a transiently occluded airway in the first 0.1 sec of inspiration. Five measurements will be conducted, with 5-15 un-occluded breaths between each P0.1 measurement. This validated test is resistant to learning or sensory bias and reflects unaltered neuromuscular effort.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Surface electromyography (EMG)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Hours</time_frame>
    <description>Surface EMGs of the respiratory muscles (up to six muscles, bilaterally: scalene, sternocleidomastoid, 2nd parasternal, 5th external intercostal, 8th external intercostal, and diaphragm) will be recorded during the test session. The root mean square (RMS) of each muscle will be averaged.</description>

    <description>AIH entails continuous breathing as the level of oxygen in the air is decreased, then returned to normal. Participants will alternate between breathing normal air and breathing hypoxic air (air that has less oxygen). Participants will complete a single 45 minute session of acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH). Breathing, muscle activity and heart activity will be monitored before, during and after the procedure. The intervals will last 1 minute each.</description>
