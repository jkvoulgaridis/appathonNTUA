      The DIAMOND-AF II Study is a prospective, non-randomized (single-group assignment) trial
      being performed at multiple centers in the United States, Canada and Europe to evaluate the
      safety and effectiveness of the DiamondTemp Ablation System for the treatment of patients
      with persistent atrial fibrillation.

Section 1 measures occurrence of atrial fibrillation by asking the subject if they are in atrial fibrillation. If they answer &quot;No&quot;, it asks for the last time they had atrial fibrillation ranging from the subject were never aware of having atrial fibrillation (minimum) to more than 1 year ago (maximum).
Section 2 measures how atrial fibrillation affects the subject's quality of life by asking a series of 20 questions that the subject rates on a scale of 1 to 7, how much was the subject bothered by their atrial fibrillation, one being &quot;Not at all bothered&quot; and 7 being &quot;Extremely bothered&quot;.</description>

For each item, a score of 0 typically indicates normal function in that specific ability, while a higher score is indicative of some level of impairment. The individual scores from each item are summed in order to calculate a patient's total NIHSS score. The maximum possible score is 42, with the minimum score possible is 0.
