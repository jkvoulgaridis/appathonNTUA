      Current literature data suggest that dental occlusion has an influence on postural control in
      the general population, and more markedly in high-level athletes. The link between dental
      occlusion and the postural stability of top athletes has been studied in several disciplines
      such as basketball, shooting, golf and running. There is currently no data in the field of
      rowing. But this sport requires optimal postural control for synchronous and symmetrical
      muscle solicitation.

      The present study aims to evaluate the influence of dental occlusion on postural stability
      and the performance of high level rowers.

      Our assumptions are as follows:

        -  Occlusal disturbance alters the muscular power developed by high level rowers

        -  occlusal disturbance alters the static postural stability of high level rowers

    <description>Muscular power (in Watts) developed by the high level rowers with the &quot;leg press&quot; test on a &quot;Dyno concept 2&quot; machine, with and without artificial occlusal disturbance. Each test lasts 30 seconds. The sequence consists in 2 tests and is performed twice with a resting period of 1 min between each recording.</description>

    <description>Each test lasts 51.2 seconds. The sequence consists in 10 tests and is performed twice with a resting period of 1 min between each recording.
During each test, the projected sway area (in mmÂ², the area of the confidence ellipse containing 90% of the sampled positions of the foot pressure center on the statokinesigram) is extracted from the stabilometric platform</description>

    <description>Each test lasts 51.2 seconds. The sequence consists in 10 tests and is performed twice with a resting period of 1 min between each recording.
During each test, the sway velocity (in mm/s) is calculated as the speed of displacement of the center of pressure of the foot as a function of the average position on the antero-posterior axis of the statokinesigram.</description>

    <measure>Tonicity of the para-vertebral muscles</measure>

    <description>Tonicity of the para-vertebral muscles is evaluated with the postural test of Posterior-superior iliac spines (PSIS) with and without artificial occlusal disturbance. This PSIS test is performed eyes opened, in MIO position with and without artificial occlusal disturbance,
The sequence of two tests is performed twice. During this test, the endpoint is qualitative: operator asymmetric thumbs' ascension reflecting asymmetric contraction of paravertebral muscles (abnormal response) or not (normal response).</description>
