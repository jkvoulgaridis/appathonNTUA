    <textblock>
      This prospective, single center, non-comparative, 90-day follow-up, post-market clinical
      investigation of etafill in patients undergoing cataract surgery.

      The performance is measured by the preservation of endothelial cells measured by specular
      microscopy at the follow-up visit in comparison to baseline values.

    <description>Questionnaire contains the subjective evaluation by the investigator of the IMD's rheological properties as well as the maintenance of the patient's anterior chamber and dome.
Scale for the chamber and dome maintenance ranges from flat ( worst case) to full chamber (best case) maintained.
Scale for rheological properties ranges from dispersive (worst case) to cohesive (best case).</description>

        The study patients will be recruited by the investigator, among patients scheduled to
        receive a standard cataract surgery taking inclusion and exclusion criteria into account.
        The investigator may also offer participation in the study to potential candidates
        identified in their patient database.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients indicated for cataract surgery via the anterior chamber

          -  A negative urine pregnancy test at Visit 1 or 2

          -  Capability to understand information about the investigation, including patients'
             obligations, and willingness to take part, as evidenced by signed and dated informed
             consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a known hypersensitivity to HA or other components of the device.

          -  Patients with corneal scars or corneal dystrophies interfering with study measurements

          -  Abnormal intraocular pressure which would interfere with surgery and follow up (in
             opinion of the investigator)

          -  Any other condition that in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with the
             participation in this investigation

          -  Any person dependent on the investigator or employees of the investigation site
             institution or the Sponsor.

          -  Current or previous (within 30 days of enrollment) treatment with another
             investigational drug and/or medical device or participation in another clinical study

          -  Patients whose participation in clinical trials is prohibited by the Austrian Medical
             Devices Act
