  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many homeless Veterans with serious mental illness (SMI) enroll in the VA's Supported Housing
      (VASH) program but struggle to obtain and sustain housing. Social skills are an important-but
      underappreciated-determinant of housing outcomes for homeless adults. The investigators
      hypothesize that homeless Veterans with SMI who participate in a social skills training
      program, tailored for housing-related social skills, will obtain housing quicker, retain
      housing longer, and show improved mental health outcomes compared to Veterans with similar
      needs not participating in such a program.

    <ipd_description>The PI will create de-identified, study-specific datasets that include all variables in a publication. Some loss of information might occur given the need to remove PHI. The PI will replace social security and medical station numbers with study-specific numbers. The PI will drop date of birth and replace age with age categories, in accordance with PHI requirements for people 85 years of age and older. Dates of service will be replaced with year dummies.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_time_frame>Datasets meeting VA standards for disclosure to the public will be made available within 1 year of publication.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Prior to distribution, a local privacy officer will certify that all datasets contains no PHI. Final data sets will be maintained locally until enterprise-level resources become available for long-term storage and access. Guidance on request and distribution processes will be provided by ORD. Those requesting data will be asked to sign a Letter of Agreement.</ipd_access_criteria>
