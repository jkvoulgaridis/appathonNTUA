    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ¹⁸F- fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) works with positron
      emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in assessing participants with
      malignant (cancerous) brain tumors. FMISO provides information about the oxygen levels in a
      tumor, which may affect how the tumor behaves. PET/MRI imaging produces images of the brain
      and how the body functions. FMISO PET/MRI may help investigators see how much oxygen is
      getting in the brain tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the feasibility of obtaining FMISO PET (hypoxic volume and tumor to blood
      background values [T/B]) and dynamic susceptibility contrast enhanced (DSC) &amp;
      diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) MRI measures in patients with intracranial brain tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the feasibility of baseline and follow-up FMISO PET and MR imaging
      co-registration.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the reproducibility of the baseline FMISO PET imaging metrics as assessed by
      baseline &quot;test&quot; and &quot;retest&quot; experiments.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive ¹⁸F-fluoromisonidazole intravenously (IV) and 1.5 - 2 hours later
      undergo PET/CT or PET/MRI over 20-40 minutes and a retest examination within 7 days.
      Participants may undergo 2 more PET/MRI scans no sooner than every 4 weeks.

      After conclusion of the diagnostic tests, participants are followed for up to 5 years.

    <description>Will be assessed as a factor of generating quantitative positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) metrics (intra-tumoral FMISO tumor to blood [T/B] level, hypoxic volume, dynamic susceptibility contrast enhanced [DSC], and diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI] values). Following completion of cohort enrollment, the generation of each quantitative PET/MRI metric will be independently scored as a dichotomous variable; successful or non-successful. Proportional assessment will be performed to assess for project feasibility. The successful generation of quantitative PET/MRI metrics in 85% of the initial cohort of patients successfully imaged for research purposes will need to be achieved for the imaging modality to be deemed feasible for the purposes of this study. The estimated proportion of success rate for each metric along with the corresponding 95% binomial confidence interval will be provided.</description>

    <description>The generation of co-registered imaging data sets will be independently scored as a dichotomous variable; successful or non-successful (&lt; 10mm versus [vs.] &gt; 10mm alignment error).
