  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the R21 is using an experimental medicine research approach to study
      whether a chronic, progressive -based exercise program will help Veterans suffering from
      chronic low back pain (cLBP) and PTSD achieve exercise maintenance, and shared symptom
      reduction, through neuropeptide Y mediated improvements in putative factors (self-regulation
      and reward sensitivity) known to improve exercise related self-efficacy and motivation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effects of a 3-month, individually prescribed progressive
      exercise training program on: 1) chronic low back pain (cLBP), depression and PTSD symptoms,
      and 2) neurobiological and related neuropsychological mechanisms by which our
      exercise-training paradigm may foster exercise maintenance. More specifically, the
      investigators hypothesize relationships between exercise-training associated augmentation of
      neuropeptide Y (NPY) system function and improved capacities for reward and
      self-regulationâ€”neuropsychological capacities posited to underlie intrinsic motivation and
      self-efficacy, which in turn have been shown to predict exercise maintenance. This study will
      focus on Veterans with cLBP/PTSD. The study design includes a baseline, acute,
      cardiopulmonary exercise assessment (CPX) that will inform the exercise prescription for the
      12-week &quot;progressive exercise&quot; training program, comprised of three 30-45 minute in clinic
      exercise sessions per week (walking or running--depending on the ability/capacity of the
      participant). All exercise sessions will be supervised by an exercise physiologist in the
      Clinical Studies Unit (CSU) at VA Boston Healthcare System. Intermittent telephone calls by
      the researchers will provide additional motivational support and problem solving.
      Implementation of the prescribed exercise regimen will also be supported by the use of heart
      rate and actigraph monitors programmed for the participant to achieve their prescribed heart
      rate range (HRR). Also, a &quot;midpoint&quot; and &quot;endpoint&quot; CPX assessment will track changes in NPY
      system function and delineate their impact on pain, depression and PTSD symptoms, as well as
      the factors proposed to foster exercise maintenance. All three CPX tests will be performed in
      accordance with guidelines published by the American College of Cardiology. Among Veterans
      with cLBP/PTSD, the investigators hypothesize that the capacity to release NPY in response to
      vigorous exercise (i.e., acute CPX testing) will be associated with improvements in pain,
      depression and PTSD symptoms, as well as the putative factors that predict exercise
      maintenance. Data from this R21 will be used to demonstrate feasibility and inform the
      further development of individually prescribed, motivationally based exercise regimens that
      could be used as adjuncts to cognitive and other therapeutic PTSD, depression or chronic pain
      interventions to reduce cLBP, depression and PTSD, as well as the negative consequences of
      these disorders over the long-term.

    <measure>Transtheoretical Model of Exercise: Stages of Change (short-form)</measure>
    <time_frame>Eligibility/screening, baseline, 6 week, and 12 week</time_frame>
    <description>This 4-item continuous measure categorizes stages of behavioral change based on the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) stages (precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action and maintenance), specifically in the context of exercise behavior change. Each stage reflects a different level of readiness to exercise, where precontemplation means that the patient is not actively considering exercise behaviors, whereas a patient in the maintenance stage has been actively exercise regularly (3 times per week for 50 minutes minimum) for at least the past 6 months. Scoring for this measure is determined by YES or NO answers provided to questions about exercise behaviors that patients are currently doing or intend to do in the near future. For example, if patients answer YES to the first question &quot;Do you currently engage in regular exercise (at least 3 times per week for 50 or more minutes per session)?&quot;, then the patient could either be in the action or maintenance stage of exercise.</description>

    <measure>West Haven Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory - Pain Interference</measure>
    <time_frame>Eligibility/Screening, baseline, 6 week, 12 week</time_frame>
    <description>The West Haven Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory (WHYMPI) has been demonstrated to be applicable across a variety of clinical pain conditions, and this subscale focuses on pain interference. Participants identify a &quot;significant other&quot; defined as a person with whom the participant feels closest to by checking off one of 7 descriptive terms that best represents the relationship with this person and if the participant shares a living space with that person. Next are 20 items about the impact of pain on the participant's life and are scored on a 7-point scale from 0 to 6. Some questions are reverse coded and a higher overall score indicates greater pain interference. Some anchors for 0 to 6 include &quot;No pain/Very intense pain,&quot; &quot;No interference/Extreme interference,&quot; &quot;No change/Extreme change,&quot; &quot;Not at all supportive/Extremely supportive,&quot; and &quot;Extremely low mood/Extremely high mood.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale-5</measure>
    <time_frame>Eligibility/screening and 12 week</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPS is the gold standard in PTSD assessment. The CAPS-5 is a 30-item structured interview that can be used to make a current (past month) diagnosis of PTSD, lifetime diagnosis of PTD, and assesses PTSD symptoms over the past week. The patient identifies a Criterion A index trauma and the assessor combines information about frequency and intensity of each item into a single severity rating. CAPS-5 total symptom severity score is calculated by summing severity scores for the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms. CAPS-5 symptom cluster severity scores are calculated by summing the individual item severity scores for symptoms corresponding to a given DSM-5 cluster: Criterion B (items 1-5); Criterion C (items 6-7); Criterion D (items 8-14); and, Criterion E (items 15-20). A symptom cluster score may also be calculated for dissociation by summing items 19 and 20. Criterion items are scored 0 to 4 (Absent to Extreme/incapacitating) and summed up. Higher scores indicate greater severity of PTSD.</description>

    <measure>Self-Efficacy for Exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>Eligibility/Screening, baseline, 6 week, 12 week</time_frame>
    <description>This 6-item scale is used to determine confidence in one's ability to exercise. Total score is calculated by summing the responses to each question. Participants rate self-efficacy to exercise in specific sitguations on 5-point scale from Not at all Confident to Completely Confident. A higher score indicates higher self-efficacy for exercise.</description>

    <measure>Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Eligibility/Screening, baseline, 6 week, 12 week</time_frame>
    <description>This revised10-item scale taps into a global sense of self-efficacy, or belief by an individual in his or her ability (e.g., &quot;I can always solve difficult problems if I try hard enough, &quot; and &quot;I can usually handle whatever comes 66-68 This 10-item self-report scale assesses habitual use of two common strategies to alter emotion captured on two sub-scales: cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. Items are rated on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).</description>

    <measure>Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Eligibility/Screening, baseline, 6 week, 12 week</time_frame>
    <description>This 18-item self-report measure uses a Likert-like scale (1-6) to assess reward sensitivity to specific experiences that are either anticipatory (the night before a major holiday) or consummatory (chocolate chip cookie). Participants rate from 1 (very false for me) to 6 (very true for me) when presented statements about how one might react to specific rewarding stimuli. Scores are added together and greater score represent higher anticipation of a reward, higher enjoyment when presented a tangible reward, a greater total score (subscales added) represents a higher sensitivity to rewarding stimuli.</description>

    <measure>Go/No-Go Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 week, 12 week</time_frame>
    <description>This computerized task measures response inhibition. Participants are asked to respond to certain (&quot;go&quot;) stimuli and make no response &quot;no-go&quot; stimuli, while maintaining speed and accuracy The main dependent measure is the commission error rate making a &quot;go&quot; response to &quot;no-go&quot; trials.</description>

    <measure>Exercise Motivation Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Eligibility/Screening, baseline, 6 week, 12 week</time_frame>
    <description>This 31-item scale is used to determine extrinsic and intrinsic variants of exercise motivation based on Self-Determination Theory. Participants rate statements about personal motivation from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree), depending on how strongly the participant relates to each item. Higher scores on specific items reflect the major sources of the participant's motivation to exercise. For example, higher scores on items 2, 10, 15, and 27 indicates intrinsic motivation to learn more about/from exercising.</description>

    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Eligibility/Screening, baseline, 6 week, 12 week</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) is a well-validated 21-item self-report measure of depressive symptom severity. It yields a total score and subscale scores for depressive cognitive and somatic symptoms. BDI-II items are rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3 based on severity of each item. The maximum total score is calculated by adding the sums of both subscales, with 0-13 indicating minimal depression, 14-19 indicating mild depression, 20-28 indicating moderate depression, and 29-63 indicating severe depression.</description>

    <description>Based on the &quot;Active Physical Treatment Model&quot; individuals with chronic pain are typically and primarily sedentary or physically deconditioned and need a progressive approach to work up to standard exercise prescriptions as defined by the American College of Sports Medicine. Thus, progressive exercise training can help to minimize the risk or occurrence of a range of exercise-related adverse medical events, particularly with the complex study population which will be starting at a sedentary level and therefore, may not be able to initially achieve the heart rate goals prescribed in standard exercise training protocols. The exercise prescription will be individually designed and geared toward an intensity manageable by the individual..</description>
