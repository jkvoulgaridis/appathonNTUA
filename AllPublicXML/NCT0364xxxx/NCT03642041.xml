      1. Understanding the smoking change patterns among the newly diagnosis lung cancer patients
           after cancer diagnosis.

        2. Explore the related factors of the smoking change patterns.

        3. The type of smoking trajectory impact on survival and quality of life.

    <description>Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung, Version 4 (FACT-L v. 4) was a 36-item ordinal scale, five-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). There were 5 domains: Physical, social/family, emotional, and functional well-being; lung cancer subscale (symptoms, cognitive function, regret of smoking). Subscale scores added to obtain total score, with higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>
