  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Guilingji capsule in older adults
      with mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment who diagnosed as the kidney and marrow deficiency
      pattern in TCM. A total of 348 participants are evenly assigned to two arms. In the
      intervention arm, participants receive Guilingji capsule and Ginko Biloba Extract mimetic in
      combination, while the other arm will receive Ginko Biloba Extract tablet with Gulingji
      mimetic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, randomized, positive control, noninferiority clinical trials.
      Experimental arm (174 cases) take 0.6 g of Gulingji capsules once a day and 19.2 mg of Ginko
      Biloba Extract mimetic three times a day. Active Comparator arm (174 cases) should take 0.6 g
      of Gulingji mimetic once a day and 19.2 mg of Ginko Biloba Extract tablet three times a day.
      The intervention lasted for 24 weeks. Clinical researchers, participants and statisticians
      are blinded to the treatment assignment throughout the study. Co-primary efficacy endpoints
      are change from baseline to week 12 and 24 in Mini-Mental State Examination score and
      Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) total score.Change from baseline to week 12 and 24 in
      Clinical Dementia Rating score, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale
      score, Activities of Daily Living, and Chinese Medicine Symptom Scale scoreare additional
      endpoints. Prespecified secondary biomarker endpoint is change from baseline in the serum
      level of acetylcholine and acetylcholinesterase at week 24.

    <masking_description>Participants are randomly and evenly assigned to 2 groups using block randomization.Random numbers are generated by the stratified random method using the SAS statistical software and assigned by an independent statistician at the Good Clinical Practice Institute of Xiyuan Hospital. Drugs are numerically labeled and sequenced according to the random numbers. The drug randomization is conducted by drug supplier. The patients are assigned to the intervention according to the sequence.
The clinicians, patients and statistician are blind to the patients' grouping assignment and intervention. Database is locked after all data is inputted. The grouping information will be revealed when statistical analyses are conducted. The researchers reveal the second blinding and write the study report finally. Unblinding is allowed only in emergency situation for the patients</masking_description>

    <time_frame>Baseline,12th week±3 days, 24th week±3 days</time_frame>
    <description>MMSE is a 30-point questionnaire and contains items assessing orientation, memory, attention and calculation, naming and visuospatial skills of patients.</description>

    <measure>The Change From Baseline in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Total Score at Week 12 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline,12th week±3 days, 24th week±3 days</time_frame>
    <description>MoCA is a 30-point questionnaire and evaluates orientation, executive function, language ability, short-term memory, attention and visuospatial ability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Change From Baseline in Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Total Score at Week 12 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline,12th week±3 days, 24th week±3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The CDR test is a numeric scale used to quantify the severity of symptoms of dementia. It sums 6 clinical ratings: 1) memory, 2) orientation, 3) judgment and problem solving, 4) involvement in community affairs, 5) home and hobbies, and 6) personal care based on the CDR interview. The CDR includes discussions with the participant and caregiver using a structured format. CDR total score range is 0 (least impairment) to 18 (most impairment); a negative change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

    <measure>The Change From Baseline in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) Total Score at Week 12 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline,12th week±3 days, 24th week±3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The ADAS-Cog is a multi-item, objective measure of cognitive function. Analysis of the ADAS-Cog for this study is based upon an 12 item score from the following items 1) word recall task, 2) naming objects and fingers, 3) following commands, 4) constructional praxis, 5) ideational praxis, 6) orientation, 7) word recognition, 8) remembering test instructions, 9) spoken language ability, 10) word finding difficulty in spontaneous speech, 11) comprehension, and 12) attention during the test. The ADAS-Cog ranged from 0 to 75 points, with higher scores indicating a greater degree of impairment. A negative change from baseline indicates a decrease in cognitive impairment.</description>

    <description>The CM-SS is a tool, designed according to the Guiding Principles of Clinical Research on New Drugs of Traditional Chinese Medicine issued in 2002, to evaluate the effects of treatments on Traditional Chinese medicine patterns (here refers to kidney deficiency pattern). Scoring is mainly based on some typical TCM symptoms, such as tongue coating and pulse.</description>
