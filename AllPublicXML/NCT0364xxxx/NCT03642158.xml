  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel and promising therapy for cognitive dysfunction is non-invasive brain stimulation, of
      which transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a form. TMS is currently FDA-approved for
      use in depression and migraine. It is under investigation for use in a number of other
      neurologic and psychiatric disorders. In addition to its potential to improve affective
      symptoms, recent research has suggested that TMS targeted to select cortical regions can also
      improve cognition. In trials of TMS therapy for psychiatric disorders, several studies have
      shown benefits for cognitive function alongside symptom amelioration. In healthy persons, a
      course of stimulation of the parietal area improved objective measures of learning and
      memory. Among persons with TBI, there have been case reports supporting improvement in
      cognitive function and postconcussive symptoms; however, there have not yet been any
      controlled studies of TMS for TBI-related cognitive dysfunction.

      Subjects with a history of TBI will be recruited into this double-blind, sham controlled,
      crossover with washout study design. Study will involve one week (5 consecutive days) of
      treatment, a 7 day off period, followed by a second week of rTMS treatment. Motor threshold
      will determine level of stimulation, and active rTMS stimulation will occur of the right
      DLPFC. Subjects will be paid for their time.

    <description>Subjects receive rTMS over the right DLPFC, in 2 second bursts at 10 Hz, followed by a 19 second break, for a total of 20 minutes. Stimulator intensity is set to 80% of motor threshold on day one, and 100% of motor threshold for the remainder of intervention. This paradigm is continued for 5 consecutive days.</description>
