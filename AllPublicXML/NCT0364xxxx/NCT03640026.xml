  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes after kidney transplantation is a frequent complication, the incidence of which
      varies from 7 to 45% depending on the studies and on the diagnostic criteria used.
      Post-transplant diabetes is an early complication, most often occurring in the first month
      after transplantation.

      In addition to the additional health costs generated by the appearance of post-transplant
      diabetes, the risk of graft loss is increased by 60% and the overall mortality risk by 90%.
      Similarly, the development of glucose intolerance after transplantation is associated with
      higher mortality.

      Tacrolimus treatment is therefore currently one of the most important risk factors for
      diabetes at the time of transplantation.

      Indeed, several in vitro and in vivo animal studies have shown that tacrolimus alters
      pancreatic endocrine function.

      In the final stage, this cellular toxicity leads to diabetes, most often diagnosed on the
      rise in capillary or venous blood sugar levels after transplantation. This diabetes often
      requires hypoglycemic treatment with insulin or oral anti-diabetic drugs. for a variable
      period. The pro-diabetogenic effect of tacrolimus is sometimes irreversible, justifying
      preventive treatment.

      No clinical studies have looked at &quot;sub-clinical&quot; changes in insulin secretion or insulin
      resistance under tacrolimus prior to the onset of diabetes. The static indices HOMA-β% and
      HOMA-IR (Homeostasis Model Accessment of insulin resistance) make it possible to estimate
      insulin secretion and insulin resistance in fasting patients respectively, while the oral
      glucose disposition index (IDO) makes it possible to study insulin secretion and action
      dynamically (after a 75 g glucose load), and are calculated as follows:

      HOMA IR= Fasting blood glucose (mmol/L) x Fasting insulin (mU/L)/ 22.5 HOMAβ% = 20 x fasting
      insulinemia (mU/L) / fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) - 3.5 IDO = (delta insulinemia T30-T0/
      delta blood glucose T30-T0)/insulinemia T0

      These indices have already been studied in dialysis patients (diabetic and non-diabetic) and
      may allow a more detailed study of pancreatic response and insulin resistance under
      tacrolimus in patients prior to renal transplantation. Determining the &quot;pancreatic response&quot;
      to tacrolimus in patients prior to transplantation would prevent diabetes by adapting
      immunosuppressive treatment and post-transplant screening modalities in the event of
      pre-transplant subclinical abnormalities identified in our study. The development of
      tacrolimus-induced diabetes in pre-transplantation in our study will be a contraindication to
      tacrolimus at the time of transplantation and ciclosporin therapy will be preferred.
