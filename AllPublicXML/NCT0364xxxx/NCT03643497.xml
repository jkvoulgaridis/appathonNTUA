  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is based on the hypothesis that the pharmacokinetics of meropenem and linezolid in
      severe infectious children are different from mild infectious children and adults. The
      investigators aim to study the population pharmacokinetics of children receiving the
      meropenem and linezolid for treatment of severe infectious diseases. In this study, the
      investigators will detect drug concentration in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid by using
      residual blood samples of blood and cerebrospinal fluid gas analysis and other clinical tests
      and employ computers for constructing population pharmacokinetic models. In addition, the
      investigators also want to correlate use of meropenem and linezolid with treatment
      effectiveness and incidence of adverse effects in children. This novel knowledge will allow
      better and more rational approaches to the treatment of severe infectious diseases in
      children. It will also set the foundation for further studies to improve anti- infective drug
      therapies for severe infectious children.

      1.Establish population pharmacokinetic (PPK) models of meropenem and linezolid in severe
      infectious children by nonlinear mixed effect modeling (NONMEM).

        1. At different time point after meropenem or linezolid administration, plasma and/or
           cerebrospinal fluid samples of 100 children will be collected from pediatric intensive
           care unit (PICU) for each drug. The clinical information includes demography,
           medication, concentration data, blood biochemical parameters and so on.

        2. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid samples will be tested by high performance liquid
           chromatography (HPLC).

        3. PPK models of meropenem and linezolid will be established by NONMEM program.

        4. The reliability and stability of the PPK model will be evaluated by 1000 times of
           Bootstrap procedure and normalized predictive distribution error(NPDE).

      2. Evaluation of the clinical feasibility and safety of individualized dosing.

        1. According the results of PPK models, the investigators will use dosages recommended in
           models to cure severe infectious children in prospective studies. For antibiotic drug,
           50 children will be collected.

        2. The investigators will compare the therapeutic effects and safety between children with
           conventional therapies and children with individualized therapies in severe infectious
           diseases, including proportions of children with effective drug concentration,
           improvement speed of children, liver and kidney functions of children, adverse reactions
           of drugs and so on
