  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the possible therapeutic effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation(rTMS) in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in OCD patients who have not fully
      responded to pharmacotherapy, and the underlying neural mechanism by EEG.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of study is to examine the efficacy of rTMS over different brain areas, including
      the bilateral supplement motor Area (SMA), the right dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
      and SMA+DLPFC in the treatment of OCD. 120 OCD patients will be randomized into four groups.
      Continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) stimulation will be performed once a day, five
      times a week, for four weeks. The investigators will assess improvement after four weeks of
      cTBS. Though the study, Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale（Y-BOCS）, the Dimensional
      Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (DY-BOCS), the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11),
      the Beck Depression Inventory-II(BDI-II), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Perceived Stress
      Scale(PSS), Pittsburgh sleep quality index(PSQI), the Obsessive-Compulsive
      Inventory-Revised(OCI-R) and side effects will be obtained by a trained investigator. The
      patients will also receive magnetic resonance imaging scan and electroencephalography (EEG).
