      Background:

      The autonomic nervous system controls automatic body functions. Researchers want to improve
      the tests used to diagnose autonomic failure. Orthostatic hypertension is a drop in blood
      pressure when a person stands up. Researchers want to focus on this sign of autonomic
      failure.

      Objective:

      To improve testing for conditions that cause autonomic nervous system failure.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older in one of these categories:

        -  Their blood pressure drops when they get up.

        -  They have had a heart transplant or bilateral endoscopic thoracic sympathectomies or
           have had or will have renal sympathetic ablation

      Design:

      All participants will be screened with:

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Blood and urine tests

      Some participants will be screened with:

        -  Heart and breathing tests

        -  IV placement into an arm vein

        -  Tilt table testing: Participants lie on a table that tilts while an IV is used to draw
           their blood.

      Participants may stay in the hospital for up to 1 week depending on their tests. Tests may
      include repeats of screening tests and:

        -  Sweat testing: A drug is placed on the skin to cause sweating. Sensors on the skin
           measure moisture.

        -  Lumbar puncture: A needle is inserted between the bones in the back to collect fluid.

        -  MRI and PET/CT scan: Participants lie on a table that slides into a scanner. For the
           PET/CT, a small amount of a radioactive chemical will be injected with a small amount of
           a radioactive chemical.

        -  Bladder catheter placement to collect urine

        -  Skin biopsies: A punch tool removes a small skin sample.

        -  Tests to see how the pupils react to light

        -  Smelling tests

        -  Thinking and memory tests

        -  Questionnaires

      Participants may have a visit about 2 years later to repeat tests.

      Objective:

      In dysautonomias, altered functions of one or more components of the autonomic nervous system
      adversely affect health. A subset of dysautonomias consists of chronic autonomic failure
      (CAF) syndromes. A key sign of CAF is orthostatic hypotension (OH) due to sympathetic
      neurocirculatory failure (neurognic OH, or nOH). Primary CAF has been classified based on
      clinical manifestations into three forms-pure autonomic failure (PAF), multiple system
      atrophy (MSA), and Parkinson s disease with OH (PD+OH). All three forms involve deposition of
      the protein, alpha-synuclein (AS), in neurons (PD, PAF) or glial cells (MSA) and therefore
      are called autonomic synucleinopathies. Clinical assessment alone often is inadequate for
      distinguishing among these conditions in individual patients. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)
      is another form of autonomic synucleinopathy. This observational study continues and expands
      on Protocol 03-N-0004, Clinical Laboratory Evaluation of Primary Chronic Autonomic Failure.
      The objective is to conduct multi-modality testing of catecholaminergic and autonomic systems
      in patients with neurodegenerative chronic

      autonomic failure (CAF). The goals are to: (a) build up rosters of well characterized
      patients for future experimental therapeutic trials; (b) test predictions derived from the
      catecholaldehyde hypothesis for the pathogenesis of autonomic synucleinopathies; (c) follow
      the natural history of neurodegenerative chronic autonomic failure (CAF); and (d) discover
      new clinical entities involving catecholaminergic neurodegeneration.

      Study Population:

      The study population consists of patients with neurodegenerative chronic autonomic failure
      (neurodegenerative CAF) identified by on site screening at the NIH Clinical Center.
      Comparison groups include a group on control patients with iatrogenic CAF (e.g., status-post
      cardiac transplantation, pre/post renal sympathetic ablation, pre/post bilateral thoracic
      sympathectomies) or PD and without OH (PD No OH), and a group of Healthy Volunteers (HVs),
      some of whom have genetic abnormalities known to increase the risk of developing PD. A group
      of MSA patients is included, to build up a subject roster for a planned clinical trial.

      Design:

      This is an observational pathophysiology/natural history study with a planned duration of 3
      years. Descriptive statistics will be done in diagnostic groups with neurodegenerative CAF.

      Outcome Measures:

      The primary outcome measure is results of clinical laboratory research tests in
      neurodegenerative CAF patients. Neuroimaging data are from MRI and from 18F-DOPA and
      18F-dopamine PET scanning. Neurochemical data are from assays of catechols in plasma and
      cerebrospinal fluid. Immunofluorescence microscopy data are from analyses of immunoreactive
      tyrosine hydroxylase and AS in skin biopsy samples. Neurobehavioral rating scale data are
      from the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), Montreal Cognitive
      Assessment (MoCA), and Uniform Parkinson s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Correlation analyses
      will be done among individual values for outcome measures. A secondary outcome measure is
      estimated extraneuronal binding of 11C-methylreboxetine, based on studies of patients with
      iatrogenic CAF and desipraminetreated HVs.

        -  INCLUSION CRITIERIA:

        Inclusion Critieria: Patients referred for orthostatic hypotension. This is the main
        subject cohort.

          -  Previously studied and diagnosed with one of the forms of nOH or else newly accrued
             with a referral diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension, and

          -  18 years or older, and

          -  Able to provide own consent to participate or have an existing Legally Authorized
             Representative (LAR).

        If a patient has already been diagnosed as having neurodegenerative CAF under NIH Clinical
        Protocol 03-N-0004, this satisfies the inclusion criteria for that patient. Previous
        enrollment in NIH Clinical Protocol 03-N-0004 is not required for enrollment in this study.
        We do plan to recruit participation intothis study from NIH Clinical Protocol 03-N-0004
        which has been closed.

        If a patient has been referred for OH, then the patient gives consent at the NIH Clinical
        Center (and therefore is accrued) and then has screening testing at the NIH Clinical Center
        to confirm that the OH is neurogenic. We anticipate that all patients referred for OH will
        be shown to have nOH upon screening testing at the NIH Clinical Center. At the time of
        screening, exclusionary abnormal laboratory test results (e.g., high serum creatinine
        indicating renal failure) may come to light, in which case they will be withdrawn from the
        study; however, the patient would have been accrued.

        Inclusion criteria: Control patients with iatrogenic CAF

          -  Patients with heart transplants, pre or post bilateral endoscopic thoracic
             sympathectomies, or pre or post-renal sympathetic ablation, and

          -  18 years or older, and

          -  Able to provide own consent to participate.

        Inclusion criteria: Cotrol patients with PD No OH:

        -Patients with PD and no OH who have (a) already been evaluated under other protocols of
        the AMS and are undergoing follow-up; (b) have already been evaluated under another
        intramural NINDS protocol; or (c) have cardiac symptoms, signs, or laboratory findings that
        in the opinion of the PI make it likely there is a cardiac

        sympathetic lesion, and

          -  18 years or older, and

          -  Able to provide own consent to participate.

        Inclusion criteria: Healthy Volunteers:

          -  Age 18 years or older and

          -  Able to provide own informed consent to participate

        NIH employees may participate. There is no direct solicitation of employees/staff by
        supervisors. Co-workers will not solicit co-workers. NIH employees are required to abide by
        NIH Policy Manual 2300-630-3, Leave Policy for NIH Employees Participating in

        NIH Medical Research Studies.

             heart failure, severe anemia, psychosis, refractory ventricular arrhythmias, currently

          -  Being treated currently (within 2 weeks of anticipated protocol participation) with a
             medication known to interfere with the cell membrane norepinephrine transporter, which
