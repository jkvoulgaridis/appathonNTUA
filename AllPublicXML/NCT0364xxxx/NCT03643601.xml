  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to describe renal anemia treatment patterns in
      non-dialysis dependent (ND) and dialysis dependent (DD) populations, with a particular focus
      on iron use in erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) treated patients.

      This study will also provide an epidemiological description of chronic kidney disease (CKD)
      associated anemia in relation to CKD stage, dialysis modality and underlying morbidity, as
      well as describe the relationship between inflammation and ESA treatment and describe the
      associated cardiovascular illness in ESA treated patients.

      Data from year 2015 will be used for the prevalence analysis.The prevalent population of CKD
      patients &gt; 18 years in the Swedish Renal Registry in 2015 both dependent on dialysis (DD) and
      not on dialysis (ND).
