  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, 2 parallel arms clinical trial. All patients will be
      PDE5I users/responders. After 1 month wash-out period, ED patients will be screened, in order
      to randomize 50 men with vasculogenic ED with primary objective to examine the efficacy of
      LiST using Aries2 device.
