  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study will define the bioavailability and short term pharmacokinetics of the principal
      secondary metabolites of a aqueous-ethanolic extract of H. procumbens in non-enteric and
      enteric capsules.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study(n = 12) will use a one-dose design to measure bioavailability and pharmacokinetic
      properties of an aqueous extract of H. procumbens containing 100mg harpagoside. Plasma levels
      of harpagoside, harpagide, verbascoside, and 8-p-coumarylharpagide will be measured for 24
      hours with blood collections taken at timed intervals.
