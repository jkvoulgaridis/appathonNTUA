  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers already did trials that showed Sorafenib and Regorafenib worked for patients with
      hepatocellular carcinoma (most common liver tumor type).

      In this trial, they want to learn more about the same patient group in which Sorafenib or
      Regorafenib is given after other drugs. Patients participating in this study will be observed
      until 12 months after the last patient has been enrolled to collect data on how safe the
      drugs are and how well they are working when used as second line or beyond treatment.

        The study population will consist of patients with HCC in stage BCLC-B (Barcelona
        Classification of Liver Cancer) or BCLC-C for whom the decision to treat with Nexavar
        and/or Stivarga as ≥ 2nd-line has been taken by the investigator and the drugs are
        prescribed in the customary manner in accordance with the terms of the marketing
        authorization.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of hepatocellular cancer in stage BCLC-B or BCLC-C

          -  Decision to initiate treatment with Nexavar (sorafenib) and/or Stivarga (regorafenib)
             as 2nd-line or beyond treatment was made as per investigator's routine treatment
             practice. Stivarga (regorafenib) must be used according to its indication, i.e. after
             prior progression under Nexavar (sorafenib) treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients concurrently participating in an investigational program for the treatment of
             HCC with interventions outside of routine clinical practice.

          -  Stivarga (regorafenib) treatment without prior therapy with Nexavar (sorafenib). NOTE:
             Nexavar (sorafenib) treatment could have been given as treatment for HCC outside of
             this non-interventional study. In this case Stivarga (regorafenib) would NOT
             constitute the second-line therapy after direct pretreatment with Nexavar (sorafenib)
             but e.g. 3rd-line treatment directly after a different drug.

          -  Contra-indications according to the local marketing authorization.

    <ipd_description>Availability of this study's data will be determined according to Bayer's commitment to the EFPIA/PhRMA &quot;Principles for responsible clinical trial data sharing&quot;. This pertains to scope, timepoint and process of data access.
As such, Bayer commits to sharing upon request from qualified researchers patient-level clinical trial data, study-level clinical trial data, and protocols from clinical trials in patients for medicines and indications approved in the US and EU as necessary for conducting legitimate research. This applies to data on new medicines and indications that have been approved by the EU and US regulatory agencies on or after January 01, 2014.
Interested researchers can use www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com to request access to anonymized patient-level data and supporting documents from clinical studies to conduct research.
