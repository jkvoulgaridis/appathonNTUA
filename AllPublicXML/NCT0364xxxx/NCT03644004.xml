  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus, type 2, is a chronic disease which can be linked with many complications
      in connexion with impaired blood glucose balance.

      It diagnosis in risky subjects such as in patients with medical history of gestational
      diabetes is therefore imperative to prevent its complications.

      Actual guidelines recommend an oral tolerance glucose test, measuring glucose levels after
      oral glucose intake (75g), between 6 an 12 weeks after childbirth. But studies reveal a low
      diagnosis rate.

      The study of the current practices of diagnosis methods seem to be essential in order to
      improve this diagnosis.

    <description>Patients will be contacted by mail with sending of the information notice to ask them to participate in the study.
If they don't reply, the subjects will be called by phone by the investigator to collect their non opposition of participation at the study.
During this call, the investigator will be able to answer all the questions about the study.
The report of this telephone conversation will be register in the medical file of the patient.
Then, we will collect informatic data from the hospital concerning the patients.
After that they will be contacted by phone to answer a survey. Beside, another secure survey will be send by email to each patient's family doctor.
To finish, crossing data between those of the patients and the family doctor and anonymisation of the data.</description>
