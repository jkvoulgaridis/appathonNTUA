  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Childhood Healthy Weights Early Intervention Program (EIP) is a family-based pilot
      program that will promote healthy lifestyle practices for families whose children are off the
      healthy weight trajectory (e.g., BMI ≥ 85th percentile for age and sex) that do not need the
      intensive services of medically supervised programs. It is a lifestyle behaviour approach for
      promoting healthy weights in children. The EIP program consists of 10 weekly intervention
      sessions (1.5 hours per session) followed by 4 maintenance sessions and is age specific (age
      8-12). During the intervention, participants will also have access to digital educational
      content that is supplementary to what is provided during the individual sessions. The program
      will be integrated and aligned with existing BC-specific childhood healthy weights programs
      (e.g. the HealthLinkBC Eating and Activity Program for Kids). The EIP pilot will run from
      October-December 2018 with 8 child programs (age 8-12). Participants who do not qualify for
      this program (e.g., BMI ≤ 85th percentile for age and sex) will be offered a 10 week online
      program which is similar in educational content as the EIP program.
