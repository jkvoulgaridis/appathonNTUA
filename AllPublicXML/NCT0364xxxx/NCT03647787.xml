  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate differential plastic changes of fractional
      anisotropy (FA) in the corticospinal tract (CST), the intrahemispheric corticocortical tract
      from the primary motor cortex to ventral premotor cortex (M1PMv) and the corpus callosum (CC)
      from 2 weeks to 3 months after stroke according to BDNF genotype.

      The aims of this study were to investigate plastic changes in the fractional anisotropy (FA)
      of three motor-related white matter fibers according to the BDNF genotype from 2 weeks to 3
      months after stroke onset; one is a the majority of fibers from M1 to medullary oblongata
      (CST), another is the intrahemispheric connection from M1 to ventral premotor cortex (M1PMv),
      and the other is the interhemispheric connection between bilateral M1s (CC). There were also
      to investigate the relationships between motor impairment and tract-related FA of white
      matter tracts in each BDNF genotype
