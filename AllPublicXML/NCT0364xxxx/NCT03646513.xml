  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single arm, sequential enrolment study to collect relevant clinical
      and radiological data in approximately 26 subjects, at one site in Australia, who have been
      implanted with the SMF Short Modular Femoral Stem Hip System in a primary THA procedure to
      assess its safety and efficacy up to 20 years post-surgery.

    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, consecutive series study to collect relevant clinical, laboratory and
      radiological data in up to 26 subjects, who have been implanted with the SMF Short Modular
      Femoral Stem THA system at 1 site in Australia.

      The Baseline visit will be determined as the first visit to site after Ethics approval. This
      will be approximately 8-9 years post implant. Enrolled subjects will be followed up to 20
      years post SMF implant.

      Eligible patients will be contacted and patient status and implant revision status will be
      assessed at this initial contact. The subject will be given the option to participate in a
      prospective 12 year on-site follow-up visits for which they will provide written informed
      consent. Subjects who are lost to follow-up, deceased or are unwilling/unable to participate
      in the prospective study will be noted in the subject files and this data will be captured
      for analysis of study results. Data will be collected on the operative date, and implant
      status.

      Post Baseline, the study will allow for metal ion assessments every 3 years for asymptomatic
      subjects and annual assessments for subjects with pain, swelling, and/or functional
      limitations if assessed by the Principal Investigator to be related to the SMF implant,
      having ruled out all other probable causes for the subject. If the subject has elevated whole
      blood cobalt or chromium (defined as &gt;7ppb) a MARS MRI or CT will be obtained. These types of
      imaging techniques are aimed at detecting inflammatory degenerative evolution of peri
      articular soft tissues including pseudo-tumours. A functional Questionnaire, HOOS JR
      Questionnaire will be completed at all patient site visits.

      Safety will be evaluated by assessing the frequency and nature of adverse events, serious
      adverse events and revisions.

    <time_frame>From date of first study visit at Baseline until a 12 year period of safety assessments.</time_frame>
    <description>All subjects at Baseline and every three years afterwards will have whole blood collected for metal ion testing of whole blood cobalt and chromium. Symptomatic subjects with pain, swelling, and/or functional limitations if assessed by the PI to be related to the implant will have whole blood collected for metal ion testing of cobalt and chromium annually.</description>

    <description>Subjects with whole blood cobalt and/or chromium &gt; 7 ppb will have MARS MRI (or CT if MRI is contraindicated) performed. This is used to detect pseudotumors, abductor muscle atrophy, and tendinous pathology in patients with painful metal-on-metal (MOM) hip arthroplasty.</description>

    <description>Loosening as indicated by radiolucencies &gt; 2mm. In a cemented arthroplasty, this lucency at the bone-cement interface indicates the formation of a fibrous membrane (representing the lucency). Periprosthetic lucencies wider than 2 mm and/or progressive lucencies are signs of abnormality.</description>

    <measure>HOOS JR Questionnaire</measure>

    <description>The HOOS JR. questionnaire consists of 6 questions. These focus on 3 categories: joint pain, stiffness and function in daily living. The HOOS JR. questionnaire, allows patients to rate each activity by indicating the amount of pain or disability they experience while carrying them out. Raw scores are added up and then converted to an interval score (0-100) using an interval table. The final interval score represents a patients total joint disability where 0 corresponds to total joint disability and 100 is perfect joint health.</description>
