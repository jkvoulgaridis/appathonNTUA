  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the correlation between pulmonary microbiota dynamics
      (including bacteria, fungi and viruses) and COPD exacerbation for COPD patients admitted to
      ICU
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a frequent cause of ICU admission. COPD
      exacerbations are a leading cause of lung function worsening and of morbimortality.
      Hospitalizations due to COPD exacerbations are highly expensive for health insurance system.
      Bacterial pulmonary microbiota has been shown to be correlated to the severity of COPD and to
      exacerbations. Nevertheless fungi and viruses which are full actors of pulmonary microbiota
      have not yet been investigated.

      Our primary outcome will be the assessment of alpha and beta diversity dynamics of the whole
      pulmonary microbiota (bacteria, fungi and viruses) between COPD exacerbation and steady
      state.

      This study will prospectively include 24 patients at ICU admission for COPD exacerbation with
      sputum sampling. Steady-state as defined during a 2 months-later visit will be studied with
      another sputum collection.
