  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to recent estimates by the World Health Organization (WHO) on eastern Africa, not
      all visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases reported are confirmed by a laboratory test, probably
      due to limited access to accurate diagnostic tests and poor reporting. The main approach for
      VL diagnosis involves antibody detection using the rK39 rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and
      alternatively the direct agglutination test (DAT) to confirm clinically suspected cases.
      Suspected cases with negative rK39 RDT and/or DAT results are referred to facilities where
      examination of tissue aspirate (spleen, bone marrow, lymph node) by microscopy is available.
      Unfortunately, the diagnostic performance of rK39 in eastern Africa is suboptimal,
      particularly in settings with a high VL/HIV co-infection rate. A recently developed RDT,
      based on the recombinant antigen rK28, may overcome this problem, with studies reporting
      better performance than the rK39. However, data are not definitive, as studies comparing rK28
      RDTs with rK39 RDT are limited. Another recently developed RDT detects immunoglobulin G1
      (IgG1) specific to Leishmania and has shown promising results in the Indian subcontinent.
      This study aims to undertake a multi-country assessment of the performance of rK28 and IgG1
      RDTs, as compared to the currently used rK39 RDT.

      Primary objective and endpoint: To evaluate the performance of different diagnostic tests in
      detecting anti-Leishmania antibodies to improve early diagnosis of VL in eastern Africa, in
      particular Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda and Kenya. Evaluation of the diagnostic performance of the
      RDTs for primary VL diagnosis based on estimates of sensitivity, specificity, positive and
      negative predictive values, as well as the degree of agreement between tests.

      Design: Prospective single arm diagnostic accuracy study. Multicountry. With participants
      being suspected cases of VL
