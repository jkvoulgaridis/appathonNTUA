  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 3 study is designed to test the effectiveness of intranasal carbetocin (LV-101) in
      participants with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Carbetocin is an oxytocin analog (a man-made
      chemical that is like oxytocin). This study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      LV-101.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind study with an 8-week, placebo-controlled period
      designed to test the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of LV-101 in participants with
      PWS.

      Effectiveness will be measured using both caregiver-reported and clinician-reported measures
      of hyperphagia (extreme hunger), obsessive and compulsive behaviors, and anxiety. Safety and
      tolerability will be measured by adverse events, laboratory tests, and physical exams.

      After the 8-week placebo-controlled period, there will be a long-term follow-up period of 56
      weeks and an optional extension period after study week 64 during which all participants will
      receive active treatment with LV-101. At Week 8, participants who were randomized to placebo
      in the placebo-controlled period will be randomized to one of the two LV-101 doses,
      administered three times per day before meals.
