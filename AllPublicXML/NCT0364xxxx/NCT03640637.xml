  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the utility of PET/MRI in diagnosis and management of
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children and adolescents, hereby

        -  To test if PET/MRI scan is an accurate method to diagnose and differentiate Crohn's
           disease and Ulcerous Colitis in children and adolescents suspected of IBD.

        -  To evaluate whether PET/MRI scan in children and adolescents with Crohn's disease is an
           accurate method to diagnose relapses and to monitor the effect of biological treatment
           with monoclonal antibodies directed towards Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha.

    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease and Ulcerous Colitis constitute the primary inflammatory bowel diseases.
      Crohn's disease can affect any part of the digestive tract, from mouth to anus, and
      inflammation can be present in all layers of the intestinal wall. Ulcerous Colitis is
      primarily located in the inner layer of the colonic bowel wall.

      In the pediatric population, current diagnostic strategies involve blood tests, fecal
      sampling (calprotectin), magnetic resonans (MRI) scan and both upper and lower endoscopies.
      In this population endoscopy requires general anesthesia and involves the risk of bowel wall
      perforation.

      A known method of identifying inflammation is by Positron Emission Tomography (PET). In this
      procedure a radioactively labelled sugar molecule is injected into the blood stream via a
      venous catheter. The inflammatory cells take op relatively more of the sugar, compared to
      normal cells, and the cells are visible on the scan. Until now the anatomic localization of
      the inflammation has been poor but recently is has become possible to combine the MRI scan
      with PET resulting in excellent localization, with minimal radiation exposure (corresponding
      to 1 year background radiation in Denmark).

      To make diagnosis and identification of inflammation flares during treatment safer for
      children and adolescents we aim to investigate whether PET/MRI is accurate in diagnosing IBD
      in children and adolescents and in diagnosing flares in children with Crohn's disease.

    <description>PET/MRI will be compared to standard evaluation: Clinical symptom scoring systems (for Crohns disease: wPCDAI, for Ulcerous colitis: PUCAI), faecal calprotectin, C-reactive protein and endoscopy with histology.
Endoscopy will be used for gold reference. PET/MRI scans will be analysed for PET uptake values pr. bowel segment for each patient and compared to standard evaluation results.</description>

    <description>A prospective study of 50 pediatric patients suspected of IBD. Participants will undergo routine diagnostic procedures for evaluation of pediatric IBD including blood samples, faecal samples, endoscopies (colonoscopy and gastroscopy with biopsy/histology) and MRI of the abdomen. In addition, a PET scan will be performed in this protocol and combined with MRI. For accuracy measures, PET/MRI scan will be compared to the combined findings of endoscopy, histology and severity of inflammation by clinical scoring systems (weighted Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (wPCDAI) for CD and Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis activity Index (PUCAI) for CU), faecal calprotectin and biochemistry.</description>

    <description>A pilot study of 10-15 patients previously diagnosed with CD who will undergo PET/MRI scan as an investigational procedure before initiation of biological treatment with an anti-TNF-alpha antibody (infliximab, adalimumab) because of disease relapse or steroid dependent disease. Patients will be scheduled for a PET/MRI again after one month. This study will evaluate if PET/MRI can diagnose a flare in CD and if PET/MRI is a reliable imaging tool to monitor intestinal inflammation. In this study the patient will act as his/her own control.</description>
