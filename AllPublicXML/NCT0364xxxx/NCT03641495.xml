  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia syndrome is characterized by chronic generalized musculoskeletal pain associated
      with fatigue, sleep disturbances and psychological problems. The European League Againts
      Rheumatism (EULAR) described an algorithm how to treat step by step these patients.

      The objective of this trial is to evaluate if patient education plus therapeutic exercise is
      more effective in pain intensity, fatigue, function, strength, pain threshold, anxiety,
      depression, quality of life, quality of sleep, kinesiophobia, pain coping and biochemical and
      genetic markers and compared to therapeutic exercise.

      For this purpose the investigators conduct a randomized controlled trial double-blind
      (patient and examiner). The investigators included patients diagnosed of fibromyalgia
      according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR).

      Patients included are randomized into 2 groups one receive education of pain neurophysiology
      plus exercise therapy and the other only exercise therapy. Groups receive 3 treatment
      sessions a week over 10 weeks.

      The variables are measured at the beginning and end of treatment. And also some variables are
      measured before and after each session.
