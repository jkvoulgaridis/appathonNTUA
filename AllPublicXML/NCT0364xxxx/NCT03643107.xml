      The study seek to evaluate the anti-tumor effect after treatment of Irofulven in combination
      with prednisolone in patients who progressed on androgen receptor(AR)-targeted therapy and
      Docetaxel-Pretreated Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients. A drug
      response predictor (DRP®) biomarker in prostate cancer patients will identify patients likely
      to respond to and benefit from treatment with Irofulven.
