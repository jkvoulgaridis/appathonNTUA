      Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) plays an important role in the innate immune response. In
      addition to activating the complement, MBL can induce cytokine production and contribute to a
      deleterious inflammatory response with severe A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection. The aim was to
      determine if serum MBL levels correlate with the risk of mortality in intensive care units
      (ICU) patients with A(H1N1)pdm09 infection.

      Prospective observational study was performed in ICU patients with acute respiratory distress
      syndrome due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Demographic characteristics and severity
      indices were recorded at ICU admission. MBL was assayed from blood drawn at influenza
      diagnosis within 24-48 h following the ICU admission. Outcomes were compared according to MBL
      levels.

      (ICU) patients with A(H1N1)pdm09 infection.

      Prospective observational study was performed in ICU patients with acute respiratory distress
      syndrome due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Demographic and clinical data at admission and
      during the ICU stay were recorded from the medical files of each patient and collected in a
      database to evaluate variables potentially associated with in-hospital mortality. Data
      baselines were recorded at admission. Mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation (ECMO) requirements, and the use of vasopressor drugs were noted during ICU stay.
      To determine illness severity, SAPSII and SOFA scoring systems were applied to all patients
      within 24 h of ICU admission.Demographic characteristics and severity indices were recorded
      at ICU admission. MBL was assayed from blood drawn at influenza diagnosis within 24-48 h
      following the ICU admission. Outcomes were compared according to MBL levels.

    <measure>Levels of serum MBL are associated with mortality in critically ill patients with severe A(H1N1)pdm09 viral pneumonia.</measure>
    <time_frame>7days</time_frame>
    <description>The aim of the present study was to determine whether levels of serum MBL are associated with mortality in critically ill patients with severe A(H1N1)pdm09 viral pneumonia. When a patient met criteria for ARDS, the closest residual blood sample taken on the same day was obtained from the central hospital laboratory in the 24-48 h following the intubation or in the acute phase of the viral infection. MBL serum concentrations were assayed by an Oligomer ELISA kit (BioPorto) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Results are expressed as median [interquartile range (IQR)] or number (percent). Survivors were compared with nonsurvivors using the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables and Chi2 test for categorical variables with Yates' correction or Fisher's exact test if necessary. A correlation was searched between MBL and inflammatory parameters using spearman test.</description>

        Any patient according to the present invention, has self optimized by a medical report:
        sedation, curarization, protective ventilation and adapted PEEP, under and without
        treatment with BAL and blood samples on the dry tube and EDTA in its care can be included
        in our study.

        At the time of the diagnosis of ARDS, and during the aetiological assessment, one can
        highlight a blood sample, samples of tubes for the assays of the inflammation.
