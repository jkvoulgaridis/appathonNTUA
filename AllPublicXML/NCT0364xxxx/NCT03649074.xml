      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of combining AKL-T01 (with AKL-X01
      symptom tracking) as adjunctive treatment to stimulant medication, and to understand the
      effects of AKL-T01 treatment (with AKL-X01 symptom tracking) in participants not recently on
      medication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to enroll (203) participants, with a confirmed diagnoses of ADHD, at
      approximately 15 sites and will be divided between 2 cohorts; 130 participants will be
      enrolled in Cohort 1, and 73 participants will be enrolled in Cohort 2.

      Cohort 1 will have been stable (adherence to a prescribed medication schedule) on a stimulant
      medication, but are inadequately managed by the stimulant (in the opinion of the
      investigator). The stimulant is managed by their own physician for at least 30 days before
      baseline. This is the Stimulant cohort.

      Cohort 2 will have been stable without any stimulant medication for at least 30 days before
      the baseline. This is the Non-Stimulant cohort.

      For both cohorts, at least 7 and up to 30 days before baseline, participants' caretakers will
      begin using AKL-X01 (Fengo) to track their participants' symptoms and behaviors.

      During Treatment Phase 1 (Days 1 through 28) participants in Cohort 1 (Stimulant) will
      continue to receive their current stimulant plus the addition of AKL-T01. Participants in
      Cohort 2 (Non-Stimulant) will just receive AKL-T01. For both cohorts, during this time the
      caretakers will monitor their child's symptoms daily with AKL-X01.

      During the 1-Month Break (Days 29 through 56) between AKL-T01 treatment phases, participants
      in Cohort 1 will continue to receive their current stimulant. In both cohorts, AKL-T01 will
      be suspended during this time. For both cohorts, during this time caretakers will continue to
      monitor their child's symptoms daily with AKL-X01.

      During Treatment Phase 2 (Days 57 through 84), participants in Cohort 1 (stimulant) will
      continue to receive their current stimulant plus the addition of AKL-T01. Participants in
      Cohort 2 will just receive AKL-T01. For both cohorts, during this time the caretakers will
      monitor their child's symptoms daily with AKL-X01.

    <description>The Impairment Rating Scale (IRS) is an 8-item scale used to measure functioning across 7 different domains including a child's life in school and non-school settings. The scale is administered to a parent by a clinician. Each item is rated on a 7-point scale from 0-6 with 0 indicating no impairment is present to 6 extreme impairment is present. The last question, question 8, is a rating of the severity of a child's functioning overall.</description>

    <description>The ADHD-Rating Scale is an 18-item scale assessing the frequency of each ADHD symptom based on DSM-IV criteria. The scale consists of 2 subscales: inattention (9 items) and hyperactivity-impulsivity (9 items). Scoring is based on a 4-point Likert-type severity scale: 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe. The sum of the scores of each of the 18 items comprises the total score.</description>

    <measure>Change TOVA Attention Composite Score (ACS); Cohort 1: Stimulant</measure>
    <time_frame>Study Day 0 to Study Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>TOVA ACS is a comparison of the subject's scores based on selected measures that persons with an independent diagnosis of ADHD frequently demonstrated. ACS is calculated from variability, response time (RT), and d' Prime using the following formula: ACS = RT Z score (Half 1) + D' Z score (Half 2) + variability Z score (Total) + 1.80 where RT is the average time it takes to respond correctly to a target, D' score is a response discriminability score reflecting the ratio of &quot;hits&quot; to &quot;false alarms&quot;, and variability is a measure of consistency of speed of responding based on the standard deviation of the mean correct response times. ACS tells how similar the score is to the ADHD profile. A score of less than -1.8 indicates that the subject had similar performance to a normative ADHD population. A lower score indicates a more severe ADHD profile. The calculation for difference in TOVA ACS is ACS at Baseline (Day 0) minus ACS at Day 28.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, ages 8 years 0 months to 14 years 9 months (inclusive), at the time of
             parental informed consent.

          2. Confirmed ADHD diagnosis (primarily inattentive or combined subtype), at Screening
             based on DSM-V criteria and established via the MINI-KID administered by a trained
             clinician.

             Note: Co-morbid diagnoses on the MINI-KID are acceptable provided that ADHD is the
             primary diagnosis and the co-morbid diagnoses will not confound study data (per the
             Investigator's judgment).

          3. Currently experiencing sub-optimal treatment of ADHD, based upon results of Clinical
             Global Impression-Severity score.

          4. Impairment Rating Scale (Parent Report) score of ≥ 3 at Screening.

          5. Ability to follow written and verbal instructions (English), as assessed by the PI
             and/or study coordinator.

          6. Estimated IQ score &gt; 80 as assessed by the Kaufmann Brief Intelligence Test, Second
             Edition (KBIT-II).

               -  Moderate response on stimulant, but still room for improvement

               -  Dose unchanged within past 30 days, but other doses have been tried previously

             Participants with clinical history of learning disorders will be allowed to
             participate, provided the disorder does not impact their ability to participate in the
             trial based on PI judgment.

          2. Participants who are currently treated with a non-stimulant medication for ADHD (i.e.,

             the MINI-KID interview.

             ADHD treatment.

          5. Initiation within the last 4 weeks from the time of consent of behavioral therapy.
             Participants who have been in behavior therapy consistently for more than 4 weeks may
             participate provided their therapy frequency and intensity is unchanged during the
             course of the study. Participants planning on changing or initiating behavior therapy
             during the course of the study will be excluded.

             playing the digital treatment as reported by the parent or observed by the
             investigator.

          8. Recent history (within the past 6 months) of suspected substance abuse or dependence

          9. History of seizures (exclusive of febrile seizures), or significant motor or vocal

         10. Has participated in a clinical trial within 90 days prior to Screening.

         11. Diagnosis of or parent-reported color blindness (Confirmed in-clinic via ICBT)

         12. Uncorrected visual acuity (confirmed in-clinic, via ability of participant to play the
             game, at Screening)

         13. Regular use of psychoactive drugs (non-stimulant) that in the opinion of the
             Investigator may confound study data/assessments.

         14. Any other medical, behavioral, or developmental condition that in the opinion of the
             investigator may confound study data/assessments.

         15. Has a sibling also enrolled/currently participating in the same study. Siblings may
             participate in the study sequentially, but not at the same time.
