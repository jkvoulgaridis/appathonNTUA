  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient outcomes and satisfaction are an ever-increasing priority in surgical specialties.
      Cryotherapy has been utilized following spine surgery as an adjunct therapy to reduce
      postoperative inflammation and improve patient outcomes. However, limited studies have
      investigated the effect of cryotherapy on postoperative pain and narcotics use. Fountas et
      al. performed a randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of postoperative cryotherapy
      following single-level lumbar microdiscectomy. The authors reported patients receiving
      cryotherapy required significantly less pain medication (0.058 mg/kg/hr versus 0.067
      mg/kg/hr, p&lt;0.001) and had shorter hospital stays (1.71 days versus 2.65 days, p&lt;0.001) as
      compared to the control group. In another randomized trial of single-level lumbar discectomy
      patients, Murata et al. demonstrated cryotherapy to have no significant effect on VAS
      inpatient pain scores or postoperative blood loss.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if postoperative cryotherapy with a cold-therapy
      system reduces postoperative pain and narcotic consumption following single and multi-level
      spinal fusion.

      The investigators hypothesize that patients undergoing lumbar spinal fusion who receive
      postoperative cryotherapy treatment with a cold-therapy system will have reduced inpatient
      pain scores and require less narcotics as compared to patients that receive standard care
      (ice pack).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>2 year postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Average daily Visual Analog Scale (VAS) survey, which measures pain, for the duration of hospital stay and postoperative VAS scores will be recorded for 2 years postoperatively. This information will be collected through a survey that will be administered upon patient discharge. Patients will be asked to return the completed survey to the research team.
VAS scale ranges from 0 - 100 mm, with 100 representing maximum pain and 0 representing no pain.</description>

    <measure>Narcotics Consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Total, daily, and hourly narcotics consumption during the hospitalization. Narcotic consumption will be recorded for 2 weeks following discharge. Patients will be asked to report the number of narcotic pills taken each day. This information will be collected through a survey that will be administered upon patient discharge. Patients will be asked to return the completed survey to the research team.</description>

    <measure>Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>2 year postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) survey scores will be compared to preoperative values.
ODI measures disability for lumbar patients. The scale ranges from 0% to 100%. 0-20% represents minimal disability, 21-40% represents moderate disability, 41-60% represents severe disability, 61%-80% represents a crippled state, and 81-100% represents a bed-bound patient.</description>

    <measure>Physical Function: Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 year postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative PROMIS scores will be compared to preoperative values.
PROMIS evaluates physical function through a series of questions covering level of difficulty with normal daily activities. A score of 5 represents &quot;without any difficulty&quot; and a score of 1 represents &quot;unable to do&quot;.</description>

    <measure>General Health Status: Short-Form (SF-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 year postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative SF-12 scores will be compared to preoperative values.
SF-12 evaluates the general health status of the patient. A minimum score of 0 represents the lowest level of health, while a maximum score of 100 represents the highest level of health.</description>
