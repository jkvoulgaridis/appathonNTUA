  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of enzalutamide in
      Indian patients with progressive mCRPC previously treated with docetaxel-based chemotherapy.
      This study will also evaluate the effect of enzalutamide on prostate-specific antigen (PSA).

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. AEs will be graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) guidelines (Version 4.03).</description>
