  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects of gut microbiome diversity (richness in terms of
      many bacterial species in the gut) on responses and side effects of immunotherapy in advanced
      melanoma patients. Immunotherapy for melanoma is especially damaging for the gut with colitis
      which can lead to death and significant morbidity with repeated hospital admissions. The
      richness of the microbiome in the gut may be protective against colitis and other side
      effects but this needs to be confirmed. There is also some preliminary evidence that the gut
      microbiome diversity can enhance responses to immunotherapy in cancer but this has been shown
      in small numbers of melanoma patients.

      This pilot project will assess the gut microbiome with metagenome sequencing before and after
      starting immunotherapy in stage 3 and 4 melanoma patients. The project will assess the impact
      of the gut microbiome on treatment response rates and side effects induced by immunotherapy.

      200 stage 4 and 250 stage 3 melanoma patients naive to immunotherapy will be recruited from
      melanoma clinics. Stool samples will be donated pre-treatment and at follow-up visits
      throughout treatment. An additional sample will also be requested in the event of disease
      progression or toxicity necessitating treatment delay or discontinuation. An accompanying
      stool sample questionnaire will be completed at each sampling time point with the optional
      completion of a 24-hour recall food diary.

      Blood samples will also be taken before and after starting immunotherapy treatment, with
      gastrointestinal, food frequency, quality of life questionnaires administered at baseline. An
      optional tumour biopsy if safe and accessible, is requested from patients in the stage 4
      cohort before and after starting immunotherapy.

      Microbiome data from melanoma patients will be compared with the TwinsUK healthy control gut
      microbiome data on more than 3000 healthy adults. This analysis will help us assess if there
      are major differences between the microbiome composition in the melanoma cases prior to
      therapy compared to the control gut microbiome data from TwinsUK.
