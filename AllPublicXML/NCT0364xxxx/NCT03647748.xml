    <textblock>
      A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized evaluation of the effect of Cellulize, a green
      light low level laser system for aesthetic use for the non-invasive reduction in fat layer
      for body contouring and reduction of cellulite.

      This clinical trial will provide objective evidence showing effectiveness of the Cellulize
      532nm green light therapy for the non-invasive reduction in fat layer for body contouring,
      and for the non-invasive treatment for the appearance of cellulite.

    <description>Average Change in Inches of Total Circumference Measurements for effect of Cellulize, a LED 532nm green light low level laser system for aesthetic use for the non-invasive reduction in fat layer for body contouring from baseline measurements, and after treatment.</description>

    <measure>Durability of Effect</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Durability of Effect: a term used to indicate whether the results of the primary outcome endure at the 2 week follow up time point. If the average change in inches of total circumference continues decreasing or stays the same, then the durability of effect is assumed to endure for at least two weeks. If the measurements at the 2-week time point show that the changes in inches return to previous measures at the start of treatment, then the effect is considered temporary.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in appearance of cellulite</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in appearance of cellulite is a measure of the Nurnberger-Muller Scale (NMS) from baseline to 2 weeks post-assessment for both of the right and left thighs.</description>
