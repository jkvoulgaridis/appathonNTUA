  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will study two treatment combinations for classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). This
      trial will find out if these two treatment combinations work to treat cHL. It will also find
      out what side effects occur. A side effect is anything the drug does besides treating cancer.
      This study will have three parts (Parts A, B, and C).

      The drugs used in Part A are a combination of targeted anticancer drug (brentuximab vedotin)
      and three chemotherapy drugs (doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine). These four drugs
      are called &quot;A+AVD.&quot; Participants will be treated with granulocyte colony stimulating factor
      (G-CSF) following every dose of A+AVD for 6 cycles of treatment (12 doses).

      Part A will look at whether the A+AVD drug combination reduces the number of participants who
      experience the side effect of febrile neutropenia. Febrile neutropenia is a very low white
      blood cell count and a fever, which can be life threatening.

      Parts B and C will use drug combination of brentuximab vedotin, plus nivolumab, doxorubicin,
      and dacarbazine. These four drugs are called &quot;AN+AD.&quot; Parts B and C will study how well the
      drugs work to treat cHL and what side effects they cause.

      This study will have three parts.

      Part A of the study is designed to evaluate the incidence of febrile neutropenia, efficacy,
      and dose intensity in participants with advanced stage classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL)
      receiving granulocyte colony stimulating factor primary prophylaxis (G-PP) administration
      during treatment with frontline A+AVD. In Part A, participants will be treated with
      granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) following every dose of A+AVD for 6 cycles of
      treatment. Participants will be treated using institutional standard of care practices for
      the majority of treatment decisions.

      Part B is designed to evaluate the combination of brentuximab vedotin, nivolumab,
      doxorubicin, and dacarbazine (AN+AD) as frontline treatment in participants with advanced
      cHL. In Part B, participants will be given AN+AD combination for 6 cycles of treatment. This
      part of the trial will look at whether this combination of drugs is effective and tolerable
      in participants with Stage II with bulky mediastinal disease and Stage III or IV cHL.

      Part C is designed to evaluate AN+AD as frontline treatment in participants with early stage
      cHL. In Part C, participants will be given AN+AD combination for 4 cycles of treatment. This
      part of the trial will look at whether this combination of drugs is effective and tolerable
      in participants with Stage I or II cHL with non-bulky mediastinal disease.
