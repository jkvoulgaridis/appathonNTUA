    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial to examine the effect of 3 mobile telephone text message
      reminders on followup colonoscopy 120 days after a positive fecal occult blood test among
      Meuhedet members aged 50-74 who tested positive in 2016.

      Background: Fecal occult blood tests are recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force
      as a screening method for colorectal cancer, but they are only effective if positive results
      are followed by colonoscopy. Surprisingly, a large proportion of patients with a positive
      result do not follow this recommendation.

      Objective: To examine the effectiveness of a short message service in increasing adherence to
      colonoscopy follow-up after a positive fecal occult blood test.

      Methods: This randomized controlled trial was conducted with patients who had positive
      colorectal cancer screening results. Randomization was stratified by residential district and
      socioeconomic status. Subjects in the control group (n = 238) received routine care that
      included an alert to the physician regarding the positive Fecal occult blood test result. The
      intervention group (n = 232) received routine care and three short message service reminders
      to visit their primary care physician. Adherence to colonoscopy was measured 120 days from
      the positive result. All patient information, including test results and colonoscopy
      completion, were obtained from their computerized medical records. Physicians of the study
      patients completed an attitude survey regarding FOBT as a screening test for colorectal
      cancer. The intervention and control groups were compared using chi-squared for discrete
      variables. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals
      for performing colonoscopy within 120 days, adjusting for potential confounders of age,
      gender, socioeconomic status, district, ethnicity, intervention group and physician's
      attitude.

    <description>Each patient in the intervention group also received an automated text message up to a week after the positive FOBT result. The text read: &quot;Hello. There is a lab test result ready for you. Contact your physician for an explanation of the findings.&quot; Two additional automated text message reminders were sent to the patient at 2 weeks and 1 month reading, &quot;Hello, This is a reminder. It is essential that you contact your physician if you have not already done so.&quot;</description>
