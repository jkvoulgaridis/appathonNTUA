      The purpose of this project is to design a health management model of TCM preventive medicine
      that meets the need of healthy or suboptimal healthy people. This project will try to
      practice &quot;Health management model of TCM preventive medicine&quot; together with health promotion
      groups related to Taiwan Society of Health Promotion in the district of Shilin and Zhongzheng
      in Taipei city, and plan to recruit 100 people.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With regard to &quot;Developing traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) Health Care&quot;, the goal of
      &quot;Promoting the development of TCM health promotion service&quot; was set and the strategy of
      &quot;Promoting the development of TCM preventive medicine and health promotion services&quot; was used
      to develop TCM preventive medicine, which is applied to preventing disease and improving
      physical fitness. By establishing the TCM health care prototype of &quot;health promotion&quot; and
      &quot;preventive medicine,&quot; this project will push the systemic development of TCM preventive
      medicine forward and improve suboptimal health by early intervention, providing people with
      multiple model choices in self-health management.

      This project will first form a multidisciplinary team to gather and analyze the domestic and
      international health promotion and management models of TCM or traditional medicine. Then
      systematically arrange and induct the literature references to establish the outline and
      draft of &quot;Health management model of TCM preventive medicine.&quot; Furthermore, in
      July-September, this project will try to practice &quot;Health management model of TCM preventive
      medicine&quot; together with health promotion groups related to Taiwan Society of Health Promotion
      in the district of Shilin and Zhongzheng in Taipei city, and plan to recruit 100 people. The
      purpose of this project is to design a health management model of TCM preventive medicine
      that meets the need of healthy or suboptimal healthy people. The investigators expecte to
      bring out the prototype of &quot;Health management model of TCM preventive medicine&quot; and finish
      the follow-up promoting proposal of the draft in the meantime, which will discuss the
      possibility of applying this model to healthy or suboptimal healthy people and bring up
      concrete policy and implementation recommendations of &quot;promoting the development of TCM
      preventive medicine and health promotion services.&quot;
