  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Personal Resilience Empowerment Program (PREP) at Hackensack Meridian Integrative Health
      &amp; Medicine was designed in Legacy Meridian to assist all selected patients with upcoming
      hospitalization. For the &quot;Personal Resilience Empowerment Program (PREP) in the perioperative
      setting of surgically treated cancer patients&quot;, hereafter &quot;the Project or PREP&quot;, the
      Hackensack Meridian Integrative Health &amp; Medicine is designing a new pilot program to focus
      on the needs of oncology patients.

      All patients diagnosed with cancer that will undergo a scheduled surgical (Hepato-Biliary,
      and Thoracic) procedure in Hackensack Meridian Health and specifically in the Jersey Shore
      University Medical Center, will be eligible to participate (for more details please see
      eligibility criteria, section 4).

      Overall, this pilot project will include 5 coaching sessions and an introductory
      session/visit that will take place on the physician's office. The initial physician visit
      will focus on patient eligibility, introduction to the Project, informed consent and a
      pre-intervention survey and will be conducted by the principal investigator or one of the
      sub-investigators listed above. The following 5 sessions will be conducted by one of the
      integrative health coaches/registered nurses (for details please see section 5). A
      post-intervention survey will be completed during the final session and repeated at one
      month, and at 3 months from the final session.

      The goal of this project is to investigate whether using the PREP as an intervention in
      patients diagnosed with cancer would result in improving various metrics including
      improvements to resilience, sleep, activity, purpose, nutrition, empowerment to manage one's
      own health and well-being, decrease in pain medication use and more rapid return to previous
      functional status according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG).
