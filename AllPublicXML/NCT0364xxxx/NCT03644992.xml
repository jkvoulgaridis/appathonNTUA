  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this cross-sectional study is to describe the specific sutuations of
      thromboembolic disease in gynecological surgery and identify the risk factors of it.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The electronic medical data of 54 patients who undergo operations to treat gynecological
      diseases but develop thromboembolic disease will be analyzed retrospectively in this study.
      The location, symptom and other situations of embolism will be described and multiple linear
      analysi will be employed to identify the risk factors of it.

    <description>Performing multiple linear regression analysis with SPSS 17.0, we plan to identify the risk factors which can increase the possibility of thromboembolic disease from possible factors like hypertension, diabetes, etc.</description>

        The planned sample size was based on data from a previous study, in which the standard
        deviation was 5. We assumed an one-tailed Î± error of 0.05 and a sampling error of 1.0. we
        propose to enroll 60 participants and allow for a dropout rate of 10% for an effective
        sample size of 54.
