  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Orthopaedic surgeries involving the legs can be done under nerve block, where patients will
      be numb of pain at the operated site but awake during surgery. Sedation can be given to allay
      anxiety and provide comfort throughout the surgery. Sedation can be given by the anaesthetic
      doctors by using target-comtrolled infusion pump, or self-administered by patients by means
      of specialised machines. This study compares two method of administration of sedation,
      patient-controlled sedation (PCS) versus target-controlled infusion sedation (TCIS) by
      anaesthetic doctors, in people undergoing orthopaedic surgeries under nerve block.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Central neuraxial block (CNB) is one of the mainstays of anaesthesia methods in various
      disciplines particularly orthopaedic surgeries. However the state of consciousness can
      potentially cause patient anxiety thus sedation is often utilized as a mean to improve
      patient satisfaction and increase patient acceptance of CNB.

      Conventionally, the anaesthesiologist administers sedatives for the patients. Propofol is the
      commonly used drug for sedation due to its favourable pharmacokinetic profile, which results
      in fast induction, easy control of depth of sedation and rapid recovery. It can be infused by
      using target-controlled infusion (TCI) devices where the anaesthetists titrates propofol by
      setting desired target plasma and effect site concentration. However it is difficult to judge
      precisely patient requirements for adequate patient sedation, comfort and analgesia as
      patients' needs differ.

      Patient-controlled sedation (PCS) is a valid option, initially adapted from post surgery
      patient-controlled analgesia. It allows patients to titrate sedative medication to their
      comfort and therefore present an option that addresses the needs of patients with strong
      desire to maintain sense of control during procedures.

      This study was designed to compare total propofol requirement between PCS versus TCI sedation
      (TCIS), complications and patient satisfaction, in patients undergoing lower limb orthopaedic
      surgery under CNB.

    <description>Patients in Group PCS (patient-controlled sedation) received intravenous (IV) propofol via a patient controlled analgesia (PCA) infusion pump. The machine was set to deliver a demand bolus dose of 0.25 mg/kg with 1-minute lockout interval, without basal infusion.The patient was instructed to press on a hand-held device as often as required, to achieve their desired level of comfort or sedation.</description>

    <description>Patients in Group TCIS (target-controlled infusion sedation) received IV propofol via a target-controlled infusion (TCI) pump, targeted at an initial effect site concentration (Cet) of 0.6 μg/ml, using the Schnider pharmacokinetic model. Upon attainment of 0.6 μg/ml Cet, the patient's sedation level was assessed. The Cet was increased or reduced accordingly by 0.2 μg/ml to attain an OAA/S score of 3.</description>
