  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rapid force production declines as a consequence of ageing. Given the functional relevance of
      rapid force production, exercise interventions in older adults should aim at improving the
      capacity to produce force rapidly. To improve this capacity, exercises should be performed
      with the intention to develop high speeds, as supported by previous work.

      Human locomotion fundamentally consists of multi-joint movements and rapidly coupled
      eccentric-concentric muscle actions, known as stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) activities or
      plyometrics. Plyometrics might therefore be used to optimize power production. However, there
      is limited research on the feasibility of plyometrics in older adults and its potential
      effects on rapid force production and functional capacity. This study will test the
      feasibility of a 12-week plyometric exercise intervention in older men and compare its
      effects on rapid force production to a traditional resistance exercise or walking
      intervention.

    <measure>Rapid force production</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in rapid force production at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects perform a test protocol on a sledge apparatus, consisting of explosive isometric voluntary contractions for the leg-extensor muscles of the right leg. The inclination of the sledge is 20° to horizontal. The seat of the sledge is inclined backwards (130°). The knee joint angle is set at 90° and the hip angle at 70°. The point of force application is aligned with the head of the fifth metatarsal. Subjects are instructed to kick as fast and as hard as possible and maintain their maximum force for approximately 3s. The rate of force development (N/s) is defined as the linear slope of the force-time curve and is measured from the onset of movement till 100 ms.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline in jumping height at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects perform a test protocol on a sledge apparatus, consisting of squat jumps (SJ), countermovement jumps (CMJ), and drop jumps (DJ). The inclination of the sledge is 20° to horizontal. The seat of the sledge is inclined backwards (130°). A force platform is built in perpendicular to the jumping direction. A speed sensor is attached to the seat of the sledge, which is used to assess the transition point between braking and push-off phases and to calculate jumping height (in cm).</description>
