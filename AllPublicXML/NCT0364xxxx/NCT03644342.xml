  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most effective strategy for managing distantly metastatic invasive carcinomas of the
      cervix is not defined. Based on the success of niraparib in breast and ovarian cancer trials
      and the concern for toxicities and comorbidities limiting the compliance of concurrent
      cisplatin for cervical cancer, this study is a phase I/II study of women diagnosed with
      distantly metastatic (Stage IV) disease to determine the maximum tolerated dose and to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of niraparib, an orally available
      small molecule PARP inhibitor when administered concurrently with definitive regional
      radiotherapy for treatment of cervical cancer. Women enrolled in this study will receive 3-6
      cycles of induction-style carboplatin and paclitaxel followed by definitive doses of pelvic
      radiotherapy along with the oral niraparib given at the same time.
