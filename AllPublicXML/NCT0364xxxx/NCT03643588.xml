    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to compare single injection HYAJOINT Plus Synovial Fluid Supplement
      used on the single and repeat treatment of knee osteoarthritis that has the same safety and
      effectiveness as three-injection hyaluronan, Hyalgan.

      The study was a random, evaluator-blinded, controlled, single center clinical trial.
      Recruiting patients who have been suffered from the osteoarthritis pain under conventional
      nonpharmacologic therapy or analgesics for a long time and randomly divided into two groups,
      HYAJOINT Plus or Hyalgan group, when the inclusion criteria was met and the inform consent
      was obtained. They were followed for 56 weeks including visits at 4, 12, 26, 39, and 52 weeks
      post-treatment for the safety and effectiveness evaluation. After complete 52-week visit,
      subjects would received HYAJOINT Plus on the target knee. These subjects were followed for 4
      weeks to assess the safety of repeat treatment or cross reactions of the use from
      three-injections to single-injection hyaluronan treatment. The primary endpoints were the
      incidence of any adverse events during the study, as well as the objective assessment of pain
      visual analog scale at baseline and every visit.
