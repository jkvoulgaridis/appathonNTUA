      To document effects of consuming Golden Black Seed (brand: New Chapter Inc.) on metabolic
      health and wellness in human subjects.

      Golden Black Seed contains extracts from the turmeric root (Curcuma longa) and black cumin
      seeds (Nigella sativa). Both botanicals have been used traditionally in Asian cooking, and
      also in herbal medicine for reducing inflammation.
