  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel web-based intervention (Optimune),
      which was designed to introduce relevant cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques to
      women with breast cancer who are past the active eradication phase. The present study will
      test the hypothesis that Optimune has an impact on lifestyle parameters and psychometric
      outcomes. Therefore, 360 woman with breast cancer will be recruited and randomized to two
      groups: (1) a control group, in which they may engage with any treatment (Care-as-Usual, CAU)
      and receive access to Optimune after a delay of 3 months (i.e., CAU/wait list control group),
      or (2) to a treatment group that immediately receives 12-month access to Optimune and may
      also use CAU. The primary outcome measure is the effect on quality of life, physical activity
      and diet three month post-baseline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression and fatigue is common in breast cancer survivors and its presence is associated
      with personal suffering, increased inflammatory activity, and worse prognosis. While in the
      phase of acute treatment many women receive short-term psychological support to better cope
      with the situation, this is not standard of care in the years following. Web-based
      psychological interventions are easily accessible and preliminary evidence suggests that such
      interventions can be effective. However, no trial has yet examined whether a CBT-based
      internet intervention designed to meet the needs of breast cancer survivors can achieve
      effects on lifestyle parameters and psychometric outcomes, when offered as adjunct to care as
      usual.

      In this study, the investigators will investigate treatment effects of the novel web-based
      program Optimune when added to treatment as usual. Beyond established CBT techniques
      targeting depression, anxiety, and fatigue, this intervention specifically includes elements
      that have shown effects on markers of immune status and inflammation, including sleep and
      stress management (e.g., mindfulness-based techniques) and lifestyle optimization (dietary
      and physical activity advice). The delivery and training of content is continuously
      individualized to match users' preferences and needs, based on responses within the program.
      The intervention is delivered via the internet and protected by individually assigned
      passwords. The program can be accessed for 365 days after registration.

      This randomized controlled trial will include 360 women with breast cancer who are past the
      active eradication phase. Participants will be recruited from various settings, including
      web-based advertisement and internet forums/groups. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      either (1) a control group, in which they receive care as usual (CAU) and are given access to
      the web-based intervention (Optimune) after a delay of 3 months (i.e., CAU/wait list control
      group), or (2) a treatment group that may also use CAU and in addition immediately receives
      12-month access to the web-based intervention (Optimune). Measurements are collected at
      pre-treatment (T0) three months (T1) and six months (T2).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Determination of Quality of Life using the WHOQOL-BREF</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 3 months (also assessed at 6 months post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life will be measured using the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF), which is a shorter version of the original instrument. Scale Range: 26 to 130.
The WHOQOL-BREF is a 26-item, 5-point rating scale. It measures the following broad domains: physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment. Response options range from 1, indicating &quot;very dissatisfied&quot; to 5, indicating &quot;very satisfied&quot; and relate to the last two weeks.
Higher scores on the WHOQOL-BREF correspond to higher self-reported levels of quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Determination of Physical Activity using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 3 months (also assessed at 6 months post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Physical Activity will be measured using the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ - short).
The short version of the IPAQ is a 7-item questionnaire that assesses the types of intensity of physical activity and sitting time that people do as part of their daily lives. Open-ended questions surrounding individuals' last 7-day recall of physical activity are considered to estimate total physical activity min/week and time spent sitting.
Interpretation: Three levels (categories) of physical activity are proposed: low, moderate and high.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Determination of Diet Quality using the Food Quality Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 3 months (also assessed at 6 months post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Diet Quality will be measured using the Food Quality Questionnaire (FQQ). Scale Range: 0 to 39.
The FQQ is a 10-item, 5-point rating scale. The FQQ is a short food frequency questionnaire, which includes 10 food items on a 5-point rating scale. It focuses on fruit, vegetables, high-sugar foods, processed food, meat and drinks. The aim of the tool is to measure diet quality. Response options range from 0, indicating &quot;daily&quot; to 3&quot; indicating, &quot;once or never&quot;. Interpretation: A global diet quality score can be obtained by averaging all the items on the FQQ.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determination of cancer-related fatigue using the Brief Fatigue Inventory Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 3 months (also assessed at 6 months post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue will be measured using the Brief Fatigue Inventory Questionnaire (BFI-9) questionnaire. Scale Range: 0 to 90.
The BFI is a 9-item, 11-point rating scale. The first three questions measure fatigue severity from 0, indicating &quot;no fatigue,&quot; to 10, indicating &quot;as bad as you can imagine,&quot; at current, usual, and worst levels. The following six questions assess fatigue interference with daily activities. Response options range from 0, indicating &quot;does not interfere,&quot; to 10, indicating, &quot;completely interferes.&quot; Interpretation: A global fatigue score can be obtained by averaging all the items on the BFI.
Higher scores on the BFI correspond to greater self-reported levels of fatigue</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determination of cancer-related emotional stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 3 months (also assessed at 6, 9 and 12 months post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Cancer-related emotional stress will be measured using the standardized IES-R (Impact of Event Scale) Questionnaire. Scale Range: 0 to 88 The IES-R is a 22-item self-report measure that assesses subjective distress caused by traumatic events. Items are rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;extremely&quot;). The IES-R yields a total score (ranging from 0 to 88) and subscale scores can also be calculated for the Intrusion, Avoidance, and Hyperarousal subscales.
Interpretation: Higher scores correspond to greater self-reported levels of post-traumatic stress.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determination of depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 3 months (also assessed at 6 months post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Depression will be measured using the standardized PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire). Scale Range: 0 to 27 The PHQ-9 is a multipurpose instrument for screening, diagnosing, monitoring and measuring the severity of depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represents mild, moderate, moderately severe and severe depression.
Interpretation: Higher scores correspond to greater self-reported levels of depression.</description>
