  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational and prospective cohort study to examine whether the addition of IVUS
      plaque morphological evaluation to FFR haemodynamic assessment of non-culprit lesions in
      NSTEACS patients will better predict MACEs.

      IMPACT-NSTEACS is a prospective, single-centre and dynamic observational study. The study
      population consists of NSTEACS patients who undergo FFR in lesions with intermediate to
      severe angiographic stenosis. Then, FFR-guided PCI is performed, followed by morphological
      assessment based on IVUS in all FFR-negative lesions (FNLs). After discharge all patients
      receive optimal medication treatment and are followed up clinically. On the basis of
      follow-up angiography, MACEs are further adjudicated as occurring at FNLs or not.

    <description>After the angiographic screening for lesions with 40%-90% diameter stenosis, FFR will be performed according to standard protocol using the s5 console and PrimeWire Prestige PLUS coronary pressure wire (Volcano Corporation, San Diego, California). FFR is calculated as the ratio of mean distal intracoronary pressure measured by the pressure wire, and the mean arterial pressure measured through the coronary guiding catheter. An FFR ≤0.8 or &gt;90% diameter stenosis should result in a treatment decision for revascularization by PCI and lesions with FFR &gt;0.80 are defined as FNLs and should result in deferral of PCI.</description>

    <description>After the successful FFR-guided PCI, IVUS will be performed in all FNLs with the ultrasound Imaging Catheter Atlantis™ SR Pro (40 MHz, mechanical-type transducer, 3.2 F, Boston Scientific Corporation, Natick, MA, USA). Quantitative analyses of grayscale IVUS include contouring external elastic membrane (EEM) and luminal borders and the measurement of EEM cross-sectional area (CSA), luminal CSA, plaque and media CSA, plaque burdenand remodeling index. Virtual assessment of plaque is performed with iMap software (QIvus 2.0; Medis Medical Imaging Systems, Leiden, The Netherlands). Plaque components are categorized as dense calcium, necrotic core, fibrofatty, and fibrous tissue and reported as absolute area and proportion of total plaque area.</description>

        For study enrollment, we screen patients with NSTEACS combination of unstable angina and
        non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction according to current guidelines. Once all
        clinical inclusion criteria and no clinical exclusion criteria are met, patients must sign
        the informed consent and undergo invasive coronary angiography (ICA). During ICA patients
        will be further analyzed for eligibility using angiographic inclusion and exclusion
        criteria. Patients will be enrolled into the study once the IVUS measurement is delivered
        after successful FFR-guided PCI.
