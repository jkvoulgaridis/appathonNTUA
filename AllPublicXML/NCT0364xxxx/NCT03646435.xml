  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will focus to determine the usefulness of continuous monitoring and the role it
      would play in improving inpatient management. The study is also conducted to collect
      patient's experiences regarding use of the wearable device for health monitoring. There will
      be no control or comparison group for this prospective cohort study. For each participant,
      the investigators will provide summary of their data to nurses and physicians who are
      directly involved in the patients' care. At the end of the study for each participant, the
      investigators will ask questions related to how useful they found the data. As a secondary
      endpoint for this study, the study team will also be evaluating the accuracy of the heart
      rate, sleep and activity data gathered from the wearable against the current gold standard
      used in hospitals (ie. information gathered by nurses or using sleep assessment patient
      questionnaires). The investigators predict that wearable devices will be well received among
      participants and that they can provide accurate information about patients on GIM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients admitted to general internal medicine are admitted because they are sick and need
      monitoring that cannot be provided at home, need expedited testing and/or need treatments
      that are best administered in hospital. Currently, standard monitoring on the hospital ward
      consists of measuring vital signs typically twice a day. The rapid development, uptake of
      affordable wearables such as smartwatches and wearable devices that involve continuous
      measurement of vital measures may provide added information to the care of inpatients. To
      date, there have been limited studies on the use of wearables in hospitalized medical
      patients. The rationale for the study is to determine feasibility of using wearables in GIM
      patients and usefulness of the data that wearables provide.

      The wearable chosen for this study will be the Fitbit Charge 2. The Fitbit will be worn by
      all patients who are recruited to participate in the study. It will be worn like a watch on a
      wrist and uses photoplethysmography (PPG) to detect periodic changes in blood flow beneath
      the sensor; thereby measuring changes in heart rate. Heart rate will be measured nearly
      continuously. Fitbit will also assess activity and will also assess sleep. Fitbit data will
      be transmitted via Bluetooth to a mobile app which then is uploaded to Fitbit servers. The
      Fitbit data will then be accessed via the Web. The data will be downloaded from Fitbit
      servers to a secure UHN server.

      In an effort to reduce the risk of potential iatrogenic infection, the study team will use
      disinfectant wipes to thoroughly clean wearables between uses. Participants will be shown how
      to wear the band by a study investigator or research personnel.

      At the end of the study for each participant, the investigators will ask the questions
      related to how useful they found the data. For each participant, the study team will provide
      summary of their data to nurses and physicians who were caring for them. The investigators
      hope to get 2 nurse surveys per patient (because of there being multiple shifts per patient)
      and to get 1 attending survey per patient.

    <intervention_model_description>This study model will involve a single cohort of about 50 GIM patients. All patients will be asked to wear the Fitbit Charge 2 for the duration of their stay in the hospital and the health information (heart rate, sleep, physical activity) collected from the wearable will be compared to the nurses' vital sign assessment for accuracy. There will be no other comparison group in this study.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>6 days</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be given a 'patient questionnaire' that is developed by the research team to provide feedback about their experience and how useful/feasible (if at all) they found the wearable to be in collecting their health information. The questionnaire is not adopted from any other source or the literature. There will be a mix of 10 questions (open-ended short answer or scale-based from 1-10) on the questionnaire. Higher scores will indicate that patients felt that their Fitbit data correlated well with their behaviour and nurses' vital sign assessment.</description>

    <time_frame>6 days</time_frame>
    <description>Nurses and physicians will be given a 'clinician questionnaire' which is also developed by the research team, to report how clinically useful they felt the Fitbit data was. There will be a mix of 6 questions (open-ended short answer or scale-based from 1-10) on the questionnaire. Higher scores on questionnaire indicate that nurses and physicians felt that the Fitbit data was mostly consistent with the nurses' assessment (which was conducted every 6 hours).</description>

    <measure>Correlation between Fitbit HR and HR obtained by nurses</measure>
    <time_frame>6 days</time_frame>
    <description>Upon termination of the study, the minute-level HR data gathered from Fitbit will be compared to the HR data collected by nurses in the GIM ward (every 6 hours) to see how consistent and accurate both methods are. Ultimately, averaged data collected from both methods will be presented graphically and the correlation coefficient (r2) between the two types of data will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between Fitbit sleep and sleep information gathered by patients</measure>
    <time_frame>6 days</time_frame>
    <description>Upon termination of the study, an analysis will be done to assess if there is a correlation between the sleep data gathered by the Fitbit and the sleep information obtained by patients (via the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire). All patients enrolled in the study will be required to fill out the RCSQ after the study concludes. This RCSQ uses a visual analog scale (0-100) to assess 5 features of sleep: sleep depth, latency, awakenings, percentage of time awake, and overall quality of sleep. Ultimately, all the individual feature scores will be aggregated to develop a final RCSQ score for each patient. Higher scores indicate that patient has a good sleep pattern. The RCSQ scores of patients will then be compared to the sleep data gathered by the Fitbit and a correlation coefficient (r2) between the two types of data will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between Fitbit physical activity (number of steps taken) and activity information obtained by nurses</measure>
    <time_frame>6 days</time_frame>
    <description>The physical activity data gathered by the Fitbit (ie. number of steps taken every day by the patient) will be compared to the nurses' daily assessment of the patients which includes a Braden scale (for predicting pressure sore risk). The braden score consists of 6 categories: sensory perception, moisture, activity, mobility, nutrition and friction. The score ranges from 6-23 with lower scores indicating a higher risk. The Braden scores gathered by nurses for every patient in the study will be compared to each patient's Fitbit data to assess for accuracy and consistency. Ultimately, averaged data collected from both methods will be presented graphically and a correlation coefficient (r2) between the two types of data will be reported.</description>

    <description>The Fitbit Charge 2 is the wearable of interest for this pilot study. All 50 study participants will be requested to wear the electronic device for the duration of their stay in the hospital (maximum of 6 days).

    <description>The Fitbit Charge 2 is the electronic wearable chosen for this pilot study. This particular Fitbit is capable of measuring patient heart rate, sleep and physical activity. The data collected will then be analyzed with respect to the outcomes of this study. To determine the accuracy of the Fitbit, data collected will be compared to the nurses' standard patient assessment (for HR and physical activity) and to patient responses on the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (for sleep).</description>
