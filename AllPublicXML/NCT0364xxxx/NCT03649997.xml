             millimeter of mercury (mmHg) systolic, inclusive, and no higher than 90 mmHg diastolic
             at screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant abnormal values for hematology, biochemistry, or urinalysis at
             screening as deemed appropriate by the investigator

             aspartate aminotransferase [AST], gamma-glutamyltransferase [GGT], alkaline
             phosphatase [ALP], and bilirubin) at screening more than (&gt;)1.5* upper limit of normal
             (ULN)
