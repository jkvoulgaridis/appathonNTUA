  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine whether a surgical intervention involving removing of
      the calcified cartilage cap in patients with Grade II Kellgren-Lawrence osteoarthritis
      influences the incorporation of labeled bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC)-derived cells
      within the cartilage regenerate vs labeled BMAC cells delivered after arthroscopy without
      removing of the calcified cartilaginous layer. The survival and incorporation of the BMAC
      labeled cells will be evaluated with MRI using the Ferumoxytol infusion stem cell labeling
      technique. The second arm of the study evaluating cell fate after injecting stem cells under
      a rotator cuff repair will also be explored.

      The secondary objectives are to 1) determine which surgical intervention leads to better
      clinical outcomes as measured by Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) at 12
      months, and 2) determine who long we can track the labeled-BMAC cells in the knee.

    <textblock>
      Articular cartilage repair and regeneration has become a focal point for scientists and
      surgeons in search for a biological treatment for osteoarthritis that has failed
      non-operative management. Surgeons have begun to harvest and centrifuged bone marrow aspirate
      to produce bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) in hopes that the mesenchymal stem cells
      in the bone marrow aspirate can stimulate cartilage regeneration in areas of articular
      cartilage deficiency. This study is a first-in-human blinded randomized clinical trial using
      labeled BMAC cells in adults diagnosed with grade II-III Kellgren-Lawrence osteoarthritis.

      This is a single site study where 20 cases among eligible patients will be identified and
      randomly assigned to either the control (no calcified cartilage) or experimental (calcified
      cartilage removed) group. A power analysis will be performed after 20 patients to determine
      the total number of patients required to reach adequate power.

      A patient will receive an infusion of Feraheme 2 days before the procedure and a baseline MR
      Pelvis and knee. A nurse will be present at all times during the infusion to monitor vitals.
      On the day of the procedure patient will undergo harvesting of the bone marrow from the
      pelvis and arthroscopy procedure involving menisectomy, synovectomy and debridement. Patients
      in the experimental group will also undergo removal of the calcified cartilage cap. The bone
      marrow aspirate will be centrifuged and about 5-7 cc of BMAC injected into knee. MRIs will be
      done at the 2 day mark for confirmation of the labeling of the mesenchymal cells, and at the
      two week and 3 month mark. Patient related Outcomes will be measured using the Knee injury
      and Osteoarthritis Score at 12 months follow up.
