  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      In high-transmission settings, up to 70% of school-aged children harbour malaria parasites
      which is mostly asymptomatic, thus, from an epidemiological point of view, they contribute
      significantly as reservoir to onward malaria transmission to others. In endemic areas,
      malaria accounts for around 50% of the mortality, 13-50% of all school absenteeism, and
      causes anaemia in approximately 85 million school-aged children of sub Saharan Africa that
      also impairs the cognitive development of children. Intermittent preventive treatment (IPT)
      of pregnant women as well as seasonal malaria chemoprevention in children under the age of
      five have been implemented in several sub-Saharan countries and have proven to be very
      effective. However, none of these IPT strategies is targeting school children. A clinical
      trial is being conducted to expand the IPT by testing effectiveness and safety of two
      antimalarial drugs Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) and Artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) in
      preventing malaria related morbidity in school aged children (IPTsc) living in high endemic
      areas.

      Methods:

      A randomized, open label, controlled trial will enrol 1602 school children aged 5-15 years,
      who will receive either DP or ASAQ or control (no drug ), using a &quot;balanced block design&quot;
      with the &quot;standard of care&quot; arm as reference. The interventional treatments are given every 4
      months 3 rounds for the first year. A second non-interventional year will assess possible
      rebound effects. All study-arms receive bed nets, early diagnosis and care for malaria, and
      praziquantel and albendazole as mass treatment for helminthiasis. The primary endpoint are
      change from baseline in mean haemoglobin concentration at months 12 and 20 of follow-up and
      clinical malaria incidence from month 0 till months 12 and 20 of follow up. Adverse events
      will be monitored throughout the study. Mixed design methods will be used to assess the
      acceptability, cost-effectiveness and feasibility of this IPTsc as part of a more
      comprehensive school children health package.

      Discussion:

      The national school health programme (NSHP), Tanzania, combines schistosomiasis and soil
      transmitted helminthes (STH) control package under national schistosomiasis and STH control
      programme (NSSCP). Malaria intervention using IPTsc strategy may be integrated in NSHP with
      the same platform as NSSCP, however, there is limited systematic evidence to assess the
      operational feasibility of this approach. School aged children are a reachable target
      population in any endemic malaria setting. The suggested strategy will provide effective
      protection against malaria, hasten either the elimination process and/or diminish the
      reservoir and burden.
