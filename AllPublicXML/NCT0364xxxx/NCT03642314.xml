    <textblock>
      This is a sub-study of an ongoing PrEP study ( HIV PrEP for men who have sex with men - MSM -
      and transgender women - TGW: a demonstrative project in Brazil, Peru and Mexico - ImPrEP).
      MSM/TGW enrolled to ImPrEP Study at the selected sites, who agree to participate in this HIV
      Self Test (HIVST) sub-study, will be 1:1 randomized at the third study visit either to
      receive 5 HIVST+voucher (intervention arm) or 5 vouchers alone (control arm) to secondarily
      distribute into their MSM/TGW network. All vouchers are numbered invitations for priority
      access to individualized HIV risk assessment and combination prevention services, including
      PrEP, at the ImPrEP sites. Study population comprises ImPrEP participants and their referred
      peers. Sample size is going to be determined at an interim analysis performed when each city
      has enrolled 70 participants. Trial participants will be at maximum 876 (438 intervention and
      438 in the control arm) MSM and TGW included in the ImPrEP Study who received PrEP for at
      least 6 months in the sites from Rio de Janeiro and Lima. The study is designed as a
      multicenter, open, adaptative, randomized trial. The main study outcome is the voucher
      redemption proportion by arm.
