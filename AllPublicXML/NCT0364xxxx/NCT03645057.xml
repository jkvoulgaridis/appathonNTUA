  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, cross-sectional study to monitor the effects of
      crisaborole and tacrolimus 0.03% on patient-reported outcomes and caregiver burden in
      children (ages 5 to 12 years, inclusive) with ≤ moderate atopic dermatitis over a 12 week
      period of time. The goal of this study is to detect changes in PROs and caregiver burden
      during treatment for atopic dermatitis of moderate or less severity. The study design will
      allow us to correlate PROs and caregiver burden with treatment response and disease
      improvement in children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common, chronic skin disease affecting 20% of children and 10% of
      adults worldwide (1-3). Children with AD often develop the disease within the first five
      years of life, which is a critical time for physical and psychosocial development (4). AD
      impacts an individual's physical, mental, and social health. Anxiety, itch, sleep
      disturbance, and depression have been associated with low quality of life scores. Childhood
      AD also affects the emotional, financial, physical, and social well-being of parents or
      caregivers (4). Individuals caring for a child with AD report sleep deprivation, poor social
      support, and stress about parenting (1, 4). Utilizing patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in
      clinic can provide meaningful data to monitor disease activity and response to different
      interventions, with the ultimate goal to improve quality of life for the patient and their
      family members or caregivers. Additionally, PROs can help us better understand the burden of
      AD. It is still unclear which PROs are most relevant for atopic dermatitis. This study will
      evaluate the utility of several PROs to monitor response to two different topical ointments,
      crisaborole (Eucrisa™) and tacrolimus 0.03%, to better understand the impact of these two
      non-steroidal topical treatments on overall health of children with AD of moderate or less
      severity and their caregivers.

    <measure>Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This patient-reported outcome measure will be completed using an iPad. The 10-item questionnaire designed for use in parents of children (i.e., ages 4-17) to obtain information on children's quality of life. Each question relates to a component of quality of life: Symptoms/Feelings (items 1-2); Leisure (items 4-6); School (item 7); Relationships (items 3-8); Sleep (item 9), and Treatment (item 10). Children answer each question using a 4-point scale: Not at all = 0, A Little = 1, Quite A Lot = 2, Very Much = 3. The scores from each item are summed to create a severity burden score (i.e., maximum score = 30). The scores represent degree of severity burden on quality of life: No effect = 0-1; Small effect = 2-6; Moderate effect = 7-12; Very large effect = 13-18; and Extremely large effect = 19-30.</description>

    <measure>Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This patient-reported outcome measure will be completed using an iPad. This is a validated 22 item questionnaire consisting of 4 subscales: Bedtime, Sleep Behavior, Waking During the Night, and Morning Wake Up. The patient/parent will answer each item choosing from: &quot;Always&quot; if something occurs every night; &quot;Usually&quot; if it occurs 5 or 6 times a week; &quot;Sometimes&quot; if it occurs 2 to 4 times a week; &quot;Rarely&quot; if it occurs once a week; and &quot;Never&quot; if it occurs less than once a week. Each question is scored on a 3-point scale as 1 = Usually and Always (5-7 times/week); 2 = Sometimes&quot; (2-4 times/week); or 3 = Rarely and Never (0-1 time/week). The scores are combined from each subscale to generate a Total Sleep Disturbance Score, which can range from 22 to 66. A Total Sleep Disturbances score over 28 represent clinically significant sleep disturbance.</description>

    <measure>Eczema Area &amp; Severity Index (EASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The EASI is a tool used to measure the extent (area) and severity of AD. It does not include a grade for dryness or scaling and includes only inflamed areas. The area score is a 7-point scale representing the percentage of skin affected by AD for each body region. The severity score is recorded for each of the four regions of the body and is the sum of the intensity scores for four signs. The four signs include redness, thickness, scratching, and lichenification. The intensity scores are performed using a 4-pont scale. The final EASI score is the sum of the total scores for each region. Add up the total scores for each region to determine the final EASI score. The minimum EASI score is 0 and the maximum EASI score is 72.</description>

    <measure>Caregiver Burden Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CBI is a 24-item, five-subscale Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI) and demonstrates its use as a diagnostic tool for caregiver burden. The five subscales include: Time Dependency, Development, Physical Health, Emotional Health, and Social Relationships. Each subscale contains 4-5 items which are statements of feelings. Caregivers use a 5-point scale, anchored by &quot;0&quot; = &quot;Never&quot; and &quot;4&quot; = &quot;Nearly Always&quot;, to show how often the statement describes his/her feelings. Overall scores can range from 0 to 96, where a score near or above 36 indicates significant burden. All subscales have a maximum score of 20, except Physical Health which has a maximum score of 16. Subscale scores and item scores help identify the underlying cause of caregiver burden. This measure will be completed electronically on an iPad.</description>

    <description>The FDLQI is a 10-item questionnaire designed for adult family members of a patient with a skin disease. It measures the impact of the patient's skin disease on the family member's quality of life. The caregiver will answer each question using a 4-point scale: Not at all = 0, A Little = 1, Quite A Lot = 2, Very Much = 3. The scores from each item are summed to create a severity burden score (i.e., maximum score = 30). The scores represent degree of severity burden on quality of life: No effect = 0-1; Small effect = 2-6; Moderate effect = 7-12; Very large effect = 13-18; and Extremely large effect = 19-30.
