    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to train Church Leaders and other community members in Mental
      Health First Aid (MHFA), which is an evidence-based public mental health education program.
      MHFA has been found to improve people's recognition of emotional and mental health challenges
      and to increase people's confidence in providing help to others. Information about MHFA can
      be accessed at http://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org.

      MHFA consists an 8-hour training program in which participants will be provided a manual,
      learn the signs and symptoms of common mental health problems, and learn a 5-step action plan
      to help someone in an emotional crisis.

      Participants ware recruited from faith-based organizations (i.e., churches), health care
      organizations (i.e., hospitals), and other community based organizations. There will be no
      treatment directly provided as part of this study.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Stigma at 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Functional Health Status at 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short Form Survey Instrument (SF-12) is a validated functional health status assessment that assesses health status over the preceding 4 weeks. Measures include
General Health: 5-point Likert scale with 1 = Excellent and 5 = Poor
Physical Functioning: 3-point Likert scale with 1 = Yes, Limited a lot and 3 = No, Not Limited at all
Role limitations resulting from physical health problems: Possible responses are 'Yes' or 'No'
Role limitations resulting from emotional problems: Possible responses are 'Yes' or 'No'
Bodily Pain: 5-point Likert scale with 1 = Not at All and 5 = Extremely
Vitality (energy and fatigue):
Mental Health: 6-point Likert scale with 1 = All of the Time and 6 = None of the Time
Social Functioning: 6-point Likert scale with 1 = All of the Time and 6 = None of the Time Total Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating poorer health</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Semi structured Interviews at 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Semi-structured interviews are conducted with participants either over the telephone, in-person at their church or at the New York State Psychiatric Institute.
