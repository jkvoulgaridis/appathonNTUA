  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients of unilaterally displaced sacral fractures fixed with lumbopelvic technique or novel
      adjustable plate from June 2011 to June 2017 were recruited into this study and were divided
      into two groups: group A (lumbopelvic fixation) and groups B (novel adjustable plate).
      Surgical time, intraoperative blood loss, frequency of intraoperative fluoroscopy, reduction
      quality, related complications were reviewed. Fracture healing was assessed by the
      radiographs conducted at follow-up. Functional outcome was evaluated according to the Majeed
      score at the final follow-up.

    <textblock>
      Patients of unilateral displaced sacral fractures from June 2011 to June 2017 were recruited
      into this study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: 18-65 years, with normal activity
      ability before injury, fixed with lumbopelvic technique or novel adjustable plate, completed
      more than a year follow-up. The exclusion criteria were as follows: pathologic fractures,
      open fractures, associated with other severe injuries (traumatic brain injury), risk factors
      affecting bone healing (osteoporosis, smoking, and metabolic diseases) and non-completion of
      one-year follow-up. Surgical time, intraoperative blood loss, frequency of intraoperative
      fluoroscopy, related complications were reviewed. Reduction quality was assessed on the
      postoperative radiographs and CT scans. Functional outcome was evaluated according to the
      Majeed score system at the final follow-up.
