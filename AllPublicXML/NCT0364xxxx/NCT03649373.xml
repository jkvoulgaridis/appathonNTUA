      In this paper we describe and evaluate the results of the Noergaard technique through a
      retrospective analysis of patients admitted and treated for anterior shoulder dislocation at
      the ED of Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark, in a 1-year period.

      Introduction

      In this article the investigators describe the Noergaard technique for reduction of anterior
      shoulder dislocations. This is an atraumatic reduction method that has proven successful
      through several years of practice. The investigators describe and evaluate the results of
      this technique through a retrospective analysis of patients admitted and treated for anterior
      shoulder dislocation at the emergency department (ED) of Copenhagen University Hospital
      Hvidovre, Denmark, in a 1-year period.

      Methods

      In the Noergaard technique the patient is placed standing bend over forwards in front of the
      rail on a hospital bed, resting the forehead on the back of the non-affected forearm, which
      is put on the rail. The affected arm should now be relaxed and stretched, hanging straight
      down toward the floor. The patient is then instructed to attempt to relax and make pendular
      and circular motions with the affected arm hanging down.

    <description>We retrospectively reviewed patient charts of all patients admitted for shoulder dislocation at the ED at Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre between January 1st 2014 and December 31st 2014. A total of 151 patients' charts were reviewed.</description>

    <description>The patient is placed standing in an upright position in front of the rail on a hospital bed. Legs should be stretched with a wide well balanced stance. The patient is then instructed to bend forwards, resting the forehead on the back of the non-affected forearm, which is put on the rail. The affected arm should now be relaxed and stretched, hanging straight down toward the floor. The patient is then instructed to attempt to relax and make pendular and circular motions with the affected arm hanging down. Successful reduction occurs when sufficient muscle relaxation allows the humeral head to reposition to its natural position in the glenoid fossa. Often the patient will experience a popping sensation when the shoulder is reduced.</description>
