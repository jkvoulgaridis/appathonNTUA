  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, phase II trial to test the efficacy of Ibrutinib in
      combination with either Nivolumab or Cetuximab in the treatment of recurrent and/or
      metastatic head an neck squamous cell carcinoma
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Open-label, randomized, controlled, clinical trial. Enrollment will be stratified by HPV
      status and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either ibrutinib + cetuximab or ibrutinib + nivolumab

      The study will enroll patients who develop R/M HNSCC have not yet been treated with EGFR
      inhibitors in the recurrent/metastatic setting. All patients being considered for the study
      must be ≥ 18 years of age and will receive: i) ibrutinib + cetuximab or ii) ibrutinib +
      nivolumab.

      To determine the clinical efficacy of ibrutinib in combination with cetuximab or nivolumab in
      patients with R/M HNSCC.

      Ibrutinib will be supplied by Pharmacyclics as 140 mg hard gelatin capsules for oral (PO)
      administration.

      Cetuximab will be supplied as a clear, colorless liquid formulated for intravenous
      administration.

      Nivolumab will be supplied as a clear, colorless liquid formulated for intravenous
      administration.
