  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will create a treatment to improves mobility, physical activity, engagement in
      activities with family and friends and overall satisfaction with life for Veterans who have
      depression and anxiety after having a stroke. The treatment will then be tested to ensure it
      makes the desired improvements in the Veterans.

      The study has three aims. The first aim is to develop a client-centered, behavioral stroke
      self-management program (I'm Whole) for Veterans with stroke and psychological distress
      (e.g., symptoms of anxiety and/or depression). This will be done using expert input from a
      multidisciplinary team of a clinical psychologist, nurse practitioner, exercise physiologist
      and social role functioning expert will be used to create the I'm Whole patient workbook and
      clinician manual.

      The second aim is to pilot the I'm Whole treatment by delivering the intervention to 5
      Veterans suffering from stroke and comorbid depression and/or anxiety symptoms. The
      feasibility (barriers and facilitators to completing I'm Whole and acceptability of the
      intervention) will be assessed through qualitative interviews posttreatment. Veterans'
      feedback about ways to improve I'm Whole will be analyzed and used to improve treatment.

      The third aim is to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of I'm Whole on quality of
      life (primary outcome) physical functioning, physical activity, social role functioning,
      psychological distress, and satisfaction with I'm Whole (secondary outcomes). To test the
      feasibility and efficacy, a small randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 30 Veterans (15 I'm
      Whole and 15 education+usual care) with stroke and psychological distress will be conducted.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessments will be administered at 0, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks posttreatment</time_frame>
    <description>The scale assesses change in energy, language, vision, mobility, fine motor tasks, mood, personality and thinking, social roles, family roles and work productivity. Subscale scores will be reported for the energy, language, mobility, personality, mood, family roles, thinking, and social roles. The score range for each subscale is 1=need total help to 5=need no help at all.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke Impact Scale Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessments will be administered at 0, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks posttreatment</time_frame>
    <description>The scale assesses change in exercise, leisure time physical activity, indoor and outdoor household activity, wheelchair ambulation, employment-related activity, and rehabilitation therapy-related activity. The total score is reported and the total range will be provided. The score range is 1=All of the time 5=None of the time. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Activity and Disability Survey Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessments will be administered at 0, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks posttreatment</time_frame>
    <description>The survey measures change in exercise, leisure time physical activity, indoor and outdoor household activity, wheelchair ambulation, employment-related activity and rehabilitation therapy-related activity. Subscale scores will be reported for each 6 areas of exercise/activity. The subscale score is based on the self-reported amount of time an individual states they spend performing each exercise. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Index of Physical and Social Outcome Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessments will be administered at 0, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks posttreatment</time_frame>
    <description>The survey measures change in a patient's subjective assessment of his/her social integration after a stroke in physical and social components. The two subscale scores will be reported. The score range for each subscale is 0=poor integration to 4=highly integrated. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Community Integration Questionnaire Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessments will be administered at 0, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks posttreatment</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire measures change in home integration (i.e., market, meal preparation, household activities, finance), social integration (i.e., shopping, avocation, going out), and productive activity (i.e., work, school, volunteer activity). Subscale scores will be reported for each subscale. The score range for each subscale is 1=you yourself alone 3=someone else. Lower values represent a better outcome.</description>
