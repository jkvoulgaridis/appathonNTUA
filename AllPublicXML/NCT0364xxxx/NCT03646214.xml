  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many pregnant women suffer from poor sleep quality and snoring. Evidence shows an increasing
      association between (1) sleep disordered breathing and (2) maternal cardiovascular disease
      and in-hospital death. Snoring is a variant of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and OSA during
      pregnancy is associated with higher risks for cesarean delivery, gestational hypertension,
      preeclampsia and preterm delivery. It may also impact fetal outcomes negatively. The purpose
      of this study is to determine whether sleep quality can be improved in pregnant women who
      snore by means of an oral appliance that opens the airway. Sleep quality is evaluated
      objectively using an un-intrusive home sleep test system.

      As many as 20 percent of women suffer from snoring and poor sleep quality while pregnant. The
      purpose of this study is to determine whether sleep can be improved in pregnant women who
      snore by means of a midline traction oral appliance (OA) that opens the airway. This is an
      interventional study to objectively evaluate OA therapy on breathing during sleep as well as
      its effect on sleep quality. Pregnant women from all trimesters will be recruited. Each
      subject is expected to participate in the study for at least five (5) consecutive weeks. Home
      sleep recordings will be collected at three time points: T0 - Baseline prior to OA use for
      two consecutive nights; T1- first two consecutive nights wearing the OA; T2 - for two
      consecutive nights after 4 weeks of appliance use. In addition to the sleep studies performed
      at each of these time points, subjects will also complete several brief surveys. All
      participants will be given the opportunity to use their OAs after the 4 week period, and have
      their sleep recorded at 8 week intervals through the remainder of their pregnancies.
      Participants will get to keep and use their OAs after the study.

      Pregnant women who snore (or otherwise have poor sleep), may qualify to participate in this
      study. Those who do not want to wear an oral appliance, but are interested in learning about
      sleep quality while pregnant, may also qualify to participate as a control subject.
