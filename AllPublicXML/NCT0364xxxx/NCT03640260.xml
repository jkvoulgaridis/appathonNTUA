    <textblock>
      Dyspnea is the main reason that patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD) to
      sedentary. It's a vicious circle of deteriorating lung function. The heart rate
      various(HRV)biofeedback with respiratory regulation training had been reported to reduce
      dyspnea and improve regulatory physical activities in COPD. However, HRV is not available
      with patients in communities persistently, the arm of this study is to explore the effect of
      the pulse oximeter biofeedback with respiratory regulation training to improve physical
      activities in COPD. A 2-group, randomized design study, the subjects are GOLD stage II-IV
      COPD from a medical center hospital of the middle of Taiwan. The experiment cases will be
      taught the skills of evaluating oximeter data and performing correct pursed-lip with
      diaphragmatic breathing. All experiment and controlled patients have to fill out the
      demographic form, the modified British Medical Research Council (mMRC), the international
      physical Activity questionnaire- short form(IPAQ-SF), exercise self-regulation efficacy scale
      (Ex-SRES), COPD assessment test (CAT), and physical activity &amp; respiratory training diary in
      pre-intervention and 12 weeks later. The collective data will analyze with SPSS 22.0.

      Before subjects begin participation in any study-specific procedures, the investigators get
      institutional review board approval of the protocol, informed consent form, questionnaires
      and all subject information. A subject is considered enrolled when the investigator decides
      that the subject has met all eligibility criteria. All subjects must personally sign and date
      the IRB approved ICF before commencement of study-specific procedures. Each subject who
      enters the screening period for the study will receive a unique subject identification number
      before any study-related activities are performed. This number will be used to identify the
      subject throughout the study.

      116 subjects will spend 20~30 minutes to fill out based demographic forms, mMRC, CAT, IPAQ,
      Ex-SRES and simple emotion questionnaires, then be randomized by sealed envelope to 1 of 2
      arms. Under routine care, the experiment arm will get educational leaflets to pursed-lip with
      diaphragmatic breathing training and oximetry level evaluation. The controlled arm also has
      education leaflets but without breathing and oximetry level evaluation training. They be
      required to record respiratory regulation and physical activity diary while home care period
      up to first following out-patient department (about 12 weeks later). In the home care period,
      there are three times phone monitors to remind keep recording diary at first, forth and
      eighth week. Finally, mMRC, CAT, IPAQ and Ex-SRES will be finished again when first follow
      visit.
