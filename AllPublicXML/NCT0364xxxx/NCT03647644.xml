  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers are trying to reduce the need for blood transfusions in subjects having
      surgery that will involve the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. A unit of whole blood will be
      removed as part of their standard of care prior to going on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
      This unit is given back to the subject post CPB. This has been shown to reduce the need for
      blood transfusion in patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be asked to allow the researchers to take the blood left over from normal
      standard of care blood draws and do coagulation testing. If clinically indicated, the blood,
      about 2 units, will be withdrawn from the subject. The researchers will also collect 8 ml
      (less than two teaspoons) of blood through the catheter that was placed as part of standard
      of care.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Platelet count</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 30 minutes after cardiopulmonary bypass</time_frame>
    <description>A platelet is a tiny piece of cell that is made by breaking off of a large cell in the bone marrow. Platelets are found in the blood and spleen. They help form blood clots to slow or stop bleeding, and to help wounds heal. Also called thrombocyte. Normal platelet count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. Units: 10(9)/L</description>

    <measure>Change in Fibrinogen</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 30 minutes after cardiopulmonary bypass</time_frame>
    <description>Component of blood that aids in coagulation. Also known as a blood coagulation factor. Normal reference range 200-393 mg/dL.</description>

    <measure>Change in Prothrombin Time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 30 minutes after cardiopulmonary bypass</time_frame>
    <description>Laboratory test that measures the clotting ability of blood and is a marker for the amount and functionality of the clotting factors in the blood. Normal reference range 0.9-1.1 seconds</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in aPTT</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 30 minutes after cardiopulmonary bypass</time_frame>
    <description>Laboratory test that measures the clotting ability of blood and is a marker for the amount and functionality of the clotting factors in the blood. Normal reference range 25-37 seconds.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Thromboelastogram</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 30 minutes after cardiopulmonary bypass</time_frame>
    <description>Laboratory test that looks at the bloods ability to form a clot and the the strength of the blood clot. It looks at all the components that allow blood to clot as a whole. The visual shape of the test along with objective data provide diagnostic information about normal or abnormal conditions of blood coagulation.</description>

    <description>All patients enrolled in the study will undergo a perioperative cardiac surgical anesthetic care plan standardized to the current institutional protocol utilized for intraoperative medication administration. If clinically indicated and appropriate per the discretion of the anesthesiologist, Acute Normovolemic Hemodilution (ANH) blood, about 2 units, will be withdrawn from the patients and stored carefully at room temperature per standard protocol. At the conclusion of cardiopulmonary bypass and after protamine administration, Coagulation Laboratory Testing will be drawn from the patients prior to re-infusing the ANH blood and after the blood has been infused per standard institutional protocol.</description>

    <description>All patients enrolled in the study will undergo a perioperative cardiac surgical anesthetic care plan standardized to the current institutional protocol utilized for intraoperative medication administration. In this arm, ANH would be clinically appropriate, however, the anesthesiologist determined they would not have ANH preformed. At the conclusion of cardiopulmonary bypass and after protamine administration, Coagulation Laboratory Testing will be drawn from the patients and again 30 minutes later to mirror the time lapse in the ANH group.</description>

        Subjects are those who are scheduled to undergo elective cardiac surgery. Researchers
        identify patients who based on our institutional practice would be candidates for ANH which
        has been shown to reduce bleeding and transfusion in cardiac surgical patients. These
        patients are consented to participate in the study, and are then followed through their
        operative day and laboratory results recorded. Patients are not randomized to any treatment
        arm as part of this study and it is up to the covering anesthesiologist as to whether or
        not a patient with undergo ANH or not (become a control).
