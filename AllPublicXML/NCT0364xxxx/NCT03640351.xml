  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today, cataract surgery has become one of the safest and most effective eye surgical
      procedures performed on many people through the development and development of surgical
      techniques and instruments. However, a significant number of patients who underwent cataract
      surgery still complain about postoperative symptoms, such as irritation, pain, dryness,
      burning sensation, and foreign body sensation. The reasons of dry eye (DE) development after
      cataract surgery include thermal and light toxicity from the microscope, corneal epithelial
      damage, and frequent irrigation of ocular surface during operation, sterilization of
      conjunctival sac and eyelid with chemicals, transection of the corneal nerves by corneal
      incision, use of topical anesthetics, and preservatives in topical eye drops. In this era of
      high expectation of patients and premium intraocular lenses, the postoperative discomforts
      cannot be accepted to many patients. Several studies have recently reported that the common
      cause of postoperative symptoms of the patients is DE. Furthermore, if the ocular surface is
      deformed due to DE syndrome after surgery, the optical quality is greatly affected which
      results in a decrease of the quality of vision. If the tear film becomes irregular, the
      higher-order aberration can change due to local irregular total radius of curvature of ocular
      surface and result in decreased visual acuity.

      There have been many attempts to treat DE syndrome after cataract surgery. Artificial tears
      are commonly used for the first line treatment of postoperative DE and several studies
      revealed its effectiveness on management of DE symptoms and signs. The postoperative use of
      cyclosporine 0.05 % topical eye drop improved DE symptoms and visual quality after cataract
      surgery. Recently, diquafosol sodium ophthalmic solution has been used for the management of
      DE after cataract. Diquafosol is a dinucleotide derivative and functions as agonist to the
      purinergic P2Y2 receptor. Diquafosol is known to stimulate not only the mucin secretion from
      the goblet cells but also water secretion from conjunctival epithelial cells and accessory
      lacrimal glands. According to previous studies, diquafosol has been found to be very
      effective in treating DE after cataract and to alleviate symptoms of DE syndrome.
      Furthermore, several studies have shown that topical diquafosol has a better efficacy in
      managing DE after cataract surgery than artificial tears. The preservative free diquafosol
      ophthalmic solution has been released recently. The use of eye drops without preservatives
      has also been shown to play an important role in the treatment of DE after cataract surgery.
      Until now, there is no study that evaluated the effect of preservative free diquafosol
      ophthalmic solution. Thus the investigators try to investigate the efficacy of preservative
      free diquafosol ophthalmic solution compared to preservative containing diquafosol ophthalmic
      solution and sodium hyaluronate ophthalmic solution, which are widely used in patients with
      DE after cataract surgery.

      Enrollment period : 24 months after IRB approval Participants : The subjects over 20 years
      old, who visited Severance hospital for cataract surgery and has dry eye. The participants
      who satisfies criteria, and who can be monitored at all times during each period of
      observation after surgery are included in the study.

      Methods: The subjects are randomly divided into three groups. Group 1 will use preservative
      diquafosol ophthalmic solution, Group 2 will use preservative containing diquafosol
      ophthalmic solution, and Group 3 will use preservative free sodium hyaluronate after cataract
      surgery. Before surgery, all patients underwent a detailed ophthalmological examination that
      included evaluation of logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR)
      uncorrected-distance visual acuity (UDVA) and CDVA, manifest refraction, slit-lamp
      examination (Haag-Streit, Köniz, Switzerland), and dry eye parameters including tear breakup
      time, schirmer test, OSDI, and MGD staging. All examinations were repeated at 1, and 3 months
      after surgery.
