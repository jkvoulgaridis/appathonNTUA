      The proposed study aims to examine the effectiveness of Nanit-Insights, an app-based
      intervention for parents who wish to improve their infant's sleep. The intervention provides
      parents with daily sleep metrics as well as personalized sleep recommendations, based on
      their infant's developmental stage and weekly sleep data.

      Participants will be parents of 5-7 month-old infants, randomized into one of two groups: (1)
      the intervention group, which will include users who have purchased the baby monitor without
      subscribing to Nanit Insights and are then offered a six month subscription to Nanit-Insights
      when their baby is 5-7 months of age; and (2) the control group, which will include users of
      the baby monitor, who have not subscribed to Nanit-Insights.

      Each group will include approximately 150 families.

      Sleep will be assessed at baseline and 3- and 6-months following the beginning of the
      intervention. Computer vision technology will be used to assess infant sleep, as well as
      parental adherence to the intervention, allowing us to determine whether adherence mediates
      sleep benefits.

      The results of this study are expected to evaluate the effectiveness of a low-cost, app-based
      intervention for infant sleep problems. Furthermore, the results may broaden the
      understanding of the mediating role of parent adherence in such interventions.

    <description>Change from baseline in parent-reported sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at 3 and 6 month follow ups. The PSQI is comprised of 10 questions, from which the following subscales are generated: sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep disturbances, and daytime-dysfunction. Items are open-ended or rated on a 4-point scale, and higher scores represent poorer sleep.</description>
