    <textblock>
      The MTN-041 study is a multi-site exploratory study using focus group discussions (FGDs) and
      in-depth interviews (IDIs) to identify individual, interpersonal, social and cultural factors
      that may affect potential uptake of two safe and effective HIV prevention products, the
      monthly dapivirine (DPV) vaginal ring (VR) and daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), by
      pregnant and breastfeeding women in Africa.

      MTN-041 is an exploratory study primarily designed to identify individual, interpersonal,
      social and cultural factors that may affect potential uptake of two safe and effective HIV
      prevention products, the monthly DPV VR and daily oral PrEP, in a vulnerable yet
      seldom-studied population, pregnant and breastfeeding women. MTN-041 will utilize FGDs and
      IDIs to elicit community and health professional perceptions about vaginal practices, sexual
      activity, use of medicines, and HIV risk during pregnancy or breastfeeding, including how
      these perceptions may affect pregnant and breastfeeding women's acceptability of using
      intravaginal products and oral medications like the DPV VR and Truvada oral tablet.

      The MTN-041 study population will consist of HIV-uninfected women 18-40 years old who are
      currently or were recently (within two years) pregnant or breastfeeding, men aged 18 years or
      older whose partners are currently or were recently (within two years) pregnant or
      breastfeeding, grandmothers whose daughters or daughters-in-law are currently or were
      recently (within two years) pregnant or breastfeeding, and key informants (KIs), which
      include: health care professionals (HCPs), traditional birth attendants (TBAs), providers of
      family planning, antenatal, and traditional health services to women, providers of other
      social services to women, and community leaders.

      Up to 60 men and women will be selected at each site for participation in this study, for a
      maximum total of 240 study participants. This includes up to 50 FGD participants (currently
      or recently pregnant or breastfeeding women, male partners of women who are currently or were
      recently pregnant or breastfeeding, and grandmothers with currently or recently pregnant or
      breastfeeding daughters/daughters-in-law) and up to 10 KIs selected at each site, for a
      maximum total of 200 FGD participants and 40 KIs enrolled across all sites.
