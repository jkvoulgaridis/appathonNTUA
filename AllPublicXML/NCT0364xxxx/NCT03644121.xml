  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of OSA is aimed to improve symptoms and mitigate reduce other health
      consequences. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is the recognized treatment for OSA,
      able to reverse the pathophysiology of OSA and improving sleep continuity, resulting in
      improvements in daytime sleepiness and quality of life (QoL). However, low adherence to this
      treatment reduces the potential to achieve these benefits. The aim of this real life
      retrospective observational study was to assess the adherence to CPAP at 12 month and 10
      years. The investigators evaluated also predicitve factors of adherence.

      Methods The protocol was approved (2215 CE, June, 19, 2018) by the Ethical Committee of the
      Istituti Clinici Scientifici (ICS) Maugeri, Pavia, Italy. All patients at admission to the
      Scientific Institute of Tradate gave the informed consent to the scientific use of their
      data.

      Study Participants This study was conducted on a database of patients' discharge records,
      available between August, 2006 and December, 2009.

      Adaptation to CPAP: titration of CPAP was performed either by full-night manual titration
      according to the AASM Guidelines or by automatic titration with Auto-Set systems. Further 4
      day-time hours of adaptation were performed along two days. Patients underwent also four face
      to face sessions with the respiratory therapist, for feed-back of adaptation, optimal
      comprehension of procedure of CPAP management. The presence of a caregiver (if any) was
      strongly suggested.

      Statistical Analysis An ad hoc electronic form was created to collect all study variables.
      Qualitative variables were described with absolute and relative (percentages) frequencies,
      whereas quantitative variables were summarized with means (standard deviations) or medians
      (interquartile ranges) based on their normal distribution, respectively.

      In-between comparison for qualitative and quantitative variables was performed with the
      chi-squared or Fisher exact test when appropriate, and Student t or Mann-Whitney test in case
      of parametric or non-parametric distribution, respectively. Comparison of the temporal
      variation of continuous variables for the same group was assessed with Anova or Friedman's
      test, depending on their normal distribution.

      Uni- and multi-variable logistic regression analysis was performed to assess which covariates
      could be associated with the adherence to CPAP.

      A two-tailed p-value &lt;0.05 was considered significant. All statistical analyses were carried
      out using the statistical software STATA version 15 (StatsCorp, Texas).

    <description>Epworth Sleepness Scale (ESS).The questionnaire asks the subject to rate his/her probability of falling asleep on a scale of increasing probability from 0 to 3 for eight different situations that most people engage in during their daily lives. The scores for the eight questions are added together to obtain a single number. A number in the 0-9 range is considered to be normal while a number in the 10-24 range indicates that expert medical advice should be sought</description>

        Patients with diagnosis of OSA. According to the International Classification of Sleep
        Disorders, OSA was defined as the presence of 5 or more obstructive respiratory events
        (apnea, hypopnea or respiratory effort-related arousal) per hour of sleep plus daytime or
        nighttime symptoms of OSA, alternatively as the presence of 15 or more obstructive
        respiratory events per hour of sleep
