  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a speech-to-noise feedback procedure for the
      treatment of hypophonia in Parkinson's disease. The procedure includes a device that records
      the sound intensity level of the wearer's speech and compares it to the noise level around
      them. The device will provide the wearer with feedback if their speech becomes too quiet for
      them to be heard by their listener.

    <measure>Percent Speech Intelligibility Score (PSIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Single two-hour visit.</time_frame>
    <description>PSIS is the percentage of words that can be correctly understood by a person listening (listener) to the participant's speech while they read sentences aloud. The PSIS ranges from 0% to 100%. This is a total score. Higher PSIS are considered better. The PSIS are obtained using communication partners (i.e. spouse) who listen and provide live repetitions of the spoken sentences. The spoken repetitions are transcribed by the investigators and compared to the printed reading material to calculate the percent of correctly transcribed words. The result is the PSIS referenced to a familiar listener (i.e. communication partner). The participant's spoken sentences are audio recorded and played to naïve listeners who provide written transcriptions of the participant's spoken sentences. The naïve listener transcribed sentences are compared to the printed reading material and the percent of correctly transcribed words is calculated. The result is the PSIS referenced to a naïve listener.</description>

    <measure>Ratings of Experience with the Device</measure>
    <time_frame>Single two-hour visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rate their device experience with 5 visual-analogue scales (VAS) for 5 parameters. Participants see a 10cm horizontal line with end points and place a vertical line for their rating. Left is a poorer rating and right is a better rating. Parameter 1 is 'physical comfort' with left as 'uncomfortable' and right as 'comfortable'. Parameter 2 is 'visual presentation' with left as 'unacceptable' and right as 'acceptable'. Parameter 3 is 'response to feedback' with 'bothersome' (left) and 'not bothersome' (right). Parameter 4 is 'speech intensity' with 'too quiet' (left) and 'too loud' (right). Parameter 5 is 'overall preference' with 'low preference' (left) and 'high preference' (right). Vertical lines placed on the VAS are measured by hand from the left end and expressed as percent of the total VAS line. The 5 device experience parameter ratings are expressed as separate percentage VAS scores and will not be used to calculate a total score.</description>
