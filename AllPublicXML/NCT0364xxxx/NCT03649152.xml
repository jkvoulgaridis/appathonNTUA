    <textblock>
      This study will be evaluating the safety and efficacy of propagermanium for the treatment of
      participants with FSGS who are already taking irbesartan by:

        -  monitoring symptoms that participants may experience while on the study,

        -  measuring levels of protein in participant's urine and kidney function during the course
           of the study,

        -  measuring the levels of propagermanium and irbesartan that enters into participant's
           urine and blood, and

        -  comparing the propagermanium outcomes to participants' pre-study and placebo outcomes.

      Eligible participants will randomly be assigned to one of two arms to receive both the
      propagermanium and placebo in different orders as follows, either:

      Treatment Period 1 taking a propagermanium capsule twice a day for 16 weeks, followed by a
      six week washout period followed by Treatment Period 2 taking a placebo capsule twice a day
      for 16 weeks.

      OR Treatment Period 1 taking a placebo capsule twice a day for 16 weeks, followed by a six
      week washout period followed by Treatment Period 2 taking a propagermanium capsule twice a
      day for 16 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Aged 18 to 80 (inclusive) at screening;

          2. A diagnosis of primary FSGS confirmed by renal biopsy;

          3. Must be receiving a stable dose of 300 mg daily dose of irbesartan (in any marketed
             formulation) for at least 3 months prior to screening, and have no plan to change
             treatment regime throughout the study;

          4. Patients can be on stable doses of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors,
             aldosterone inhibitors, direct renin inhibitor and/or sodium-glucose co-transporter- 2
             inhibitors. However, the dose and regimen must be stable for 3 months prior to
             screening and must have no plan to change treatment regime throughout the study.

          5. If taking immunosuppressive medications (except for rituximab or cyclophosphamide),
             must have a stable treatment regime for 3 months prior to screening and do not have
             plans to alter the regimen except to maintain therapeutic immunosuppression or in the
             event of adverse events. Patients who have received rituximab or cyclophosphamide must
             have ceased treatment for at least 6 months prior to screening;

          6. Mean of two protein/creatinine ratio values (screening and baseline) of ≥ 1326 mg/g

                  high follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] level in the postmenopausal range may be
                  used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception
                  or hormonal replacement therapy; however, in the absence of 12 months of
                  amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.);

               -  Of childbearing potential and agrees to use a highly effective method of
                  contraception consistently during the treatment period and for at least 60 days

         10. A male patient with a female partner of childbearing potential is eligible to
             participate if he agrees to use acceptable contraception during the treatment period
             and for at least 60 days after the last dose of investigational product and refrains
             from donating sperm during this period;

         11. Have given written informed consent prior to any study procedures being performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:
