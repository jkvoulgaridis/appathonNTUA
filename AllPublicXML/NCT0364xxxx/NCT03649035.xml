  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer represents the 11th most commonly diagnosed cancer in men and 9th in women,
      being the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the Western countries. Pancreatic
      cancer has a very poor prognosis and median overall survival is less than 5 months in
      population-based studies. Approximately 80% of patients with pancreatic cancer present with
      unresectable disease, which is either due to locally advanced or metastatic disease. About
      40% of patients have metastases at the time of diagnosis and in another 30 to 40 % of the
      patients tumour resection is not feasible because of vascular invasion, or poor general
      conditions. In resectable patients surgical resection with negative margins (R0) continues to
      be worldwide considered the only chance to cure, however, this standard treatment is usually
      reserved to a small number of patients. In patients with locally advanced tumour, neoadjuvant
      treatment has been proposed in various modalities as a way to decrease size and downstage the
      tumour leading to a resectable disease. Several phase I - II studies have shown the
      capability of chemotherapy alone or chemo radiotherapy based regimens to increase the
      resection rates of these patients and the related median overall survival.

      Systemic chemotherapy followed by chemoRT or stereotattic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is an
      option for selected patients with unresectable disease and good PS who have not developed
      metastatic disease.

      This sequence is especially recommended in cases in which it is highly unlikely that the
      patient will become resectable (ie, complete encasement of SMA/superior celiac artery). Due
      to the significant rate of toxicity of the radio therapy (RT) treatment alone or in adjunct
      to chemotherapy, other local treatments with the goal to downstage the primary tumour with
      less or no toxicity as compared to RT have been proposed.

      Radiofrequency (RF) has been used with success in solid cancers like the hepatocellular
      carcinoma while cryoablation has been used for breast and renal cancers. RFA has been applied
      in few clinical trials in human pancreatic cancer either without any imaging guidance or just
      under intra-operatory ultrasound control during palliative open surgery.

      The HybridTherm probe (HTP), (ERBE Elektromedizin GmbH, Tübingen, Germany) combines bipolar
      RF-ablation with cryogenic induced cooling. A bipolar radiofrequency system creates ablation
      with less collateral thermal damage than standard monopolar systems but with the trade-off to
      lose overall efficiency.

      In a recent in-vivo study the feasibility of the HTP in patients with unresectable locally
      advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma has been shown. HTP has been applied under EUS-guidance to
      patients who have been already treated by chemotherapy (two lines) and in many cases with the
      adjunct of RT.

    <description>To demonstrate the efficacy of the HybridTherm probe in the control of the tumour progression in terms of progression-free survival, measured at 6-month after therapy onset (PFS-6) by MRI. PFS-6 takes in consideration the tumour growth in relation to the volume/size evaluated as a difference between the previous and the current examination.
In practice, it is the time interval between the enrolment of the patient and the first radiological evidence of tumor progression.</description>

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Only patients with pathologically proven, locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic
             adenocarcinoma will be selected.

          -  The criteria for unresectability will be: encasement or thrombosis of one or more
             large vessels surrounding the pancreas (celiac axis, portal vein, and/or superior
             mesenteric artery and/or vein, and/or hepatic artery, except the splenic vessels);
             infiltration of the vessel wall or contact 180° for more than 2 cm length, with
             initial stricture of the vessel or alteration of the Doppler signal (each patient will
             undergo thoracic and abdominal-CT with contrast medium to check resectability and
             detect the absence of distant metastasis).

        Esclusion criteria:

          -  Patients with pancreatic tumors other than pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC)

          -  Patients with resectable, borderline resectable or metastatic PDAC
