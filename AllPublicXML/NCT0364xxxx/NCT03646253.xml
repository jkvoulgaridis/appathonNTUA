  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fractures of the proximal humerus are increasingly frequent, with numbers tripling between
      the 1970s and the 2000s. Among these fractures, those involving the tuberosities and also the
      anatomic neck are a therapeutic challenge. For this type of fracture (Neer's four-part
      fracture) the degree of displacement of the fracture needs to be understood in order to
      provide suitable treatment and apprehend the risks in its evolution. There is indeed, in this
      type of fracture, a risk of humeral head ischaemia, which will carry considerable weight in
      the therapy adopted.

      The usual classifications, such as the AO or the Neer classification, have shown their
      limitations in terms of reproducibility and are not suitable for the prognostic assessment of
      these four-fragment fractures of the proximal humerus. The radiographic parameters described
      by Hertel in 2004, on the other hand, seem to be far more relevant to routine clinical
      practice.

      The use of the scanner to improve reproducibility of the classification of these proximal
      humerus fractures is still controversial. The scanner is the rule to guide therapeutic
      strategy for complex fractures, although the reproducibility of the different assessment
      criteria has never been studied.

      The aims of the present study were firstly to analyse inter-observer and intra-observer
      reproducibility for the different criteria proposed by Hertel, using three types of imagery
      (standard radiographies, 2D and 3D scans) and secondly to assess the relevance of the use of
      the scanner to improve reproducibility
