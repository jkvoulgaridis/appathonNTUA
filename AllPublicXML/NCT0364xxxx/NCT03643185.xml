  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to determine whether the levels of different inflammatory
      cytokines in the serum and BALF (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) are relative to the severity
      and exacerbations of ABPA (allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis).

  <detailed_description>

      The study would record patients' medical data at baseline and follow them up for different
      period of time. Updated data would be recorded and blood( or BALF) of the patients would be
      drawn for tests or stored as whole blood or serum at -80℃ when patients visit the hospital.
      Then the cytokine (A panel set by the manufacturer) of the serum and BALF would be tested .
      The secretion ability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells would also be verified. The
      investigators would then analyze the data and see if any cytokine is relative to the
      exacerbation or other indicators of the severity of ABPA.

        ABPA patients who were or would be hospitalized in Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital would be
        recruited. They would receive standard treatment of ABPA and be asked to visit the clinic
        again one month later after they start taking glucocorticoids. they are also asked to visit
        the clinic every three month to monitor the change of serum IgE and their condition.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients diagnosed as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). The diagnosis
             criteria of ABPA is as following: clinical diagnosis of asthma, elevated total IgE
             levels (&gt; 1,000 IU/mL), presence of specific IgE against A fumigatus detected (&gt; 0.35
             kUA/L) or type 1 skin reaction to Aspergillus antigen. Other criteria(at least two of
             three): Presence of serum IgG antibodies (precipitins) against A. fumigatus;
             Radiographic pulmonary opacities consistent with ABPA(It might be transient
             consolidation, nodules, finger-in-glove opacities. Or it could be permanent
             bronchiectasis and pleuropulmonary fibrosis) Patients who sighed consent forms.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are unwilling to sign the consent form.

          -  Patients under 18 years old
