  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing elective meningeoma resection surgery will be randomly assigned to one of
      the following two groups. After anesthesia induction but before skull-pin insertion, one
      group will receive scalp nerve blocks with 0.5% ropivacaine, whereas the other group will
      receive scalp nerve blocks with 0.9% saline. The patients' postoperative recovery quality,
      which is evaluated by KPS score, peri-operative inflammatory responses, and post-operative
      pain degree will be evaluated and compared between the two groups.

      group will receive scalp nerve blocks with 0.5% ropivacaine, whereas the other group will
      receive scalp nerve blocks with 0.9% saline. The patients' KPS scores at 3d after surgery and
      at discharge, serum levels of TNF-α、IL-6，IL-1β at 24h after surgery, satisfaction score after
      recovery, and VAS scores at 1, 2, 3 days post-surgery will be evaluated and compared between
      the two groups.
