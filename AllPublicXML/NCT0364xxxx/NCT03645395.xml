      This is a multi-center, open-label two-part study evaluating the safety and tolerability of
      MT-3724 in combination with Lenalidomide in relapsed or refractory positive B-cell Lymphoma
      patients.

      Part 1: (MT-3724 Dose Escalation) Define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MT-3724 in
      combination with standard treatment of Lenalidomide

      Part 2: (MTD Expansion Cohort) Confirm the safety and tolerability of the MTD of MT-3724 from
      Part 1 in the MTD Expansion Cohort, where MT-3724 will be given at the MTD in combination
      with Lenalidomide. In addition, the PK, PD, immunogenicity and tumor response at the MTD of
      MT-3724 in combination with Lenalidomide will be more thoroughly evaluated in Part 2.

      It is anticipated that up to 64 patients will be enrolled. Treatment will continue for up to
      Six 28 day cycles (approximately 6 months)
