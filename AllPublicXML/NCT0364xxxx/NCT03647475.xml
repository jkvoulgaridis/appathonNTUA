  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the clinical safety and effectiveness of the
      Resolute Onyx stent in subjects deemed at high risk for bleeding and/or medically unsuitable
      for more than 1 month DAPT treatment receiving reduced duration (1 month) of DAPT following
      stent implantation.
