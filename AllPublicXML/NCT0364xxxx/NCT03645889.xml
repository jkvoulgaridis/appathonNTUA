  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchial Asthma is a common childhood chronic disease characterized by chronic inflammation
      of the airways. Frequent relapse of asthma has serious impacts on the child's growth, impairs
      quality of life (QoL) and mortality, posing a huge economic burden on both family and
      society. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) principles and theory, the main
      reason for children suffering from asthma are congenital deficiencies at birth which were not
      corrected and/or lack of appropriate care in the early childhood, leading to insufficiency of
      the lung, spleen and kidney, resulting in susceptibility to external pathogenic factors.
      During the interval phase of the illness, wheezing is not prominent and the &quot;Lung-Spleen Qi
      Deficiency&quot; (LSQD) syndrome is most commonly seen. TCM treatment aims to strengthen the
      body's immune system by nourishing the spleen, replenishing &quot;Qi&quot;(vital energy), tonifying the
      lungs and strengthening the exterior, thereby reducing incidences of relapse and improve QoL.
      It is hypothesized that TCM has adjuvant roles in the management of mild-moderate childhood
      asthma. Hence the primary aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of using herbal
      TCM as adjuvant therapy in the management of symptoms and QoL in asthmatic patients. A
      randomized, double-blind cross-sectional, 2-arms placebo-controlled study will be carried
      out. Pediatric patients with mild-moderate asthma identified with LSQD will be randomized to
      either control or treatment group. Study participants in control group will continue their
      conventional western medicine (CWM) while those in TCM group will consume a decoction of
      herbal TCM for 12-weeks in addition to their CWM. Pulmonary function tests, Asthma Control
      Test, QoL and TCM questionnaires will be used as outcome measurement tools. In addition,
      liver and kidneys functions will be monitored for signs of toxicity.

      It is hypothesized that herbal Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has adjuvant roles in the

      The primary aim of the study is to investigate the efficacy of using herbal TCM as adjuvant
      therapy in the management of symptoms and quality of life in asthmatic patients.

      The secondary aim of the study is to investigate the improvement in pulmonary function test
      (PFT) and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) test in asthmatic patients taking herbal TCM
      adjuvant therapy, and to monitor the safety profile of herbal TCM with regards to renal and
      liver functions.
