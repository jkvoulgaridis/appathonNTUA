  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent alcohol tobacco and drug (ATOD) use is a major public health concern, with rates
      for Latino middle school youth higher than other ethnic groups. One well-established
      precursor of adolescent ATOD use is psychosocial stress. The overall aim of this project is
      to test the efficacy of a culturally appropriate psychosocial program to prevent or reduce
      ATOD use among Latino immigrant youth (ages 13 to 16). The intervention consists of: (1)
      encouraging parental involvement in child schooling, general parenting skills, and coping
      strategies ; (2) fostering child social emotional learning (SEL) through assigning a
      near-peer success coach to help develop critical thinking, problem solving, and goal setting
      skills; and (3) promoting positive peer affiliations through participation in regular
      activities that facilitate bonding to prosocial institutions. The three specific aims are:

        1. Evaluate the efficacy of the intervention to delay the initiation into or reduce ATOD
           use among Latino adolescents with one or more undocumented parent.

        2. Evaluate the efficacy of the intervention in reducing stress exposure in youth and
           parents

        3. Evaluate the impact of the intervention on strengthening known protective factors,
           specifically child SEL and parent-child, peer, and school relationships and the role of
           these factors as buffers against stress.

      The study's primary hypothesis is: The Unidos Se Puede program will delay initiation of ATOD
      use of current non-users or reduce use among current users.

      Two cohorts of Latino youth and their parents (n=200 dyads each (n=100 treatment and n=100
      control); N=400 dyad) with staggered start dates will be recruited from a random sample of
      Latino 7th graders and screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria. Those meeting the criteria
      and agreeing to participate will provide baseline data before being randomly assigned to
      either the treatment or control condition. Participants will be followed for 30 months
      (beginning of 7th grade (baseline), end of 7th, 8th, and 9th grades). The study will collect
      psychosocial measures and biomarker data, used to create an objective measure of stress and
      ATOD use.
