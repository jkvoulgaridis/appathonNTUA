  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to compare implant stability of Hiossen ET III implants with its new
      hydrophilic surface (NH) and Hiossen ET III implants with the SA surface.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients required at least two teeth to be rehabilitated with a fixed, implant-supported
      restoration, consecutively enrolled. Patients randomly received Sandblasted and Acid-etched
      (SA) surface implants (SA group) or SA implants with a newly developed bio-absorbable apatite
      nano coating (NH group). Outcome measures were: implant and prosthetic survival rate,
      complications, insertion torque, and implant stability quotient (ISQ) measured at implant
      placement and every week up to 8 weeks after implant placement. Comparison between groups was
      made by unpaired t test, while comparison between each follow-up will be made by paired t
      tests to detect any change during the follow-up. Complications and failures were compared by
      using Fisher exact test.

    <intervention_model_description>To randomly compare implant stability quotient (ISQ) of Hiossen ET III implants with its new hydrophilic surface (NH) and Hiossen ET III implants with the conventional SA surface, in a split-mouth randomized study.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>A blinded collaborator opened the opaque envelope after implant site development, giving the implant to the investigator that remain blinded. Both the test and control implants are perfectly the same.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Implant and prosthetic success rates</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months after implant placement (baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Success rates of the implants and prostheses were evaluated by an independent assessor (EX). An implant was considered a failure if it presented mobility, assessed after the osseointegration period by tapping or rocking the implant head with the metallic handles of two instruments, progressive marginal bone loss or infection, or any mechanical complications rendering the implant unusable, although still mechanically stable in the bone. A prosthesis was considered a failure if it needed to be replaced with another prosthesis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Technical or biological complications</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months after implant placement</time_frame>
    <description>Any biological complication, such as pain, swelling, and or suppuration, as well as any technical complication, such as screw loosening, fracture of the framework and/or the veneering material will be recorded during the follow-up period. Complications were evaluated and treated by the same surgeon (MT).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Implant stability quotient (ISQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Each week (after implant placement) up to 8 weeks, and then 12 weeks (after implant placement)</time_frame>
    <description>Implant stability quotient (ISQ) values were recorded each week up to 8 weeks, and then after 12 weeks, using resonance frequency analysis (Osstell Mentor device, Osstell, Gothenburg, Sweden). Each implant was measured twice. First in a messy-distal direction and then in a buck-lingual direction. The mean value was recorded.</description>
