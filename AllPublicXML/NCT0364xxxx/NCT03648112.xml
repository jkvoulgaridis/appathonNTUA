  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The interventional study will evaluate the effects of a regularly consumption of barley and
      oat flakes in crude and roasted form on the glucose and lipid metabolism as well as the
      postprandial saturation. Moreover, the study will evaluate the effect of a regularly
      consumption of barley and oat flakes on the glucose and lipid metabolism over a period of
      three weeks.

      All participants will run through each intervention (cross-over design). Inbetween these
      intervention periods there will be wash-out phases. In total there will be four
      interventions: crude oat flakes, roasted oat flakes, crude barley flakes and roasted barley
      flakes. The comparison will be made against white toastbread. The study participants will
      visit the study centrum before and after each intervention over an entire period of 27 weeks.

      The interventional study will evaluate the effects of a regularly consumption of barley and
      oat flakes in crude and roasted form on the glucose and lipid metabolism as well as the
      postprandial saturation. Moreover, the study will evaluate the effect of a regularly
      consumption of barley and oat flakes on the glucose and lipid metabolism over a period of
      three weeks.

      By applying the cross-over design, all participants will run through each intervention. In
      total there will be four interventions: crude oat flakes, roasted oat flakes, crude barley
      flakes and roasted barley flakes. Each intervention period will last three weeks and will be
      separated by wash-out phases which also will last three weeks. The comparison will be made
      against white toastbread, which will be the fifth intervention. The entire duration of the
      study will be 27 weeks (5x 3 weeks intervention + 4x 3 weeks wash-out phases inbetween).

      The participants will visit the study centrum before and after each intervention for
      examinations and for taking blood samples. During the examination the participants will
      receive a test-meal to evaluate postprandial blood glucose and insulin levels. Moreover, the
      kinetic of hormones that influence the satiety will be evaluated. In addition to the
      examination of blood samples, the microbiota of feces will be examined.

      During the intervention periods the participants will receive recipes for breakfast for 21
      days. In these recipes 80 gram oat or barley flakes or four slices of white toastbread will
      be included.

      The study will provide data about the association between different processed cereals and
      measurable markers reflecting glucose and lipid metabolism as well as their influence on
      hormones of satiety and microbiota.
