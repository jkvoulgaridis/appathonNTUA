  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study on the effectiveness of computerized cognitive training for treatment of
      memory disorders in patients with epilepsy. Participants will be recruited from patients
      referred for neuropsychological assessment through the NYU Comprehensive Epilepsy Center's
      inpatient and outpatient services. Individuals meeting inclusion criteria will be screened
      for the presence of memory disturbance (defined by results of neuropsychological testing) and
      lack of exposure to any previous form of computerized cognitive training. All eligible
      subjects will be provided with an account for Lumosity with instructions to complete training
      modules 5 days per week for a total of 8 consecutive weeks. Outcomes will be evaluated
      through changes on the neuropsychological test battery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented diagnosis of epilepsy based on medical records. The records will be

             epilepsy has been made.

          -  Presence of memory disturbance, as defined by an immediate or delayed memory index
             score &lt; 85 on the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status
             (RBANS)

          -  Availability of a home computer and internet for access to the computer training
             program.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Full Scale IQ &lt; 80, as assessed by an appropriate Wechsler scale (WAIS-IV or WASI-II).

          -  Epilepsy surgery within 8 weeks of the beginning of the trial.

          -  History of chronic progressive neurologic or neurodegenerative illnesses (e.g.,
             Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, primary or metastatic malignancy). Patients
             with headache or migraine are not excluded.

          -  History of Axis I psychiatric illness with psychotic features. (e.g., schizophrenia or
             bipolar disorder). Patients with depression or anxiety (treated or untreated) without
             psychotic features are not excluded.

          -  Visual or auditory impairment, which precludes participation in part, or all of the
             testing or computer training.

          -  English as a first language will not be required, but participants must have either
             received some of their schooling in English or used English in their work for &gt;10
             years.

          -  Previous exposure (&gt; one week) to Lumosity or a similar computerized training program.
