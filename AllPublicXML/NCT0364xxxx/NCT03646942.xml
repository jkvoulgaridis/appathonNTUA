  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will treat patients with class I malocclusion who have moderate crowding (4-6 mm)
      according to Little's irregularity index and asses the efficacy of low level laser therapy in
      accelerating orthodontic tooth movement .

      There is two groups :

        1. treated with Low level laser therapy (LLLT)

        2. treated traditionally without any irradiation Patients will be randomly allocated in any
           group and all data will be collected through photographs when leveling and alignment
           completed.

      Also pain levels will be assessed using numeric rating scale to compare between the two
      groups and if laser really can relief pain or not .

      The time of orthodontic treatment is considered to be one of the most concerns for patients.
      The study will investigate the effect of low level laser therapy on the speed of orthodontic
      tooth movement during the correction of moderately crowded anterior upper teeth using lingual
      orthodontic appliance.

      The study will be accomplished with two arms, the first is LLLT arm and the other is the
      control arm without any active intervention.

      Low level laser with a wave length of 830 nm, output of 150 mW, energy of 2 J per point and
      application time of 15 seconds per point will be applied on each tooth of the six upper
      incisors according to this protocol: the root will be divided into 2 halves; gingival and
      cervical. Laser will be applied in the center of each half from both the buccal and palatal
      sides which means 4 application points and a total energy of 8 j per each tooth.

      Within the limits of our knowledge, this is the first study in the world that will study
      acceleration of orthodontic tooth movement with lingual orthodontic .
