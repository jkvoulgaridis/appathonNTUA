  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In China, with the improvement of living standards, there is a significant increase in the
      rate of prevalence of type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia, associated with Non-alcoholic fatty
      liver disease（NAFLD） which has gradually become a major public health problem in our country.
      The latest study found that intestinal microflora imbalance is closely correlated with NAFLD.
      In this subject, the investigators aim to explore whether intestinal microbiota
      transplantation(IMT) could reverse the change of intestinal microflora imbalance and has
      direct effects of NAFLD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a significant health problem. With the trend of
      obesity and associated metabolic syndrome globally, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has
      become a high incidence of liver disease in developed countries, the prevalence rate of NAFLD
      adult is about 10% ~ 30%. Therefore, effective prevention and treatment of NAFLD has
      important significance in improving people's quality of life and disease prognosis. The
      latest study found that intestinal microflora imbalance is closely correlated with NAFLD.
      When the structure of intestinal flora is destroyed, host energy absorption and storage of
      fat balance will be broken, with higher absorption of efficiency. At the same time, metabolic
      disorder expands. In this projects the investigators aim to re-establish a gut balance of
      intestinal microbiota through Standardized Intestinal Microbiota Transplantation for NAFLD.
      The CT ratio of liver/spleen, Fibroscan E value, general indicators, biochemical indicators
      will be used to assess the efficiency, durability and safety of Standardized IMT at the start
      and end of the projects.
