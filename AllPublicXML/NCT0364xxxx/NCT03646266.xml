  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Controlled mechanical ventilation may lead to the development of diaphragm muscle atrophy,
      which is associated with weakness and adverse clinical outcome. Therefore, it seems
      reasonable to switch to partially supported ventilator modes as soon as possible. However, in
      patients with high respiratory drive, the application of partially supported modes may result
      in high lung distending pressures and diaphragm injury.

      Recently, the investigators published a study that demonstrated that a low dose of
      neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) facilitates lung-protective ventilation and maintains
      diaphragm activity in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. That study was conducted in a small
      (N=10), selected group of patients and partial neuromuscular blockade was applied for only 2
      hours (proof-of-concept study). Therefore, further research has to be done before this
      strategy can be applied in clinical practice.

      The primary goal is to investigate the feasibility and safety of prolonged (24 hours) partial
      neuromuscular blockade in patients with high respiratory drive in partially supported mode.
      The secondary goals are to evaluate the effect of this strategy diaphragm function, lung
      injury, hemodynamics and systemic inflammation.
