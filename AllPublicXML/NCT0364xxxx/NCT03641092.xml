  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disparities in health begin in early childhood. Early life experiences influence brain
      development and have significant implications on future health and developmental outcomes.
      Low-income children are at greater risk of developmental delays in large part due to a lack
      of an enriched environment. Disparities in early childhood development increase risk for
      stunted academic achievement throughout the life course. Primary care is a universal exposure
      in early childhood and therefore is also a significant entry point for promoting optimal
      child development.

      There is a need to provide effective, low-cost, and scalable interventions in primary care to
      support early childhood development.The CenteringParenting intervention is designed to reduce
      negative health and developmental outcomes within a model of group routine child health care.
      To date, there is no evidence of the benefits of the CenteringParenting intervention on
      school readiness, or improvements in parental behaviors that support optimal developmental
      milestones and achievement. The intent of this study is to determine the effectiveness of the
      CenteringParenting intervention on school readiness in early childhood, as measured by
      language development at 24 months, (in addition to health care utilization, child routine
      care maintenance, parenting stress, caregiver behaviors and attitudes).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children raised in environments with limited stimulation and lack of exposure to positive
      interactions are likely to have developmental delays in expressive and receptive language,
      vocabulary, social skills, behaviorâ€”all factors critical for school readiness. Children who
      enter kindergarten underprepared are more likely to struggle academically and experience
      lower school achievement, and ultimately impaired opportunities for economic and social
      mobility as adults.

      The CenteringParenting intervention is designed to reduce negative health and developmental
      outcomes within a model of group routine child health care. This bundled intervention
      supports healthy parent-child interactions and early learning through education and
      experiential learning within a group well-child visit model. The intervention reduces social
      isolation and creates a community of support for caregivers, as well as utilizes a positive
      parenting approach to empowering parents with knowledge and skills to support optimal child
      development. The CenteringParenting intervention includes written materials provided at an
      annual clinical visit, as well as specific training for the facilitators/providers. To date,
      there is no research evidence of the benefits of the CenteringParenting intervention on
      school readiness, or improvements in parental behaviors that support optimal developmental
      milestones and achievement.

      Study Design: A multi-site, cluster randomized controlled trial evaluating the impact of the
      CenteringParenting clinical intervention on kindergarten readiness, as measured by expressive
      and receptive language and vocabulary at 24 months of age.

      Objective Hypothesis: Compared to those receiving standard routine health care, the
      CenteringParenting intervention will result in improved language development at age 2 years
      and increased parental behaviors to encourage reading, talking and playing.

      Specific Aim 1: In a cluster randomized controlled trial, assess the effectiveness and
      implementation of the CenteringParenting intervention. Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the fidelity
      of the implementation of the CenteringParenting intervention. Specific Aim 3: Evaluate
      caregivers' experience and engagement with the CenteringParenting intervention model and
      explore the relation between degree of engagement and development stimulating behaviors.

      Primary outcomes are: expressive and receptive language and vocabulary based on the
      MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI) and Preschool Language Scale-5
      (PLS-5) 5th Edition Parent Questionnaire. The secondary outcome is: parental behavior based
      on the Stim-Q (a reliable and valid measure of cognitive stimulation provided in the home).

    <description>Assess early language (vocabulary, comprehension, production, gestures and grammar) based on the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventories (CDI). The Words and Gestures short form (Level I) is comprised of a 89-word vocabulary checklist with separate columns for comprehension and production, appropriate for children 8-18 months. The score is assessed in the amount of correct answers and measured in percentiles, from &lt;1th to 100th, depending on the child's age. Administered by research assistant to female guardian.</description>

    <description>The Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) is a questionnaire completed by parents to identify and screen for social and emotional behaviors in their children. The ASQ questionnaire has measures child behaviors and emotional responses assessing seven different areas: self-regulation, compliance, social-communication, adaptive functioning, autonomy, affect, and interaction with people. the questionnaire uses a point system per question that ranges from 0-10. The total score ranges from 0-110+. Total child scores ranging from 0-50 results in &quot;no or low risk&quot; and means the child's social-emotional development appears to be on schedule. Total child scores ranging from 50-65 results in &quot;monitoring&quot; and means child's behavior of concern need to be monitored. Total child scores ranging from 65-110+ results in &quot;refer&quot; and means further assessment with a professional may be needed.
