  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients at the Orthodontic Department of University of Damascus Dental School will be
      examined and subjects who meet the inclusion criteria will be admitted then the initial
      diagnostic records (diagnostic gypsum samples - internal and external oral photographs as
      well as radiographic images) will be studied to ensure that the selection criteria are
      accurately matched.

      The aim of this study is to compare three groups of patients with severe crowding of the
      upper anterior teeth:

        -  Group 1 : Patients will be treated using self-ligating brackets

        -  Group 2 : Patients will be treated using self-ligating brackets associated with flapless
           corticotomy.

        -  Group 3 : Patients will be treated using traditional brackets (i.e. brackets positioned
           on the labial surface of the teeth)

      At the end of leveling and aligning phase, we will compare the self-ligating brackets and
      traditional brackets ( the acceleration of teeth movement, dental and alveolar changes and
      other variables ) Also, there is an intention to study the effectiveness of using flapless
      corticotomy with the self-ligating brackets.

      The sample of this study will be chosen according the following steps:

        -  The examination of patients referred to the Department of Orthodontics at the University
           of Damascus Dental School (clinical examination, diagnostic plaster models, radiographic
           photos , external and internal oral photographs) then subjects who meet the inclusion
           criteria will be included in this trial.

        -  A random sample of 100 patients from the sampling frame will be chosen.

        -  An information sheet ( including the research objective and treatment plan in detail )
           will be given to each candidate. Then consent forms will be collected from those who
           agree to participate.

        -  A random selection of 60 patients will be performed. Then a random distribution of these
           patients to 3 groups will be done.

    <description>The irregularity of the upper and lower incisors is calculated by measuring the amount of deviation of the anatomic contact points between the six incisors in the horizontal direction in mm, since the sum of these measurements represents the value of the index (Little, 1975). The more the score is, the more crowded the case is.</description>
