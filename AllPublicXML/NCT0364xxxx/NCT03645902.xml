  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optimizing the MRI protocol in acute ischemic stroke remains a challenging issue. In this
      field, susceptibility-weighted sequences have proved their superiority over T2. Besides the
      strengthened susceptibility effect, enhanced susceptibility-weighted angiography (eSWAN)
      sequence provides also a time-of-flight (TOF) effect, allowing the exploration of the
      intracranial arterial circulation. The objective of this study is to compare eSWAN and 3D
      TOF, considered as the reference, in the detection of arterial occlusion in acute stroke.

      Patients who undergo MRI for suspected acute stroke with an acute ischemic lesion on
      diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) will be prospectively included in this study.eSWAN and TOF
      images will be analyzed under double-blind conditions by a junior radiologist and a senior
      neuroradiologist for the detection of arterial occlusion. eSWAN images will be assessed in
      order to estimate the inter-observer agreement. After a consensus, eSWAN and TOF data will be
      compared to calculate inter-modality agreement.

    <description>MRI examinations will be performed on a 3 T GE MR750 W scanner. Two readers, an experienced neuroradiologist (8 years of experience in neuroradiology) and a junior radiologist (3 years of experience in general radiology) will independently analyze eSWAN and TOF images in random order, looking for arterial occlusions. Analysis will be based on a 2-point-scale: arterial occlusion, based on a local signal loss, or acceptable permeability.</description>
