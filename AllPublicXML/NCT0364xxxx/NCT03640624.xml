  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vulvodynia (i.e. chronic vulvar pain without identifiable cause) is a heterogeneous clinical
      entity with a complex multifactorial causation. It is long lasting and difficult to treat,
      and the general consensus of current guidelines states that patients with vulvodynia benefit
      from a compound multidisciplinary intervention targeting mucosal hypersensitivity, pelvic
      muscle floor dysfunction and general pain management. However, there is little empiric
      evidence to support this recommendation. This will be a randomized controlled trial comparing
      multidisciplinary treatment with standard care for women with vulvodynia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic vulvar pain constitute a heterogeneous group with regards to causes and
      moderators of pain. Multidisciplinary teams simultaneously assess contributing factors such
      as infections and dermatoses and treat known mediators of pain, namely mucosal
      hypersensitivity, pelvic muscle floor dysfunction and general pain management. Treatment as
      usual, on the other hand, is primarily based on a sequential model applying one type of
      treatment at a time.

      The investigator's aim is to compare multidisciplinary treatment including multimodal
      physiotherapy (intervention group) with standard treatment (control group) in reducing pain,
      sexual dysfunction and related symptoms in women with vulvodynia.

      The study sample will be allocated randomly 1:1 to multidisciplinary treatment by a vulva
      team or to standard treatment by a specialist in gynaecology. The intervention will include a
      joint consultation by a gynaecologist and a dermatologist, tailored multimodal physiotherapy
      by a physiotherapist and guided imagery (mindfulness and relaxation) by use of a sound track
      during home sessions. The controls will receive standard care by a gynaecologist, who is free
      to offer any kind of non-standardized treatment.

      Treatment effect will be measured at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after inclusion.
