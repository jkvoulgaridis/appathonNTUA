  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maternal iron deficiency (ID) and adverse maternal-infant health outcomes disproportionately
      affect Black women. Chronic exposure to structural violence can dysregulate a Black woman's
      stress response promoting systemic inflammation. Stress-induced inflammation can negatively
      affect iron metabolism and promote ID that compromises the health of pregnant women and their
      infants - a phenomenon that may explain maternal-infant health disparities in Black women.
      Thus, interventions that can mitigate the physiologic effects of chronic stress have the
      potential to improve maternal-infant iron status that translates to positive maternal-infant
      health outcomes. There is evidence that the probiotic LP299v can reduce the adverse
      physiologic effects of stress and normalize iron metabolism although, this has not been
      tested in the context of pregnancy. The investigators will conduct a double blinded
      placebo-controlled randomized pilot study to determine the feasibility and tolerability of
      daily oral LP299v supplementation (15 weeks gestation - delivery) in 20 pregnant Black women
      from marginalized neighborhoods of Chicago and explore the effect of daily oral LP299v vs.
      placebo on maternal stress response and iron status, infant iron status at delivery, and
      molecular mechanisms (maternal microbiome) that may mediate the effect of LP299v on maternal
      stress- and iron-related outcomes.

    <description>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a 10-item scale intended to measure perceived stress over the last month. Individual scores on the PSS can range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress. Scores ranging from 0-13 would be considered low stress. Scores ranging from 14-26 would be considered moderate stress. Scores ranging from 27-40 would be considered high perceived stress.</description>
