  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, single-arm study. This clinical study will be conducted at up to 4
      sites with a total of 10 subjects per site. All subjects will receive standard of care
      treatment which includes DFU treatments with the dermaPACE device.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dermaPACE system will be used according to label along with standard of care. perfusion
      will be measured using TcPO2 methods and also using cleared hyperspectral imaging equipment.
      The intent of the study is to observe/measure oxygen saturation levels in the area of the
      treated wound before initiation of dermaPACE treatment, during the treatment period, and two
      weeks post treatment period
