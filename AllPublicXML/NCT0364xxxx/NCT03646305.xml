    <textblock>
      Study Objectives:

        1. Examine whether singing can be used as a cognitive defusion strategy to change one's
           appraisals of body-related thoughts so they are less threatening to the individual.

        2. Explore whether this technique can change the appraisals of one's body (i.e. increasing
           body satisfaction, increasing body esteem, decreasing the drive towards thinness), as
           well as increase mood and self-esteem.

        3. Compare singing to the defusion strategy of verbal repetition, as well as control
           conditions, to determine the effectiveness of these techniques.

        4. Examine whether defusion techniques would be particularly beneficial for individuals
           with high thought-shape fusion

      Study Hypotheses:

      The primary hypothesis was that the cognitive defusion conditions, namely verbal repetition
      and singing, would foster greater detachment (i.e. defusion) from negative body-related
      thoughts and change thought appraisals such that these thoughts were less believable and less
      negative, and the individual was more willing, less likely to avoid, and less uncomfortable
      when engaging with these thoughts than the control conditions.

      Secondary hypotheses propose that these defusion techniques will reduce negative body-related
      cognitions such as body image distress, drive for thinness, and body dissatisfaction to a
      greater extent than the control conditions. Moreover, compared to the control condition,
      these techniques are expected to be superior in reducing negative mood and improving
      self-esteem. Finally, better outcomes are expected from those in the defusion conditions who
      practice the technique as instructed (i.e. better homework adherence). Due to the novelty of
      this intervention, no specific hypotheses have been made regarding whether singing will equal
      or differ from verbal repetition on the aforementioned outcome measures. Moreover, due to the
      exploratory nature of applying defusion techniques with individuals with thought-shape
      fusion, no specific hypotheses have been made around anticipated changes in the perception of
      the thought, body image satisfaction, mood, self-esteem, and cognitive defusion within this
      population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eating disorders are characterized by intense mental preoccupation with body shape and
      weight. Even in the absence of disordered eating, high levels of body dissatisfaction
      prospectively predict depression and low self-esteem in young women. Common intervention
      strategies, such as challenging the validity of negative body-related thoughts, often have
      limited success. Recent research suggests that accepting, rather than challenging, negative
      body-related thoughts may reduce body image distress by changing the relationship with those
      thoughts. For example, continually repeating or even singing an unwanted thought has been
      shown to reduce the believability and discomfort associated with that thought, through a
      technique known as cognitive defusion. The current study aims to extend the literature on
      cognitive defusion and test its effectiveness in the treatment of body dissatisfaction. In a
      randomized controlled trial design, 122 female restrained eaters were randomly assigned to
      practice either 1) verbally repeating negative body-related thoughts, 2) singing negative
      body-related thoughts, 3) verbally repeating body-unrelated thoughts (control), or 4) singing
      body-unrelated thoughts (control). The goal of this study was to determine whether singing
      one's negative body-related thoughts could lead to greater changes in perception of the
      thought, body image satisfaction, mood, and self-esteem relative to a control condition when
      practiced twice daily for one week.

    <description>Cognitive defusion aims to change one's relationship to their thoughts - as opposed to changing the content, form, or frequency - by reframing internal experiences as less threatening (Hayes, Luoma, Bond, Masuda, &amp; Lillis, 2006). It is the process of detaching the link between one's thoughts and perceptions of reality and acknowledging the role one's thoughts play in their internal events. A number of techniques have been developed to remove the literal quality of such thoughts, including repeating the thought, and, more recently, singing the thought.</description>
