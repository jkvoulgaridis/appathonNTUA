      The purpose of this study is to gain more information about the step-by-step process that
      causes someone to develop type 1 diabetes. Scientists think that a person's own immune
      system, directed by genetic and environmental factors play a major role in its development.
      Participation involves a blood draw, a brief medical history questionnaire and measurements
      of height and weight. Some participants will be asked to return for annual follow-up visits
      for 10 years.

      The goal of this project is to gain knowledge about the development of Type 1 diabetes (T1D),
      as T1D is one of the most common chronic diseases in children. There has been a rise in the
      number of cases diagnosed as well as a decrease in the age of diagnosis. This project aims to
      understand the disease progression as seen in the immune system and to define the genetic and
      environmental factors that affect inflammation and regulation, which could determine disease
      progression or nonprogression. Families that include a family member with T1D will be
      recruited, as well as unrelated, healthy controls as a comparison group.

      Participants will have height and weight measured, complete a social &amp; medical history
      questionnaire, and have blood drawn for analysis for HLA haplotype (a genetic sequence
      related to type 1 diabetes susceptibility)diabetes, blood glucose, immune system response,
      complete blood count, and autoantibody measurements. Some family members may return for
      follow-up visits for up to 10 years.

      The investigators will be collecting blood samples, which will be analyzed for HLA haplotype
      (a genetic sequence related to type 1 diabetes susceptibility), plasma-induced signature,
      diabetes autoantibodies, and complete blood count with differential, as well as plasma for
      storage. Blood will be analyzed for A1c for participants with diabetes. Specimens will be
      used and stored until none is left.

        Patients with T1D seen at clinics at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin (n~1500) and
        Froedtert Hospital (n~800 will be targeted. In families with a child proband, siblings and
        parents will be asked to join the study. If the investigators find that the diabetic child
        has an aunt, uncle, or cousin with T1D, then that nuclear family will also be recruited.
        Adult proband families may include the spouse and children. Adult proband families must
        include children &lt;17 years of age. If the adult proband has a sibling, niece, or nephew
        with T1D, that nuclear family will be recruited as well. The age-of-diagnosis criterion for
        the proband will be less than 39 years and insulin therapy started within 5 years of
        diagnosis. Singleton adult probands within 10 months of diagnosis will also be recruited.
