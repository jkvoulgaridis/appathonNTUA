      Bemcentinib inhibits pancreatic cancer proliferation as monotherapy and in combination with
      gemcitabine through inhibition of the Axl pathway. The combination of
      nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine/cisplatin has encouraging signs of clinical activity in patients
      with metastatic pancreatic cancer38. We would like to build on this combination in a
      biomarker driven phase 1b/2 clinical trial of bemcentinib in
      nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine/cisplatin for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
