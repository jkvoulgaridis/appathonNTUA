  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many women with ovarian cancer experience distress, fatigue, weakness, anxiety, and other
      symptoms that decrease quality of life. Moderate exercise may improve quality of life,
      decrease distress, and improve biomarkers associated with prognosis in women with ovarian
      cancer. This clinical trial studies how well moderate exercise works in improving distress,
      quality of life, and biomarkers of angiogenesis and chronic stress in women with ovarian,
      fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer.

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (EXERCISE INTERVENTION): Patients meet with exercise physiologist for 1, 60 minute
      session. Patients then receive individualized exercise prescription with goal of moderate
      aerobic exercise over 150 minutes per week at home for up to 24 weeks. Patients also receive
      telephone-based motivational support by exercise physiologist weekly for 24 weeks.

      ARM II (CONTROL GROUP): Patients maintain habitual levels of physical activity and receive
      general education material about ovarian cancer and survivorship for 24 weeks. After 24
      weeks, patients are offered exercise intervention.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed stage II-IV epithelial ovarian, fallopian
             tube, or peritoneal cancer. If site of origin cannot be specified, carcinoma of
             Mullerian origin may be included if most consistent with ovarian/fallopian
             tube/peritoneal origin rather than uterine origin. The following histologic epithelial
             cell types are eligible: serous adenocarcinoma, endometrioid adenocarcinoma, mucinous
             adenocarcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, mixed epithelial carcinoma, transitional cell
             carcinoma, malignant Brenner's tumor, undifferentiated carcinoma, carcinosarcoma, or
             adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified. Women with neoplasms of low malignant
             potential (borderline tumors) are not eligible.

          -  Subjects must have no evidence of disease, as defined by their treating oncologist,
             and with normal CA-125 (=&lt; 35).

          -  Subjects must have completed primary surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy for treatment
             of ovarian, fallopian tube, of peritoneal cancer within one to six months of
             screening. Maintenance therapy will be allowed as long as the participant is in
             clinical remission- including hormonal agents, anti-angiogenesis agents, PARP
             inhibitors, and immunotherapy. Prior radiation therapy is allowed, as long as it has
             been completed within one to six months of screening. Subjects may have received prior
             therapies (including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy) for other malignancies
             in the past.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status of 0, 1, or 2.

          -  Pregnancy and the need for contraception:

             * Participants with ovarian cancer have undergone hysterectomy with removal of ovaries
             and tubes as part of surgical treatment, and therefore do not have the potential to
             become pregnant.

          -  Ambulatory.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  Women participating in other clinical trials are eligible provided their enrollment in
             the other trial does not impair their ability to participate in the physical activity
             interventions and study assessments required in this trial. The other clinical trial
             must not be a behavioral intervention trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have had primary surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy within 4
             weeks prior to screening. Subjects may have received other surgeries not performed for
             primary treatment (for example, removal of intraperitoneal port, laparoscopic
             cholecystectomy, etc.) within 1 month of screening as long as they do not have
             post-operative restrictions that would preclude participating in a moderate intensity
             exercise program once enrolled in the clinical trial.

          -  Self-reported inability to walk at least 2 blocks (at any pace).

          -  Prior brain metastasis is not an exclusion, as long as subject is in clinical
             remission.

          -  Uncontrolled or concurrent illness including, but not limited to: unstable angina
             pectoris, recent (within six months) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled cardiac
             arrhythmia, uncontrolled congestive heart failure, hypertrophic obstructive
             cardiomyopathy, uncontrolled hypertension (systolic &gt; 200, diastolic &gt; 120),
             conditions (cardiovascular, respiratory, or musculoskeletal disease or joint problems)
             that preclude moderate physical activity. Subjects with a history of cardiac arrest,
             or those with moderate/severe aortic or mitral stenosis may be eligible if their
             treating physician determines that moderate physical activity is safe. Moderate
             arthritis that does not preclude physical activity is not a reason for ineligibility.
             Women with lymphedema or peripheral neuropathy will not be excluded. They will be
             evaluated by the exercise physiologist for safety and modifications to the exercise
             prescription will be made as appropriate.

          -  Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          -  Already physically active &gt; 90 minutes per week of moderate exercise.
