  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Online social networking sites, such as Telegram, possess a number of useful features that
      could enhance oral health promotion interventions, including the ability of users to share
      personal information, which is aggregated and displayed to other users .This study is a
      longitudinal controlled trial that is designed to investigate the effectiveness of a
      multi-component intervention on improving oral health in adolescents and their mothers.
      Participants will be allocated in three groups with a) an intervention group in which mothers
      and children receive the intervention and questionnaires via Telegram, b) only the children
      receive the intervention via Telegram and mothers and children receive the questionnaires,
      and c) mothers and children are in active control group and only receive the questionnaires.
      The intervention package contains behavior change techniques targeting outcome expectancy,
      self-efficacy, action planning, coping planning, and self-monitoring. The active control
      group receives an information sheet regarding recommendations on Oral health behaviors. There
      will be 3 assessment points in time, baseline, 1 month and 6 months after the interventions.

      The primary outcome of this study is to estimate the dyadic mechanisms between mothers and
      their children regarding improving oral health. Secondary outcome is to investigate whether
      oral health behavior did improve in the intervention groups in general and also to find the
      psychological mechanism behind the changes during the time of the study.
