  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) are frequently used in anesthesia and quantitative
      monitoring of neuromuscular block is standard care. Normally the calibration of the
      neuromuscular monitor is done after anesthesia induction to avoid patient discomfort. Under
      certain circumstances there is no time for the calibration process. In the so-called rapid
      sequence induction (RSI) the neuromuscular blocking agent has to be injected immediately
      after the induction agent. As the neuromuscular monitor cannot be calibrated, precise
      neuromuscular monitoring is not possible, and this is of particular disadvantage, when high
      doses of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers are injected to fasten the onset of
      neuromuscular block. The primary objective is to validate the measurements of the TOF Watch
      SX® monitor calibrated in awake patients by comparing them with the measurements obtained
      with the TOF Watch SX® monitor calibrated after anesthesia induction (Gold standard).

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the tolerability of the awake calibration process of
      the TOF Watch SX® monitor.

    <textblock>
      Neuromuscular function will be assessed by acceleromyography of the adductor pollicis with a
      TOF-Watch SX® monitor on both arms. By randomization it will be chosen on which arm the awake
      calibration will be done. 5 minutes before the awake calibration process the patients will
      receive 0.2 µg/kg of sufentanil intravenously. Immediately after the end of the calibration
      process the patients will rate the pain of the calibration process on a visual analog scale
      from 0 to 10. Anesthesia will then be induced and immediately at loss of consciousness
      continuous TOF stimulation will be continued every 12s. Then the calibration process on the
      other arm will be started, followed by continuous TOF stimulation. After having obtained
      stable baseline measurements with the TOF-Watch SX® monitor, a bolus dose of rocuronium 0.6
      mg kg-1 will be administered intravenously. The trachea will be intubated when full
      neuromuscular block is reached. No additional rocuronium will be given. Both neuromuscular
      monitors will be linked via a fiber-optic (TOF-Link®) cable with UBS port to a laptop.
      Specific software will be used to record the measurements (TOF watch SX® monitor, version
      2.2). Neuromuscular monitoring will be continued until a normalized TOF ratio of 0.9 has been
      obtained on both arms. The onset of neuromuscular block and its spontaneous recovery will be
      recorded and the results obtained on each arm will be compared. Every patient is his own
      control.
