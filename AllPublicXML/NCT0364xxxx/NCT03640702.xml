  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aimed to examine the effect of prolonging the second stage of labor on the rate of
      Cesarean section (CS), maternal and neonatal outcomes.

      The study compared 2 time periods. The first time period was between May 2011 until April
      2014 when a prolonged second stage in nulliparous women was considered three hours with
      regional anesthesia or two hours if no such anesthesia was provided. Second stage arrest was
      defined in multiparous women after two hours with regional anesthesia or one hour without it.
      The second time period was between May 2014 until April 2017, allowed nulliparous and
      multiparous women to continue the second stage of labor an additional one hour before
      diagnosing second-stage arrest. Singleton deliveries at or beyond 37 weeks' gestation were
      initially considered for eligibility.
