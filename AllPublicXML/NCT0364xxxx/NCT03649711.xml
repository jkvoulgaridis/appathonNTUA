    <textblock>
      This study evaluates how aspirin, clopidogrel and ticagrelor work in people with chronic
      kidney disease (CKD) compared to people with normal kidneys. In the first part of the study,
      half of CKD participants will be randomly assigned to ticagrelor and aspirin, while the other
      half will be assigned to clopidogrel and aspirin in a blinded fashion. The treatment duration
      will be two weeks. After recruiting CKD participants the investigator will recruit controls
      with normal kidney function that will receive only ticagrelor and aspirin for two weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is known that people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at higher risk to have heart
      and blood vessel problems like heart attack and stroke compared to people that do not have
      kidney problems. Aspirin, clopidogrel and ticagrelor prevent blood clots building up in the
      vessels. If a blood clot is present in one vessel, it could stop oxygen carrying blood to get
      to a specific organ, and that could cause problems like heart attack or stroke. There is very
      little knowledge about the way this group of medicines works in people with chronic kidney
      disease as well as it works in individuals with normal kidney function.

    <intervention_model_description>CKD participants will be double-blind randomized in these two arms:
Arm 1 - Ticagrelor, 90 mg twice daily (one pill in the morning and one pill in the evening) + Aspirin 81 mg/day. Ticagrelor is the test treatment.
Arm 2 - Clopidogrel, 75 mg/day in the morning and a matching placebo in the evening + Aspirin 81 mg/day. Clopidogrel is the reference treatment.
Arm 3: Control with normal kidney function will be recruited after matching for age and diabetes status to the Arm 1 participants. Participants will be asked to take Ticagrelor, 90 mg twice daily (one pill in the morning and one pill in the evening) and aspirin 81 mg/day. Open label treatment.
All participants are required to take the oral treatment for a total of two weeks.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>CKD participants will be randomly assigned into one of the 2 study groups: ticagrelor (90 mg) one pill in the morning and one pill in the evening, or, clopidogrel (75 mg) one pill in the morning + placebo one pill in the evening. Placebo looks like the study drug but has no medicine in it. Neither participant nor the study personnel will know about allocation. The study drugs will look the same, except aspirin pill which will be dispensed to everyone in an open label manner.
There is no masking for control with normal kidney function. Participants will be asked to take open label ticagrelor, 90 mg twice daily (one pill in the morning and one pill in the evening) and aspirin 81 mg/day.</masking_description>
