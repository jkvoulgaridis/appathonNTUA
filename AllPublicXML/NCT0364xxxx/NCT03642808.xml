  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Within the Groupe Hospitalier Paris Saint-Joseph (GHPSJ), a reinforced medical care of
      osteoporosis ('Fracture Liaison service') was organized for osteoporotic fractured patients.
      The evaluation of benefits of this program through a randomized study showed an improvement
      in diagnostic tests performed (bone densitometry) and antiosteoporotic treatment initiated
      (OPTIPOST study, being published in BMJ). However, of 323 patients included, 91 presented a
      new fracture within 12 months. Among them, 40/126 patients (31.7%) were in the reinforced
      medical care arm. This result clearly demonstrates the need for a specific medical care
      program for patients with osteoporotic fracture falling regularly.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Only few studies for secondary prevention of falls have been conducted in France yet. This
      can be partly explained by the complexity of reeducation programs to implement and by
      organization issues. Moreover, to our knowledge, no study has demonstrated the benefit of
      such programs on secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures, even though falls prevention
      is needed. Our objective is to demonstrate with a pilot study the feasibility of a falls
      secondary prevention program, based on a rheumatology (GHPSJ) and reeducation wards (Hôpital
      Sainte-Marie Paris : HSMP) collaboration. Considering the innovative nature of both this
      program and this collaboration, a feasibility study is preferable before conducting a larger
      multicentric study, evaluating locomoter benefits of this program in comparison with usual
      primary care.
