      This study offers 5 fraction radiation treatment through partial breast irradiation in
      patients with early stage breast cancer after having a lumpectomy.

    <textblock>
      This study offers 5 fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy for early stage breast cancer
      after patient undergoes a lumpectomy. The study aims to determine the safety and feasibility
      of delivering only 5 higher dose radiation treatments rather than the longer schedule of
      treatments that is currently considered standard of care for breast cancer patients. Patients
      will be followed for 24 months (2 years) with follow-up appointments at 6, 12, 18, and 24
      months.

    <description>To determine patient and nurse assessed cosmetic outcome at 1, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months post SBRT. Patient will give a verbal satisfaction rating of 1-Excellent, 2-Good, 3-Fair, or 4-Poor of their cosmetic appearance post-SBRT. Nurse will also give their overall rating of 1-Excellent, 2-Good, 3-Fair, or 4-Poor based off of their examination of the cosmetic appearance post-SBRT.</description>

    <description>This study will enroll patients that have a confirmed histology of early stage breast cancer. The patient will undergo a lumpectomy and will then receive partial breast 5 fraction stereotactic body radiation therapy at a dose of 30 gy for treatment. Patients will be followed for 24 total months with specific follow-ups at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months.</description>

    <intervention_name>5 Fraction Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has gained favor in the treatment of select central nervous system, lung, and abdominal malignancies due to its ability to deliver highly conformal doses of radiotherapy while using sharp dose gradients to deliver comparatively lower doses to the surrounding normal tissue. Utilization of SBRT is more labor intensive than conventional fractionation and requires precise immobilization and localization techniques with daily image guidance with direct physician and physicist oversight for all treatments. While more labor intensive and often utilizing more advanced technologies, SBRT allows the advantage of reducing setup margins compared to conventionally fractionated treatment while being able to shorten overall treatment times due to the ability to safely dose escalate high risk areas</description>
