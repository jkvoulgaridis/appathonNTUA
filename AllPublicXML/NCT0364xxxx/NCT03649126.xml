      The first objective is to explore factors that impede or facilitate implementation of SSR in
      pathology (and other disciplines) among the MDT members receiving SSRs. The second objective
      is to select, develop and evaluate (process and effect outcomes) implementation tools
      supporting optimal implementation of SSR in pathology. The third objective is to offer
      implementation tools to all pathology laboratories in the Netherlands and to share the
      SSR-kit for successful implementation with other medical disciplines

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By implementing SSR in various disciplines, we contribute to improving communication,
      efficiency and quality of multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings and facilitate optimal
      treatment decision making. Optimal discussion of each patient at MDT meetings can be achieved
      by a clear communication of all diagnostic results among MDT members. However, the adoption
      of innovations, such as SSR, is laborious, especially when the innovation requires changing
      daily habits. Offering implementation tools supports the adoption of innovations among
      medical professionals. Implementation tools are most effective when they are developed on the
      basis of factors that impede or facilitate the innovation. Besides the importance of
      investigating these factors for SSR among pathologists, we will also involve MDT members
      receiving pathology SSRs in our study. After all, because MDT members will greatly benefit
      from SSR, they could play a key role in stimulating the use of SSR among pathologists.
      Therefore, we will also explore which tools MDT members need to stimulate the diagnostic
      disciplines in using SSR. Subsequently, we will develop and evaluate implementation tools to
      support the use of SSR by pathologists. The kit for successful implementation of SSR will be
      offered to other medical disciplines like radiology, endoscopy, and surgery who face similar
      challenges with implementation of SSR. The SSR-kit consists of our multidisciplinary approach
      for the whole process of developing implementation tools for SSR, examples of tools for SSR,
      and other results of this project.
