  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory rehabilitation is one of the main treatments for COPD in the early stages of the
      disease (Stage 2 of GOLD) with a recognized effect on improving the capacity of the patients
      to exert effort by fighting against deconditioning. the effort. This treatment also improves
      the quality of life of patients and reduces the risk of respiratory exacerbations. The
      patients are very often malnourished and various studies have proposed the addition of oral
      supplementation such as hormone therapy (testosterone) to improve the exercise performance of
      these atrophied muscles. The use of branched-chain amino acids (AARs) such as valine,
      leucine, isoleucine in this indication can be fully justified because they stimulate protein
      synthesis and promote muscle maintenance and repair.
