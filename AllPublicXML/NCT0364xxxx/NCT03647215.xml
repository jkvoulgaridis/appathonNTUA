    <description>Participants with CML and Ph+ALL who are being treated with their first or subsequent TKI therapy. CML patients must meet the ELN criteria for warning and failure ) or have high SOKAL score (&gt;0.8) or presence of additional chromosomal abnormalities (ACAs) and have detectable BCR-ABL levels.

        Approximately 50 centers in the UK, Ireland and France that treat adult patients with CML
        and Ph+ ALL will be selected for participation in the study. The sites selected will be a
        mixture of hospital and academic centers.

        The target study population will include adult patients with CML who meet the ELN criteria
        for warning or failure or have high SOKAL score &gt; 0.8 or presence of additional chromosomal
        abnormalities (ACAs), all with detectable BCR-ABL levels. Ph+ ALL patients must have
        detectable BCR-ABL levels. Patients will be taking their first or subsequent TKI.

        Consecutive patients within each prescriber's practice who meet the enrollment criteria and
        provide informed consent will be invited to enroll into the study.

        Repeat NGS KD mutation testing is permitted under the protocol as deemed part of the
        standard management of patients.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients (age â‰¥ 18 years) with CML (in all phases of disease) or Ph+ ALL with
             detectable BCR-ABL levels who are being treated with a first or subsequent TKI.

          -  Patients with CML must meet the warning or failure criteria as per the ELN guidelines
             for first second and subsequent treatment line, including:

               -  BCR-ABL/ABL IS transcripts &gt; 10% at 3 months

               -  BCR-ABL/ABL IS transcripts &gt; 1% at 6 months

               -  BCR-ABL/ABL IS transcripts &gt; 0.1% at 12 months or later

          -  Patients with CML must not currently be in MMR (ie, have disease with BCR-ABL1/ABL1
             transcripts &gt; 0.1% IS).

        OR

          -  Patients with Ph+ ALL with any level of BCR-ABL/ABL IS transcripts. Patients with Ph+
             ALL should have BCR-ABL1/ABL1 transcript levels &gt; 0.1% and should not be currently
             enrolled in UKALL14 but may have relapsed during or after participation in UKALL14.

          -  Patients with an intermediate or high Sokal score (&gt; 0.8) can be recruited into the
             study from 3 months after diagnosis, irrespective of BCR-ABL1/ABL1 transcript levels
             at 3 months.

          -  Patients with additional chromosomal abnormalities at diagnosis and patients with
             AP-CML may be recruited into the study, irrespective of BCR-ABL1/ABL1 transcript
             levels at 3 months and beyond provided BCR-ABL1/ABL1 transcript levels are &gt; 0.1% IS.
             It is recommended that these patients have mutational analysis performed every 3
             months irrespective of BCR-ABL1/ABL1 transcript levels until they reach MR3/MMR
             (BCR-ABL1/ABL1 &lt; 0.1% IS).

          -  Any patients who have previously undergone testing for KD mutations, irrespective of
             KD mutational analysis test results.

          -  Patients who have the ability to understand the requirements of the study and provide
             written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients without detectable BCR-ABL and patients who have switched TKI due to intolerance
        but who have met the criteria for optimal response (CP-CML, ELN 2013 guidelines).
