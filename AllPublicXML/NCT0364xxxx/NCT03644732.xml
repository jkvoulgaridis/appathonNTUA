    <textblock>
      The main objective of MAPCOG_SEEG is to create a database including brain recordings of
      cognition performed in clinical routine in patients during the pre-surgical SEEG assessment.
      This aims to be able to propose the first atlas of human cognition with a high temporal and
      spatial resolution.

      The pre-surgical assessment of a cortectomy in patient suffering from a refractory epilepsy
      includes several examinations aiming both, to specify the epileptogenic zone (EZ) which must
      be resected and to evaluate functional and cognitive risks of surgery.

      Nevertheless, in some patients, non-invasive evaluation does not give formal answer. In these
      subjects, it is then necessary to carry out a second step, consisting of an invasive
      exploration by implantation of intracerebral electrodes during a Stereoelectroencephalography
      (SEEG).

      Due to its temporal and spatial resolution, the SEEG allows, besides the precise
      determination of the EZ, to carry out a functional mapping of the cortical regions likely to
      be included in cortectomy. Conventionally, this mapping is carried out on the basis of the
      cortical electrical stimulations applied to the implanted electrodes. If this approach is
      very robust for exploring primary functions such as motor skills or language, it cannot be
      used to evaluate more complex cognitive tasks such as face recognition or attention.
      Essential cognitive tasks on a daily basis.

      This has led to the development in recent years, in Grenoble, of a complementary approach to
      cerebral stimulation: Dynamic Spectral Imaging (ISD). Numerous experimental paradigms have
      demonstrated that the realization of a cognitive task associates with the generation within
      the cortical regions involved in its treatment of a particular cortical activity. This
      activity is characterized by oscillations of the cortical rhythm in high frequencies (&gt; 40
      Hz), called gamma activities. The ISD thus consists in mapping this gamma activity during
      various cognitive tasks, thus making it possible to study more widely the complexity of the
      cognitive functions.

      MAPCOG_SEEG aims to collect the cerebral recording of the patients who have performed this
      cognitive exploration to be able to in fine propose an Atlas of human cognition which takes
      advantage of the very rich information in terms of spatial and temporal resolution of the
      SEEG. Furthermore, it will exactly allow more to understand the impact of the epilepsy and
      the surgery of the epilepsy on the cognition.

    <description>Prospective collection of data from SEEG recordings using functional brain mapping procedure performed in clinical routine during the presurgical assessment of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. These data are represented by the electroencephalographic activity during the realization of the different cognitive tasks proposed to the patients. Electroencephalographic activity will then be analyzed in terms of Dynamic Spectral Imaging and in terms of high frequency activity ([50-150Hz]).</description>

    <description>Behavioral data (reaction time and accuracy of response) collected during the presurgical assessment (joint with the SEEG) and during the postsurgical follow-up (approximately 3 months after the surgery) as well as the collection of neuropsychological scores from the presurgical and postsurgical assessment.
Behavioral performance and neuropsychological test scores before and after surgery (as available) will allow to evaluate the impact of surgery on cognitive functioning (improvement or deterioration of cognitive performance).</description>
