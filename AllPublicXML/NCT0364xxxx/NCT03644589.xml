  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II treatment study that is done to evaluate how effective and safe the
      combination of pembrolizumab and cisplatin work in treating participants with triple-negative
      breast cancer that had spread to other parts of the body, has come back, or cannot be removed
      by surgery. Pembrolizumab (investigational drug) is a monoclonal antibody that works by
      helping your immune system to fight cancer. Cisplatin is a chemotherapy drug that works by
      interfering with tumor cell division. Studies also suggest that treatment with chemotherapy,
      like cisplatin, may improve the effectiveness of pembrolizumab. This study will test the
      effectiveness of pembrolizumab and cisplatin in participants with advanced triple-negative
      breast cancer.

      Participants will receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and cisplatin once
      every 3 weeks for a total of 6 doses. Both drugs are given by vein (Intravenous(IV)) on day
      1. Participants that are responding to the study treatment will continue to receive
      pembrolizumab alone for up to 24 months until disease gets worse, having bad side effects, no
      longer wish to be in the study, or have become pregnant (whichever comes first).

      In addition to study drug administration visits, participants will be asked to have physical
      exams, blood draws every three weeks and tumor evaluation using MRI or CT scans every 9
      weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for safety within at 30
      days of last dose of study treatment and then every 12 weeks until study completion.
