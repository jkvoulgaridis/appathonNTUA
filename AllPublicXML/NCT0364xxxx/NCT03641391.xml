      The study aims at constructing a Chinese language probabilistic map by awake intraoperative
      direct electrical stimulation (DES) language mapping.

      The &quot;maximal safe resection&quot; of brain tumor adjacent to language cortex requires precise
      real-time localization of the intraoperative language cortex.

      Awake craniotomy combined with DES to localize language cortex has been carried out for
      several decades. However, there is yet no unified standard on the specification of its
      technical parameters. Besides, language probabilistic maps based on DES have been reported by
      several teams around the world. However these studies were based on the Indo-European
      language speakers alone. There was one paper published in 2015 by the investigators' group
      using DES for the Chinese probabilistic map, but it is also a single center study, and the
      sample size is relatively small.

      Awake craniotomy and intraoperative DES for language cortex localization will be used to
      construct a Chinese probabilistic map in this study. Several common tasks for language
      mapping (i.e., number counting, picture naming, word reading) will be applied in Chinese
      speakers. The positive language sites including speech arrest, anomia, alexia, anarthria,
      dysarthria, semantic paraphasia and phonological paraphasia, spatial negativity and other
      higher order cognitive function will be identified in individual patients and normalized to
      the standard brain atlas. The corresponding probabilistic maps will be integrated and
      generated.

      At the same time, the standardization and optimization of awake intraoperative DES parameters
      will be explored, factors affecting postoperative function morbidity and survival will also
      be analyzed.

      Through this study, the investigators will further popularize individualized awake surgery of
      glioma in language cortex, improve the extent of tumor resection, protect postoperative
      language function and improve postoperative quality of life. By constructing this
      standardized Chinese probabilistic map, the investigators will provide more direct evidence
      for brain language research.

    <description>Language deficits were considered when the participant presents with aphasia or severe dysphasia measured by standardized Aphasia Battery of Chinese (ABC, a Chinese version of Western Aphasia Battery) having the Aphasia Quotient (AQ) less than 50 (where lower values represent a worse outcome).</description>

    <time_frame>During surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Positive stimulation of the language area was assumed when the participant exhibited counting interruption, errors during object naming, language confusion or other language problems induced by DES.
Positive stimulation of the motion area was assumed when movements of the contralateral limb, face, lip or tongue were induced by DES, with the concurrent recording of an electromyogram.
Positive stimulation affecting the sensation area was assumed when an abnormal feeling was induced by DES in the contralateral limb, face, lip or tongue.
The locations of positive sites will be recorded by neuro-navigation system.</description>

    <measure>Incidence rate of intraoperative epilepsy induced by direct cortical stimulation</measure>
    <time_frame>During surgery</time_frame>
    <description>A strip electrode would be placed tangentially over the central sulcus to monitor cortical seizure activity or after-discharge during intraoperative DCS. And the participant would be closely observed for involuntarily shaking or twitching. Any shaking, twitching or after-discharge during monitor would considered as epileptic event. All epileptic events will be recorded and DES will be terminated for the participant.</description>

    <measure>Extent of resection</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 72h after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Extent of resection (EOR) based on early postoperative MRI obtained within 72h after surgery. Gross total resection (GTR) was defined as the complete disappearance of all enhancing lesions (T1WI) for HGG and the complete disappearance of all nonenhancing (T2WI FLAIR) lesions for LGG. The EOR were quantitatively volumetric analyses for all gliomas and gliomas grouped according to eloquent areas and non-eloquent areas, and stratified as: GTR, 100% resection; subtotal resection ≥ 90% resection, partial resection ≥ 70% resection, biopsy, resection ≥98% for overall survival advantage (HGG) and resection ≥90% for overall survival advantage (LGG).</description>
