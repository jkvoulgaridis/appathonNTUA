  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators know that many patients who are on dialysis suffer from the burden of unwanted
      symptoms, which can affect quality of life. In this study, the investigators will be
      assessing symptom burden using the London Evaluation of Illness &quot;LEVIL,&quot; an application based
      platform where patients self-report their symptoms with at least one hemodialysis treatment.
      The investigators would like to compare the currently available dialyzer with a new dialyzer
      that is capable of removing solutes of higher molecular weight that may or may not cause
      patients to experience symptoms related to increased amounts of these toxins in their blood.

    <textblock>
      Baxter Canada has an expanded hemodialysis (HDx) membrane called the &quot;Theranova&quot;, which is
      capable of removing solutes of higher molecular weight. Although this clearly has biochemical
      advantages it is not known at this time if the removal of larger middle molecules can have a
      direct and immediate effect on patients reported symptoms and quality of life. In short, do
      be people actually feel better?

      Given the way many QoL measurements fluctuate around the dialysis week, the investigators
      propose to utilize a dynamic tool. The investigators will be assessing symptom burden using
      the London Evaluation of Illness &quot;LEVIL&quot; an application based platform where patients
      self-report their symptoms with at least one hemodialysis treatment. Reports are generated
      immediately and in real-time, which cannot be accomplished with other symptom management
      tools. This allows the investigators to track study changes and benchmark observations to
      previously established baseline values. The investigators are excited to see if there is an
      imminent effect on how patients feel using the Theranova dialyzer.

      The study is investigator initiated and the principal investigator has secured modest funding
      from Baxter to allow support for the core study team and the introduction and maintenance of
      the LEVIL evaluation platform at other centers. Baxter have also provided some dialyzer
      support, and will work with individual centers to ensure that there is no consumable
      increment of cost associated with participation.

      The study is 54 weeks in length:

        -  LEVIL entries with at least one hemodialysis treatment each week for 54 weeks

        -  Blood sampling at 3 time points

        -  Implementation of Theranova dialyzer from weeks 3 through14 and weeks 23 through 46

        -  Wash out period from weeks 15 through 22 and weeks 47 through 54

        -  Time to recovery question at the first treatment of weeks 1, 14, 22, and 46

        -  5-D Pruritus scale and Restless Legs Syndrome rating scale at the first treatment of
           weeks 1, 14, 22, and 46

        -  Echocardiogram prior to starting hemodialysis and at peak stress at baseline (within the
           first two weeks) and with one treatment between weeks 10 to 14 which will occur
           mid-week.

        -  CVInsight monitoring at baseline (within the first two weeks) and with one treatment
           between weeks 10 to 14 while on the Theranova dialyzer

    <intervention_model_description>Study visits take place within the patients' usual hemodialysis unit consistent with their routinely scheduled dialysis sessions. Beginning week 3 and 23 participants use the Theranova dialyzer until the end of the dialysis week on week 14 and 46. Participants answer 9 questions with at least one session regarding symptoms experienced since their last session using the LEVIL application. Furthermore, participants answer a single time to recovery question at the first treatment of weeks 1, 14, 22, and 46 to get more detailed information on recovery time after dialysis in addition to completing the 5-D Pruritus and the Restless Legs Syndrome scales.
Bloodwork is drawn at 3intervals throughout the study for laboratory evaluation.
Participants have an echo at baseline and once between weeks 10 to 14 while on the Theranova dialyzer. In addition to this, participants will have non-invasive monitoring of circulatory stress using the CVInsight contact device at the same time intervals.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Beginning week 1 and ending at the end of the dialysis week on week 46</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome will be a change (from patient's own baseline) in general well-being, pain, sleep, breathing, energy, appetite, itch, restless legs, and recovery from hemodialysis when using the Theranova dialyzer. These parameters will be measured using the LEVIL an electronic application based visual analog scale.</description>

    <description>The Theranova dialyzer will be used for each of the hemodialysis treatments beginning week 3 and ending at the end of the dialysis week on week 14 and again starting week 23 and ending at the end of the dialysis week on week 46 . This will allow us to compare patient reported symptoms in weeks 1 and 2 when patients are on their usual dialyzer with their symptoms using the Theranova dialyzer. This will also allow us to see if there is a carry-over effect.</description>
