  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are currently no cognitive tests that have been validated as screening tools for people
      with dementia and comorbid hearing loss. This is particularly important given the high
      prevalence of hearing impairment in older adults presenting to memory services and the risk
      of misdiagnosis of dementia in this population as outlined above.

      Cognitive tests validated in hearing impaired populations will also be important as outcome
      tools for interventional research aiming to find out if treating hearing loss may reduce
      dementia risk in the longer term.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hearing loss is very prevalent in older population. This leads to further problems such as
      communication problem, isolation from the community and depression. Moreover, hearing
      impairment may potentially affect the patients' cognitive function as demonstrated in the
      above mentioned published papers.

      Communication problems that arise from a hearing loss alone can also interfere with
      administration of cognitive test battery, as a previous study showed that re-administered of
      MMSE test with assistive listening device can immediately improve the test score among
      elderly (1).

      Therefore, special adaptation of the cognitive test battery to address the needs of hearing
      impaired older adult is necessary. This is to ensure that the test result reflects the exact
      cognitive state of the older adult with hearing impairment, not effected by hearing loss.

      Moreover, appropriate cut-off point scores for hearing impaired population should be
      identified for these new cognitive screening tools. This is to ensure appropriate referral
      for further diagnosis and prompt management for cognitive impairment/dementia among older
      adults with hearing loss.

      In addition, since hearing loss can potentially lead to deterioration in patients' cognitive
      function over time (2). Follow up assessments of cognitive function among older adults with
      hearing impairment can determine the rate of deterioration in retrospective trial(2). This
      prospective trial follow up of cognitive function among hearing loss participants may uncover
      additional risk factors associated with the deterioration. Better understanding of these risk
      factors can potentially lead to further intervention in order to delay decline in patients'
      cognitive function.

    <time_frame>approximately 1 years (expected to recruit 30 participants for each group)</time_frame>
    <description>The score will be used to calculate the appropriate cut-point score for differentiating each group of hearing impaired older adults.(total score ranging from 0-30 points with higher score indicate better cognitive function)</description>

    <measure>The adapted version Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III (ACE-III) questionnaire total score among dementia/mild cognitive impairment/normal cognition group of hearing impaired older adult.</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 1 years (expected to recruit 30 participants for each group)</time_frame>
    <description>The score will be used to calculate the appropriate cut-point score for differentiating each group of hearing impaired older adults (total score ranging from 0-100 points with higher score indicate better cognitive function)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hearing handicap score from the Modified Amsterdam Inventory for Auditory Disability and Handicap (mAIAD) (total score ranging from 0-84 with higher score indicate smaller perceived hearing difficulty)</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 1 years (expected to recruit 30 participants for each group)</time_frame>
    <description>The score from mAIAD and the hearing threshold from audiogram (in dB HL) along with the MoCA and ACE-III test scores will be used to determine what best predicts hearing handicap in the cognitively impaired population.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Final cognitive status diagnosis (base on ICD-10 coding system; dichotomous outcome; code F00-F03 (dementia) or code ICD F06.7 (Mild cognitive impairment)) provided by an NHS memory service doctors at routine clinical care follow up session at 1 year.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year follow up from initial recruitment</time_frame>
    <description>The final cognitive status diagnosis of the population will be compared with hearing and cognitive outcome measures at baseline ie. the hearing threshold from audiogram (in dB HL)) and MoCA and ACE-III tests score and mAIAD questionnaire scores to determine what parameters best predict cognitive change in diagnosis from the baseline assessments in hearing impaired/cognitive impaired population.</description>
