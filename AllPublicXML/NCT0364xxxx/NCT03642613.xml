    <textblock>
      This study is conducted as a multicenter, non-interventional, cross-sectional study. Patients
      will be enrolled in the study by a continuous registration method after patients provide
      written informed consent. After providing informed consent, patients will answer the
      questionnaires and start measurement with an accelerometer within four weeks. Activities will
      be measured for 14 consecutive days.

      This study is conducted as a multicenter, non-interventional, cross-sectional study. Patients
      will be enrolled in the study by a continuous registration method after patients provide
      written informed consent. After providing informed consent, patients will answer the
      questionnaires and start measurement with an accelerometer within four weeks. Activities will
      be measured for 14 consecutive days.

      &lt;Objectives&gt;

        -  Evaluation of factors relating to physical activity level in COPD patients.

        -  Evaluation of the number of daily steps in subgroups of COPD patients grouped according
           to patient characteristics including lung functions, mMRC, and CAT scores.

        -  Elucidation of impacts of factors associating PAL in COPD patients.

        -  Elucidating exploratorily the characteristics of the patients who are distributed
           differently in each factor and analyzing patients' PAL further with their background.

             are available*2

                  time of enrolment or within three months prior to enrolment are available. For
                  patients on a bronchodilator as a long-term controller, respiratory function test
                  values after bronchodilator in the morning of the test are acceptable.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have participated in any other interventional studies such as clinical
             trials within the past eight weeks

          2. Patients determined to be inappropriate to be enrolled in this study by investigators
             because they cannot comply with the procedures, limitations, and requirements of this
             study, or for other reasons.

          3. Patients with an exacerbation of COPDa within the past eight weeks a Exacerbation of
             COPD: Conditions with increased shortness of breath, increased cough and sputum,
