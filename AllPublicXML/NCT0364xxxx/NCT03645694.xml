    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the acceptability, utility, and preliminary
      effectiveness of a facial recognition technology for persons with memory concerns and their
      family care partners.

      This project develops a novel social support aid (SSA) to allow persons with memory concerns
      (PWMCs) to more fully engage in their social network and enhance their quality of life. The
      SSA will assist people in an early stage of dementia, e.g., Alzheimer's disease or related
      dementia, who desire social interaction, but struggle to remember names and relationships. It
      provides memory cuing by displaying the names and relationships of the people with whom PWMCs
      are engaged. The investigators anticipate that the SSA will offer robust support for care
      partners and PWMCs in various communities. The SSA is not intended to replace caregiver aids,
      but rather augment them to further improve quality of life. Millions of Americans have
      dementia, the loss of mental functions, e.g., thinking, memory, and reasoning, which
      interferes with their daily functioning. While some cases of dementia are caused by medical
      conditions that can be treated, most cannot be reversed. Hence, the focus switches from
      treatment to palliative care, i.e., developing a plan to make life easier and more
      comfortable for individuals with dementia and their caregivers. Assistive technologies to
      enhance living with dementia, let alone studies that evaluate their efficacy, are
      underdeveloped. The proposed project aims to begin filling this scientific and clinical gap
      by developing a social support aid and formally evaluating its utility via a sufficiently
      powered randomized controlled trial.

      This phase II Small Business Innovation Research project will continue work started in phase
      I and complete a product. The aim of this human subjects research protocol is to evaluate
      whether the SSA exerts positive benefits for PWMCs' social connections, communication, and
      quality of life via an embedded experimental mixed methods design that combines the
      collection and analysis of qualitative data within a traditional randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) design. The investigators hypothesize that the proposed SSA will exert positive
      benefits on the social connections, communication, and quality of life of people in early
      stage dementia.

    <description>Individuals with memory concerns in the experimental arm received the prototype facial recognition technology, which included a smartphone and smartwatch. The smartphone was equipped with facial recognition software application; the smartwatch communicated information with the smartphone. Persons with memory concerns and their family care partners were given a demonstration on how to utilize the technology.</description>

    <description>Please see earlier; the social support aid technology consists of a smartphone with a facial recognition software application and a smartwatch. Up to 1,000 individuals can be enrolled in the facial recognition application. Enrollment includes typing individuals names and relationships of the person with memory concern into the application and taking pictures of PWMC's faces at multiple angles. Once enrolled and in view of the smartphone's camera, the SSA's application recognizes the individual's face and alerts the smartwatch. The watch then vibrates and displays the individuals' name and relationship to the PWMC.</description>

          -  SLUMS score of 20 or above

        Care partners of PWMCs must be:

          -  21 years of age and over;

          -  self-identify as someone who provides assistance to the PWMC because of their memory
             loss (these individuals are called ''care partners,'' as these individuals may or may
             not provide the intensive hands-on care typical of ''caregivers'');
