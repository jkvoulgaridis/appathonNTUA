  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to develop regenerative cell therapy for use in female
      patients with aging skin. The primary objective of this proposal is to conduct a pilot study
      on the efficacy and safety of using PRP to treat this condition in females.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, there has been interest in treatments which are orientated to more biologically
      regenerative therapies, with several studies demonstrating successful use for PRP in skin
      rejuvenation. Although PRP is widely used in clinical dermatology, experimental studies
      confirming the effects of PRP on aged fibroblasts are very limited.

      PRP contains concentrated platelet cells derived from autologous whole blood that are
      believed to induce the synthesis of collagen and other matrix components by stimulating the
      activation of fibroblasts, thus rejuvenating the skin when injected into an area of collagen
      degeneration. In this proposal we will examine whether PRP therapy provides similar or better
      rejuvenating capacity in women compared to saline solution. The study will be a randomized,
      controlled trial comparing microneedling with PRP to microneedling with saline solution, in
      females aged 45 and over with skin aging of face. This study will also compare PRP to saline
      (given through injections via filler injection technique) in females with aging skin of the
      hands. Microneedling will not be performed on the hands.

    <description>The Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale assesses the presence and severity of wrinkles at rest in a rating scale from 0 to 4, where 0 means no visible wrinkles, 1 means minimal wrinkles, 2 means shallow wrinkles, 3 means moderately deep wrinkles and 4 means very deep wrinkles.</description>

    <measure>Hand Grading Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Hand Grading Scale assesses signs of hand aging based on loss of fat tissue and visibility of veins and tendons. It is rating scale form 0 to 4 where 0 means no loss of fat tissue, 1 means mild loss of fat tissue and slight visibility of veins, 2 means moderate loss of fat tissue and mild visibility of veins and tendons, 3 means severe loss of fat tissue and moderate visibility of veins and tendons and 4 means very severe loss of fat tissue and marked visibility of veins and tendons.</description>

    <description>Autologous Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) will be isolated from the blood collected from each subject at each treatment time point.
Face: Using a 30 gage needle, about four points of PRP or saline will be injected into the malar area; about six points will be injected into the mandibular area; and seven points will be injected into the forehead (0.2 mL per point) with a total volume of approximately 3.5 mL. PRP and saline application will be followed by microneedling.
Hands: Using a 30 gage needle about 1 cc of PRP or saline will be injected into the dorsal area of the hands (0.2mL per point) at five points. No microneedling will be performed on the hands.</description>
