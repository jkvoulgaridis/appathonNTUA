  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute pancreatitis is a common problem in the United States necessitating 275,000 hospital
      admissions per year, with resultant healthcare costs of approximately 2.5 billion USD
      annually. As numerous trials have failed to show a benefit to specific pharmacologic
      therapies in acute pancreatitis, the mainstay of treatment has been both supportive care and
      early, aggressive fluid resuscitation. Small randomized studies have shown conflicting
      results with regards to the influence of resuscitation fluid on outcomes in acute
      pancreatitis, necessitating a large randomized trial to clarify if fluid choice matters or
      not in the treatment of acute pancreatitis.

      The objective of this study is to assess the comparative efficacy of normal saline versus
      lactated ringer's solution in the management of acute pancreatitis.

      Patients presenting to the Los Angeles County Hospital with acute pancreatitis will be
      randomized to fluid resuscitation with NS or LR with volumes of fluid administered according
      to a pre-determined algorithm that will be the same for both treatment arms.

      The primary outcome of the study will be the change in SIRS prevalence from enrollment to 24
      hours. Secondary outcomes will include the change in SIRS prevalence from enrollment to 48
      hours and 72 hours, development of moderately severe or severe pancreatitis, change in PASS
      score, ICU admission, length of hospitalization, persistent pain or disability after
      discharge, and time of advancement to oral diet and discharge.

      Background: Acute pancreatitis is a common problem in the United States necessitating 275,000
      hospital admissions per year, with resultant healthcare costs of approximately 2.5 billion
      USD annually. As numerous trials have failed to show a benefit to specific pharmacologic
      therapies in acute pancreatitis, the mainstay of treatment has been both supportive care and
      early, aggressive fluid resuscitation. Small randomized studies have shown conflicting
      results with regards to the influence of resuscitation fluid on outcomes in acute
      pancreatitis, necessitating a large randomized trial to clarify if fluid choice matters or
      not in the treatment of acute pancreatitis.

      Objective: To assess the comparative efficacy of normal saline versus lactated ringer's
      solution in the management of acute pancreatitis.

      Study Design: Patients presenting to the Los Angeles County Hospital with acute pancreatitis
      are the focus population of this study. Patients will be randomized to fluid resuscitation
      with NS or LR within 8 hours of diagnosis of pancreatitis. The inclusion and exclusion
      criterion will be assessed (see below). Randomization will be performed using a random
      sequence algorithm with concealed allocation. The patients will be blinded to allocation by
      covering the bag with an opaque covering. A study physician determining the outcomes will
      also be blinded. Following randomization, the volumes of fluid administered for the
      resuscitation will be determined by a pre-determined algorithm that will be the same for both
      treatment arms. The hydration algorithm is as follows: all patients will receive a bolus of
      the treatment fluid at a rate of 5 mL/kg/hour to be administered over the first two hours
      (total 10 mL/kg) with an assessment for volume overload at 1 hour. They will then will
      receive maintenance fluids at a rate of 3 mL/kg/hour. After 12 hours participants will have
      blood urea nitrogen (BUN) assessed, which is part of the standard clinical procedure. Those
      who do not have a fall in this parameter or who develop SIRS by this 12 hour checkpoint will
      receive a second 5 mL/kg/hour bolus over two hours (as above) of their designated treatment
      fluid followed by further treatment fluid at a rate of 3 mL/kg/hour. Those who do have a fall
      in BUN will receive further treatment fluid at a rate of 3 mL/kg/hour for 12 additional
      hours. Patients' volume status will be assessed in the following manner: study physicians
      will perform a targeted physical exam which will include assessment of JVD, lung
      auscultation, and monitoring for edema Q12 hours for the first 24 hours, then daily for the
      remainder of the hospital admission. In elderly patients and those with co-morbidities, the
      targeted physical exam will be performed Q12 hours for the entire hospital admission. Vitals
      will also be obtained Q6-8 hours. If they develop signs of fluid overload including pitting
      edema, ascites, anasacra, pulmonary edema, or dyspnea, or signs of renal failure including
      oliguria, anuria, or hypotension, they will have their fluid rate managed at the discretion
      of their treating physicians. However, it will be requested that if further fluid is given
      that it be the assigned type (LR versus NS). At 24 hours patients will be assessed for SIRS
      development (see outcomes). Beyond this point fluid rate will be per the primary team though
      it still be encouraged that the assigned type of fluid (LR versus NS) is used for additional
      resuscitation with the rate and volume beyond this point at the discretion of the treating
      physician. However, if the treating physicians have a strong preference to change to a
      different fluid type for clinical reasons this will be recorded (for post hoc analysis) and
      the patient included in the intention to treat analysis.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Presentation with acute pancreatitis as defined by two of three criterion; amylase or
             lipase &gt; 3x the upper limit of normal, classical abdominal pain, or imaging suggestive
             of pancreatitis. Such radiographic findings include swelling, edema, or heterogeneity
             of the gland or peripancreatic fluid or stranding.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with severe pancreatitis as defined by the Revised Atlanta Classification
             will be excluded. Severe pancreatitis is defined by the Revised Atlanta Classification
             as those with a Modified Marshall score of &gt;2 for their cardiovascular renal, or
             respiratory system will be excluded (Figure 2).13 Practically this includes patients
             with systolic blood pressure &lt;90, serum creatinine &gt;1.9, and PaO2/FiO2 &lt;300 (Figure
             3). Since blood gases are unlikely to be drawn on those with mild pancreatitis we will
             exclude patients with an oxygen saturation &lt;92% on room air and certainly any patients
             which require intubation for respiratory failure due to pancreatitis.

          -  Patients who cannot tolerate increased doses of fluids for other reasons will also be
             excluded. This consists of those with cardiac insufficiency (CI, &gt;NYHA Class II heart
             failure), pulmonary edema, dialysis requirement, or severe liver dysfunction (albumin
             &lt; 3mg/dL, known cirrhosis).

          -  Pregnant women will also be excluded as they are prone to retain sodium and water,
             which puts them at increased risk of pulmonary congestion, ascites or peripheral
             edema.

          -  Patients who are incarcerated, younger than eighteen, or unable to give informed
             consent will be excluded.

          -  Individuals who present with clinical signs of edema or anasacra, including pulmonary
             congestion, peripheral swelling, and ascites, will also be ineligible for the study.

          -  Administration of fluids prior to the enrollment in the study will not be an exclusion
             criterion as this reflects actual clinical practice (hydration during evaluation
             period) however all fluids given prior to the study will be meticulously recorded.
