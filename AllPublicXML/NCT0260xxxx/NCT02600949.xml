    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I trial studies the side effects and best way to give personalized peptide
      vaccine in patients with pancreatic or colorectal cancer that has spread to other places in
      the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment (advanced). Personalized
      peptide vaccine is a vaccine developed from patient's own tumor cells and blood in order to
      use as a biological therapy. Biological therapies, such as personalized peptide vaccine may
      attack tumor cells and stop them from growing or kill them.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Demonstrate that developing a custom vaccine for metastatic pancreatic ductal
      adenocarcinoma (PDA) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patients is feasible.

      II. Show that a custom peptide-based vaccine in combination with pembrolizumab is safe.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine preliminary clinical efficacy. II. Demonstrate the antigenicity of each vaccine.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive personalized synthetic tumor-associated peptide vaccine therapy
      subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 of weeks 0, 1, 3, 4 and 6, then every 3 weeks until week 30,
      then at weeks 39 and 51. Beginning 30 minutes after each vaccine is administered, patients
      then receive imiquimod cream topically after 30 minutes. Patients also receive pembrolizumab
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses with pembrolizumab repeat every 3 weeks
      until week 51 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up 2 times in 6 months.

             injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal
             influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed
