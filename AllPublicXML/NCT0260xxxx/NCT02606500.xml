  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to determine, whether clinical efficacy of 150 mcg of
      Corifollitropin alfa is the same in normal weighing and obese women. Furthermore,
      investigators want to determine whether oocytes retrieved from normal weighing and obese
      women, after COH using 150 mcg of Corifollitropin alfa, are of same quality on the molecular
      level.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dosage of Corifollitropin alfa used for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) is
      adjusted according to the patient's body weight. Meaning, in women with a body weight ≤ 60
      kg, a single dose of 100 mcg of Corifollitropin alfa is administered for COH and in women
      with a body weight &gt; 60 kg, a single dose of 150 micrograms of Corifollitropin alfa is
      administered for COH. These two protocols are comparable in safety and efficacy of follicular
      stimulation.

      On the other hand, knowledge about the clinical efficacy of 150 mcg of Corifollitropin alfa
      in obese women (BMI&gt;30 kg/m2) is lacking.

      Cumulus cells (CC) surround the oocyte and bi-directional communication between oocyte and CC
      is necessary for the development of mature and quality oocytes. It has been proposed, that
      analysis of genes, expressed in CC, can serve as an objective indicator of the oocyte's
      maturity and developmental potential. Expression of genes in CC as hyaluronan synthase 2
      (HAS2), follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), versican (VCAN), progesterone receptor
      (PR), vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGFC), serine protease inhibitor E2 (SERPINE2),
      glutathione peroxidase (GPX3), pentraxin 3(PTX3) was reported to correlate with oocyte
      maturity and developmental potential.

      The effect of Corifollitropin alfa on expression of these genes however, is unknown.

    <description>20 obese women will be the study group and 20 normal weighing women will be the control group. Both groups will receive 150 mcg of Elonva for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist will be used to prevent premature luteinizing hormone (LH) surge. Additional daily doses of 200 IU of recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (rFSH) will be used if necessary. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) will be used for oocyte maturation. 2 mature follicles will be aspirated separately in each patient. Cumulus cell (CC) samples will be collected and stored on -80 oC for subsequent analysis. Clinical and molecular parameters of IVF success will be assessed and compared between the groups.
The exclusion criteria will be: polycystic ovary syndrome, severely abnormal sperm parameters, and age &gt; 38 years.</description>

          <description>35 obese women (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) were included to the study group. 150 mcg of Elonva for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) on day 2 or 3 of menstrual cycle. GnRH antagonist was used to prevent premature LH surge. Additional daily doses of 200 IU of rFSH were used if necessary to achieve optimal ovarian stimulation. hCG was used to induce final oocyte maturation. Follicles were aspirated separately in each patient. Cumulus cells (CC) samples of the first 2 aspirated follicles were collected and stored on -80 oC for subsequent analyses. Clinical IVF parameters were assessed and compared between the groups. Also, gene expression analyses of CC were performed using quantitative real-time PCR.
Inclusion criteria for the study group were: first or second IVF cycle, BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, tubal factor of infertility, normal partner's spermiogram.</description>

            <description>35 obese women (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) were included to the study group. 150 mcg of Elonva for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) on day 2 or 3 of menstrual cycle. GnRH antagonist was used to prevent premature LH surge. Additional daily doses of 200 IU of rFSH were used if necessary to achieve optimal ovarian stimulation. hCG was used to induce final oocyte maturation. Follicles were aspirated separately in each patient. Cumulus cells (CC) samples of the first 2 aspirated follicles were collected and stored on -80 oC for subsequent analyses. Clinical IVF parameters were assessed and compared between the groups. Also, gene expression analyses of CC were performed using quantitative real-time PCR.
Inclusion criteria for the study group were: first or second IVF cycle, BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, tubal factor of infertility, normal partner's spermiogram.</description>

        <title>Real-time PCR Analysis of Genes That Were Proposed as Biomarkers of Oocyte Quality to Determine Effect of Corifollitropin Alpha on Oocyte Quality on Molecular Level</title>
        <description>Expression of some genes that were proposed as biomarkers of oocyte quality was analysed in CC using real-time PCR. Relative expression values of genes were compared between mature oocytes derived from obese women and mature oocytes derived from normal weighing women.</description>
        <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
        <population>Gene expression in cumulus cells surrounding mature oocytes was analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). We analyzed 53 CC samples in the Study group and 56 CC samples in Control group.</population>

            <title>Study Group</title>
            <description>35 obese women (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) were included to the study group. 150 mcg of Elonva for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) on day 2 or 3 of menstrual cycle. GnRH antagonist was used to prevent premature LH surge. Additional daily doses of 200 IU of rFSH were used if necessary to achieve optimal ovarian stimulation. hCG was used to induce final oocyte maturation. Follicles were aspirated separately in each patient. Cumulus cells (CC) samples of the first 2 aspirated follicles were collected and stored on -80 oC for subsequent analyses. Clinical IVF parameters were assessed and compared between the groups. Also, gene expression analyses of CC were performed using quantitative real-time PCR.
Inclusion criteria for the study group were: first or second IVF cycle, BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, tubal factor of infertility, normal partner's spermiogram.</description>
