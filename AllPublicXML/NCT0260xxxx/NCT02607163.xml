  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury(AKI) is a common and severe complication after the cardiac surgery.
      Postoperative AKI increases the in-hospital stay, intensive care unit(ICU) stay and
      postoperative mortality. Aortic surgery is the most risky surgery that causes the
      postoperative AKI, and the incidence of AKI after aortic surgery is about 50%.

      The α1- and α2-adrenergic receptors in the kidney modulate vasoconstrictor and vasodilatory
      effects, respectively. Agents that attenuate renal vasoconstriction may have potential as
      renoprotective drugs because vasoconstriction most likely contributes to the pathophysiology
      of AKI. Clonidine, an α2-agonist, has been shown experimentally to inhibit renin release and
      cause a diuresis, and it has been evaluated in an experimental AKI model, confirming its
      potential as a renoprotective agent. Furthermore, it has been already reported that
      dexmedetomidine, α2-agonist, reduce the impairment of renal function after cardiac operation.

      The aim of this study is to examine the association between preoperative dexmedetomidine
      infusion and the incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury(AKI) in patients undergoing
      aortic surgery.
