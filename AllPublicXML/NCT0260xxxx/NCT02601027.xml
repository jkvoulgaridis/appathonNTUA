  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine if using abdominal nerve blocks when patient
      undergo breast reconstruction can significantly decrease use of pain medications after
      reconstructive surgery.

      Primary Objective: The primary objective is to determine if pre-operative transversus
      abdominis plane (TAP) blocks with continued infusion of local anesthetic post-operatively
      affect post-operative narcotic usage as compared to a placebo TAP block.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To determine if pre-operative TAP blocks with continued infusion of local anesthetic
           post-operatively affect post-operative pain scores as compared to a placebo TAP block.

        -  To determine if pre-operative TAP blocks with continued infusion of local anesthetic
           post-operatively affect anti-emetic usage as compared to a placebo TAP block.

        -  To determine if pre-operative TAP blocks with continued infusion of local anesthetic
           post-operatively affect time to ambulation post-operatively as compared to a placebo TAP
           block.

        -  To determine if pre-operative TAP blocks with continued infusion of local anesthetic
           post-operatively affect time to first bowel movement as compared to a placebo TAP block.

        -  To determine if pre-operative TAP blocks with continued infusion of local anesthetic
           post-operatively affect patient-reported quality of life as compared to a placebo TAP
           block.

    <measure>Post-operative Narcotic Usage</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Total oral morphine equivalents of narcotic used in first 48 hours post-operatively after breast reconstruction. Post-operative Narcotic Usage will be measured in total oral morphine equivalents (OME) calculated by summing all narcotics used in the first 48 hours post-operatively.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-operative Pain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Post-operative Pain Score is defined using Visual Analog Scale (VAS), a patient reported pain score on a scale of 0-10.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-operative Anti-emetic Usage</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Post-operative Anti-emetic Usage is defined as the total amount of IV ondansetron administered to a patient during the first 48 hours post-operatively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Ambulation</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Time to Ambulation is defined as the time to the first instance a patient is able to stand up and walk a few steps post-operatively. The time of first ambulation will be recorded by the nurse on shift. Time to Ambulation will be calculated from midnight on POD 1.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to First Bowel Movement</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Time to First Bowel Movement is defined as the time to the first instance a patient passes stool post-operatively. The time of first bowel movement will be recorded by the nurse on shift. Time to First Bowel Movement will be calculated from midnight on POD 1.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life Measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life is defined as the calculated score from the BREAST-Q questionnaire. Quality of Life will be measured by having the patient fill out the BREAST-Q questionnaire preoperatively, as well as post-operatively between 1-6 months after surgery.</description>
