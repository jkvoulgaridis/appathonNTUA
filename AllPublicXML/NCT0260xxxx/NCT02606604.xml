      This study will seek to determine the benefits that FES-LE cycling has over cycling alone on
      walking performance and quality of life in people with multiple sclerosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) is a rehabilitation tool that stimulates nerves via
      electrical current, causing muscles to contract. When FES is appled to leg muscles during
      stationary cycling the legs move in a fixed rhythmical pattern. Previous studies have
      demonstrated that FES during cycling is a safe and effective exercise for individuals
      recovering from spinal cord injury or stroke, but few have applied this tool to a progressive
      disorder, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). The aim of this study is to assess the immediate
      and short-term effect of an 8-week training program comparing FES lower extremity cycling to
      cycling without FES. Twenty volunteers with MS will participate. They will be randomly
      assigned to a training group. This study examine the effects of training on quality of life,
      endurance, walking speed, and step quality. Participants will sign an informed consent and
      complete a questionnaire that includes medical history and demographic data. Before training,
      immediately after training finishes and one month after training, self-report questionnaires,
      timed walking tests will be completed. During the walking tests, step quality and speed will
      be measured with a sensor that is worn on a belt

    <measure>Self-reported Fatigue Using Modified Fatigue Impact Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Fatigue Impact Scale is a 21 item self-report questionnaire that takes 5-10 minutes to complete. It uses a 5-point likert scale to rate the patient's perception of how Multiple Sclerosis related fatigue affects an individual's life on an everyday basis. It contains three subscales that include: cognitive, physical, and psychosocial dimensions. Scores on the subscales can be analyzed individually or as a summed score to give an overall fatigue score. Higher scores indicate a greater impact of fatigue. The minimum score is a 0 and the maximum score is 81.</description>

    <measure>Self-reported Walking Using 12 Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale is a 12-item self-report questionnaire that takes approximately 10 minutes to complete and reflects a persons' perception of the impact that multiple sclerosis has on walking ability during the past 2 weeks. Each of the items scored ranges from 1 to 5, in which higher scores indicate a greater impact of multiple sclerosis on their walking. Scores on the 12 items are summed. To transform to a 0‐100 scale, the minimum score of 12 is subtracted from the sum; the result is divided by 48 and then multiplied by 100. The lowest score is 0 and the highest score is 100. Higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>The Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 is a self-report quality of life questionnaire. It measures health-related quality of life using both generic and disease-specific measures and was constructed by experts in the field. There is no overall score for this scale since it contains 12 subscales, two summary scores, and two single-item measures. The quality of life subscale was the chosen outcome measure reported below. The scores range from 0-100. Higher scores on the scale notes improved outcome.</description>

        <title>Self-reported Fatigue Using Modified Fatigue Impact Scale</title>
        <description>The Modified Fatigue Impact Scale is a 21 item self-report questionnaire that takes 5-10 minutes to complete. It uses a 5-point likert scale to rate the patient's perception of how Multiple Sclerosis related fatigue affects an individual's life on an everyday basis. It contains three subscales that include: cognitive, physical, and psychosocial dimensions. Scores on the subscales can be analyzed individually or as a summed score to give an overall fatigue score. Higher scores indicate a greater impact of fatigue. The minimum score is a 0 and the maximum score is 81.</description>

          <title>Self-reported Fatigue Using Modified Fatigue Impact Scale</title>
          <description>The Modified Fatigue Impact Scale is a 21 item self-report questionnaire that takes 5-10 minutes to complete. It uses a 5-point likert scale to rate the patient's perception of how Multiple Sclerosis related fatigue affects an individual's life on an everyday basis. It contains three subscales that include: cognitive, physical, and psychosocial dimensions. Scores on the subscales can be analyzed individually or as a summed score to give an overall fatigue score. Higher scores indicate a greater impact of fatigue. The minimum score is a 0 and the maximum score is 81.</description>

        <title>Self-reported Walking Using 12 Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale</title>
        <description>The Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale is a 12-item self-report questionnaire that takes approximately 10 minutes to complete and reflects a persons' perception of the impact that multiple sclerosis has on walking ability during the past 2 weeks. Each of the items scored ranges from 1 to 5, in which higher scores indicate a greater impact of multiple sclerosis on their walking. Scores on the 12 items are summed. To transform to a 0‐100 scale, the minimum score of 12 is subtracted from the sum; the result is divided by 48 and then multiplied by 100. The lowest score is 0 and the highest score is 100. Higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>

It measures health-related quality of life using both generic and disease-specific measures and was constructed by experts in the field. There is no overall score for this scale since it contains 12 subscales, two summary scores, and two single-item measures. The quality of life subscale was the chosen outcome measure reported below. The scores range from 0-100. Higher scores on the scale notes improved outcome.</description>
