  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open label, non-randomized Phase 1 study, to be conducted in two
      parts, Part A, and Part B. Part A is the dose escalation phase for evaluating the safety and
      tolerability profile of PRN1371, a FGFR 1-4 Kinase inhibitor. Part B is the Cohort Expansion
      phase in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma to further evaluate safety and
      tolerability, preliminary activity, PK, and PD in patients with FGFR genetic alterations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a dose escalation study. The protocol specifies rules for dose-limiting toxicity
      and a maximum tolerated dose (MTD). To gain further experience with the MTD, and/or at some
      lower optimal biologic dose level, an expansion cohort (Part B) will be enrolled in patients
      with metastatic urothelial carcinoma with fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1, 2, 3 or
      4 genetic alterations.
