    <measure>Baseline Values and Mean Change From Baseline At Week 48 In Derived Liver Iron Concentration (LIC) By Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) (Data Cut-off Date: 11 May 2018)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline: Week -12 to Day -1; Treatment: Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>In β-thalassemia adult patients who are transfused, iron overload occurs mainly as a result of accumulation of iron from transfusions and, to a lesser extent, increased intestinal absorption of iron due to hepcidin suppression. Baseline was defined as the last value on or before the first dose of study drug was administered; if multiple values were present for the same date, the average of these values was used. If a participant had 1 postbaseline assessment, it was used as the Week 48 value. If a participant had multiple postbaseline assessments, the last one was used as the Week 48 value. The value of LIC was either the value collected from the electronic case report form or the value derived from the T2*, R2*, or R2 parameter, depending on which techniques and software were used for magnetic resonance imaging LIC acquisition. Participants with an LIC value &gt; 43 mg/g were not included in the analysis.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline: Day 1; Treatment: Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>For BMD, the lumbar spine and total hip were measured at baseline and 48 weeks by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Baseline was defined as the last value on or before the first dose of study drug is administered; if multiple values are present for the same date, the average of these values was used. If during the 48 week double-blinded treatment period, a participant has only one assessment, it is counted as 'Week 48' visit; if a participant has multiple assessments, the last one is used as 'Week 48' visit. The analysis was done on the population that had at least 2 measurements.</description>

    <measure>Baseline Values and Mean Change From Baseline in the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Questionnaire Physical Functioning Domain at Weeks 24 and 48 (Data Cut-off Date: 11 May 2018)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline: 4 weeks prior to Day 1; Treatment: Weeks 24 and 48</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a generic, self-administered instrument consisting of 8 multi-item scales that assess 8 health domains. Survey items 3a-3j comprise the Physical Functioning domain which is reported here. The raw score for each health domain is transformed into a 0 (worst) to 100 (best) domain score. The 0-100 scale score for each health domain is further converted to normbased scores using a T-score transformation, with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Higher norm-based T-scores indicate better heath/QoL, based on data from a nationally representative sample of adults from the US. The range of possible T-scores for the Physical Functioning domain is 19.26 - 57.54 and the minimally important differences between readings is considered 3.0. The completion of the SF-36 for a given visit was defined as ≥ 50% of all items being answered (ie, ≥ 18 items of the 36 items). Positive change from baseline values indicate improvement.</description>

A TEAE includes AEs between the first dose date of either study drug and 90 days after the last dose of study drug. A serious AE is any AE occurring at any dose that - Results in death - Is life-threatening - Requires or prolongs existing inpatient hospitalization - Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity - Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect - Constitutes an important medical event. The Investigator assessed the relationship of each AE to study drug and graded the severity according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 4.03): - Grade 1 = Mild - Grade 2 = Moderate (some limitation in activity; no/minimal medical intervention) - Grade 3 = Severe (limitation in activity; medical intervention required) - Grade 4 = Life-threatening - Grade 5 = Death</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          1. Male or female, ≥18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent document
             (ICF).

          2. Subject must understand and voluntarily sign an Inform Consent Form prior to any
             study-related assessments/procedures being conducted.

          3. Subject is willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements.

          4. Documented diagnosis of β-thalassemia or Hemoglobin E/β-thalassemia. (β-thalassemia
             with mutation and/or multiplication of alpha globin is allowed).

          5. Regularly transfused, defined as: 6-20 Red Blood Cell (RBC) units* in the 24 weeks
             prior to randomization and no transfusion-free period for ≥ 35 days during that
             period.

             * Sites who prescribe transfusions and have the transfusion records only in volumes
             should use for conversion of volume to units the below criteria, in order to obtain
             number of units within the last 24 weeks to assess the eligibility: 1 unit in this
             protocol refers to a quantity of packed RBCs approximately 200-350 mL. (i) sites who
             use transfusion bags within this range, or ≥ 350 mL, the conversion in units should be
             done by dividing the volume transfused to the patient by 350 mL, (ii) sites who use
             transfusion bags &lt; 200 mL, the conversion in units should be done by dividing the
             volume transfused to the patient by 200 mL.

          6. Performance status: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0 or 1.

          7. A female of childbearing potential (FCBP) for this study is defined as a female who:
             1) has achieved menarche at some point, 2) has not undergone a hysterectomy or
             bilateral oophorectomy or 3) has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea
             following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24
             consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive
             months). FCBP participating in the study must:

               1. Have two negative pregnancy tests as verified by the Investigator prior to
                  starting study therapy. She must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing during the
                  course of the study, and after end of study treatment. This applies even if the
                  subject practices true abstinence ** from heterosexual contact.

               2. Either commit to true abstinence** from heterosexual contact (which must be
                  reviewed on a monthly basis and source documented) If a FCBP engages in sexual
                  activity that may result in a pregnancy, she must agree to use, and be able to
                  comply with, effective*** contraception without interruption, 28 days prior to
                  starting investigational product, during the study therapy (including dose
                  interruptions), and for 12 weeks (approximately five times the mean terminal
                  half-life of luspatercept based on multiple-dose Pharmacokinetic PK) data) after
                  discontinuation of study therapy.

                    -  True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and
                       usual lifestyle of the subject. [Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar,
                       ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not
                       acceptable methods of contraception.] *** Agreement to use highly effective
                       methods of contraception that alone or in combination result in a failure
                       rate of a Pearl index of less than 1% per year when used consistently and
                       correctly throughout the course of the study.

             Such methods include: Combined (estrogen and progesterone/progestin containing)
             hormonal contraception: Oral; Intravaginal; Transdermal; Progestogen/progestin only
             hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: Oral; Injectable
             hormonal contraception; Implantable hormonal contraception; Placement of an
             intrauterine device (IUD); Placement of an intrauterine hormone-releasing system
             (IUS); Bilateral tubal occlusion; Vasectomized partner; Sexual Abstinence.

          8. Male subjects must:

               -  Practice true abstinence or agree to use a condom during sexual contact with a
                  pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential while participating in the
                  study, during dose interruptions and for at least 12 weeks (approximately five
                  times the mean terminal half-life of luspatercept based on multiple-dose PK data)
                  following investigational product discontinuation, even if he has undergone a
                  successful vasectomy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:

          1. Any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that
             would prevent the subject from participating in the study.

        <title>Baseline Values and Mean Change From Baseline At Week 48 In Derived Liver Iron Concentration (LIC) By Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) (Data Cut-off Date: 11 May 2018)</title>
        <description>In β-thalassemia adult patients who are transfused, iron overload occurs mainly as a result of accumulation of iron from transfusions and, to a lesser extent, increased intestinal absorption of iron due to hepcidin suppression. Baseline was defined as the last value on or before the first dose of study drug was administered; if multiple values were present for the same date, the average of these values was used. If a participant had 1 postbaseline assessment, it was used as the Week 48 value. If a participant had multiple postbaseline assessments, the last one was used as the Week 48 value. The value of LIC was either the value collected from the electronic case report form or the value derived from the T2*, R2*, or R2 parameter, depending on which techniques and software were used for magnetic resonance imaging LIC acquisition. Participants with an LIC value &gt; 43 mg/g were not included in the analysis.</description>

        <description>For each participant, the baseline mean serum ferritin level was calculated during the 12 weeks prior to first study drug administration. The postbaseline mean serum ferritin level was calculated during the last 12 weeks of the 48-week double-blind Treatment Period or last 12 weeks of study treatment, if discontinued early. The change was calculated as the difference of post baseline mean serum ferritin level and baseline mean serum ferritin level.</description>

        <description>For BMD, the lumbar spine and total hip were measured at baseline and 48 weeks by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Baseline was defined as the last value on or before the first dose of study drug is administered; if multiple values are present for the same date, the average of these values was used. If during the 48 week double-blinded treatment period, a participant has only one assessment, it is counted as 'Week 48' visit; if a participant has multiple assessments, the last one is used as 'Week 48' visit. The analysis was done on the population that had at least 2 measurements.</description>

        <description>The TranQol is a disease-specific, self-administered, well-validated health-related quality of life tool developed for beta-thalassemia patients. The adult self-report version used in this study, includes 36 questions assessed on a 5-point response, that are grouped into 5 domains (Physical Health, Emotional Health, Sexual Health, Family Functioning, School/Career Functioning). Scores are calculated according to author's guidelines and scoring rules. The total score ranges from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). The TranQoL was considered completed at a given visit when ≥ 75% of all items were answered (ie, ≥ 27 items of the 36 items or a nonmissing total score). Positive change from baseline values indicate improvement.</description>

        <title>Baseline Values and Mean Change From Baseline in the Transfusion-dependent Quality of Life (TranQol) Questionnaire Physical Health Domain at Weeks 24 and 48 (Data Cut-off Date: 11 May 2018)</title>
        <description>The TranQol is a disease-specific, self-administered, well-validated health-related quality of life tool developed for beta-thalassemia patients. The adult self-report version used in this study, includes 10 questions concerning physical assessed on a 5-point response scale. Scores are calculated according to author's guidelines and scoring rules. The Physical Health Domain ranges from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). The TranQoL was considered completed at a given visit when ≥ 75% of all items were answered (ie, ≥ 27 items of the 36 items or a nonmissing total score). Positive change from baseline values indicate improvement.</description>

        <title>Baseline Values and Mean Change From Baseline in the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Questionnaire Physical Functioning Domain at Weeks 24 and 48 (Data Cut-off Date: 11 May 2018)</title>
        <description>The SF-36 is a generic, self-administered instrument consisting of 8 multi-item scales that assess 8 health domains. Survey items 3a-3j comprise the Physical Functioning domain which is reported here. The raw score for each health domain is transformed into a 0 (worst) to 100 (best) domain score. The 0-100 scale score for each health domain is further converted to normbased scores using a T-score transformation, with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Higher norm-based T-scores indicate better heath/QoL, based on data from a nationally representative sample of adults from the US. The range of possible T-scores for the Physical Functioning domain is 19.26 - 57.54 and the minimally important differences between readings is considered 3.0. The completion of the SF-36 for a given visit was defined as ≥ 50% of all items being answered (ie, ≥ 18 items of the 36 items). Positive change from baseline values indicate improvement.</description>

        <description>The SF-36 is a generic, self-administered instrument consisting of 8 multi-item scales that assess 8 health domains. Survey items 1, 11a-11d comprise the General Health domain which is reported here. The raw score for each health domain is transformed into a 0 (worst) to 100 (best) domain score. The 0-100 scale score for each health domain is further converted to norm-based scores using a T-score transformation, with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Higher norm-based T-scores indicate better heath/QoL, based on data from a nationally representative sample of adults from the US. The range of possible T-scores for the General Health domain is 18.95 - 66.50 and the minimally important differences between readings is considered 2.0. The completion of the SF-36 for a given visit was defined as ≥ 50% of all items being answered (ie, ≥ 18 items of the 36 items). Positive change from baseline values indicate improvement.</description>

        <description>An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen during the course of a study. A TEAE includes AEs between the first dose date of either study drug and 90 days after the last dose of study drug. A serious AE is any AE occurring at any dose that - Results in death - Is life-threatening - Requires or prolongs existing inpatient hospitalization - Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity - Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect - Constitutes an important medical event. The Investigator assessed the relationship of each AE to study drug and graded the severity according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 4.03): - Grade 1 = Mild - Grade 2 = Moderate (some limitation in activity; no/minimal medical intervention) - Grade 3 = Severe (limitation in activity; medical intervention required) - Grade 4 = Life-threatening - Grade 5 = Death</description>
