    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion study with BID (suspension)
      and TID (tablet) oral dose of tazemetostat. Subjects will be screened for eligibility within
      14 days of the planned first dose of tazemetostat. A treatment cycle will be 28 days.
      Response assessment will be evaluated after 8 weeks of treatment and subsequently every 8
      weeks while on study.

      The study has two parts: Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion.
