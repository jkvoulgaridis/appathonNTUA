      The PROP UP research study is funded by The Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute
      (PCORI). PROP UP is a multi-centered prospective observational study that will evaluate
      all-oral treatment regimens for chronic hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection regarding several
      patient-reported outcomes (PROs) such as HCV-associated symptoms, treatment side effects,
      medication adherence, out of pocket costs, comorbid conditions, and long-term benefits of
      cure and harms of treatment to compare PROs of different treatment regimens, treatment
      durations, and patient subgroups. Participants will be recruited from 9 U.S. liver centers.
      Approximately 1920 patients with HCV infection who are prescribed a regimen containing
      Sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir(SOF/LED), SOF/Velpatasvir(SOF/VEL), Grazoprevir/Elbasvir(GRZ/ELB),
      OBV/PTV/r + DSV (PRoD), or daclatasvir/SOF (DAC/SOF) will be recruited and approximately 1600
      patients who are approved and begin HCV treatment will be enrolled in the longitudinal study.
      PRO surveys will be evaluated before, during and after HCV treatment.

      PROP UP is a collaborative effort between behavioral and biomedical researchers, a patient
      engagement group and a patient advocacy organization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Newer, more effective all-oral regimens for hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection are available.
      However the available data from industry-sponsored trials do not provide all the information
      that patients need, nor do these data represent the broad spectrum of patients treated in
      real-world practice. Trials also exclude disadvantaged subgroups, focus on short-term
      efficacy and clinician-rated adverse events, rarely obtain the patient's perspective, and do
      not investigate longer-term harms of treatment or benefits of viral cure. Given these
      informational gaps, patient-centered outcomes research on treatment harms and benefits that
      matter most to patients, is needed.

      PROP UP is funded by The Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). PROP UP is a
      multi-centered prospective observational study that will evaluate newly approved direct
      acting antiviral (DAA) treatment regimens for HCV regarding several patient-reported outcomes
      (PROs) such as HCV-associated symptoms, treatment side effects, medication adherence, out of
      pocket costs, comorbid conditions, and long-term benefits of cure and harms of treatment to
      compare PROs of different treatment regimens, treatment durations, and patient subgroups.

      PROP UP is a collaborative effort between researchers, a patient engagement group, and a
      patient advocacy organization. Eleven U.S. liver centers will collaborate on PROP UP.
      Approximately 1920 patients with HCV infection who are prescribed a DAA regimen for chronic
      HCV will be consented and will complete baseline PRO surveys. Approximately 1600 patients who
      are approved and begin HCV treatment will be enrolled in the longitudinal study. Participants
      will complete several PRO surveys at 5 assessment periods during the study: baseline,
      treatment week 4, end of treatment, 3 months post-treatment, and 12 months post-treatment.
      PRO survey data will be collected via 3 options: patient home-based computers, tablet,
      smartphone; phone-administered surveys with a centralized call enter; or at regular clinic
      visits.

      Analysis of PROs collected longitudinally before, during and after treatment for HCV will
      allow the investigators to answer a variety of questions important to patients and
      clinicians. Specifically, the investigators will evaluate: (a) prevalence of pre-existing
      baseline symptoms associated with HCV; (b) the development of new onset treatment side
      effects and exacerbation of pre-existing symptoms during HCV treatment; (c) medication
      adherence and out of pocket costs associated with treatment; (d) changes in HCV-associated
      symptoms and functional status in patients who are cured; (e) long-term patient-reported
      harms associated with treatments and long-term benefits associated with viral cure.

    <measure>Change in the Total Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale Mean Score (TMSAS) From Baseline to On-Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 24 weeks of HCV Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Change in &quot;Overall Symptom Burden&quot; was measured using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS). Patients indicate the presence or absence of a symptom, and if present, rate the symptom on severity, frequency and interference. The total MSAS score (TMSAS) can range from 0 (no symptom) to 4 (symptom present and worst severity, frequency and distress). Change in TMSAS score is calculated as Baseline TMSAS mean score minus T2 TMSAS mean score or Baseline TMSAS mean score minus T3 TMSAS mean score.
Change scores could range from +/- 4.0. Higher scores (+) indicate worse symptom burden.
To aid in interpretation of clinically significant change, a &gt;5% change from baseline was set as the &quot;minimally important change (MIC)&quot; threshold. A 5% change in the TMSAS = 0.3 points; therefore TMSAS change scores &gt; +/- 0.3 were considered clinically meaningful.</description>

    <measure>Change in Treatment-Related Symptom Mean Scores From Baseline to On-Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 24 weeks of HCV Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Treatment-Related Symptoms was measured using multiple surveys from the NIH Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6). Mean CHANGE Scores were calculated as baseline mean score minus T2 mean score or baseline mean score minus T3 mean score. Lower change scores (-) indicate symptoms improved.
PROMIS Fatigue-7 mean change score range = +/- 53.9
PROMIS Sleep Disturbance-8a mean change score range = +/- 47.1
PROMIS Nausea/Vomiting-4 mean change score range = +/- 44.0
PROMIS Diarrhea-6 mean change score range = +/- 42.8
PROMIS Anger-5 mean change score range = +/- 50.5.
PROMIS Anxiety-4 mean change score range = +/- 41.4
HIT-6 mean change score range = +/- 42
To aid in interpretation of clinical significance, a 5% change from baseline is considered a &quot;minimally important change (MIC).&quot; The 5% MIC change in a PROMIS or HIT-6 score is +/- 2.5 points.</description>

    <measure>Change in HCV-PRO Mean Scores From Baseline to On-Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 24 weeks of HCV Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>HCV-specific Functional Well-Being was measured using the disease-specific &quot;HCV-PRO.&quot; The scale includes 16 items that measure physical, emotional and social functioning, productivity, intimacy, and perception of quality of life.
The Means provided are the HCV-PRO Mean Change Scores, calculated as Baseline HCV-PRO mean score minus T2 HCV-PRO mean score or Baseline HCV-PRO mean score minus T3 HCV-PRO mean score.
HCV-PRO mean change scores range from +/- 100. Higher change scores (+) indicate better HCV-PRO outcomes.
To aid in interpretation of clinically significant change, a &gt;5% change from baseline was set as the &quot;minimally important change (MIC)&quot; threshold. A 5% change in HCV-PRO = 4 points; therefore HCV-PRO change scores &gt; +/- 4.0 were considered clinically meaningful.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cumulative Out of Pocket Costs During HCV Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 weeks of HCV Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Cumulative out of pocket (OOP) costs incurred by patients during HCV treatment was measured by a survey recording 5 direct and 5 indirect costs of treatment. OOP costs were collected early on-treatment (T2), late on-treatment (T3), and early post-treatment (T4) in case patients paid bills after treatment ended.
The Mean is the average dollar ($$) amount for Total OOP Cost of HCV Treatment for the cohort, calculated by summing the OOP costs for each patient reported at T2+T3+T4.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Nonadherence During HCV Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 weeks of HCV Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Medication adherence was measured using the Voils' Medication Adherence Survey (VMAS). The VMAS consists of 3 items that evaluated the extent of adherence using a 5-point Likert scale from 1=None of the time to 5=All of the time. The 3 items assess how often participants missed doses, skip doses, or do not take doses over the past 7 days and are averaged into a single score. A dichotomous variable was created to categorize patients as 100% (adherent) or &lt;100% (nonadherent) during HCV treatment at early treatment (T2) and late treatment (T3).</description>

    <measure>Change in Total Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (TMSAS) Mean Score From Baseline to 3-months Post Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3-months post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Change in &quot;Overall Symptom Burden&quot; from Baseline to 3-months post-treatment was measured using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS).
The total Overall Symptom Burden mean change score (TMSAS) was calculated as Baseline TMSAS mean score minus T4 TMSAS mean score.
Lower scores (-) indicate better outcomes. Change scores were calculated for two subgroups: (1) Patients who achieved SVR and (2) patients who did not achieve SVR.
TMSAS Mean Change Scores could range from +/- 4.
To aid in interpretation of clinically significant change, a &gt;5% change from baseline was set as the &quot;minimally important change (MIC)&quot; threshold. A 5% change in the TMSAS = 0.3 points; therefore TMSAS change scores &gt; +/- 0.3 were considered clinically meaningful.</description>

          <description>Overall symptom burden was measured using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS). The MSAS is a reliable and validated 32-item instrument used to measure change in pre-existing HCV symptoms. The MSAS evaluates 32 symptoms common in medical populations. Patients indicate the presence or absence of a symptom. If present, rate the construct on severity, frequency and distress. An overall symptom burden score is created: TMSAS (total MSAS score). The TMSAS scores range from 0 (no symptom) to 4 (present, severe, frequent, distressing). Higher scores indicate worse overall symptom burden.</description>

        <title>Change in the Total Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale Mean Score (TMSAS) From Baseline to On-Treatment</title>
        <description>Change in &quot;Overall Symptom Burden&quot; was measured using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS). Patients indicate the presence or absence of a symptom, and if present, rate the symptom on severity, frequency and interference. The total MSAS score (TMSAS) can range from 0 (no symptom) to 4 (symptom present and worst severity, frequency and distress). Change in TMSAS score is calculated as Baseline TMSAS mean score minus T2 TMSAS mean score or Baseline TMSAS mean score minus T3 TMSAS mean score.
Change scores could range from +/- 4.0. Higher scores (+) indicate worse symptom burden.
To aid in interpretation of clinically significant change, a &gt;5% change from baseline was set as the &quot;minimally important change (MIC)&quot; threshold. A 5% change in the TMSAS = 0.3 points; therefore TMSAS change scores &gt; +/- 0.3 were considered clinically meaningful.</description>

        <population>Of 1533 patients with complete record at T2, 1517 provided sufficient TMSAS data to calculate change score.

        <description>Change in Treatment-Related Symptoms was measured using multiple surveys from the NIH Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6). Mean CHANGE Scores were calculated as baseline mean score minus T2 mean score or baseline mean score minus T3 mean score. Lower change scores (-) indicate symptoms improved.
PROMIS Fatigue-7 mean change score range = +/- 53.9

        <title>Change in HCV-PRO Mean Scores From Baseline to On-Treatment</title>
        <description>HCV-specific Functional Well-Being was measured using the disease-specific &quot;HCV-PRO.&quot; The scale includes 16 items that measure physical, emotional and social functioning, productivity, intimacy, and perception of quality of life.
The Means provided are the HCV-PRO Mean Change Scores, calculated as Baseline HCV-PRO mean score minus T2 HCV-PRO mean score or Baseline HCV-PRO mean score minus T3 HCV-PRO mean score.
HCV-PRO mean change scores range from +/- 100. Higher change scores (+) indicate better HCV-PRO outcomes.
To aid in interpretation of clinically significant change, a &gt;5% change from baseline was set as the &quot;minimally important change (MIC)&quot; threshold. A 5% change in HCV-PRO = 4 points; therefore HCV-PRO change scores &gt; +/- 4.0 were considered clinically meaningful.</description>

        <title>Cumulative Out of Pocket Costs During HCV Treatment</title>
        <description>Cumulative out of pocket (OOP) costs incurred by patients during HCV treatment was measured by a survey recording 5 direct and 5 indirect costs of treatment. OOP costs were collected early on-treatment (T2), late on-treatment (T3), and early post-treatment (T4) in case patients paid bills after treatment ended.
The Mean is the average dollar ($$) amount for Total OOP Cost of HCV Treatment for the cohort, calculated by summing the OOP costs for each patient reported at T2+T3+T4.</description>
        <time_frame>Up to 24 weeks of HCV Treatment</time_frame>
        <population>Of 1601 patients enrolled, OOP cost data was recorded by 1578 patients. Due to unreliable data, especially at the upper limit, 40 cases (2.53%) were eliminated from each tail (lower and upper limit), totaling 80 cases (5.06%) of the 1578 sample.

        <title>Change in Total Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (TMSAS) Mean Score From Baseline to 3-months Post Treatment</title>
        <description>Change in &quot;Overall Symptom Burden&quot; from Baseline to 3-months post-treatment was measured using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS).
The total Overall Symptom Burden mean change score (TMSAS) was calculated as Baseline TMSAS mean score minus T4 TMSAS mean score.
Lower scores (-) indicate better outcomes. Change scores were calculated for two subgroups: (1) Patients who achieved SVR and (2) patients who did not achieve SVR.
TMSAS Mean Change Scores could range from +/- 4.
To aid in interpretation of clinically significant change, a &gt;5% change from baseline was set as the &quot;minimally important change (MIC)&quot; threshold. A 5% change in the TMSAS = 0.3 points; therefore TMSAS change scores &gt; +/- 0.3 were considered clinically meaningful.</description>

        <population>Of 1601 patients enrolled, 1430 patients had post-treatment HCV RNA available to determine SVR status. Of these, 1362 achieved SVR, 68 did not achieve SVR. SVR data were missing on 171 patients. Additional missing numbers (from 1362 to 1313 and 68 to 58) were due to missing MSAS survey data at 3-months post-treatment.</population>

        <title>Change in HCV-PRO Mean Score From Baseline to 3-months Post Treatment</title>
        <description>HCV-specific Functional Well-Being was measured using the disease-specific &quot;HCV-PRO.&quot;
The means provided are the HCV-PRO Mean Change Scores, calculated as Baseline HCV-PRO mean score minus T4 HCV-PRO mean score. Change scores were calculated for two subgroups: (1) Patients who achieved SVR and (2) patients who did not achieve SVR.
HCV-PRO Mean Change Scores could range from +/- 100. Higher change scores (+) indicate better HCV-PRO outcomes.
To aid in interpretation of clinically significant change, a &gt;5% change from baseline was set as the &quot;minimally important change (MIC)&quot; threshold. A 5% change in HCV-PRO = 4 points; therefore HCV-PRO change scores &gt; +/- 4.0 were considered clinically meaningful.</description>

        <title>Change in HCV-PRO Mean Score From Baseline to 1 Year Post-treatment</title>
        <description>HCV-specific Functional Well-Being was measured using the disease-specific &quot;HCV-PRO.&quot; The scale includes 16 items that measure physical, emotional and social functioning, productivity, intimacy, and perception of quality of life.
The Means provided are the HCV-PRO Mean Change Scores, calculated as Baseline HCV-PRO mean score minus T5 HCV-PRO mean score.
Change scores were calculated for two subgroups: (1) Patients who achieved SVR and (2) patients who did not achieve SVR.
HCV-PRO mean change scores could range from +/- 100. Higher change scores (+) indicate better HCV-PRO outcomes.
To aid in interpretation of clinically significant change, a &gt;5% change from baseline was set as the &quot;minimally important change (MIC)&quot; threshold. A 5% change in HCV-PRO = 4 points; therefore HCV-PRO change scores &gt; +/- 4.0 were considered clinically meaningful.</description>

      <desc>This observational, non-interventional survey study did not systematically track NON-study related deaths, SAEs, or OAEs. Per protocol, only study-related deaths, SAEs, and OAEs were reportable and none occurred. All deaths observed were learned about inadvertently and via non-systematic methods during data collection processes. While possibly incomplete, the number reported represents all known observable deaths during the study. Other SAEs and OAEs were not monitored/assessed.</desc>
