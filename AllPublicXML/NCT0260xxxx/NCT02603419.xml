  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, open-label, multi-center study comprising a lead-in phase and an
      expansion phase. The lead-in phase is a multiple-dose, randomized, parallel-arm,
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of avelumab as a single agent in adult patients
      with cHL. Patients enrolled in the lead-in phase of this study are required to have relapsed
      following a prior autologous or allogeneic HSCT, or to be ineligible for HSCT. Based on the
      preliminary TO, safety, and efficacy results from the lead-in phase, the expansion phase will
      evaluate the anti-tumor activity and safety of single-agent avelumab utilizing an
      intra-patient dose escalation paradigm based on two of the dosing regimens studied in the
      lead-in phase in 40 cHL patients in whom an allogeneic HSCT has failed.

Previously involved nodes that were 1.1 to 1.5 cm in greatest diameter must have decreased to less than or equal to 1 cm or by more than 75 percent in the sum of the products of the greatest diameters. PR was defined &gt;=50% decreased in the sum of products of the greatest diameters (SPD) of 6 largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. No increase in size of nodes, liver or spleen and no new sites of disease. Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by &gt;=50% in the SPD.</description>

    <description>Duration of Response (DR) is defined, for participants with an objective response, as the time from the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) to the first documentation of objective progression of disease (PD) or to death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. CR was defined as all lymph nodes must have regressed to normal size(less than or equal to 1.5 cm in greatest diameter if &gt;1.5 cm before therapy). Previously involved nodes that were 1.1 to 1.5 cm in greatest diameter must have decreased to less than or equal to 1 cm or by more than 75 percent in the sum of the products of the greatest diameters.

    <description>Disease Control (DC) was defined as the best overall response of CR, PR, or SD. CR was defined as all lymph nodes must have regressed to normal size(less than or equal to 1.5 cm in greatest diameter if &gt;1.5 cm before therapy).

No increase in size of nodes, liver or spleen and no new sites of disease. Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by &gt;=50% in the SPD and Stable Disease was defined as less than a PR but not progressive disease. To qualify as a best overall response of SD, at least one SD assessment must be observed &gt;=6 weeks after start date and before disease progression.</description>

    <time_frame>From treatment start in expansion phase to date of first documentation of objective Progressive Disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first (maximum duration of 14 months)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as time (in months) from date of randomization to the first documentation of disease progression or death (due to any cause), whichever occurred first. Progression was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must have also demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered progression. Analysis was performed using a Cox's Proportional Hazard model stratified by the randomization strata and a stratified log-rank test.</description>

    <description>Acute GvHD is a reaction of donor immune cells against host tissues. The three main tissues that acute GvHD affects are the skin, liver and gastrointestinal tract. Chronic GvHD is a syndrome of variable clinical features resembling autoimmune and other immunologic disorders.

                  response.

               2. Expansion Phase: Prior therapy with an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 agent following
                  allo-HSCT is prohibited unless the therapy was stopped more than one year prior
                  to the first dose of study treatment, and the patient had a documented prior
                  response. NOTE: Prior therapy with an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 agent prior to
                  allo-HSCT is permitted with no time limits and irrespective of a documented
                  response.

               3. Patients with a history of ≥Grade 3 anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1-related immune

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. As per NCI-CTCAE version 4.03: Grade 3: severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening, or prolongation of existing hospitalization indicated; Grade 4: life-threatening consequence; Grade 5: death related to AE. SAE was an AE resulting in any of following outcomes: death, initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, life-threatening experience, persistent or congenital anomaly. A TEAEs: an event that emerged during treatment period (From first dose of study drug until end of open label phase [From first dose of study drug to 90 days after last administration of study drug (maximum duration of 32 months)] that was absent before treatment,or worsened during treatment period relative to pre-treatment state. AE was considered related to study drug if event was assessed by investigator as probably or possibly related.</description>

            <description>All participants received an initial dose of 70 mg Q2W avelumab for 3 cycles, Each cycle was of 14 days (2 weeks), and were monitored for safety and efficacy. Participants who achieved a CR at the 6-week tumor assessment were continued at the same dose regimen. Participants who achieved a PR at 6 weeks were continued at 70 mg Q2W for an additional 3 cycles, and if the 12-week tumor assessment still showed a PR, participants were dose escalated to 500 mg Q2W. Participants who achieved a SD at the 6-week tumor assessment, dose escalated to 500 mg Q2W. Treatment was continued until disease progression, participant refusal, unacceptable toxicity, lost to follow-up, or until study termination the Sponsor, whichever occurred first. Maximum treatment exposure was of 48 weeks.</description>

          <description>DC: best overall response of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD). CR was defined as all lymph nodes must have regressed to normal size(less than or equal to 1.5 cm in greatest diameter if &gt;1.5 cm before therapy). Previously involved nodes that were 1.1 to 1.5 cm in greatest diameter must have decreased to less than or equal to 1 cm or by more than 75% in sum of the products of greatest diameters. PR was defined &gt;=50% decreased in SPD of 6 largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. No increase in size of nodes, liver or spleen and no new sites of disease. Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by &gt;=50% in SPD and SD was defined as &lt; PR but not progressive disease. To qualify as a best overall response of SD, at least one SD assessment must be observed &gt;=6 weeks after start date and before disease progression. (Disease progression: &gt;= 20% and &gt;= 5-mm increase in sum of target lesion diameters in reference to smallest sum on study and/or substantial worsening in non-target disease).</description>

        <description>Objective response was defined as CR or PR according to the Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma, from 'start date' until disease progression or death due to any cause. CR was defined as all lymph nodes must have regressed to normal size(less than or equal to 1.5 cm in greatest diameter if &gt;1.5 cm before therapy). Previously involved nodes that were 1.1 to 1.5 cm in greatest diameter must have decreased to less than or equal to 1 cm or by more than 75 percent in the sum of the products of the greatest diameters. PR was defined &gt;=50% decreased in the SPD of 6 largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. No increase in size of nodes, liver or spleen and no new sites of disease. Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by &gt;=50% in the SPD. (PD: &gt;= 20% and &gt;= 5-mm increase in sum of target lesion diameters in reference to smallest sum on study and/or substantial worsening in non-target disease).</description>

        <description>Acute GvHD is a reaction of donor immune cells against host tissues. The three main tissues that acute GvHD affects are the skin, liver and gastrointestinal tract. Chronic GvHD is a syndrome of variable clinical features resembling autoimmune and other immunologic disorders.
