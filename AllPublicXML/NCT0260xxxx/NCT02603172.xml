  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK3039294 has been developed in order to offer an orally available alternative to parenteral
      CPHPC (GSK2315698 [metabolite of GSK3039294]) for plasma serum amyloid P component (SAP)
      depletion prior to use of anti SAP monoclonal antibody (mAb) in the treatment of systemic
      amyloidosis. This phase 1 study is intended to study safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic
      (PK) profile of GSK3039294 in humans. This study consists of three parts. Part A will
      evaluate safety and tolerability of single doses of GSK3039294 in healthy subjects, Part B
      will evaluate safety and tolerability of repeat doses of GSK3039294 in healthy subjects, and
      Part C will evaluate safety and tolerability of repeat doses of GSK3039294 in subjects with
      systemic amyloidosis. Part A is a single dose, open label, dose escalation study. Two cohorts
      of subjects will be enrolled to provide data from 6 subjects per cohort and up to 4 different
      doses (2 dose levels per cohort) of GSK3039294 will be tested. For Cohorts 1 and 2, each
      subject may take part in two dosing periods. Part B is repeat dose, open label, dose
      escalation study. Sufficient number of subjects will be enrolled in Cohort 3a to ensure 6
      completers (Cohort 3b will be conducted if required) and GSK3039294 will be administered
      repeatedly for a total of 21 days. Each subject will take part in a single study period. In
      Part C a single dose level of GSK3039294 will be tested for 21 days repeat dose, in 12
      subjects with systemic amyloidosis. Each subject will take part in a single study period. The
      total duration for Part A is approximately 8 weeks, Part B is approximately 8-9 weeks, and
      Part C is approximately 13 weeks.

      <pre_assignment_details>This was 3 parts study, participants received GSK3039294: single ascending dose in Part A; repeated dose in Part B; repeat dose in systemic amyloidosis in Part C. Participants in Part A also participated in Part B of the study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Part A: Mean Change From Baseline in 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)</title>
        <description>Triplicate ECG was measured in semi-supine position after 5 minutes (min) rest. A single 12-lead ECG was measured by using ECG machine that automatically measured PR, QRS, QT, and Fridericia's formula (QTcF) intervals. Baseline is defined as the latest available assessment pre the first dose of study drug within each period in Part A. Change from Baseline was calculated as any visit post Baseline value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Part A: Mean Change From Baseline in Heart Rate by 12-lead ECG</title>
        <description>Triplicate ECG was measured in semi-supine position after 5 min rest. A single 12-lead ECG was measured by using ECG machine that automatically measures the heart rate. Baseline is defined as the latest available assessment pre the first dose of study drug within each period in Part A. Change from Baseline was calculated as any visit post Baseline value minus Baseline value.</description>

The remaining participants received the same dose of GSK3039294 (dose level 3) 600 mg, capsules, orally, once on Day 1 and stayed in-house until Day 4 in cohort 2. A washout period was maintained from Day 5 to 14 between two treatment cohorts.</description>

          <title>Part A: Mean Change From Baseline in Heart Rate by 12-lead ECG</title>
          <description>Triplicate ECG was measured in semi-supine position after 5 min rest. A single 12-lead ECG was measured by using ECG machine that automatically measures the heart rate. Baseline is defined as the latest available assessment pre the first dose of study drug within each period in Part A. Change from Baseline was calculated as any visit post Baseline value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect and other important medical events judged by the investigator that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention.</description>

        <description>Triplicate ECG was measured in semi-supine position after 5 minutes rest. A single 12-lead ECG was measured by using ECG machine that automatically measured PR, QRS, QT, and QTcF intervals. Baseline is defined as the latest available assessment pre the first dose of study drug in Part B. Change from Baseline was calculated as any visit post Baseline value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <description>Triplicate ECG was planned to be measured in semi-supine position after 5 minutes rest. A single 12-lead ECG was measured by using ECG machine that automatically measured PR, QRS, QT, and QTcF intervals. Baseline is defined as the latest available assessment pre the first dose of study drug within each period in Part C. Change from Baseline was calculated as any visit post Baseline value minus Baseline value.

          <title>Part C: Number of Participants With Abnormal 12-lead ECG Findings</title>
          <description>Triplicate ECG was planned to be measured in semi-supine position after 5 minutes rest. A single 12-lead ECG was measured by using ECG machine that automatically measured PR, QRS, QT, and QTcF intervals. Baseline is defined as the latest available assessment pre the first dose of study drug within each period in Part C. Change from Baseline was calculated as any visit post Baseline value minus Baseline value. This analysis was planned but not performed for Part C as the study was terminated early during Part B.</description>
