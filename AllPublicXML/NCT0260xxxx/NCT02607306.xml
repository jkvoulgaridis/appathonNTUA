    <measure>Number of Treatment Emergent Severe or Blood Glucose (BG) Confirmed Hypoglycaemic Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0-52</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment emergent hypoglycaemic episode is defined as an event that had onset date on or after the first day of trial product administration, and no later than 7 days after the last day on trial product.
Severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as episodes that were severe according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) classification or BG confirmed by a plasma glucose value &lt; 3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) with or without symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia.
Severe hypoglycaemia according to the ADA definition: an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or take other corrective actions. Plasma glucose concentrations may not be available during an event, but neurological recovery following the return of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration.</description>

    <measure>Anti-drug Antibodies: Anti-insulin Degludec Antibodies</measure>
    <time_frame>at week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Insulin degludec (IDeg)-specific antibodies were measured at week 52, as %B/T (percentage of bound &amp; precipitated radioactive drug/total added drug to the sample). A sample is measured in 2 different series. In series 1, the radioactive IDeg (tracer) and surplus unlabeled IDeg are added to the sample. In series 2, the tracer and surplus unlabeled human insulin are added to the sample. Series 1 represents unspecific background binding. Series 2 represents IDeg specific antibodies including unspecific background binding. The reported %B/T is calculated by subtracting the background %B/T in series 1 from the %B/T result in series 2. If the background result has higher values than the %B/T in series 2, the resulting value is negative %B/T. Here, a negative %B/T value means that the test samples do not have IDeg-specific antibodies. The reason for getting a negative value for %B/T is due to variation in the analytical background. Thus, the results presented are not a change from baseline.</description>

          <title>Insulin Degludec/Liraglutide</title>
          <description>Eligible subjects were treated with insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) once daily (OD) in combination with pre-trial oral anti diabetic drugs (at stable dose level and dosing frequency; dose reduction was allowed in case of safety concern). The recommended starting dose of IDegLira was 10 dose steps (10 units IDeg/0.36 mg liraglutide). IDegLira was titrated twice weekly according to a predefined titration algorithm to a maximum of 50 dose steps (50 units IDeg/1.8 mg liraglutide), aiming to reach a fasting plasma glucose target between 72 mg/dL (4.0 mmol/L) and 90 mg/dL (5.0 mmol/L). One follow-up visit was scheduled 7 days after end of treatment. IDegLira was injected subcutaneously in the thigh, upper arm (deltoid region) or abdomen. The injection area chosen remained unchanged throughout the trial, although rotation within the area was recommended.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in HbA1c after 52 weeks of treatment was measured. Statistical analyses were performed to test the hypotheses: non-inferiority of IDegLira vs. IDeg and superiority of IDegLira vs. Liraglutide (Lira).</description>
        <time_frame>Week 0, Week 52</time_frame>
        <population>Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all randomised subjects (819 subjects).

            <description>Eligible subjects were treated with insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) once daily (OD) in combination with pre-trial oral anti diabetic drugs (at stable dose level and dosing frequency; dose reduction was allowed in case of safety concern). The recommended starting dose of IDegLira was 10 dose steps (10 units IDeg/0.36 mg liraglutide). IDegLira was titrated twice weekly according to a predefined titration algorithm to a maximum of 50 dose steps (50 units IDeg/1.8 mg liraglutide), aiming to reach a fasting plasma glucose target between 72 mg/dL (4.0 mmol/L) and 90 mg/dL (5.0 mmol/L). One follow-up visit was scheduled 7 days after end of treatment. IDegLira was injected subcutaneously in the thigh, upper arm (deltoid region) or abdomen. The injection area chosen remained unchanged throughout the trial, although rotation within the area was recommended.</description>

        <title>Number of Treatment Emergent Severe or Blood Glucose (BG) Confirmed Hypoglycaemic Episodes</title>
        <description>Treatment emergent hypoglycaemic episode is defined as an event that had onset date on or after the first day of trial product administration, and no later than 7 days after the last day on trial product.
Severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as episodes that were severe according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) classification or BG confirmed by a plasma glucose value &lt; 3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) with or without symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia.
Severe hypoglycaemia according to the ADA definition: an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or take other corrective actions. Plasma glucose concentrations may not be available during an event, but neurological recovery following the return of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration.</description>

            <description>Eligible subjects were treated with insulin degludec (IDeg) once daily (OD) in combination with pre-trial oral anti diabetic drugs (at stable dose level and dosing frequency unless there were safety concerns, in which case dose reduction was allowed). The recommended starting dose of IDeg was 10 units. IDeg was titrated twice weekly according to a predefined titration algorithm, aiming to reach a fasting plasma glucose target between 72 mg/dL (4.0 mmol/L) and 90 mg/dL (5.0 mmol/L). There was no maximum dose decided for IDeg. One follow-up visit was scheduled 7 days after end of treatment. IDeg was injected subcutaneously in the thigh, upper arm (deltoid region) or abdomen. The injection area chosen remained unchanged throughout the trial, although rotation within the area was recommended.</description>

The recommended starting dose of IDegLira was 10 dose steps (10 units IDeg/0.36 mg liraglutide). IDegLira was titrated twice weekly according to a predefined titration algorithm to a maximum of 50 dose steps (50 units IDeg/1.8 mg liraglutide), aiming to reach a fasting plasma glucose target between 72 mg/dL (4.0 mmol/L) and 90 mg/dL (5.0 mmol/L). One follow-up visit was scheduled 7 days after end of treatment. IDegLira was injected subcutaneously in the thigh, upper arm (deltoid region) or abdomen. The injection area chosen remained unchanged throughout the trial, although rotation within the area was recommended.</description>

        <description>Number of subjects with HbA1c less than 6.5% with no weight gain, who did not experience treatment emergent severe or BG confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes during the last 12 weeks of treatment.
Treatment emergent hypoglycaemic episode is defined as an event that had onset date on or after the first day of trial product administration, and no later than 7 days after the last day on trial product.
Severe or BG confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as episodes that were severe according to the ADA classification or BG confirmed by a plasma glucose value &lt; 3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia.</description>

            <description>Eligible subjects were treated with insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) once daily (OD) in combination with pre-trial oral anti diabetic drugs (at stable dose level and dosing frequency; dose reduction was allowed in case of safety concern). The recommended starting dose of IDegLira was 10 dose steps (10 units IDeg/0.36 mg liraglutide). IDegLira was titrated twice weekly according to a predefined titration algorithm to a maximum of 50 dose steps (50 units IDeg/1.8 mg liraglutide), aiming to reach a fasting plasma glucose target between 72 mg/dL (4.0 mmol/L) and 90 mg/dL (5.0 mmol/L). One follow-up visit was scheduled 7 days after end of treatment. IDegLira was injected subcutaneously in the thigh, upper arm (deltoid region) or abdomen. The injection area chosen remained unchanged throughout the trial, although rotation within the area was recommended.</description>

            <description>Eligible subjects were treated with insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) once daily (OD) in combination with pre-trial oral anti diabetic drugs (at stable dose level and dosing frequency; dose reduction was allowed in case of safety concern). The recommended starting dose of IDegLira was 10 dose steps (10 units IDeg/0.36 mg liraglutide). IDegLira was titrated twice weekly according to a predefined titration algorithm to a maximum of 50 dose steps (50 units IDeg/1.8 mg liraglutide), aiming to reach a fasting plasma glucose target between 72 mg/dL (4.0 mmol/L) and 90 mg/dL (5.0 mmol/L). One follow-up visit was scheduled 7 days after end of treatment. IDegLira was injected subcutaneously in the thigh, upper arm (deltoid region) or abdomen. The injection area chosen remained unchanged throughout the trial, although rotation within the area was recommended.</description>

The recommended starting dose of IDeg was 10 units. IDeg was titrated twice weekly according to a predefined titration algorithm, aiming to reach a fasting plasma glucose target between 72 mg/dL (4.0 mmol/L) and 90 mg/dL (5.0 mmol/L). There was no maximum dose decided for IDeg. One follow-up visit was scheduled 7 days after end of treatment. IDeg was injected subcutaneously in the thigh, upper arm (deltoid region) or abdomen. The injection area chosen remained unchanged throughout the trial, although rotation within the area was recommended.</description>

        <title>Number of Treatment Emergent Nocturnal Severe or BG Confirmed Symptomatic Hypoglycaemic Episodes</title>
        <description>Treatment emergent hypoglycaemic episode is defined as an event that had onset date on or after the first day of trial product administration, and no later than 7 days after the last day on trial product. Nocturnal period: The period between 00:01 and 05:59 a.m. (both inclusive).
Severe or BG confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as episodes that were severe according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) classification or BG confirmed by a plasma glucose value &lt; 3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia.
Severe hypoglycaemia according to the ADA definition: an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or take other corrective actions. Plasma glucose concentrations may not be available during an event, but neurological recovery following the return of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration.</description>

        <title>Anti-drug Antibodies: Anti-insulin Degludec Antibodies</title>
        <description>Insulin degludec (IDeg)-specific antibodies were measured at week 52, as %B/T (percentage of bound &amp; precipitated radioactive drug/total added drug to the sample). A sample is measured in 2 different series. In series 1, the radioactive IDeg (tracer) and surplus unlabeled IDeg are added to the sample. In series 2, the tracer and surplus unlabeled human insulin are added to the sample. Series 1 represents unspecific background binding. Series 2 represents IDeg specific antibodies including unspecific background binding. The reported %B/T is calculated by subtracting the background %B/T in series 1 from the %B/T result in series 2. If the background result has higher values than the %B/T in series 2, the resulting value is negative %B/T. Here, a negative %B/T value means that the test samples do not have IDeg-specific antibodies. The reason for getting a negative value for %B/T is due to variation in the analytical background. Thus, the results presented are not a change from baseline.</description>

            <description>Eligible subjects were treated with insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) once daily (OD) in combination with pre-trial oral anti diabetic drugs (at stable dose level and dosing frequency; dose reduction was allowed in case of safety concern). The recommended starting dose of IDegLira was 10 dose steps (10 units IDeg/0.36 mg liraglutide). IDegLira was titrated twice weekly according to a predefined titration algorithm to a maximum of 50 dose steps (50 units IDeg/1.8 mg liraglutide), aiming to reach a fasting plasma glucose target between 72 mg/dL (4.0 mmol/L) and 90 mg/dL (5.0 mmol/L). One follow-up visit was scheduled 7 days after end of treatment. IDegLira was injected subcutaneously in the thigh, upper arm (deltoid region) or abdomen. The injection area chosen remained unchanged throughout the trial, although rotation within the area was recommended.</description>

            <description>Eligible subjects were treated with insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) once daily (OD) in combination with pre-trial oral anti diabetic drugs (at stable dose level and dosing frequency; dose reduction was allowed in case of safety concern). The recommended starting dose of IDegLira was 10 dose steps (10 units IDeg/0.36 mg liraglutide). IDegLira was titrated twice weekly according to a predefined titration algorithm to a maximum of 50 dose steps (50 units IDeg/1.8 mg liraglutide), aiming to reach a fasting plasma glucose target between 72 mg/dL (4.0 mmol/L) and 90 mg/dL (5.0 mmol/L). One follow-up visit was scheduled 7 days after end of treatment. IDegLira was injected subcutaneously in the thigh, upper arm (deltoid region) or abdomen. The injection area chosen remained unchanged throughout the trial, although rotation within the area was recommended.</description>
