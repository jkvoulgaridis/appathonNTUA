    <textblock>
      Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors reduce hyperglycemia and improve
      peripheral insulin sensitivity by ameliorating glucotoxicity. Insulin resistance in type 2
      diabetes (T2DM) is associated with endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation. Thus
      strategies to improve insulin sensitivity and lower glucotoxicity may improve endothelial
      inflammation and vascular inflammation. However, the effects of these agents on vascular
      inflammation and endothelial function is not known in patients with type 2 diabetes although
      anti-inflammatory properties have been demonstrated in various animal models. In the present
      study the investigators will assess if dapagliflozin treatment for 12 weeks decreases
      monocyte inflammation and improves endothelial function in patients with type 2 diabetes on
      metformin monotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The insulin-resistant state of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is largely mediated by
      inflammatory pathways affecting skeletal muscle which is the primary site of whole body
      insulin resistance. Nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) regulates pro-inflammatory cytokines
      which ultimately impair skeletal muscle insulin signaling and fatty acid oxidation; its
      activity reflects overall inflammatory tone in skeletal muscle. Recent human studies confirm
      that NFkappaB is elevated in the skeletal muscle of T2DM human subjects. Furthermore, the
      same inflammatory processes and signaling impairments contribute to worsening endothelial
      dysfunction, which is an independent predictor for future cardiovascular events in T2DM. In
      addition, these SGLT-2 Inhibitors reduce body weight, visceral adiposity, systolic and
      diastolic blood pressure, microalbuminuria, and oxidative stress. However, there are no
      studies examining the effects of SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy on NFkappaB and other inflammatory
      mediators in humans with T2DM. Moreover, no studies have examined the effect of SGLT-2
      inhibitor therapy on endothelial function in this population. In the present study the
      investigators will assess whether dapagliflozin treatment for 12 weeks reduces monocyte
      inflammation and improves endothelial dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes on
      metformin monotherapy.
