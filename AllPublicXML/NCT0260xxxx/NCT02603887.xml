    <textblock>
      This pilot early phase I trial studies pembrolizumab in treating patients with slow growing
      (smoldering) multiple myeloma with intermediate or high-risk of spreading. Immunotherapy with
      monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the overall response rate after 8 cycles of treatment according to the
      International Myeloma Working Group Criteria (IMWG).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine time to progression to multiple myeloma (TTP) at 30 months from study entry.

      II. To determine overall survival (OS). III. To determine duration of response (DOR). IV. To
      determine the clinical benefit rate (CBR) after 8 cycles of treatment according to the
      modified IMWG Criteria for multiple myeloma (MM).

      V. To evaluate safety and tolerability of single agent treatment in this population.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity at complete remission (CR).

      II. Molecular profiling (including whole exome sequencing and gene expression profiling) and
      cellular (including flow cytometry) profiling at baseline and/or at progression using bone
      marrow aspirate samples and peripheral blood.

      III. Immunophenotypic characterization of dendritic, T-, B-, natural killer (NK)- and natural
      killer T (NKT)-cells, and inhibitory/activation markers on tumor cells at baseline and at
      completion of 8 cycles of therapy in bone marrow aspirate samples and/or peripheral blood.

      IV. Evaluation of changes in PD-L1 and PD-1 expression at baseline/end of 8 cycles of
      treatment and correlate with clinical response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6-12 months.
