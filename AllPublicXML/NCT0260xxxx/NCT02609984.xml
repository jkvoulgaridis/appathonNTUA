    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase 2 randomized study that will examine the use of the study agents,
      CMB305 (sequentially administered LV305 which is a dendritic cell-targeting viral vector
      expressing the New York Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma 1 gene [NY-ESO-1] and G305 which
      is a NY-ESO-1 recombinant protein plus glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant-stable emulsion
      [GLA-SE]) in combination with atezolizumab or atezolizumab alone, in participants with
      locally advanced, relapsed or metastatic sarcoma (synovial or myxoid/round cell liposarcoma)
      expressing the NY-ESO-1 protein.

      There is no formal primary hypothesis for this study.

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Per Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 36.1 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first, per RECIST 1.1 modified to use immune-related response criteria (irRC) confirmation and unidimensional tumor measurements as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR). PD was defined as ≥20% increase in tumor burden compared with nadir (at any single time point) in 2 consecutive observations ≥4 weeks apart. If there was no disease progression or death, participants were censored at the date of their last disease assessment. The PFS was analyzed using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing a Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 42 days</time_frame>
    <description>DLTs will be evaluated during the safety run-in period. Any treatment emergent Grade 3 or higher adverse event (AE) that occurs in the first 42 days after initiation of study treatment, that is deemed possibly, probably or definitely related to the combination of CMB305 and atezolizumab will be considered a DLT with the following exceptions:
Alopecia or vomiting (unless not controlled by optimal anti-emetics)
Hepatic enzyme elevations associated with the baseline Grade 2 abnormalities
Grade 3 laboratory AEs that are asymptomatic and return to baseline or to Grade 1 within 3 days, unless identified specifically as DLT by the investigator or the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)
Grade 3 fatigue
Grade 3 systemic reactions (such as fever, headache, influenza like symptoms, myalgia, malaise, or nausea) that return to baseline or Grade 1 within 3 days of study inoculation</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experienced At Least One Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 36.1 months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a study treatment and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the study treatment or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that was temporally associated with the use of study treatment, was also an AE. The number of participants who experienced at least one AE is presented.</description>

        <title>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Per Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)</title>
        <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first, per RECIST 1.1 modified to use immune-related response criteria (irRC) confirmation and unidimensional tumor measurements as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR). PD was defined as ≥20% increase in tumor burden compared with nadir (at any single time point) in 2 consecutive observations ≥4 weeks apart. If there was no disease progression or death, participants were censored at the date of their last disease assessment.

          <title>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Per Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)</title>
          <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first, per RECIST 1.1 modified to use immune-related response criteria (irRC) confirmation and unidimensional tumor measurements as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR). PD was defined as ≥20% increase in tumor burden compared with nadir (at any single time point) in 2 consecutive observations ≥4 weeks apart. If there was no disease progression or death, participants were censored at the date of their last disease assessment. The PFS was analyzed using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data.</description>

        <title>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Rate at Month 3 Per Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)</title>
        <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first, per RECIST 1.1 modified to use irRC confirmation and unidimensional tumor measurements as assessed by BICR. PD was defined as ≥20% increase in tumor burden compared with nadir (at any single time point) in 2 consecutive observations ≥4 weeks apart. If there was no disease progression or death, participants were censored at the date of their last disease assessment. The PFS was analyzed using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data. Participants were evaluated every 6 weeks with radiographic imaging to assess their response to treatment. The PFS rate was calculated as the percentage of participants with PFS at Month 3.</description>
