  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, single dose, two-sequence, two-periods crossover study,
      separated by 7 days washout interval from the first Study Drug Administration. This study is
      conducted to determine the bioequivalence of Rabeprazole from IDIAZOLE 20mg Delayed-Release
      (DR) tablets (tabs) and PARIET 20 mg DR tabs after a single oral dose administration of each
      to healthy adults fed under conditions.

      In Period 1, subjects will be randomized to either Idiazole 20mg DR tabs or PARIET 20 mg DR
      tabs. Following a washout of at least 7 days, subjects will be crossed over in Period 2 to
      receive the treatment that they did not receive in Period 1.

    <description>Blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analyses in each period at specified time points. Pharmacokinetic parameters of rabeprazole were estimated using standard non-compartmental methods. AUC (0-t) was calculated from measured data points from time of administration to time of last quantifiable concentration (Clast) by the linear trapezoidal rule.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-dose and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14 and 24 hours post-dose in period 1 and 2</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis in each period at specified time points. Pharmacokinetic parameters of Rabeprazole were estimated using standard non-compartmental methods. Ke was derived from a semi-log plot of the plasma concentration versus time curve. The parameter was calculated by linear least-squares regression analysis using the last three (or more) non-zero plasma concentrations.</description>

    <description>Half life is the period of time required for the concentration or amount of drug in the body to be reduced by one-half. Blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis in each period at specified time points. Pharmacokinetic parameters of Rabeprazole were estimated using standard non-compartmental methods. t1/2 was calculated as: t1/2 = Ln(2) / (-b), where b was obtained as the slope of the linear regression of the Ln-transformed plasma concentrations versus time in the terminal period of the plasma curve.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Bioequivalence of rabeprazole from Idiazole 20 milligram (mg) tablets and Pariet 20 mg tablets was investigated after single oral dose administration to healthy participants under fed conditions. This study was conducted from 22 March 2014 to 30 March 2014.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>During this study, 74 participants were screened. One participant was excluded for significant variation in laboratory results at screening and three participants voluntarily withdrew before entering in to period 1. Hence, 70 participants were enrolled and randomized in study, and all 70 participants completed both periods of the study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Mean Terminal Half Life (t1/2) of Rabeprazole</title>
        <description>Half life is the period of time required for the concentration or amount of drug in the body to be reduced by one-half. Blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis in each period at specified time points. Pharmacokinetic parameters of Rabeprazole were estimated using standard non-compartmental methods. t1/2 was calculated as: t1/2 = Ln(2) / (-b), where b was obtained as the slope of the linear regression of the Ln-transformed plasma concentrations versus time in the terminal period of the plasma curve.</description>
