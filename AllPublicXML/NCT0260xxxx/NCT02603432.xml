    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to compare maintenance treatment with avelumab plus best
      supportive care (BSC) with BSC alone, to determine if avelumab has an effect on survival in
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer that did not worsen during or
      following completion of first-line chemotherapy.
