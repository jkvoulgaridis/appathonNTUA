      This primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a fixed dose combination
      (FDC) containing bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) versus
      dolutegravir (DTG) + a FDC containing emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (F/TAF) in HIV-1
      infected, antiretroviral treatment-naive adults.

    <description>After Week 144, participants will continue to take their blinded study drug and attend visits every 12 weeks until the End of Blinded Treatment Visit. Following the End of Blinded Treatment Visit, participants will be given the option to receive open-label (OL) B/F/TAF for 96 weeks. After the Week 96 OL Visit, participants in a country where B/F/TAF is not commercially available will be given the option to continue OL B/F/TAF until the product becomes accessible through an access program or until Gilead elects to discontinue the study in that country, whichever occurs first.</description>

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Antiretroviral treatment naive (≤ 10 days of prior therapy with any antiretroviral
             agent following a diagnosis of HIV-1 infection) except the use for pre-exposure

             mL/sec) according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  An opportunistic illness indicative of stage 3 HIV diagnosed within the 30 days prior
             to screening

          -  Decompensated cirrhosis (eg, ascites, encephalopathy, or variceal bleeding)

Extension Phase: After Week 144, participants will continue to take their blinded study drug and attend visits every 12 weeks until the End of Blinded Treatment Visit. Following the End of Blinded Treatment Visit, participants will be given the option to receive open-label (OL) B/F/TAF for 96 weeks. After the Week 96 OL Visit, participants in a country where B/F/TAF is not commercially available will be given the option to continue OL B/F/TAF until the product becomes accessible through an access program or until Gilead elects to discontinue the study in that country, whichever occurs first.</description>

After the Week 96 OL Visit, participants in a country where B/F/TAF is not commercially available will be given the option to continue OL B/F/TAF until the product becomes accessible through an access program or until Gilead elects to discontinue the study in that country, whichever occurs first.</description>
