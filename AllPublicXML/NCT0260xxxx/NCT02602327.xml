  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I dose escalation study (3+3 design) with a dose expansion arm (12 patients)
      designed to evaluate safety of the combination of Tas-102 and radioembolization using
      Yttrium-90 (90Y) resin microspheres for patients with chemotherapy-refractory liver-dominant
      chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized studies have demonstrated that Tas-102 has single agent activity against
      chemotherapy refractory colorectal cancer. A recent pre-clinical study has shown that Tas-102
      may have activity as a radiation sensitizer in bladder cancer cell lines. Benefit of single
      agent Tas-102 against chemotherapy refractory colon cancer and the drug's promise a
      radiosensitizer make Tas-102 a potential candidate drug for testing in combination with
      radioembolization using Yttrium-90 resin microspheres in patients with liver-dominant
      chemotherapy-refractory mCRC. This is a phase I dose escalation study with a dose expansion
      arm designed to evaluate safety of the combination of Tas-102 and radioembolization using 90Y
      resin microspheres for patients with chemotherapy-refractory colon or rectal adenocarcinoma
      metastatic to the liver.

    <time_frame>56 days</time_frame>
    <description>Any adverse events grade ≥ 3 will be reviewed by the treating interventional radiologist and medical oncologist within 24 hours of being informed event. If none of the 3 patients in a cohort experiences a DLT, another 3 patients will be treated at the next higher dose level. However, if 1 of the first 3 patients experiences a DLT, 3 more patients will be treated at the same dose level. The dose escalation will continue until at least 2 patients among a cohort of 3-6 patients experience DLTs (i.e., ≥ 33% of patients with a dose-limiting toxicity at that dose level) or until 3-6 patients had been treated at TAS-102 dose of 35mg/m2 per day in 2 divided doses (up to a maximum of 80 mg per dose) administered concurrently with radioembolization cycles 1 and 2 without experiencing a DLT. DLT window will be 56 days (cycle 1, day 1 to cycle 2, day 28). Dose limiting toxicity will be reached when one of the clinical and/or laboratory parameters are met</description>
