  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plasma midkine has reported to be elevated in infection and a regulator of
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). We aimed to investigate the plasma midkine in septic
      patients and its association with 28-day mortality and organ function, and also with plasma
      ACE and angiotensin II.

      This study showed that Ang II induced endothelial injury in sepsis patients. Midkine has been
      shown to regulate the renin-angiotensin system and acts in the upstream signaling pathway of
      angiotensin (ANG) II. The investigators want to access the relationship between midkine level
      and ACE-Ang II induced endothelial injury in sepsis

    <description>We recruited the patients admitted to the Department of Critical Care Medicine, Zhongda Hospital, a tertiary hospital, from November 2017 to March 2018. The inclusive criteria were adult patients (age &gt; 18 years-old and &lt; 80 years-old) diagnosed with sepsis, according the definition of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (2016). Exclusive criteria included: 1. age &lt; 18 years-old or &gt; 80 years-old; 2. pregnancy or breastfeeding; 3. malignancy; 4. patients with potentially elevated plasma midkine apart from sepsis including acute myocardial infarction, stroke, limb thrombosis, chronic renal dysfunction (baseline plasma creatine ≥2 mg/dL), autoimmune diseases and Alzheimer syndrome; 5. patients deceased or discharge from ICU within 24 hours; or, 6. written consents could not be obtained.</description>
