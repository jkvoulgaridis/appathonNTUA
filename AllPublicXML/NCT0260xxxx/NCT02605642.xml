    <textblock>
      To assess persistence of CT-P13 in patients with Rheumatoid Diseases (Rheumatoid arthritis
      [RA], ankylosing spondylitis [AS], and psoriatic arthritis [PsA]) who are naïve to biologics
      or are switching from stable Remicade to CT-P13. The main objectives of the study are:

        -  To evaluate real-life drug persistence in RA, AS, and PsA patients who are either
           initiated with CT-P13 as their first biologic, or who are switched from stable Remicade

        -  To characterise the patient populations and drug usage patterns of RA, AS, and PsA
           patients who are either initiated with CT-P13 as their first biologic, or who are
           switched from stable Remicade

        -  To assess the safety of CT-P13 in RA, AS, and PsA patients who are either initiated with
           CT-P13 as their first biologic, or who are switched from stable Remicade for up to 2
           years

    <time_frame>During the observation period of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Persistence (in days) was defined as a continuous variable measured in time from index date until date of drug discontinuation. Drug discontinuation was defined as either switching to another non infliximab BDMARD or elapsing of a drug free interval of 16 weeks from CT-P13. For participants undergoing a switch to CT-P13 from Remicade, the index date was considered the date from which Remicade was originally commenced and for participants who initiated treatment with CT-P13 as their first biologic, the index date was considered the date from which CT-P13 was initiated.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) in Participants With Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) at Months 6, 12, 18 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 6, 12, 18 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>BASDAI is a self-reported measure of disease activity in participants with AS. Participants answered 6 questions measuring symptoms of AS (fatigue, spinal pain, joint pain or swelling, areas of localized tenderness, morning stiffness duration and severity). The BASDAI total score was calculated by computing the mean of questions 5 and 6 and adding it to the sum of questions (Q) 1-4. This score was then divided by 5. BASDAI=Q1+Q2+Q3+Q4+[Q5+Q6/2]/5. The total BASDAI score ranges from 1=none to 10=severe, where lower score indicated less disease activity. The level of AS disease activity was interpreted as low (BASDAI &lt; 4) or high (BASDAI &gt; 4).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) in Participants With Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) at Months 6,12,18 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 6, 12, 18 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>ASDAS is used to assess disease activity in participants with AS. It is a score combining the assessment of overall pain (Q1), duration of morning stiffness (Q2), peripheral pain/swelling (Q3), PtGA (assessed on a sale of 0 to 10, where 0 = not active and 10=very active), and C-reactive protein (CRP) in milligrams per liter (mg/L). ASDAS total score was derived using the following formula: ASDAS=0.12*Q1+0.06*Q2+0.11*GH+0.07*Q3+0.58*ln (CRP+1). The level of AS disease activity was interpreted as inactive disease (ASDAS&lt; 1.3), moderate disease activity (1.3 &lt;= ASDAS &lt; 2.1), high disease activity (2.1&lt;= ASDAS &lt;=3.5) and very high disease activity (ASDAS &gt; 3.5).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 6, 12, 18 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>BASFI is a validated self assessment tool to determine the degree of functional limitation in participants with AS. It is comprised of 10 questions which were answered by participants using a VAS ranging from 0 (being easy) to 10 (impossible). BASFI total score was calculated as the average score of the 10 questions, and ranges from 0 (no functional impairment) to 10 (maximal impairment), higher scores indicated more impairment.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score at Months 6, 12, 18 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Months 6, 12, 18 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ-DI assesses the degree of difficulty a participant had experienced in 8 domains of daily activities: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and other activities. Each item scored on a 4-point scale from 0 to 3 with 0 =&quot;no difficulty&quot;, 1 =&quot;some difficulty&quot;, 2 = &quot;much difficulty&quot;, and 3 =&quot;unable to do&quot;. Overall score was computed as the sum of scores divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range was 0-3 with 0 = &quot;no difficulty to 3 =&quot;unable to do&quot;. Higher score indicate more difficulty in performing daily living activities.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Months 6, 12, 18 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D-3L is a standardized, participant-administered measure of self-reported health outcomes. It consists of two parts: EQ-5D descriptive system (Part I) and the EQ-VAS (Part II). For Part I, i.e. EQ-5D-3L index score, participants rated their current health state on 5 single-item dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression with each dimension having three levels of function:. 1=no problems, 2=some problems and 3=extreme problems. Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score was transformed and results in a total score range of -0.074 to 1.00; higher scores indicating a better health state.</description>

      <recruitment_details>351 participants were included in this study, however, 17 participants were excluded from all analysis (they were neither BDMARD naive nor switched from Remicade). They switched to CT-P13 from a BDMARD other than Remicade, therefore not considered for any analysis.</recruitment_details>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study treatment without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death, initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying), persistent or significant disability or incapacity, congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of infusion up to 2 years, that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. Serious infections including sepsis (excluding opportunistic infections and tuberculosis) were the pre-defined TEAE of special Interest for this study. AEs included both serious and non-serious adverse events.</description>

        <description>DAS28 calculated from the number of TJC and SJC using 28 joints count, ESR (millimeters per hour; ranged from 0 to 150), and participant's GH on a 100 mm VAS (ranging from 0 mm [very well] to 100 mm [extremely bad], higher scores indicated worsening of health condition). Total DAS28 score ranged from 0 (none) to 9.4 (extreme disease activity), higher scores indicated more disease activity. DAS28 &lt;= 3.2 implied low, &gt; 3.2 to &lt;=5.1 implied moderate, and &gt;5.1 implied high disease activity.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) in Participants With Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) at Months 6, 12, 18 and 24</title>
        <description>BASDAI is a self-reported measure of disease activity in participants with AS. Participants answered 6 questions measuring symptoms of AS (fatigue, spinal pain, joint pain or swelling, areas of localized tenderness, morning stiffness duration and severity). The BASDAI total score was calculated by computing the mean of questions 5 and 6 and adding it to the sum of questions (Q) 1-4. This score was then divided by 5. BASDAI=Q1+Q2+Q3+Q4+[Q5+Q6/2]/5. The total BASDAI score ranges from 1=none to 10=severe, where lower score indicated less disease activity. The level of AS disease activity was interpreted as low (BASDAI &lt; 4) or high (BASDAI &gt; 4).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) in Participants With Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) at Months 6,12,18 and 24</title>
        <description>ASDAS is used to assess disease activity in participants with AS. It is a score combining the assessment of overall pain (Q1), duration of morning stiffness (Q2), peripheral pain/swelling (Q3), PtGA (assessed on a sale of 0 to 10, where 0 = not active and 10=very active), and C-reactive protein (CRP) in milligrams per liter (mg/L). ASDAS total score was derived using the following formula: ASDAS=0.12*Q1+0.06*Q2+0.11*GH+0.07*Q3+0.58*ln (CRP+1). The level of AS disease activity was interpreted as inactive disease (ASDAS&lt; 1.3), moderate disease activity (1.3 &lt;= ASDAS &lt; 2.1), high disease activity (2.1&lt;= ASDAS &lt;=3.5) and very high disease activity (ASDAS &gt; 3.5).</description>

        <population>Analysis performed on participants who had received at least one dose of CT-P13 and had at least one post-dose assessment for ASDAS. ‘Overall number of participants analyzed’: participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure. ‘Number analyzed’ = Participants evaluable for this outcome measure at specified rows.</population>

Each item scored on a 4-point scale from 0 to 3 with 0 =&quot;no difficulty&quot;, 1 =&quot;some difficulty&quot;, 2 = &quot;much difficulty&quot;, and 3 =&quot;unable to do&quot;. Overall score was computed as the sum of scores divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range was 0-3 with 0 = &quot;no difficulty to 3 =&quot;unable to do&quot;. Higher score indicate more difficulty in performing daily living activities.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-3 Levels (EQ-5D-3L) Index Score at Months 6, 12, 18 and 24</title>
        <description>EQ-5D-3L is a standardized, participant-administered measure of self-reported health outcomes. It consists of two parts: EQ-5D descriptive system (Part I) and the EQ-VAS (Part II). For Part I, i.e. EQ-5D-3L index score, participants rated their current health state on 5 single-item dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression with each dimension having three levels of function:. 1=no problems, 2=some problems and 3=extreme problems. Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile.

          <title>Change From Baseline in European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-3 Levels (EQ-5D-3L) Index Score at Months 6, 12, 18 and 24</title>
          <description>EQ-5D-3L is a standardized, participant-administered measure of self-reported health outcomes. It consists of two parts: EQ-5D descriptive system (Part I) and the EQ-VAS (Part II). For Part I, i.e. EQ-5D-3L index score, participants rated their current health state on 5 single-item dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression with each dimension having three levels of function:. 1=no problems, 2=some problems and 3=extreme problems. Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score was transformed and results in a total score range of -0.074 to 1.00; higher scores indicating a better health state.</description>

        <description>The SF-12v2 is a self-administered, validated, multipurpose SF questionnaire to measure generic health status. It consists of 12 items, which are categorized into eight domains (subscales) of functioning and well-being: physical function, role limitations due to physical problems, bodily pain, general health perceptions, energy and vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. The score range for each of the 8 health aspects was from 0 (poor health) to 100 (better health), higher scores indicating good health condition. These eight domains are further summarized into PCS and mental component summary (MCS). The score range for each of these 2 summary scores was from 0 (poor health) to 100 (better health). Higher scores indicated a better health-related quality of life.</description>

          <description>The SF-12v2 is a self-administered, validated, multipurpose SF questionnaire to measure generic health status. It consists of 12 items, which are categorized into eight domains (subscales) of functioning and well-being: physical function, role limitations due to physical problems, bodily pain, general health perceptions, energy and vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. The score range for each of the 8 health aspects was from 0 (poor health) to 100 (better health), higher scores indicating good health condition. These eight domains are further summarized into PCS and mental component summary (MCS). The score range for each of these 2 summary scores was from 0 (poor health) to 100 (better health). Higher scores indicated a better health-related quality of life.</description>
