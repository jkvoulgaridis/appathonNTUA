    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, multicenter, open-label, single arm, 2-stage study of tazemetostat 800 mg
      BID (twice daily) and 1600 mg QD (once daily). Subjects will be screened for eligibility
      within 21 days of the planned date of the first dose of tazemetostat and enrolled into one of
      8 cohorts:

      Cohort using tazemetostat 800 mg BID

        -  Cohort 1 (Closed for enrollment): MRT, RTK, ATRT, and selected tumors with rhabdoid
           features, including small cell carcinoma of the ovary hypercalcemic type [SCCOHT], also
           known as malignant rhaboid tumor of the ovary [MRTO]

        -  Cohort 2 (Closed for enrollment): Relapsed or refractory synovial sarcoma with SS18-SSX
           rearrangement

        -  Cohort 3 (Closed for enrollment): Other INI1 negative tumors or any solid tumor with an
           EZH2 gain of function (GOF) mutation, including: epithelioid malignant peripheral nerve
           sheath tumor (EMPNST), extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMC), myoepithelial
           carcinoma, other INI1-negative malignant tumors with Sponsor approval (e.g.,
           dedifferentiated chordoma) any solid tumor with an EZH2 GOF mutation including but not
           limited to Ewing's sarcoma and melanoma

        -  Cohort 4 (Closed for enrollment): Renal medullary carcinoma (RMC)

        -  Cohort 5 (Closed for enrollment): Epithelioid sarcoma (ES)

        -  Cohort 6 (Opened for enrollment): Epithelioid sarcoma (ES) undergoing mandatory tumor
           biopsy

        -  Cohort 7 (Opened for enrollment): Poorly differentiated chordoma (or other chordoma with
           Sponsor approval)

      Cohort using tazemetostat 1600 mg QD

      â€¢ Cohort 8 (Opened for enrollment): Epitheliod sarcoma

      Subjects will be dosed in continuous 28-day cycles. (Note: if treatment with study drug is
      discontinued prior to completing 2 years, subjects will be followed for a maximum duration of
      2 years from start of study drug dosing.) Response assessment will be performed every 8 weeks
      while on study.

      Treatment with tazemetostat will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or
      withdrawal of consent, or termination of the study.

             metastases found on screening MRI may be entered into the study without prior
             radiation therapy to the brain if they do not require immediate surgical or radiation
