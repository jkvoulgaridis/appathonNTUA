  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the setting of progressive or recurrent cancer, adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients,
      parents, and healthcare providers (HCP) are faced with multiple therapeutic options. Each
      treatment option has a unique risk/benefit ratio, resulting in a need to trade one desirable
      outcome for another or accept acute toxicities and treatment-related morbidity to increase
      the chance of survival. Adding to the complexity of this decision, stake holders characterize
      and value the risk/benefit ratios differently.

      This study seeks to learn what things are important to an adolescent or young adult with
      cancer, parents, and health care providers when making decisions about their treatment
      choices.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To quantify the relative importance of various factors believed to be
      important to adolescent and young adult patients with cancer, parents, and health care
      providers when choosing between treatment options in the hypothetical situation of
      progressive or refractory disease.

      Data for this observational study will be collected first at the time the participants enroll
      in the study. If the participant agrees to be re-contacted in the event of disease relapse or
      recurrent cancer, follow-up data will be collected at a second time point up to five years
      after enrollment. This second follow-up time point is optional.

      Participants will complete two short questionnaires and a guided survey on a laptop computer.
      AYA patients and parents will participate in an interviewer-led interview session. The
      surveys are the Herth Hope Index (HHI) to assess hope in adults in clinical settings, and the
      Decision Making Preference Questionnaire (DMPQ) to identify factors that parents believe
      influence their role in treatment decision making. The guided survey presents a hypothetical
      situation outlining different treatment options at the time of recurrent or progressive
      disease. Participants will be asked to answer questions related to type of treatment,
      location of treatment, hospital of treatment, route of treatment, symptoms or side effects
      from treatment, quality of life, frequency of clinic visits, chance of being hospitalized,
      chance of cure, and survival length of time.

      Medical data including cancer diagnosis, date of diagnosis, duration of time on treatment,
      and serious side effects and complications of treatment will be collected on AYA patients.

      Data will be analyzed by group: (1) adolescent and young adult patients, (2) parents, or (3)
      health-care providers.

    <description>Conjoint analysis picks a small subset of possible answer combinations and combination sets and asks respondents which option (profile) they prefer in each set. This data is compiled and a hierarchical Bayesian approach, as implanted in Sawtooth Software package, is used to evaluate the relationship between various attributes and the decision choice. The relative importance of various factors on the decision-making process will be evaluated for three groups (patients, parents and HCPs) independently, generating three separate models. At completion of the survey, the part worth for each different treatment attribute (type, location, hospital, route, symptoms or side effects, frequency of clinic visits, chance of hospitalization, quality of life, chance of cure, and survival length of time) is calculated. They are analyzed simultaneously for each participant and only have meaning in relation to one another constituting a single primary outcome measure.</description>

        Participants will be patients at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, their parents and
        health-care providers who consent to enroll in the study. All participants must meet
        inclusion criteria.

          -  Participants must be English speaking.

          -  There are three main participant subsets for the first time point of the study:

               -  AYA patients (aged 13-30) with an oncological diagnosis who are currently
                  receiving active treatment at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital that includes
                  at least chemotherapy, and have been doing so for at least one month or who
                  completed treatment (that includes at least chemotherapy) less than 1 month prior
                  to enrollment.

                  a young adult patient (â‰¥18) who meets the above criteria will be invited to
                  participate.

               -  HCPs of patients at St. Jude with at least 1 year of experience taking care of
