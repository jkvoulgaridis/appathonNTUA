      The objective is to compare the efficacy and safety of masitinib in combination with FOLFIRI
      ( irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid) to placebo in combination with FOLFIRI in
      second line treatment of patients.

    <description>Overall survival is defined as time in months from the randomization date to the date of death due to any cause. If a patient is not known to have died, then OS will be censored at the date of last known date patient alive.</description>

    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From day of randomization to disease progression or death, assessed for a maximum of 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>Progression Free Survival is defined as the time from the randomization date until the date of earliest evidence of disease progression or death, for participants who progressed or died before subsequent cancer therapy. Disease progression will be assessed by the investigator on CT scan according to RECIST 1.1 criteria</description>
