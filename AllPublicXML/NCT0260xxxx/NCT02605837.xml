    <measure>Number of Participants With Dysphagia Symptom Response at the Final Treatment Period Evaluation (Week 16)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Dysphagia symptom response was defined as greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 30 percent (%) reduction in the Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ) combined score (questions 2+3). DSQ contained 4 questions, all participants used a diary, and responded to Questions 1 (did you eat solid food) and 2 (did food pass slowly or get stuck). If the participant's answer to Question 2 was 'No', the diary ended for that day. If a participant answered 'Yes', he/she advanced to Questions 3 (did you have to do anything to make the food go down or get relief) and 4 (extent to which the participant experienced pain while swallowing). DSQ score= ([sum of points from questions 2+3 in the daily DSQ]×14)/ Number of diaries reported with non-missing data. Dysphagia symptom response after 12 weeks of double blind treatment at Week 16 was reported.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Endoscopy Score at the Final Treatment Period Evaluation (Week 16)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Endoscopic findings with separate evaluations of the proximal and distal esophagus were recorded with respect to 5 categories: 1) exudates or plaques (grade 0-2); 2) fixed esophageal rings (grade 0-3); 3) edema (grade 0-2); 4) furrows (grade 0-2); and 5) strictures (grade 0-1). An endoscopy score for each category was calculated and summed for each anatomic location (proximal and distal). The minimum and maximum endoscopy score was 0 and 10 points respectively for each location (proximal and distal) and the total endoscopy score was the sum of the scores for the proximal and distal locations (maximum total score of 20 points respectively). The higher score indicated worse appearance. A negative change from baseline indicates that appearance improved. Endoscopic findings after 12 weeks of double blind treatment at Week 16 were reported.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Histopathologic Epithelial Features Combined Total Score Ratio (TSR) at the Final Treatment Period Evaluation (Week 16)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in histopathologic epithelial features combined total score of grade and stage ratio after 12 weeks of double blind treatment at Week 16 were reported by measuring eight histopathologic epithelial features: basal layer hyperplasia, eosinophil density, eosinophil micro-abscesses, eosinophil surface layering, dilated intercellular spaces, surface epithelial alteration, dyskeratotic epithelial cells, lamina propria fibrosis were scored on a 4-point scale (0=normal, 3=worst) for both the severity of the abnormality (grade) and the amount of tissue affected by the abnormality (stage). Thus each of the 3 levels had a minimum score of 0 and maximum possible score of 24, and a possible total grade or stage score of 72 for a maximum combined score of 144. Combined total score ratio (TSR) =(proximal TSR + mid TSR + distal TSR)/N, where N is the number of non missing sections for TSR. A negative change from baseline indicates that epithelial inflammation decreased.</description>

             of 3 (proximal, mid-, and/or distal) levels of the esophagus at the screening
             endoscopy.

          -  Participant has a history of clinical symptoms of esophageal dysfunction (for example,
             eating problems, abdominal pain, heartburn, dysphagia, vomiting, food impaction,
             weight loss) intermittently or continuously at screening (Visit -1).

          -  Participants must have experienced dysphagia (response of &quot;yes&quot; to question 2 on
             Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire [DSQ]) on a minimum of 4 days and completed the DSQ on
             &gt;= 70 percent (%) of days in any 2 consecutive weeks of the screening period and in
             the last 2 weeks prior to the baseline visit (Visit 1).

          -  Participant must not have PPI-responsive EoE based on esophageal biopsies performed
             after the patient has been on at least 8 weeks of high-dose PPI therapy (high-dose

             twice daily dosing regimen). This may occur at the time of the qualifying
             esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) (in which case the same proton pump inhibitor (PPI)
             regimen must be continued), or this may have been done previously (in which case PPI
             therapy may have been stopped if there was no response to therapy based on esophageal
             biopsy results). If PPI responsiveness was excluded by a previous EGD and biopsy, the

        <description>Endoscopic findings with separate evaluations of the proximal and distal esophagus were recorded with respect to 5 categories: 1) exudates or plaques (grade 0-2); 2) fixed esophageal rings (grade 0-3); 3) edema (grade 0-2); 4) furrows (grade 0-2); and 5) strictures (grade 0-1). An endoscopy score for each category was calculated and summed for each anatomic location (proximal and distal). The minimum and maximum endoscopy score was 0 and 10 points respectively for each location (proximal and distal) and the total endoscopy score was the sum of the scores for the proximal and distal locations (maximum total score of 20 points respectively). The higher score indicated worse appearance. A negative change from baseline indicates that appearance improved. Endoscopic findings after 12 weeks of double blind treatment at Week 16 were reported.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Histopathologic Epithelial Features Combined Total Score Ratio (TSR) at the Final Treatment Period Evaluation (Week 16)</title>
        <description>Change from baseline in histopathologic epithelial features combined total score of grade and stage ratio after 12 weeks of double blind treatment at Week 16 were reported by measuring eight histopathologic epithelial features: basal layer hyperplasia, eosinophil density, eosinophil micro-abscesses, eosinophil surface layering, dilated intercellular spaces, surface epithelial alteration, dyskeratotic epithelial cells, lamina propria fibrosis were scored on a 4-point scale (0=normal, 3=worst) for both the severity of the abnormality (grade) and the amount of tissue affected by the abnormality (stage). Thus each of the 3 levels had a minimum score of 0 and maximum possible score of 24, and a possible total grade or stage score of 72 for a maximum combined score of 144. Combined total score ratio (TSR) =(proximal TSR + mid TSR + distal TSR)/N, where N is the number of non missing sections for TSR. A negative change from baseline indicates that epithelial inflammation decreased.</description>

        <description>Dysphagia symptom response (binary response [i.e, responders versus. non-responders]) was defined as a &gt;=50% reduction in the DSQ combined score (questions 2+3), from baseline to the final treatment period evaluation (Week 16). DSQ contained 4 questions, all participants used a diary, and responded to Questions 1 (did you eat solid food) and 2 (did food pass slowly or get stuck). If the participant's answer to Question 2 was 'No', the diary ended for that day. If a participant answered 'Yes', he/she advanced to Questions 3 (did you have to do anything to make the food go down or get relief) and 4 (extent to which the participant experienced pain while swallowing). DSQ score= ([sum of points from questions 2+3 in the daily DSQ]×14)/ Number of diaries reported with non-missing data.

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ) + Pain Score (Questions 2 +3+4) at the Final Treatment Period Evaluation (Week 16)</title>
        <description>DSQ contained 4 questions, all participants used a diary, and responded to Questions 1 (did you eat solid food) and 2 (did food pass slowly or get stuck). If the participant's answer to Question 2 was 'No', the diary ended for that day. If a participant answered 'Yes', he/she advanced to Questions 3 (did you have to do anything to make the food go down or get relief) and 4 (extent to which the participant experienced pain while swallowing). DSQ + pain score was calculated by summing the scores of responses to questions 2, 3, and 4 by using following formula: DSQ + pain score= ([sum of points from questions 2+3+4 in the daily DSQ] ×14)/ Number of diaries reported with non-missing data. Scale range was 0 - 2 for question 2, 0 - 4 for question 3 and 0 - 4 for question 4, with higher values representing a worse outcome. Scale range for DSQ + pain score was 0 - 140, with higher values representing a worse outcome. A negative change from baseline indicates that symptoms decreased.</description>
