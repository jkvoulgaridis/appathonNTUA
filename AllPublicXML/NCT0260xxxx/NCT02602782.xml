    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to collect physiologic data streams with the Accuryn Monitoring
      System and validate the accuracy of these measurements against existing gold standards, and
      to track and analyze changes in these physiologic data streams to identify clinical
      signatures that may enable earlier diagnosis and intervention of critical conditions.

          -  Anticipated transfusion of ≥1 unit blood products (pRBC's, platelets, and/or plasma)
             within the first 24 hours of hospitalization, and/or a current diagnosis of
