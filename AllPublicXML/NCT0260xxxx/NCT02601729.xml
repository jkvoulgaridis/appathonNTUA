    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease caused by an immune mediated
      destruction of the pancreatic β-cells. Once the pancreas has been depleted of a critical mass
      of β-cells the need for exogenous insulin therapy emerges. Several methods exist to
      administer insulin. An alternative way to administer insulin is by means of continuous
      subcutaneous insulin infusions (CSII) or insulin-pump therapy.The frequent execution of
      self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) accomplished by a capillary finger-stick test is
      essential in the management of diabetes, but this is very limited and also lacks information
      about rising or falling trends in the actual glycaemia. A solution for this is the use of a
      Real-Time Continuous Glucose Monitoring (RT-CGM) device. Contrary to SMBG, RT-CGM measures
      glycaemia 24 hours a day, provides information about glucose direction and rate of change
      during multiple days a week. Since September 2014, RT-CGM is reimbursed in Belgium for a
      selected group of type 1 diabetic patients by means of a so-called &quot;CGM convention&quot;. The main
      objective of the study is to evaluate the impact of real time continuous glucose monitoring
      reimbursement on real-life clinical care parameters of type 1 diabetic patients in Belgium
      after 12 and 24 months.

        Selected group of type 1 diabetic patients by means of a so-called &quot;CGM convention&quot;. In
        order to be a candidate for reimbursement, patients have to be on an insulin pump and use
        their RT-CGM device for more than 70 % of the time (see www.riziv.be, Nota CGV 2014/228).
        Reimbursement via the RT-CGM reimbursement system has been granted for an initial period of
        three years. As part of the requirements of the current reimbursement system, the Belgian
        health care authorities demanded for an evaluation after 2 years.
