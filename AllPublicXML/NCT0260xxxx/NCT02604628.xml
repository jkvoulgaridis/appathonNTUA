  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of a multifaceted antibiotic stewardship
      intervention on protocol adherence of moderate-severe community-acquired pneumonia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to show a decrease in broad-spectrum antibiotics with a
      non-inferiority in 90-day mortality. Hospitals with a pre-intervention protocol adherence of
      &gt;70% are excluded from the primary analysis. Primary analysis will be done with a mixed
      effects model with a random effects for clusters and time. Crude outcomes and outcomes
      adjusted for potential confounders will be reported. Primary analysis will be tested
      one-sided for a decrease in mortality. Secondary analysis to test two-sided for mortality
      will be performed.
