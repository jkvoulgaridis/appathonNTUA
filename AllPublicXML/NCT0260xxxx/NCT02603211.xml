  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to see how well a tactile imaging sensor will detect for breast
      masses compared to traditional mammography and/or ultrasound. This device may allow a simple,
      convenient method to screen for breast tumors. This data will be used to check the
      feasibility of using the device to detect breast tumors.

      The tactile imaging sensor will estimate the relative size and elasticity of the mass(es).
      This device may allow a simple, convenient method to screen for breast tumors. This is not a
      treatment and it will not be used to diagnose abnormal masses. The investigators will also
      not look for any unknown masses. And only doctors will touch the patients. An engineering
      assistant will be in the room to operate the tactile imaging sensor.

      The breast scan that is done as part of this research protocol is not intended to detect any
      breast disease or abnormality. Research breast scans are not examined by a clinical
      radiologist to look for abnormalities. Research scan will be evaluated by the engineers
      developing the device to assess its usefulness. The breast scan for this research will only
      look at a portion of your breast as it relates to this research. The investigators, the
      tactile imaging sensor operators and other members of the research team are not qualified to
      interpret the scan for any diagnostic or therapeutic value. Therefore, the tactile imaging
      scan being done for this research study will not be analyzed to detect any medical condition.

      Patients will have done mammography or ultrasound by now. Once the doctor decides to perform
      biopsy, the tactile imaging will be planned. The consent will be obtained before the biopsy.
      One of the investigators (Dr. Caroline or Dr. Reilly) will obtain the consent. Before the
      biopsy, the doctor will identify the mass(es) using other modalities such as a ultrasound.
      The tactile imaging sensor operator will obtain the tactile images. Then the biopsy will be
      performed. Radiology doctor, resident, and radiology technologist are always present during
      the procedure. In addition a professional assistant from the engineering group will operate
      the tactile imaging sensor. That person will not have any physical contact with you. The
      procedure will be very similar to the ultrasound device.

      The images will be analyzed by the investigators.

    <measure>Malignancy Estimation Using Risk Score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The tumor risk score is calculated from the tumor size and deformation index. The scale will be from 0 to 5. With 0 being likely to be benign and 5 being likely to be malignant.
We weigh the size 30% and deformation index 70% to come with the risk score. The tumor size is given in millimeters and deformation index is unitless.
Deformation Index represents the hardness of the tumor. The amount at which the probe tip gets deformed by applying a force is called deformation index.
Under the condition that the applied force, depth of the tumor and size of the tumor phantom are kept constant, the softer tumor makes the probe tip deform less than the stiffer tumor. Hence the deformation index for stiffer inclusion will be higher than the softer tumors.</description>

          <title>Malignancy Estimation Using Risk Score</title>
          <description>The tumor risk score is calculated from the tumor size and deformation index. The scale will be from 0 to 5. With 0 being likely to be benign and 5 being likely to be malignant.
We weigh the size 30% and deformation index 70% to come with the risk score. The tumor size is given in millimeters and deformation index is unitless.
Deformation Index represents the hardness of the tumor. The amount at which the probe tip gets deformed by applying a force is called deformation index.
Under the condition that the applied force, depth of the tumor and size of the tumor phantom are kept constant, the softer tumor makes the probe tip deform less than the stiffer tumor. Hence the deformation index for stiffer inclusion will be higher than the softer tumors.</description>

            <other_analysis_desc>We will obtain 20 tactile image data sets from the breast tumor patients. The tactile images will be converted to size and deformation index. Then these two parameters will be converted to the risk score. This is a small number of patients for statistically significance study. Therefore, we plan to use the Leave-One-Out-Cross-Validation (LOOCV) technique to validate the human test results to determine the performance of the device.
We obtain the Risk Score. Risk Score is a unit less numerical value, which can be used as a scale to classify the tumor as malignant and benign. Based on the calculated size of the tumor and measured deformation index, the breast tumors are classified as benign and malignant using scoring method. The risk score will range from 0 to 5, where 0 represents the benign and 5 represents the malignant tumor.
Comparing the Risk Score and the Pathology reports we obtain sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the system.</other_analysis_desc>
