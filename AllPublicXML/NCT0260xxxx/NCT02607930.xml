    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a fixed dose combination
      (FDC) containing bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) versus a FDC
      containing abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine (ABC/DTG/3TC) in HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral
      treatment naive-adults.

After the Week 96 OL Visit, participants in a country where B/F/TAF is not commercially available will be given the option to continue OL B/F/TAF until the product becomes accessible through an access program or until Gilead elects to discontinue the study in that country, whichever occurs first.</description>
