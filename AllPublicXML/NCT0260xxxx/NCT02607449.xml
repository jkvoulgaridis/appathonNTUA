  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug-resistant tuberculosis is becoming a major problem for the whole humanity, and
      development of new Anti-TB drugs is of great importance. Since Kazakhstan is a country with
      the high burden of tuberculosis, the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan has founded
      initiative on the development of new Anti-TB drug to treat drug-resistant forms of this
      infectious disease. JSC &quot;Scientific Center for Anti-infectious Drugs&quot; has developed original
      drug FS-1 for the treatment of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 3 clinical study of FS-1 drug is a randomized, interventional, multicenter,
      placebo-controlled (add-on), double-blind and two arms trial.

      The study consists of two following phases: treatment phase - 6 months and follow-up phase 12
      months. It is planned to recruit 480 patients with verified MDR-TB diagnosis.

      All data will be compiled in an Electronic Data Capture System with further statistical
      analysis according to approved Statistical Analytical Plan.

    <description>Sputum culture conversion (SCC) is a persistently negative result of the sputum culture at one year from the patients who had sputum samples positive for growth of M. tuberculosis at baseline and not followed by any positive culture until the end of the trial. SCC corresponds to the outcome &quot;cured&quot; if at least 5 negative bacteriological cultures is recorded (on solid medium) during 12 months with an interval of at least 30 days.</description>

    <measure>The incidence and severity of Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events and drug related Adverse Drug Reactions</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of Adverse Events and Drug Reactions during the study (6 months of treatment and 12 months of follow-up period).
Adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in subject administered the study drug and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not related to the study drug.
Serious Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Adverse drug reaction - all noxious and unintended responses to the study drug, when a causal relationship between the study drug and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility.</description>
