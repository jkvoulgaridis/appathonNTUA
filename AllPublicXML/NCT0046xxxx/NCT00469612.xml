      The purpose of the present study is to carry out a trial to evaluate the clinical efficacy of
      the NeuroVision Low Myopia Treatment.

      The specific questions to be answered are:

        1. Is there an improvement in vision following the treatment without bringing about a
           change in the subject's prescription for glasses?

        2. Can any treatment effect be seen at 6 months and 12 months after the termination of the
           treatment?

      Myopia and its treatment modalities are one of the widely studied areas in vision research.
      So far all the treatment options have been optical i.e., patients with myopia are either
      corrected with spectacles, contact lenses or refractive surgery to provide clear vision.
      NeuroVision's NVC vision correction technology will be a novel method in the treatment of low
      myopia as the technology is directed at specific neuronal interactions at the level of the
      visual cortex (area responsible for vision in the brain). It uses a non-invasive,
      patient-specific treatment that purports to improve neuronal efficiency and induce
      improvement in the overall ability to see due to a reduction in noise and increase in signal
      strength. As visual perception quality depends both on the input received through the eye and
      the processing in the visual cortex, NeuroVision's technology is hypothesized to compensate
      for blurred (myopic) inputs, by enhancing neural processing.

      We will conduct a clinical evaluation of the effectiveness of this system. The subject will
      be exposed to a set of visual stimulations (pattern with black and white lines) and visual
      threshold level will be obtained. The subject will look at these patterns on a computer. The
      treatment will be applied in successive 30-40 minute sessions, administered 2-3 times a week,
      for a total of 40 sessions. Every 5 sessions, subject's visual performance (visual acuity,
      ability to see letters of varying size, and CSF, ability to see black and white lines of
      varying contrast) will be tested in order to continuously monitor a subject's progress. At
      the end of a session, the data will be sent to the NeuroVision Web Server. Proprietary
      algorithmic software will analyze the patient's performance and progress and will generate
      the parameters for the next treatment session. The purpose of the study is to assess the
      effect on corrected or uncorrected visual performance following treatment.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age should be between 18 to 59 years

          -  Spherical equivalent in the worst eye should not exceed -1.5 DS and the astigmatism
             should not exceed -0.75 DC.

          -  The subject's refractive status is stable, with no increase beyond 0.5D in sphere or
             cylinder over the last six months. That is, the subject's spectacle prescription
             should not differ from the auto-refraction value by 0.50D.

          -  Unaided visual acuity is 0.6 LogMAR or better in the eye with the poorer unaided
             acuity

          -  Unaided visual acuity is 0.1 LogMAR or worse in the eye with better unaided acuity

          -  Unaided visual acuity difference between both eyes is less than 0.3 LogMAR

          -  Best-corrected visual acuity is 0.04 LogMAR or better in both eyes.

          -  The subject should be aware that the study has the following features:

               1. The recommended pace for the treatment sessions is at least 3 sessions per week.

               2. Interruptions should not be longer than 2 weeks during the treatment course.
                  Note: The subject is free to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject suffers from any other visually disabling eye disease(s) or other causes
             for the reduced visual acuity, aside from myopia and/or astigmatism

          -  The subject suffers from myopia-related visual complications resulting in visual loss,
             including myopic macular degeneration, myopic cataract and previous or pre-existing
             myopic retinal detachment.

          -  The subject is suffering from Diabetes Mellitus.

          -  The subject suffers from Migraines

          -  The subject suffers from Epilepsy

          -  The subject is pregnant. (It is not recommended to include pregnant women because of
             the expected visual fluctuations. The NV treatment , basically using a computer, has
             no impact on the pregnancy.) No pregnancy testing will be done but will be identified
             through verbal history. The study has use of tropicamide drug (dilation drops) and
             proparacaine (topical anesthetic), which are a routinely used eye drop in everyday
             clinical practice and no adverse effects have been reported so far on pregnant women
             or fetus.

          -  The subject has an activity limitation due to medical disorders (including migraines,
             seizure disorders, etc.), medications, or emotional status that might potentially
             impair the subject's ability to perform the treatment.

NeuroVision's NVC treatment for Low Myopia: NeuroVision's NVC vision correction technology is a method in the treatment of low myopia as the technology is directed at specific neuronal interactions at the level of the visual cortex (area responsible for vision in the brain).
The subject will be exposed to a set of visual stimulations (pattern with black and white lines) and visual threshold level will be obtained. The subject will look at these patterns on a computer. The treatment will be applied in successive 30-40 minute sessions, administered 2-3 times a week, for a total of 40 sessions. Every 5 sessions, subject's visual performance (visual acuity and CSF) will be tested in order to continuously monitor a subject's progress.</description>
