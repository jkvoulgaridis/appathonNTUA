  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The vagus nerve runs from the brain to many organs. Stimulating it can affect the experience
      of pain. The nerve can be stimulated on the surface of the left ear. Researchers want to
      study how this stimulation affects the perception of pain. They also want to study how mood
      affects the experience of pain.

      Objective:

      To study the effects of mood and vagus nerve stimulation on the experience of pain.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy people ages 18 and older who are fluent in English

      Design:

      Participants will be pre-screened with a 15-minute phone call.

      Participants will have three 2-hour visits.

      At the screening visit, participants will be screened with:

      Medical and psychiatric history

      Physical and psychological exams

      Questionnaires about physical and psychiatric health and mood

      Urine tests

      A heat probe on the forearm. The temperature will be increased until it is painful

      but tolerable.

      Participants will have 2 testing sessions within 7 days. Before the testing, they cannot do
      the following:

      Eat, use nicotine, or exercise for at least 2 hours

      Drink alcohol for 24 hours

      Take certain medicines for 3 days

      Testing includes:

      Urine drug screening

      Left ear stimulation: In one session, the vagus nerve will be stimulated. In the other, an
      area

      of the ear away from the vagus nerve will be stimulated. This will be done with mild electric

      shocks that cause a tingling, pricking, or itchy feeling.

      Heat applied to the forearm until it is painful but tolerable

      Completing several forms on a computer or on paper about how they are feeling

      Monitors on the chest and a finger clip to monitor heart, breathing, and blood pressure

      This double-blind, randomized, controlled, cross-over study on healthy participants will
      evaluate the perceptual differences of pain and changes in mood in response to peripheral
      nerve stimulation over two regions of the left external ear. A series of short and long
      duration heat stimuli will be applied to the participants forearms and they will be asked to
      rate their current mood state, the intensity of the pain, and whether it was pleasant or
      unpleasant. The series of heat stimuli will be applied before, during, and after mild
      electrical stimulation of the left external ear using a commercially available TENS unit.
      There are two study sessions. Session 1 involves eligibility screening, a brief practice
      session, followed by the testing session. In Session 2 (no more than 7 days later), the
      testing session will be repeated with the exception of the location of ear stimulation. Up to
      76 people, ages 18-50 years old, will be enrolled in the study.
