    <textblock>
      This study examines the role of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor family and the EGF
      family of ligands in the regulation of non-myocytes isolated from the human heart.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The EGF family of receptor tyrosine kinases (a.k.a. ERBB receptors) mediate the effects of
      the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family including Neuregulin-1Î² (NRG). NRG and ERBB1-4 are
      critical for cardiac development and maintenance of the adult heart. Current understanding of
      the role of EGF/NRG/ERBB signaling in the cardiovascular system is rapidly evolving due to
      recent findings in non-myocyte cell populations. This study is examining a population of
      progenitor cells in the adult human heart that responds to EGF and NRG. Subjects are enrolled
      who are scheduled to undergo heart surgery and are willing to allow for a small biopsy to be
      taken from their hearts during surgery. Biopsies are taken to the laboratory where cells are
      separated and analyzed by flow cytometry and grown in cell culture to understand how their
      biology is regulated by NRG and EGF.
