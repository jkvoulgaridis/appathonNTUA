    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Pain Freedom at 2 Hours After Initial Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Predose) to 2 hours after initial dose</time_frame>
    <description>Pain freedom was defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate/severe at baseline to no pain at 2 hours after the initial dose. Participants were provided with an electronic diary (eDiary) to rate headache severity on a scale from no pain to severe pain. Number analyzed is the number of participants with non-missing postdose pain severity assessment at or before 2 hours after initial dose.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Absence of the Most Bothersome Migraine-Associated Symptom Identified at Baseline at 2-Hours After Initial Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Predose) to 2 hours after initial dose</time_frame>
    <description>The most bothersome migraine-associated symptom was the symptom (photophobia, phonophobia or nausea) present at pre-dose baseline identified by the participant to be 'most bothersome'. Participants were provided with an eDiary to record absence or presence of migraine-associated symptoms. Number analyzed is the number of participants with non-missing postdose most bothersome migraine-associated symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Pain Relief at 2 Hours After the Initial Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Predose) to 2 hours after initial dose</time_frame>
    <description>Pain relief was defined as a reduction of a moderate/severe migraine headache to a mild headache or to no headache. Participants were provided with an eDiary to rate headache severity on a scale from no pain to severe pain. Number analyzed is the number of participants with non-missing pain severity assessment at or before 2 hours after initial dose.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Pain Relief From 2 to 24 Hours After Initial Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>2 to 24 hours after initial dose</time_frame>
    <description>Sustained pain relief was defined as a pain relief at 2 hours with no administration of either rescue medication or the second dose of study drug, and with no occurrence thereafter of a moderate/severe headache up to 24 hours after dosing with study drug. Participants were provided with an eDiary to rate headache severity on a scale from no pain to severe pain. Determinable cases: participants for whom sustained pain relief from 2 to 24 hours status can be determined based on the observed headache severity at scheduled time points, use of rescue medication or optional second dose between 2 and 24 hours, and the answer to the headache recurrence question at 24 hours. Number analyzed is the number of participants with determinable sustained pain relief from 2 to 24 hours after initial dose.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With the Absence of Photophobia at 2 Hours After the Initial Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours after initial dose</time_frame>
    <description>Photophobia was defined as sensitivity to light, a migraine-associated symptom. Participants were provided with an eDiary to record absence or presence photophobia. Number analyzed is the number of participants with non-missing postdose photophobia assessment at or before 2 hours after initial dose.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With the Absence of Phonophobia at 2 Hours After the Initial Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours after initial dose</time_frame>
    <description>Phonophobia was defined as sensitivity to sound, a migraine-associated symptom. Participants were provided with an eDiary to record absence or presence of phonophobia. Number analyzed is the number of participants with non-missing postdose phonophobia assessment at or before 2 hours after initial dose.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Absence of Nausea at 2 Hours After the Initial Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours after initial dose</time_frame>
    <description>Nausea was a migraine-associated symptom. Participants were provided with an eDiary to record absence or presence of nausea. Number analyzed is the number of participants with non-missing postdose nausea assessment at or before 2 hours after initial dose.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Pain Relief From 2 to 24 Hours After Initial Dose</title>
        <description>Sustained pain relief was defined as a pain relief at 2 hours with no administration of either rescue medication or the second dose of study drug, and with no occurrence thereafter of a moderate/severe headache up to 24 hours after dosing with study drug. Participants were provided with an eDiary to rate headache severity on a scale from no pain to severe pain. Determinable cases: participants for whom sustained pain relief from 2 to 24 hours status can be determined based on the observed headache severity at scheduled time points, use of rescue medication or optional second dose between 2 and 24 hours, and the answer to the headache recurrence question at 24 hours. Number analyzed is the number of participants with determinable sustained pain relief from 2 to 24 hours after initial dose.</description>

        <population>mITT population included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of investigational product, recorded a baseline migraine headache severity measurement, and had ≥ 1 postdose migraine headache severity or migraine-associated symptom measurement at or before the 2-hour timepoint, determinable cases.</population>
