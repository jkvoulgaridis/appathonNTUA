  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather information regarding the population with moderate to
      severe inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the burden of the disease, and understand their
      treatment patterns, particularly on the use of available biologic therapies.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional study to determine the rate of control of disease activity in
      moderate to severe inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) participants, with two parts:
      cross-sectional evaluation (Day 1) with retrospective data collection and a prospective
      12-month evaluation for patients with active IBD at cross-sectional evaluation (Day 1).

      The study enrolled 407 patients. This multicenter trial was conducted in Brazil.
      Retrospective data of previous IBD treatments (drug, dose, treatment duration, drug changes),
      and use of other health resources related with the management of IBD for previous three years
      will be collected. Prospective data was collected for a period of 12 months in participants
      with active disease. UC participants, with no or light disease activity at Day 1 did not
      continue to 12-month follow up. CD participants, with no or light disease activity at Day 1
      but with colonoscopy or calprotectin levels (i.e, calprotectin &gt;200 ug/g) in the previous
      year suggestive of inadequate control of activity progressed to 12-month follow up.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Active Crohn's Disease (CD) at Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Participants with Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) score of ≥8 or Crohn´s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) ≥220 points at Day 1 were classified as participants with active disease. HBI scale assessed five dimensions (general well-being, abdominal pain, number of liquid stools per day, abdominal mass, and complications). These dimensions were scored from the previous day. The total score ranges from 0 to 25. The CDAI evaluated the severity of signs and symptoms of CD. Collected data included information on the number of liquid stools, intensity of abdominal pain, general well-being, presence of comorbid conditions, use of medications for diarrhea, physical examination, and laboratory findings (abdominal mass, hematocrit, body weight), yielding 8 items that were combined with data from a 7-day diary to obtain the total CDAI score which ranges from 0 to approximately 600 points, where higher score indicates higher disease activity.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire (WPAI) assessed the impact of IBD on work productivity and daily activities during the previous 7 days. The 'impairment while working due to IBD' was calculated based on one question: to what degree did the disease impair the productivity while working in the past seven days from visit and the 'activity impairment' was calculated based on Question: how much did the disease affect ability to perform regular daily activities, other than work at a job? Percentage of overall work impairment due to IBD is calculated as: Absenteeism+(1-Absenteeism)*Presenteeism. The total score ranges from 0 (no impairment) to 100% (total loss of work productivity).</description>

               -  Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) ≥8 or

               -  Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) ≥220 or Considering that for CD
                  participants, the disease activity may not be clearly documented only with
                  clinical data, some objective criteria may be considered as entry criteria for
                  the 12-month prospective period:

               -  Colonoscopy in the previous year suggestive of inadequate control of activity or,

               -  Calprotectin levels in the previous year suggestive of inadequate control of
                  activity (i.e, calprotectin &gt;200 µg/g).

          6. For UC: partial Mayo Score ≥5.

        Note: Participants with colostomy and prospective period: Although clinical scales defined
        above are impacted by colostomy these participants will not be excluded from the protocol
        to ensure the assessment of different clinical presentations of the IBD. In addition,
        participants with colostomy must follow the same criteria as above to be eligible to the
        prospective phase.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Indeterminate or not classified colitis.

          2. Current or previous participation in interventional clinical trial (within the last 3

          3. Presenting mental incapacity, unwillingness or language barriers precluding adequate
             understanding or cooperation.

          4. Hospitalized participants at Day 1.

          5. Current off label treatment with Vedolizumab.

        Study Discontinuation Criteria It will be considered a premature termination the situation
        in which the participant discontinues the participation, i.e. they are withdrawn from the
        study before completing the 12 months of follow up period (365 days ± 14 days from Day 1),
        due to any of the reasons listed below:

          1. Withdrawal of consent: participants who for any reason withdraw the free and informed
             consent;

          2. Lost to follow-up (no return of the participant on the expected date of visit -
             drop-out from the protocol);

          3. Death;

          4. Study termination;

          5. Any situation that places the participant within one of the exclusion criteria.

        Note: Participants who are eligible for the prospective period, it means, with active
        disease at Day 1 but who during the 12 months period presents disease remission and/or no
        activity disease condition, are allowed to continue the participation in the study.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Active Crohn's Disease (CD) at Day 1</title>
        <description>Participants with Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) score of ≥8 or Crohn´s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) ≥220 points at Day 1 were classified as participants with active disease. HBI scale assessed five dimensions (general well-being, abdominal pain, number of liquid stools per day, abdominal mass, and complications). These dimensions were scored from the previous day. The total score ranges from 0 to 25. The CDAI evaluated the severity of signs and symptoms of CD. Collected data included information on the number of liquid stools, intensity of abdominal pain, general well-being, presence of comorbid conditions, use of medications for diarrhea, physical examination, and laboratory findings (abdominal mass, hematocrit, body weight), yielding 8 items that were combined with data from a 7-day diary to obtain the total CDAI score which ranges from 0 to approximately 600 points, where higher score indicates higher disease activity.</description>

        <description>HBI scale assessed the severity of CD. HBI scale assessed five dimensions (general well-being, abdominal pain, number of liquid stools per day, abdominal mass, and complications). These dimensions were scored from the previous day. The total score ranges from 0 to 25. Higher score indicates higher disease activity.</description>

        <title>Quality of Life as Assessed by European Quality of Life 5-Dimension (EQ-5D) Health States Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score at Day 1</title>
        <description>EQ-5D questionnaire is an instrument used to measure general HRQOL in participants with IBD. Each dimension has three possible levels: 1 = none, 2 = moderate or 3 = extreme. The EQ-5D VAS score is a self-assigned rating of overall health using a 20-cm visual, vertical scale, with a score of 0 as the worst and 100 as the best possible health. An increase of ≥7 points in the EQ-5D VAS score represents a clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life for participants.</description>

        <title>Quality of Life as Assessed by 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Component Score at Day 1</title>
        <description>The Short Form-36 (SF-36) is a questionnaire that evaluates a participant's health related quality of life. SF-36 includes 36 questions related to 8 health dimensions: physical functioning, role-physical (role limitations due to physical health problems), bodily pain, general health, vitality (energy/fatigue), social functioning, role-emotional (role limitations due to emotional problems), and mental health. Based on these 4 scales (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health), the physical component summary (PCS) score is generated which ranges between 0 and 100, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life. Based on these 4 scales (vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health), the mental component summary (MCS) score is generated which ranges between 0 and 100, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life.</description>

        <title>Mean of Percentage of Total Work Impairment Due to CD as Assessed by Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) Questionnaire at Day 1</title>
        <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire (WPAI) assessed the impact of IBD on work productivity and daily activities during the previous 7 days. The 'impairment while working due to IBD' was calculated based on one question: to what degree did the disease impair the productivity while working in the past seven days from visit and the 'activity impairment' was calculated based on Question: how much did the disease affect ability to perform regular daily activities, other than work at a job? Percentage of overall work impairment due to IBD is calculated as: Absenteeism+(1-Absenteeism)*Presenteeism. The total score ranges from 0 (no impairment) to 100% (total loss of work productivity).</description>

        <description>Mean total activity impairment due to IBD from WPAI questionnaire was reported. The 'overall work impairment due to IBD' was calculated based on three items: (Q2) the number of hours missed from work due to health problems in the past seven days; (Q4) the number of actual work hours in the past seven days; and (Q5) to what degree did the disease impair the productivity while working past seven days. The data was calculated using the formula Q2/(Q2+Q4)+[(1-(Q2/(Q2+Q4))x(Q5/10)] and converted to percent. Data are presented as impairment percentage, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>
