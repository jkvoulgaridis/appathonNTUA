  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK1358820 is a botulinum neurotoxin A complex that has been approved for the treatment of
      overactive bladder (OAB) in several countries, however, it has not been approved for OAB
      treatment in Japan. This study has been planned to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      GSK1358820 in Japanese OAB patients with urinary incontinence whose symptoms have not been
      adequately managed with other medications for OAB.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the superiority of a single dose treatment
      of GSK1358820 100 units (U) compared with placebo.

      The study comprises a screening phase up to 28 days, followed by a double-blind treatment
      phase of 12 to 48 weeks wherein subjects will receive a single treatment of either GSK1358820
      100 U injection or Placebo injection, in a ratio of 1:1, with further stratification within
      the treatment arms according to the number of urinary urge incontinence episodes during
      screening. Subjects meeting the criteria for re-treatment will receive a second and third
      treatment. Each re-treatment will be with open-label GSK1358820 100 U injection, and will be
      spaced at least 12 weeks from the previous treatment.

      The total duration of participation for any subject will not exceed 52 weeks, including
      screening and the 48-week treatment period.

    <measure>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1): Change From Baseline in the Daily Average Number of Urinary Incontinence Episodes at Week 12 After the First Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre-dose on Day 1) and Week 12 in Treatment Cycle 1</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were instructed to enter data in a bladder diary over 3 consecutive days within a week prior to each scheduled visit (or within 28 days prior to Day 1), excluding the day of visit (this period was called the '3-day diary collection period'). The daily average of the number of incontinence episodes were calculated using formula; number of &quot;Yes&quot; response to the diary question of accidental urinary leakage divided by number of valid diary days in the visit. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3- day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day. Change from Baseline is any visit value minus Baseline value. Adjusted mean and standard error of adjusted mean has been reported.</description>

    <description>The total volume voided was measured and recorded by participants in the bladder diary, over a 24-hour period during the 3-day diary collection period. Volume voided per micturition was determined by dividing the total urine volume collected in 24-hour period by the participants with the number of the urinary volume records which are not missing. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day. Change from Baseline was calculated as any visit value minus Baseline value.

    <description>Blood samples were collected from participants for analysis of following hematology parameters; Basophils, Eosino, Hb, Hct, Lympho, Monocytes, N bands, T neutro, PC, RBC count, and WBC. Participants were counted in the worst case category that their value changes to (Low, Normal or High), unless there is no change in their category. Participants whose value category was unchanged (e.g. High to High) or whose value became normal, were recorded in the 'To Normal or No Change' category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had values that changed 'To Low' and 'To High', so the percentages may not add to 100 percent.

                  a negative urine or serum human chorionic gonadotrophin [hCG] test), not
                  lactating, and at least one of the following conditions applies:

                  • Non-reproductive potential defined as: Pre-menopausal females with one of the
                  following: Documented tubal ligation, Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion
                  procedure with follow-up confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion, Hysterectomy,
                  Documented Bilateral Oophorectomy.

                  Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea. Females on hormone
                  replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be
                  required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to
                  continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to
                  allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment.

                  • Reproductive potential and agrees to follow one of the options listed below in
                  the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Modified List of Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding
                  Pregnancy in Females of Reproductive Potential (FRP) requirements from 30 days
                  prior to the first dose of study medication and until the study exit. This list
                  of highly effective methods (approved in Japan) is provided below, and it does
                  not apply to FRP with same sex partners, when this is their preferred and usual
                  lifestyle or for subjects who are and will continue to be abstinent from
                  penile-vaginal intercourse on a long term and persistent basis: Intrauterine
                  device or intrauterine system that meets the SOP effectiveness criteria including
                  a &lt;1% rate of failure per year, as stated in the product label; Oral
                  Contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone; Male partner sterilization
                  with documentation of azoospermia prior to the female subject's entry into the
                  study, and this male is the sole partner for that subject.

                  These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently,
                  correctly and in accordance with the product label. The investigator is
                  responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these
                  methods of contraception.

          -  Subject has given signed informed consent, including compliance with the requirements
             and restrictions listed in the consent form and in this protocol (example, using the
             toilet without assistance, complete bladder diaries and questionnaires, is able to
             collect volume voided per micturition measurements over a 24-hour period, and attend
             all study visits in the opinion of the investigator (or subinvestigator).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has symptoms of OAB due to any known neurological reason (example, spinal cord
             injury, multiple sclerosis, cerebrovascular accident, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's
             disease, etc.)

          -  Subject has a predominance of stress incontinence determined by subject history.

          -  Subject has a history or evidence of any diseases, functional abnormalities or bladder
             surgery, other than OAB, that may have affected bladder function including but not
             limited to:

               1. Bladder stones (including bladder stone surgery) within 6 months prior to
                  screening or confirmed occurrence of bladder stones at the screening phase

               2. Surgery (including minimally invasive surgery) within 1 year of screening for
                  stress incontinence or pelvic organ prolapse

               3. Current use of an electrostimulation/neuromodulation device for treatment of
                  urinary incontinence. Note: Use of any implantable device is prohibited within 4
                  weeks prior to initiation of screening phase and throughout the study period. Use
                  of any external device is prohibited within 7 days prior to the start of the

                  subinvestigator)

               5. Past or current evidence of hematuria due to urological/renal pathology or
                  uninvestigated hematuria. Subjects with investigated hematuria may enter the

                  investigator (or subinvestigator).

               6. Past or current history of bladder cancer or other urothelial malignancy,
                  positive result of urine cytology or uninvestigated suspicious urine cytology
                  results at the Screening phase. Suspicious urine cytology abnormalities require
                  that bladder cancer or other urothelial malignancy has been ruled out to the
                  satisfaction of the investigator according to local site practice.

                  satisfaction of the investigator (or subinvestigator) according to local site
                  practice.

               9. Evidence of urethral and/or bladder outlet obstruction, in the opinion of the
                  investigator (or subinvestigator)

          -  Subject has a history of 2 or more urinary tract infections (UTIs) within 6 months of

             screening.

          -  Subject has current active liver or biliary disease (with the exception of Gilbert's
             syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones or otherwise stable chronic liver disease per
             investigator assessment). Notes:

               1. Stable chronic liver disease should generally be defined by the absence of
                  ascites, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, esophageal or gastric
                  varices, or persistent jaundice, or cirrhosis

               2. Chronic stable hepatitis B and C (example, presence of hepatitis B surface
                  antigen [HBsAg] or positive hepatitis C antibody [HCVAb] test result within 3
                  months prior to first dose of study treatment) are acceptable if subject

             Branch Block from the result of electrocardiogram (ECG) at screening. Notes:

               1. The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Bazett's formula
                  (QTcB), Fridericia's formula (QTcF), and/or another method, machine-read or
                  manually over-read

               2. The specific formula that will be used to determine eligibility and
                  discontinuation for an individual subject should be determined prior to
                  initiation of the study. In other words, several different formulae cannot be
                  used to calculate the QTc for an individual subject and then the lowest QTc value
                  used to include or discontinue the subject from the trial

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of GSK1358820 (botulinum toxin type A) in participants with overactive bladder. This was a multicenter study conducted in Japan.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total 354 participants were screened, of which, 104 failed screening and 250 were randomized. Of the 250 randomized, 248 received GSK1358820 100 units (U) or placebo. One participant did not receive treatment due to defective investigational product vial and the other participant was met with protocol exclusion criteria before dosing.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1): Change From Baseline in the Daily Average Number of Urinary Incontinence Episodes at Week 12 After the First Treatment</title>
        <description>Participants were instructed to enter data in a bladder diary over 3 consecutive days within a week prior to each scheduled visit (or within 28 days prior to Day 1), excluding the day of visit (this period was called the '3-day diary collection period'). The daily average of the number of incontinence episodes were calculated using formula; number of &quot;Yes&quot; response to the diary question of accidental urinary leakage divided by number of valid diary days in the visit. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3- day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day. Change from Baseline is any visit value minus Baseline value. Adjusted mean and standard error of adjusted mean has been reported.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1): Changes From Baseline in Daily Average Number of Urinary Incontinence Episodes</title>
        <description>Participants were instructed to enter data in a bladder diary over 3 consecutive days within a week prior to each scheduled visit (or within 28 days prior to Day 1), excluding the day of visit (this period was called the '3-day diary collection period'). The daily average of the number of incontinence episodes were calculated from bladder diary data recorded by the participants during the 3-day diary collection period, by dividing the number of 'Yes' response to the diary question of accidental urinary leakage with number of valid diary days in the visit. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day. Change from Baseline was calculated as any visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3): Changes From Baseline in Daily Average Number of Urinary Incontinence Episodes</title>
        <description>Participants were instructed to enter data in a bladder diary over 3 consecutive days within a week prior to each scheduled visit (or within 28 days prior to Day 1), excluding the day of visit (this period was called the '3-day diary collection period'). The daily average of the number of incontinence episodes were calculated from bladder diary data recorded by the participants during the 3-day diary collection period, by dividing the number of 'Yes' response to the diary question of accidental urinary leakage with number of valid diary days in the visit. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day. Change from Baseline was calculated as any visit value minus Baseline value. FAS3 Population comprised of all randomized participants who had at least 1 post-3rd treatment efficacy assessment after 3rd treatment.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1): Percentage Change From Baseline in Daily Average Number of Urinary Incontinence Episodes</title>
        <description>Participants were instructed to enter data in a bladder diary over 3 consecutive days within a week prior to each scheduled visit (or within 28 days prior to Day 1), excluding the day of visit (this period was called the '3-day diary collection period'). The daily average of the number of incontinence episodes was calculated from bladder diary data recorded by the participants during the 3-day diary collection period by dividing the number of 'Yes' response to the diary question of accidental urinary leakage with number of valid diary days in the visit. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day. Percentage change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus Baseline, divided by Baseline and multiplied by 100.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3): Percentage Change From Baseline in Daily Average Number of Urinary Incontinence Episodes</title>
        <description>Participants were instructed to enter data in a bladder diary over 3 consecutive days within a week prior to each scheduled visit (or within 28 days prior to Day 1), excluding the day of visit (this period was called the '3-day diary collection period'). The daily average of the number of incontinence episodes was calculated from bladder diary data recorded by the participants during the 3-day diary collection period by dividing the number of 'Yes' response to the diary question of accidental urinary leakage with number of valid diary days in the visit. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day. Percentage change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus Baseline, divided by Baseline and multiplied by 100.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1): Change From Baseline in Daily Average Number of Urinary Urgency Incontinence Episodes</title>
        <description>The daily average number of urge incontinence episodes were calculated from bladder diary data recorded by the participants during the 3-day diary collection period, by dividing the number of 'Yes' response to the diary question of accidental urinary leakage and sudden/ urgent need to urinate with the number of valid diary days in the visit. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day. Change from Baseline was calculated as any visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3): Change From Baseline in Daily Average Number of Urinary Urgency Incontinence Episodes</title>
        <description>The daily average number of urge incontinence episodes were calculated from bladder diary data recorded by the participants during the 3-day diary collection period, by dividing the number of 'Yes' response to the diary question of accidental urinary leakage and sudden/ urgent need to urinate with the number of valid diary days in the visit. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day. Change from Baseline was calculated as any visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1): Percentage Change From Baseline in Daily Average Number of Urinary Urgency Incontinence Episodes</title>
        <description>The daily average number of urge incontinence episodes were calculated from bladder diary data recorded by the participants during the 3-day diary collection period, by dividing the number of 'Yes' response to the diary question of accidental urinary leakage and sudden/ urgent need to urinate with the number of valid diary days in the visit. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day. Percentage change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus Baseline, divided by Baseline and multiplied by 100.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3): Percentage Change From Baseline in Daily Average Number of Urinary Urgency Incontinence Episodes</title>
        <description>The daily average number of urge incontinence episodes were calculated from bladder diary data recorded by the participants during the 3-day diary collection period, by dividing the number of 'Yes' response to the diary question of accidental urinary leakage and sudden/ urgent need to urinate with the number of valid diary days in the visit. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day. Percentage change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus Baseline, divided by Baseline and multiplied by 100.</description>

        <description>The daily average number of micturition episodes (voids) were calculated from bladder diary data recorded by the participant during the 3-day diary collection period, by dividing the number of 'Yes response to the diary question of urination into the toilet with the number of valid diary days in the visit. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day. Change from Baseline was calculated as any visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3): Percentage Change From Baseline in Daily Average Number of Voids</title>
        <description>The daily average number of micturition episodes (voids) were calculated from bladder diary data recorded by the participant during the 3-day diary collection period, by dividing the number of 'Yes response to the diary question of urination into the toilet with the number of valid diary days in the visit. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day. Percentage change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus Baseline, divided by Baseline and multiplied by 100.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1): Change From Baseline in Average Volume Voided Per Micturition</title>
        <description>The total volume voided was measured and recorded by participants in the bladder diary, over a 24-hour period during the 3-day diary collection period. Volume voided per micturition was determined by dividing the total urine volume collected in 24-hour period by the participants with the number of the urinary volume records which are not missing. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day. Change from Baseline was calculated as any visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3): Change From Baseline in Average Volume Voided Per Micturition</title>
        <description>The total volume voided was measured and recorded by participants in the bladder diary, over a 24-hour period during the 3-day diary collection period. Volume voided per micturition was determined by dividing the total urine volume collected in 24-hour period by the participants with the number of the urinary volume records which are not missing. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day. Change from Baseline was calculated as any visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1): Percentage Change From Baseline in Average Volume Voided Per Micturition</title>
        <description>The total volume voided was measured and recorded by participants in the bladder diary, over a 24-hour period during the 3-day diary collection period. Volume voided per micturition was determined by dividing the total urine volume collected in 24-hour period by the participants with the number of the urinary volume records which are not missing. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day. Percentage change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus Baseline, divided by Baseline and multiplied by 100.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3): Percentage Change From Baseline in Average Volume Voided Per Micturition</title>
        <description>The total volume voided was measured and recorded by participants in the bladder diary, over a 24-hour period during the 3-day diary collection period. Volume voided per micturition was determined by dividing the total urine volume collected in 24-hour period by the participants with the number of the urinary volume records which are not missing. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day. Percentage change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus Baseline, divided by Baseline and multiplied by 100.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1): Change From Baseline in Daily Average Number of Urgency Episodes</title>
        <description>The daily average number of urgency episodes were calculated from bladder diary data recorded by the participant during the 3-day diary collection period, by dividing the number of &quot;Yes&quot; response to the diary question of episode associated with a sudden and urgent need to urinate with the number of valid diary days in the visit. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day. Change from Baseline was calculated as any visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3): Change From Baseline in Daily Average Number of Urgency Episodes</title>
        <description>The daily average number of urgency episodes were calculated from bladder diary data recorded by the participant during the 3-day diary collection period, by dividing the number of &quot;Yes&quot; response to the diary question of episode associated with a sudden and urgent need to urinate with the number of valid diary days in the visit. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day. Change from Baseline was calculated as any visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1): Percentage Change From Baseline in Daily Average Number of Urgency Episodes</title>
        <description>The daily average number of urgency episodes were calculated from bladder diary data recorded by the participant during the 3-day diary collection period, by dividing the number of &quot;Yes&quot; response to the diary question of episode associated with a sudden and urgent need to urinate with the number of valid diary days in the visit. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day. Percentage change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus Baseline, divided by Baseline and multiplied by 100.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3): Percentage Change From Baseline in Daily Average Number of Urgency Episodes</title>
        <description>The daily average number of urgency episodes were calculated from bladder diary data recorded by the participant during the 3-day diary collection period, by dividing the number of &quot;Yes&quot; response to the diary question of episode associated with a sudden and urgent need to urinate with the number of valid diary days in the visit. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day. Percentage change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus Baseline, divided by Baseline and multiplied by 100.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1): Change From Baseline in Daily Average Number of Nocturia Episodes</title>
        <description>Nocturia episodes are voids (micturition episodes) that interrupt night sleep. The daily average number of nocturia episodes were calculated from bladder diary data recorded by the participant during the 3-day diary collection period, by dividing the number of 'Yes' response to the diary question of episodes that awake participants from night sleep with the number of valid diary days in the visit. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day. Change from Baseline was calculated as any visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3): Change From Baseline in Daily Average Number of Nocturia Episodes</title>
        <description>Nocturia episodes are voids (micturition episodes) that interrupt night sleep. The daily average number of nocturia episodes were calculated from bladder diary data recorded by the participant during the 3-day diary collection period, by dividing the number of 'Yes' response to the diary question of episodes that awake participants from night sleep with the number of valid diary days in the visit. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day. Change from Baseline was calculated as any visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1): Percentage Changes From Baseline in Daily Average Number of Nocturia Episodes</title>
        <description>Nocturia episodes are voids (micturition episodes) that interrupt night sleep. The daily average number of nocturia episodes were calculated from bladder diary data recorded by the participant during the 3-day diary collection period, by dividing the number of 'Yes' response to the diary question of episodes that awake participants from night sleep with the number of valid diary days in the visit. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day. Percentage change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus Baseline, divided by Baseline and multiplied by 100.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3): Percentage Changes From Baseline in Daily Average Number of Nocturia Episodes</title>
        <description>Nocturia episodes are voids (micturition episodes) that interrupt night sleep. The daily average number of nocturia episodes were calculated from bladder diary data recorded by the participant during the 3-day diary collection period, by dividing the number of 'Yes' response to the diary question of episodes that awake participants from night sleep with the number of valid diary days in the visit. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day. Percentage change from Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value minus Baseline, divided by Baseline and multiplied by 100.</description>

Participants who met re-treatment criteria between 12 and 36 weeks after the first treatment received re-treatment with GSK1358820 100 U (open-label) in Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3) until Week 36 after the first treatment.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1): Change From Baseline in Daily Average Number of Severe Urgency Episodes</title>
        <description>The daily average number of urgency episodes categorized by each urgency intensity as no urgency, mild urgency, moderate urgency and severe urgency. Urgency episodes were calculated by a 4-point scale ranging from '0' (No urgency) to '3' (Severe urgency), as part of the bladder diary, during the 3-day diary collection period. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day. Change from Baseline in daily average number of severe urgency episodes was calculated as any visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3): Change From Baseline in Daily Average Number of Severe Urgency Episodes</title>
        <description>The daily average number of urgency episodes categorized by each urgency intensity as no urgency, mild urgency, moderate urgency and severe urgency. Urgency episodes were calculated by a 4-point scale ranging from '0' (No urgency) to '3' (Severe urgency), as part of the bladder diary, during the 3-day diary collection period. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day. Change from Baseline in daily average number of severe urgency episodes was calculated as any visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1): Change From Baseline in Daily Average Number of Severe or Moderate Urgency Episodes</title>
        <description>The daily average number of urgency episodes categorized by each urgency intensity as no urgency, mild urgency, moderate urgency and severe urgency. Urgency episodes were calculated by a 4-point scale ranging from '0' (No urgency), '1' (mild urgency), '2' (moderate urgency), '3' (Severe urgency), as part of the bladder diary, during the 3-day diary collection period. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day. Change from Baseline in daily average number of severe or moderate urgency episodes was calculated as any visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3): Change From Baseline in Daily Average Number of Severe or Moderate Urgency Episodes</title>
        <description>The daily average number of urgency episodes categorized by each urgency intensity as no urgency, mild urgency, moderate urgency and severe urgency. Urgency episodes were calculated by a 4-point scale ranging from '0' (No urgency), '1' (mild urgency), '2' (moderate urgency), '3' (Severe urgency), as part of the bladder diary, during the 3-day diary collection period. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day. Change from Baseline in daily average number of severe or moderate urgency episodes was calculated as any visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1): Number of Participants With Maximum Urgency Intensity</title>
        <description>The daily average number of urgency episodes categorized by each urgency intensity as no urgency (None), mild urgency, moderate urgency and severe urgency. Urgency episodes were calculated by a 4-point scale ranging from '0' (No urgency) to '3' (Severe urgency), as part of the bladder diary, during the 3-day diary collection period. &quot;Maximum&quot; was defined as the maximum urgency intensity within 3-day period (but only for valid diary day) in the visit. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3): Number of Participants With Maximum Urgency Intensity</title>
        <description>The daily average number of urgency episodes categorized by each urgency intensity as no urgency (None), mild urgency, moderate urgency and severe urgency. Urgency episodes were calculated by a 4-point scale ranging from '0' (No urgency) to '3' (Severe urgency), as part of the bladder diary, during the 3-day diary collection period. &quot;Maximum&quot; was defined as the maximum urgency intensity within 3-day period (but only for valid diary day) in the visit.</description>

          <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3): Number of Participants With Maximum Urgency Intensity</title>
          <description>The daily average number of urgency episodes categorized by each urgency intensity as no urgency (None), mild urgency, moderate urgency and severe urgency. Urgency episodes were calculated by a 4-point scale ranging from '0' (No urgency) to '3' (Severe urgency), as part of the bladder diary, during the 3-day diary collection period. &quot;Maximum&quot; was defined as the maximum urgency intensity within 3-day period (but only for valid diary day) in the visit.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1): Number of Participants With Improvement and Worsening in Maximum Urgency Intensity From Baseline</title>
        <description>Urgency intensity was determined using a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (None), 1 (Mild), 2 (Moderate), 3 (Severe) as part of the bladder diary, during the 3-day diary collection period. &quot;Maximum&quot; was defined as the maximum urgency intensity within 3-day period (but only for valid diary day) in the visit. Results have been presented for improvement (3 point, 2 point, 1 point improvement and no change) as well as for worsening (1 point, 2 point, 3 point worsening) of urgency intensity. Maximum possible scale range is 0 to 3. 3 point improvement means change in intensity from severe to none. 3 point worsening means change in intensity from none to severe. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 2): Number of Participants With Improvement and Worsening in Maximum Urgency Intensity From Baseline</title>
        <description>Urgency intensity was determined using a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (None), 1 (Mild), 2 (Moderate), 3 (Severe) as part of the bladder diary, during the 3-day diary collection period. &quot;Maximum&quot; was defined as the maximum urgency intensity within 3-day period (but only for valid diary day) in the visit. Results have been presented for improvement (3 point, 2 point, 1 point improvement and no change) as well as for worsening (1 point, 2 point, 3 point worsening) of urgency intensity. Maximum possible scale range is 0 to 3. 3 point improvement means change in intensity from severe to none. 3 point worsening means change in intensity from none to severe. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3): Number of Participants With Improvement and Worsening in Maximum Urgency Intensity From Baseline</title>
        <description>Urgency intensity was determined using a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (None), 1 (Mild), 2 (Moderate), 3 (Severe) as part of the bladder diary, during the 3-day diary collection period. &quot;Maximum&quot; was defined as the maximum urgency intensity within 3-day period (but only for valid diary day) in the visit. Results have been presented for improvement (3 point, 2 point, 1 point improvement and no change) as well as for worsening (1 point, 2 point, 3 point worsening) of urgency intensity. Maximum possible scale range is 0 to 3. 3 point improvement means change in intensity from severe to none. 3 point worsening means change in intensity from none to severe. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1): Percentage of Participants Attaining 100 Percent (%), &gt;=75% and &gt;=50% Reduction From Baseline in the Daily Average of Urinary Incontinence Episodes</title>
        <description>Participants were instructed to enter data in a bladder diary over 3 consecutive days within a week prior to each scheduled visit (or within 28 days prior to Day 1)&quot;, excluding the day of visit (this period was called the '3-day diary collection period'). The daily average of the number of incontinence episodes were calculated using formula; number of &quot;Yes&quot; response to the diary question of &quot;Did you have accidental urinary leakage?&quot; divided by number of valid diary days in the visit. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 2): Percentage of Participants Attaining 100%, &gt;=75% and &gt;=50% Reduction From Baseline in the Daily Average of Urinary Incontinence Episodes</title>
        <description>Participants were instructed to enter data in a bladder diary over 3 consecutive days within a week prior to each scheduled visit (or within 28 days prior to Day 1)&quot;, excluding the day of visit (this period was called the '3-day diary collection period'). The daily average of the number of incontinence episodes were calculated using formula; number of &quot;Yes&quot; response to the diary question of &quot;Did you have accidental urinary leakage?&quot; divided by number of valid diary days in the visit. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3): Percentage of Participants Attaining 100%, &gt;=75% and &gt;=50% Reduction From Baseline in the Daily Average of Urinary Incontinence Episodes</title>
        <description>Participants were instructed to enter data in a bladder diary over 3 consecutive days within a week prior to each scheduled visit (or within 28 days prior to Day 1)&quot;, excluding the day of visit (this period was called the '3-day diary collection period'). The daily average of the number of incontinence episodes were calculated using formula; number of &quot;Yes&quot; response to the diary question of &quot;Did you have accidental urinary leakage?&quot; divided by number of valid diary days in the visit. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1): Percentage of Participants Attaining 100%, &gt;=75% and &gt;=50% Reduction From Baseline in the Daily Average of Urinary Urgency Incontinence Episodes</title>
        <description>Participants were instructed to enter data in a bladder diary over 3 consecutive days within a week prior to each scheduled visit (or within 28 days prior to Day 1)&quot;, excluding the day of visit (this period was called the '3-day diary collection period'). The daily average number of urge incontinence episodes were calculated from bladder diary data recorded by the participants during the 3-day diary collection period, by dividing the number of 'Yes' response to the diary question of accidental urinary leakage and sudden/ urgent need to urinate with the number of valid diary days in the visit. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 2): Percentage of Participants Attaining 100%, &gt;=75% and &gt;=50% Reduction From Baseline in the Daily Average of Urinary Urgency Incontinence Episodes</title>
        <description>Participants were instructed to enter data in a bladder diary over 3 consecutive days within a week prior to each scheduled visit (or within 28 days prior to Day 1)&quot;, excluding the day of visit (this period was called the '3-day diary collection period'). The daily average number of urge incontinence episodes were calculated from bladder diary data recorded by the participants during the 3-day diary collection period, by dividing the number of 'Yes' response to the diary question of accidental urinary leakage and sudden/ urgent need to urinate with the number of valid diary days in the visit. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3): Percentage of Participants Attaining 100%, &gt;=75% and &gt;=50% Reduction From Baseline in the Daily Average of Urinary Urgency Incontinence Episodes</title>
        <description>Participants were instructed to enter data in a bladder diary over 3 consecutive days within a week prior to each scheduled visit (or within 28 days prior to Day 1)&quot;, excluding the day of visit (this period was called the '3-day diary collection period'). The daily average number of urge incontinence episodes were calculated from bladder diary data recorded by the participants during the 3-day diary collection period, by dividing the number of 'Yes' response to the diary question of accidental urinary leakage and sudden/urgent need to urinate with the number of valid diary days in the visit. Baseline is the latest pre-dose 3-day diary assessment which has at least one valid diary day.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1): Change From Baseline in King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ) Domain Scores</title>
        <description>KHQ is a 21 item questionnaire, consisting of 9 domains: General health (GH) (1[Very good] to 5[Very poor]), Incontinence impact (Int Imp) (1[Not at all] to 4[A lot]), Role Limitations (RL) (1[Not at all] to 4[A lot]), Physical limitations (PL) (1[Not at all] to 4[A lot]), Social limitations (SL) (0[not applicable] to 4[A lot]), Personal relationships (PR) (0[Not applicable] to 4[A lot]), Emotions (1[Not at all] to 4[Very much]), Sleep/ energy (S/ E) (1[Never] to 4[All the time]) and Severity/Coping (S/ C) (1[Never] to 4[All the time]). Domain score for GH was calculated as score of one item minus 1/4x100; Int Imp: score of one item minus 1/3x100; RL, PL, PR, S/ E: summed scores of 2 items minus 2/6x100; SL, Emotions: summed scores of 3 items minus 3/9x100; S/ C: summed scores of 5 items minus 5/15x100. Baseline is the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value,including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was any visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 2): Change From Baseline in KHQ Domain Scores</title>
        <description>KHQ is a 21 item questionnaire, consisting of 9 domains: GH (1[Very good] to 5[Very poor]), Int Imp (1[Not at all] to 4[A lot]), RL (1[Not at all] to 4[A lot]), PL (1[Not at all] to 4[A lot]), SL (0[not applicable] to 4[A lot]), PR (0[Not applicable] to 4[A lot]), Emotions (1[Not at all] to 4[Very much]), S/ E (1[Never] to 4[All the time]) and S/ C (1[Never] to 4[All the time]). Domain score for GH was calculated as score of one item minus 1/4x100; Int Imp: score of one item minus 1/3x100; RL, PL, PR, S/ E: summed scores of 2 items minus 2/6x100; SL, Emotions: summed scores of 3 items minus 3/9x100; S/ C: summed scores of 5 items minus 5/15x100. Baseline is the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was any visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3): Change From Baseline in KHQ Domain Scores</title>
        <description>KHQ is a 21 item questionnaire, consisting of 9 domains: GH (1[Very good] to 5[Very poor]), Int Imp (1[Not at all] to 4[A lot]), RL (1[Not at all] to 4[A lot]), PL (1[Not at all] to 4[A lot]), SL (0[not applicable] to 4[A lot]), PR (0[Not applicable] to 4[A lot]), Emotions (1[Not at all] to 4[Very much]), S/ E (1[Never] to 4[All the time]) and S/ C (1[Never] to 4[All the time]). Domain score for GH was calculated as score of one item minus 1/4x100; Int Imp: score of one item minus 1/3x100; RL, PL, PR, S/ E: summed scores of 2 items minus 2/6x100; SL, Emotions: summed scores of 3 items minus 3/9x100; S/ C: summed scores of 5 items minus 5/15x100. Baseline is the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was any visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <description>Treatment benefit of GSK1358820 was assessed with TBS ranging from 1(Greatly improved) to 4 (Worsened). This questionnaire consists of 4 answers to 1 question by considering current condition of participants (urinary problems, urinary incontinence) compared to condition before participants received any study treatment in this trial. Positive treatment response was defined as score of either 1 or 2 (representing 'greatly improved' or 'improved').</description>

        <description>Treatment benefit of GSK1358820 was assessed with TBS ranging from 1(Greatly improved) to 4 (Worsened). This questionnaire consists of 4 answers to 1 question by considering current condition of participants (urinary problems, urinary incontinence) compared to condition before participants received any study treatment in this trial. Positive treatment response was defined as score of either 1 or 2 (representing 'greatly improved' or 'improved').</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1): Changes From Baseline in Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS) Total Score</title>
        <description>Symptoms of frequency, nocturia, urinary urgency, and urge incontinence were assessed. OABSS questionnaire consisted of 4 questions: number of times participants urinate from waking in the morning until sleeping at night, ranging from 0 (&lt;=7 times) to 1 (&gt;=15 times); number of times participants wake up to urinate from sleeping at night until waking in the morning, ranging from 0 (0 times) to 3 (&gt;=3 times); number of times for sudden desire to urinate, ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 5 (5 times a day or more); number of times of urine leakage, ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 5 (5 times a day or more). OABSS total score was calculated as the sum of scores for above 4 questions. The range of total score of OABSS was 0 to 15 with higher score indicating, more severity of symptoms. Baseline is the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated as any visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

OABSS questionnaire consisted of 4 questions: number of times participants urinate from waking in the morning until sleeping at night, ranging from 0 (&lt;=7 times) to 1 (&gt;=15 times); number of times participants wake up to urinate from sleeping at night until waking in the morning, ranging from 0 (0 times) to 3 (&gt;=3 times); number of times for sudden desire to urinate, ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 5 (5 times a day or more); number of times of urine leakage, ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 5 (5 times a day or more). OABSS total score was calculated as the sum of scores for above 4 questions. The range of total score of OABSS was 0 to 15 with higher score indicating, more severity of symptoms. Baseline is the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated as any visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1): Number of Participants With Shift From Baseline Relative to Normal Range in Chemistry Results</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for analysis of following clinical chemistry parameters; Albumin, Alkaline Phosphatase (Alk Phosp), Alanine Amino Transferase (ALT), Aspartate Amino Transferase (AST), Direct Bilirubin (Bil), Total Bil, Calcium, Chloride, Creatinine, Glucose, Potassium, Sodium, Total Protein (T Protein), Urea/blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and Uric acid. Participants were counted in the worst case category that their value changes to (Low, Normal or High), unless there is no change in their category. Participants whose value category was unchanged (e.g. High to High) or whose value became normal, are recorded in the To Normal or No Change category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had values that changed 'To Low' and 'To High', so the percentages may not add to 100 percent. Baseline is the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 2)- Number of Participants With Shift From Baseline Relative to Normal Range in Chemistry Results</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for analysis of following clinical chemistry parameters; Albumin, Alk Phosp, ALT, AST, Direct Bil, Total Bil, Calcium, Chloride, Creatinine, Glucose, Potassium, Sodium, T Protein, Urea/BUN and Uric acid. Participants were counted in the worst case category that their value changes to (Low, Normal or High), unless there is no change in their category. Participants whose value category was unchanged (e.g. High to High) or whose value became normal, are recorded in the To Normal or No Change category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had values that changed 'To Low' and 'To High', so the percentages may not add to 100 percent. Baseline is the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3)- Number of Participants With Shift From Baseline Relative to Normal Range in Chemistry Results</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for analysis of following clinical chemistry parameters; Albumin, Alk Phosp, ALT, AST, Direct Bil, Total Bil, Calcium, Chloride, Creatinine, Glucose, Potassium, Sodium, T Protein, Urea/BUN and Uric acid. Participants were counted in the worst case category that their value changes to (Low, Normal or High), unless there is no change in their category. Participants whose value category was unchanged (e.g. High to High) or whose value became normal, are recorded in the To Normal or No Change category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had values that changed 'To Low' and 'To High', so the percentages may not add to 100 percent. Baseline is the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1): Number of Participants With Shift From Baseline Relative to Normal Range in Hematology Parameters</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants for analysis of following hematology parameters; Basophils, Eosinophils (Eosino), Hemoglobin (Hb), Hematocrit (Hct), Lymphocytes (Lympho), Monocytes, Neutrophil Bands (N bands), Total Neutrophils (T neutro), Platelet count (PC), Red Blood Cell (RBC) count, and White Blood Cell count (WBC). Participants were counted in the worst case category that their value changes to (Low, Normal or High), unless there is no change in their category. Participants whose value category was unchanged (e.g. High to High) or whose value became normal, were recorded in the 'To Normal or No Change' category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had values that changed 'To Low' and 'To High', so the percentages may not add to 100 percent. Baseline is the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 2)- Number of Participants With Shift From Baseline Relative to Normal Range in Hematology Parameters</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants for analysis of following hematology parameters; Basophils, Eosino, Hb, Hct, Lympho, Monocytes, N bands, T neutro, PC, RBC count, and WBC. Participants were counted in the worst case category that their value changes to (Low, Normal or High), unless there is no change in their category. Participants whose value category was unchanged (e.g. High to High) or whose value became normal, were recorded in the 'To Normal or No Change' category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had values that changed 'To Low' and 'To High', so the percentages may not add to 100 percent. Baseline is the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3)- Number of Participants With Shift From Baseline Relative to Normal Range in Hematology Parameters</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants for analysis of following hematology parameters; Basophils, Eosino, Hb, Hct, Lympho, Monocytes, N bands, T neutro, PC, RBC count, and WBC. Participants were counted in the worst case category that their value changes to (Low, Normal or High), unless there is no change in their category. Participants whose value category was unchanged (e.g. High to High) or whose value became normal, were recorded in the 'To Normal or No Change' category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had values that changed 'To Low' and 'To High', so the percentages may not add to 100 percent. Baseline is the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1): Number of Participants With Worst Case Post-Baseline Urinalysis Results Relative to Baseline</title>
        <description>Urine samples were collected for analysis of presence of occult blood and protein in urine using dipstick method. The dipstick test gives results in a semi-quantitative manner, and results for urinalysis parameter of occult blood and protein can be read as negative, Trace, 1+, 2+, 3+ and 4+, indicating proportional concentrations in the urine sample. Baseline is the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits.</description>

        <description>Urine samples were collected for analysis of presence of occult blood and protein in urine using dipstick method. The dipstick test gives results in a semi-quantitative manner, and results for urinalysis parameter of occult blood and protein can be read as negative, Trace, 1+, 2+, 3+ and 4+, indicating proportional concentrations in the urine sample. Baseline is the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 3)- Number of Participants With Worst Case Post-Baseline Urinalysis Results Relative to Baseline</title>
        <description>Urine samples were collected for analysis of presence of occult blood and protein in urine using dipstick method. The dipstick test gives results in a semi-quantitative manner, and results for urinalysis parameter of occult blood and protein can be read as negative, Trace, 1+, 2+, 3+ and 4+, indicating proportional concentrations in the urine sample. Baseline is the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits.</description>

        <title>Treatment Phase 2 (Treatment Cycle 2)- Change From Baseline in PVR Urine Volume: Placebo/GSK1358820 100 U</title>
        <description>PVR urine volume was assessed by ultrasound or bladder scan after participants perform a voluntary void according to the study schedule. Baseline is the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated as any visit value minus Baseline value.</description>
