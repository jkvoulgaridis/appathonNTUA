  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to demonstrate the relative bioavailability of 2 newly developed
      fixed dose combinations (FDC) tablets containing empagliflozin, linagliptin &amp; metformin
      extended release (XR) and the single tablets of empagliflozin, linagliptin and metformin XR
      administered simultaneously.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including blood pressure, pulse rate or
             electrocardiogram) is deviating from normal and judged as clinically relevant by the

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the
             range of 45 to 90 bpm

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Cholecystectomy and/or surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere with
             the pharmacokinetics of the trial medication (except appendectomy and simple hernia
             repair)

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders
