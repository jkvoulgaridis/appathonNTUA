  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ophthalmology is among the most technology driven of all medical specialties, with advanced
      medical imaging devices - and specialised computer software - increasingly adopted for
      routine clinical use. While many such devices are capable of completing specific tasks, lack
      of &quot;usability&quot; prevents their widespread adoption (i.e., such devices are not easy to learn
      and remember, or are not efficient or subjectively pleasing to use). Moreover, devices that
      are difficult to use expose patients to clinical risk as a result of human error during
      usage.

      With the introduction of a new medical technology, it is essential, therefore, to have a deep
      understanding of patients, what they need, what they value, their abilities, and also their
      limitations.

      Human factor and usability testing, also known as &quot;human factor engineering&quot;, deals with the
      formal study of people's interaction with their environment (in this case, the binocular
      optical coherence tomography (OCT) device). Structured, patient-centred, usability testing is
      essential to the design, clinical validation, regulatory approval, and widespread
      implementation, of all new medical devices. This is particularly the case for a putative
      binocular OCT system - a device intended for automated use in visually impaired, often
      elderly, populations. Although the binocular OCT is already at an advanced stage of hardware
      development, the EASE study will facilitate an iterative process of operating software and
      workflow modifications to optimize the device for use in these populations.
