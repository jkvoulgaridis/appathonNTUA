    <measure>Change in Short Form Health Survey Version 2.0 (SF-36v2™, Acute Version) Health Survey: Scores From the 8 Domains and Summaries of the Physical Component Score (PCS) and the Mental Component Score (MCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 26</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the participant's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SF-36v2™ (acute version) questionnaire measured eight domains of functional health and well-being as well as two component summary scores (physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS)). The 0-100 scale scores (where higher scores indicated a better HRQoL) from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. In the metric of norm-based scores, 50 and 10 corresponds to the mean and standard deviation respectively of the 2009 U.S. general population. Change from baseline (week 0) in the domain scores and component summary (PCS and MCS) scores were evaluated at week 26. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period.</description>

    <measure>Change in DTSQs: Individual Items and Treatment Satisfaction Score (6 of the 8 Items Summed)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire - status version (DTSQs) was evaluated at week 26. The DTSQs items are scored on a 7-point graded response scale ranging from 6 to 0. Higher scores indicate higher levels of treatment satisfaction for DTSQs items 1, 4 -8. For items 2 and 3 a higher score indicates a higher patient perceived experience of hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia, respectively. Thus, lower scores indicate a perception of blood glucose levels being &quot;none of the time&quot; unacceptably high (item 2) or low (item 3). The domain score of total treatment satisfaction (total treatment satisfaction score) was computed by adding the six items scores 1, 4-8. The score has a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 36. A higher treatment satisfaction score indicates a higher level of treatment satisfaction.</description>

        <description>Participants who achieved HbA1c &lt;7.0 % without severe or blood glucose (BG) confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia and without weight gain (yes/no) was evaluated at week 26. Severe hypoglycaemia was defined as an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate or glucagon, or take other corrective actions. BG-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia was defined as an episode with plasma glucose value &lt;3.1 mmol/L with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period, which was the time period from when a participant was randomised until the final scheduled visit, including any period after initiation of rescue medication and/or premature discontinuation of trial product.</description>

        <title>Change in Short Form Health Survey Version 2.0 (SF-36v2™, Acute Version) Health Survey: Scores From the 8 Domains and Summaries of the Physical Component Score (PCS) and the Mental Component Score (MCS)</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the participant's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SF-36v2™ (acute version) questionnaire measured eight domains of functional health and well-being as well as two component summary scores (physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS)). The 0-100 scale scores (where higher scores indicated a better HRQoL) from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. In the metric of norm-based scores, 50 and 10 corresponds to the mean and standard deviation respectively of the 2009 U.S. general population. Change from baseline (week 0) in the domain scores and component summary (PCS and MCS) scores were evaluated at week 26. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period.</description>

        <title>Change in DTSQs: Individual Items and Treatment Satisfaction Score (6 of the 8 Items Summed)</title>
        <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire - status version (DTSQs) was evaluated at week 26. The DTSQs items are scored on a 7-point graded response scale ranging from 6 to 0. Higher scores indicate higher levels of treatment satisfaction for DTSQs items 1, 4 -8. For items 2 and 3 a higher score indicates a higher patient perceived experience of hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia, respectively. Thus, lower scores indicate a perception of blood glucose levels being &quot;none of the time&quot; unacceptably high (item 2) or low (item 3). The domain score of total treatment satisfaction (total treatment satisfaction score) was computed by adding the six items scores 1, 4-8. The score has a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 36. A higher treatment satisfaction score indicates a higher level of treatment satisfaction.</description>

For items 2 and 3 a higher score indicates a higher patient perceived experience of hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia, respectively. Thus, lower scores indicate a perception of blood glucose levels being &quot;none of the time&quot; unacceptably high (item 2) or low (item 3). The domain score of total treatment satisfaction (total treatment satisfaction score) was computed by adding the six items scores 1, 4-8. The score has a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 36. A higher treatment satisfaction score indicates a higher level of treatment satisfaction.</description>
