  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to its specific pathophysiology and impact on health outcomes, the Institute of Medicine
      has described chronic pain as a complex chronic disease and a &quot;national public health
      crisis.&quot; The unique neurobiological basis and psychosocial context of chronic pain in
      HIV-infected patients underscores the importance of developing and testing a behavioral
      intervention specifically tailored to this population. This study will pilot test a
      newly-developed behavioral intervention for chronic pain tailored to individuals with HIV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is a chronic condition with a unique neurobiologic basis, which has a
      substantial impact on physical and emotional function. Chronic pain in HIV-infected patients
      is common, and associated with serious health consequences, including up to 10 times greater
      odds of impaired physical function. Many pharmacologic therapies, including opioids, often do
      not lead to improved pain and function, and carry significant risk. Evidence-based behavioral
      interventions are among the most effective and safe non-pharmacologic chronic pain treatments
      investigated in the general medical population. Therefore, behavioral interventions to
      improve pain, physical, and emotional function in HIV-infected patients are needed. There is
      much to be learned from existing interventions. However, the success of a behavioral
      intervention is heavily influenced by how well it is tailored to the target population's
      biological, psychological, and social environment. Therefore, in this study investigators
      will conduct a two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial of a recently-developed behavioral
      intervention compared to routine HIV and pain care, to determine feasibility, acceptability,
      and preliminary impact.

    <description>The control group will receive &quot;treatment as usual&quot;. The &quot;treatment as usual&quot; or control group refers to the standard of care that patients receive for their chronic pain. This standard of care allows patients to discuss chronic pain with their providers at their discretion. Although highly variable, providers can recommend and prescribe pharmacologic (e.g., opioid and other pain medication), non-pharmacologic (e.g., physical therapy, referral to psychology) approaches for pain. This study will not interfere in any way with usual care. No additional treatment will be provided to participants allocated to the control group. The participants will complete an outcome assessment within 30 days of the last group session.</description>

            <title>Control</title>
            <description>The control group will receive “treatment as usual”. The “treatment as usual” or control group refers to the standard of care that patients receive for their chronic pain. This standard of care allows patients to discuss chronic pain with their providers at their discretion. Although highly variable, providers can recommend and prescribe pharmacologic (e.g., opioid and other pain medication), non-pharmacologic (e.g., physical therapy, referral to psychology) approaches for pain. This study will not interfere in any way with usual care. No additional treatment will be provided to participants allocated to the control group.</description>
