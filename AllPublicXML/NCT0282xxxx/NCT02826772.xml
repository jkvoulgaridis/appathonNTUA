  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, clinical trial in adult subjects with metastatic
      castrate resistant prostate cancer who progressed after both hormonal therapy (abiraterone or
      enzalutamide) and chemotherapy (docetaxel), or cannot tolerate either or both therapies.

      The study involved a Phase 1 dose escalation of oral GT0918 to evaluate its safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GT0918 treatment was initiated with the first dose of 50 mg/day in a cohort of 3 patients,
      and 6- patients per cohort for the subsequent escalated dose levels at 100 mg, 200 mg, 300
      mg, 400 mg, 500 mg and 600 mg/day. Patients received orally administered GT0918 once daily at
      the indicated doses for 28 consecutive days (4 weeks), followed by a 7-day off-treatment
      period for PK analysis. This concluded the Cycle 1 treatment. Patients who could not complete
      the first cycle of 28 days for DLT evaluation were to be considered as early termination and
      replaced. Upon completion of the Cycle 1 treatment, if no DLT occurred in the cohort of 3
      patients, or no more than 1 patient had DLT in cohorts with at least 6 patients, dose
      escalation was allowed for the subsequent higher dose.

      Patients were to receive up to 6 cycles of GT0918 treatments at their assigned dose levels if
      they were evaluated by the investigator to have no unacceptable toxicity and show evidence of
      clinical benefit (stable disease or a response) per RECIST v1.1 criteria and PSA assessments.
      No off-treatment periods were scheduled for the additional cycles from Cycle 2 beyond.
      Patients had to be evaluated bi-monthly for their eligibility to continue the treatment of
      additional cycles. Patient evaluations included CT and/or MRI scans performed every 2 cycles
      (8 weeks), as well as physical examinations, ECOG performance status, PSA measurements, which
      were performed every 4 weeks. Cycles beyond the 6th cycle were optional for eligible subjects
      that did not exhibit progressive disease (PD). Eligible patients could be treated for a total
      of 6 months at their assigned dose level at the investigator's discretion.

      Patients would have an End-of-Study (EOS) visit if treatment were discontinued due to
      intolerable toxicities, disease progression, withdrawal of consent. Safety follow-up for
      possible delayed drug-related AE or side effects can be performed by phone call or office
      visit if needed.
