  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of omega-3-acid ethyl esters (TAK-085) on
      vascular endothelial function when administered for 8 weeks, as measured by FMD, in patients
      with hyperlipidemia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, collaborative, randomized, open-label study designed to explore the
      effects of administration of omega-3-acid ethyl esters (TAK-085) [2 g (2 g PO QD) or 4 g (2 g
      PO BID) for 8 weeks] on vascular endothelial function, as measured by flow-mediated dilation
      (FMD), in patients receiving a hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor
      and have concurrent hypertriglyceridemia.

      Considering the potential bias by factors that affect FMD between treatment groups,
      stratified allocation will be performed with fasting triglyceride (TG) level as a factor.

    <description>FMD refers to dilation (widening) of an artery when blood flow increases in that artery. To determine FMD, brachial artery dilation following a transient period of forearm ischemia is measured using ultrasound. FMD was calculated by the value of Maximum diastolic vessel size minus vessel size at rest, divided by vessel size at rest, described with percentage.</description>

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received, an opportunity for the primary publication of the research has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com/approach for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>

        <title>Flow-mediated Dilation (FMD) With Fasting State at Baseline, Week 4 and Week 8</title>
        <description>FMD refers to dilation (widening) of an artery when blood flow increases in that artery. To determine FMD, brachial artery dilation following a transient period of forearm ischemia is measured using ultrasound. FMD was calculated by the value of Maximum diastolic vessel size minus vessel size at rest, divided by vessel size at rest, described with percentage.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in FMD With Fasting State at Week 4 and Week 8</title>
        <description>FMD refers to dilation (widening) of an artery when blood flow increases in that artery. To determine FMD, brachial artery dilation following a transient period of forearm ischemia is measured using ultrasound. FMD was calculated by the value of Maximum diastolic vessel size minus vessel size at rest, divided by vessel size at rest, described with percentage.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in FMD With 4-Hours Postprandial State at Week 8</title>
          <description>FMD refers to dilation (widening) of an artery when blood flow increases in that artery. To determine FMD, brachial artery dilation following a transient period of forearm ischemia is measured using ultrasound. FMD was calculated by the value of Maximum diastolic vessel size minus vessel size at rest, divided by vessel size at rest, described with percentage.</description>
