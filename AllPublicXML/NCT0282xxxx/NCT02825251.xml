    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted at 92 sites in 9 countries.as follows: Belgium (7), Canada (8), France (10), Germany (9), Netherlands (9), Russian Federation (11), Slovenia (2), United Kingdom (6), and United States (30). One (1) site in the Netherlands screened, but didn’t randomise any subject.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>There was a 4-week run-in period primarily for reinforcement of subject training in trial procedures, diabetes education and collecting baseline assessments. Subjects remained on their pre-trial insulin treatment during the run-in period.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Faster Aspart</title>
          <description>The subjects received faster aspart (basal-bolus regimen) by continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) for 16 weeks. Doses of basal and bolus insulin and timing of bolus dose were individually adjusted and thus no maximum dose of insulin was specified. Basal rate insulin adjustment: The purpose of adjusting the basal rates was to ensure that blood glucose (BG) was kept between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L [71–108 mg/dL] while in a fasting state and during the night. Bolus insulin titration: It was recommended that meal-time bolus insulin was titrated based on carbohydrate-counting using the Bolus Wizard® according to their usual practice and according to instructions from the investigator. Meal-time dosing was defined as bolus infusion initiated 0-2 minutes before a meal.</description>

            <description>The subjects received faster aspart (basal-bolus regimen) by CSII for 16 weeks. Doses of basal and bolus insulin and timing of bolus dose were individually adjusted and thus no maximum dose of insulin was specified. Basal rate insulin adjustment: The purpose of adjusting the basal rates was to ensure that BG was kept between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L [71–108 mg/dL] while in a fasting state and during the night. Bolus insulin titration: It was recommended that meal-time bolus insulin was titrated based on carbohydrate-counting using the Bolus Wizard® according to their usual practice and according to instructions from the investigator. Meal-time dosing was defined as bolus infusion initiated 0-2 minutes before a meal.</description>

        <description>Percentage of subjects reaching HbA1c &lt;7.0% (53 mmol/mol) without treatment emergent severe hypoglycaemic episodes was evaluated after 16 weeks of randomisation. Subjects without an HbA1c measurement at week 16 were considered not to have achieved HbA1c target at week 16. Severe hypoglycaemia: An episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or take other corrective actions. Plasma glucose (PG) concentrations may not be available during an event, but neurological recovery following the return of PG to normal was considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low PG concentration. Treatment emergent: hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as treatment emergent if the onset of the episode occurred on or after the first day of IMP administration after randomisation (in week 0) and no later than one day after the last day on IMP (i.e., maximum week 16 + 1 day). The results are based on the in-trial period.</description>

Basal rate insulin adjustment: The purpose of adjusting the basal rates was to ensure that BG was kept between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L [71–108 mg/dL] while in a fasting state and during the night. Bolus insulin titration: It was recommended that meal-time bolus insulin was titrated based on carbohydrate-counting using the Bolus Wizard® according to their usual practice and according to instructions from the investigator. Meal-time dosing was defined as bolus infusion initiated 0-2 minutes before a meal.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Subjects Reaching HbA1c &lt;7.0% (53 mmol/Mol) Without Severe Hypoglycaemic Episodes</title>
          <description>Percentage of subjects reaching HbA1c &lt;7.0% (53 mmol/mol) without treatment emergent severe hypoglycaemic episodes was evaluated after 16 weeks of randomisation. Subjects without an HbA1c measurement at week 16 were considered not to have achieved HbA1c target at week 16. Severe hypoglycaemia: An episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or take other corrective actions. Plasma glucose (PG) concentrations may not be available during an event, but neurological recovery following the return of PG to normal was considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low PG concentration. Treatment emergent: hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as treatment emergent if the onset of the episode occurred on or after the first day of IMP administration after randomisation (in week 0) and no later than one day after the last day on IMP (i.e., maximum week 16 + 1 day). The results are based on the in-trial period.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in 30-minute, 1-hour, 2-hour, 3-hour and 4-hour postprandial glucose (PPG [meal test]) was evaluated after 16 weeks of randomisation. The results are based on the last in-trial value, which included the last available measurement in the in-trial period. Meal test: The subjects were given a carbohydrate-rich standardised liquid meal immediately after bolus (faster aspart or NovoRapid®) infusion in the morning of the meal test. The subjects were to consume the meal as quickly as possible (within 12 minutes) and blood samples were drawn after 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours from the start of the meal.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in 30-min, 2-hour, 3-hour and 4-hour PPG increment (meal test) was evaluated after 16 weeks of randomisation. The results are based on the last in-trial value, which included the last available measurement in the in-trial period. Meal test: The subjects were given a carbohydrate-rich standardised liquid meal immediately after bolus (faster aspart or NovoRapid®) infusion in the morning of the meal test. The subjects were to consume the meal as quickly as possible (within 12 minutes) and PPG was evaluated after 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours from the start of the meal.</description>

            <description>The subjects received faster aspart (basal-bolus regimen) by CSII for 16 weeks. Doses of basal and bolus insulin and timing of bolus dose were individually adjusted and thus no maximum dose of insulin was specified. Basal rate insulin adjustment: The purpose of adjusting the basal rates was to ensure that BG was kept between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L [71–108 mg/dL] while in a fasting state and during the night. Bolus insulin titration: It was recommended that meal-time bolus insulin was titrated based on carbohydrate-counting using the Bolus Wizard® according to their usual practice and according to instructions from the investigator. Meal-time dosing was defined as bolus infusion initiated 0-2 minutes before a meal.</description>

            <description>The subjects received faster aspart (basal-bolus regimen) by CSII for 16 weeks. Doses of basal and bolus insulin and timing of bolus dose were individually adjusted and thus no maximum dose of insulin was specified. Basal rate insulin adjustment: The purpose of adjusting the basal rates was to ensure that BG was kept between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L [71–108 mg/dL] while in a fasting state and during the night. Bolus insulin titration: It was recommended that meal-time bolus insulin was titrated based on carbohydrate-counting using the Bolus Wizard® according to their usual practice and according to instructions from the investigator. Meal-time dosing was defined as bolus infusion initiated 0-2 minutes before a meal.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline of the 7-7-9 Point SMPG Profile: Pre-prandial Plasma Glucose (PG) (Mean, Pre-breakfast, Pre-lunch, Pre-main Evening Meal)</title>
        <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in pre-prandial PG (pre-breakfast, pre-lunch, pre-main evening meal and mean over all meals) of the 7-7-9 point SMPG profile was evaluated after 16 weeks of randomisation. The results are based on the last in-trial value, which included the last available measurement in the in-trial period.</description>

            <description>The subjects received faster aspart (basal-bolus regimen) by CSII for 16 weeks. Doses of basal and bolus insulin and timing of bolus dose were individually adjusted and thus no maximum dose of insulin was specified. Basal rate insulin adjustment: The purpose of adjusting the basal rates was to ensure that BG was kept between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L [71–108 mg/dL] while in a fasting state and during the night. Bolus insulin titration: It was recommended that meal-time bolus insulin was titrated based on carbohydrate-counting using the Bolus Wizard® according to their usual practice and according to instructions from the investigator. Meal-time dosing was defined as bolus infusion initiated 0-2 minutes before a meal.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline of the 7-7-9 Point SMPG Profile: Fluctuation in 7-7-9 Point Profile</title>
        <description>Fluctuation in 7-point SMPG profile was the average absolute difference from the mean of the SMPG profile. Reported results are fluctuation in the 7-7-9 point SMPG profile at baseline (week 0) and after 16 weeks of randomisation (i.e., week 16). The results are based on the last in-trial value, which included the last available measurement in the in-trial period.</description>

            <description>The subjects received faster aspart (basal-bolus regimen) by CSII for 16 weeks. Doses of basal and bolus insulin and timing of bolus dose were individually adjusted and thus no maximum dose of insulin was specified. Basal rate insulin adjustment: The purpose of adjusting the basal rates was to ensure that BG was kept between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L [71–108 mg/dL] while in a fasting state and during the night. Bolus insulin titration: It was recommended that meal-time bolus insulin was titrated based on carbohydrate-counting using the Bolus Wizard® according to their usual practice and according to instructions from the investigator. Meal-time dosing was defined as bolus infusion initiated 0-2 minutes before a meal.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline of the 7-7-9 Point SMPG Profile: in Nocturnal SMPG Measurements</title>
        <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in nocturnal SMPG measurements was assessed by considering the differences between PG values available at bedtime, at 4 AM and the before breakfast value the following day: (4 AM PG value minus at bedtime PG value), (before breakfast PG value minus at bedtime PG value) and (before breakfast PG value minus 4 AM PG value). Change from baseline in nocturnal increments in SMPG measurements of the 7-7-9 point SMPG profile was evaluated after 16 weeks of randomisation and presented during three different time intervals as follows: 1) 04:00 to breakfast, 2) bedtime to 04:00, and 3) bedtime to breakfast. The results are based on the last in-trial value, which included the last available measurement in the in-trial period.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Subjects Reaching Overall PPG (1 Hour) ≤7.8 mmol/L [140 mg/dL] Without Severe Hypoglycaemia</title>
        <description>Percentage of subjects reaching overall PPG (1 hour) ≤7.8 mmol/L [140 mg/dL] without treatment emergent severe hypoglycaemia was evaluated after 16 weeks of randomisation. Subjects without a postprandial glucose measurement at week 16 were considered not to have achieved HbA1c target at week 16. Severe hypoglycaemia: An episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or take other corrective actions. Plasma glucose (PG) concentrations may not be available during an event, but neurological recovery following the return of PG to normal was considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low PG concentration. The results are based on the in-trial period.</description>

Doses of basal and bolus insulin and timing of bolus dose were individually adjusted and thus no maximum dose of insulin was specified. Basal rate insulin adjustment: The purpose of adjusting the basal rates was to ensure that BG was kept between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L [71–108 mg/dL] while in a fasting state and during the night. Bolus insulin titration: It was recommended that meal-time bolus insulin was titrated based on carbohydrate-counting using the Bolus Wizard® according to their usual practice and according to instructions from the investigator. Meal-time dosing was defined as bolus infusion initiated 0-2 minutes before a meal.</description>

            <description>The subjects received faster aspart (basal-bolus regimen) by CSII for 16 weeks. Doses of basal and bolus insulin and timing of bolus dose were individually adjusted and thus no maximum dose of insulin was specified. Basal rate insulin adjustment: The purpose of adjusting the basal rates was to ensure that BG was kept between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L [71–108 mg/dL] while in a fasting state and during the night. Bolus insulin titration: It was recommended that meal-time bolus insulin was titrated based on carbohydrate-counting using the Bolus Wizard® according to their usual practice and according to instructions from the investigator. Meal-time dosing was defined as bolus infusion initiated 0-2 minutes before a meal.</description>

            <description>The subjects received faster aspart (basal-bolus regimen) by CSII for 16 weeks. Doses of basal and bolus insulin and timing of bolus dose were individually adjusted and thus no maximum dose of insulin was specified. Basal rate insulin adjustment: The purpose of adjusting the basal rates was to ensure that BG was kept between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L [71–108 mg/dL] while in a fasting state and during the night. Bolus insulin titration: It was recommended that meal-time bolus insulin was titrated based on carbohydrate-counting using the Bolus Wizard® according to their usual practice and according to instructions from the investigator. Meal-time dosing was defined as bolus infusion initiated 0-2 minutes before a meal.</description>

Doses of basal and bolus insulin and timing of bolus dose were individually adjusted and thus no maximum dose of insulin was specified. Basal rate insulin adjustment: The purpose of adjusting the basal rates was to ensure that BG was kept between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L [71–108 mg/dL] while in a fasting state and during the night. Bolus insulin titration: It was recommended that meal-time bolus insulin was titrated based on carbohydrate-counting using the Bolus Wizard® according to their usual practice and according to instructions from the investigator. Meal-time dosing was defined as bolus infusion initiated 0-2 minutes before a meal.</description>

Doses of basal and bolus insulin and timing of bolus dose were individually adjusted and thus no maximum dose of insulin was specified. Basal rate insulin adjustment: The purpose of adjusting the basal rates was to ensure that BG was kept between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L [71–108 mg/dL] while in a fasting state and during the night. Bolus insulin titration: It was recommended that meal-time bolus insulin was titrated based on carbohydrate-counting using the Bolus Wizard® according to their usual practice and according to instructions from the investigator.

            <description>The subjects received faster aspart (basal-bolus regimen) by CSII for 16 weeks. Doses of basal and bolus insulin and timing of bolus dose were individually adjusted and thus no maximum dose of insulin was specified. Basal rate insulin adjustment: The purpose of adjusting the basal rates was to ensure that BG was kept between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L [71–108 mg/dL] while in a fasting state and during the night. Bolus insulin titration: It was recommended that meal-time bolus insulin was titrated based on carbohydrate-counting using the Bolus Wizard® according to their usual practice and according to instructions from the investigator. Meal-time dosing was defined as bolus infusion initiated 0-2 minutes before a meal.</description>

Doses of basal and bolus insulin and timing of bolus dose were individually adjusted and thus no maximum dose of insulin was specified. Basal rate insulin adjustment: The purpose of adjusting the basal rates was to ensure that BG was kept between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L [71–108 mg/dL] while in a fasting state and during the night. Bolus insulin titration: It was recommended that meal-time bolus insulin was titrated based on carbohydrate-counting using the Bolus Wizard® according to their usual practice and according to instructions from the investigator. Meal-time dosing was defined as bolus infusion initiated 0-2 minutes before a meal.</description>

Doses of basal and bolus insulin and timing of bolus dose were individually adjusted and thus no maximum dose of insulin was specified. Basal rate insulin adjustment: The purpose of adjusting the basal rates was to ensure that BG was kept between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L [71–108 mg/dL] while in a fasting state and during the night. Bolus insulin titration: It was recommended that meal-time bolus insulin was titrated based on carbohydrate-counting using the Bolus Wizard® according to their usual practice and according to instructions from the investigator. Meal-time dosing was defined as bolus infusion initiated 0-2 minutes before a meal.</description>

            <description>The subjects received faster aspart (basal-bolus regimen) by CSII for 16 weeks. Doses of basal and bolus insulin and timing of bolus dose were individually adjusted and thus no maximum dose of insulin was specified. Basal rate insulin adjustment: The purpose of adjusting the basal rates was to ensure that BG was kept between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L [71–108 mg/dL] while in a fasting state and during the night. Bolus insulin titration: It was recommended that meal-time bolus insulin was titrated based on carbohydrate-counting using the Bolus Wizard® according to their usual practice and according to instructions from the investigator. Meal-time dosing was defined as bolus infusion initiated 0-2 minutes before a meal.</description>

Doses of basal and bolus insulin and timing of bolus dose were individually adjusted and thus no maximum dose of insulin was specified. Basal rate insulin adjustment: The purpose of adjusting the basal rates was to ensure that BG was kept between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L [71–108 mg/dL] while in a fasting state and during the night. Bolus insulin titration: It was recommended that meal-time bolus insulin was titrated based on carbohydrate-counting using the Bolus Wizard® according to their usual practice and according to instructions from the investigator. Meal-time dosing was defined as bolus infusion initiated 0-2 minutes before a meal.</description>

Severe: Requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate/glucagon/take other corrective actions. PG levels may not be available during an event, but neurological recovery following return of PG to normal is considered sufficient evidence that event was induced by a low PG level.
Documented symptomatic: PG ≤3.9 mmol/L with symptoms.
Asymptomatic: PG ≤3.9 mmol/L without symptoms.
Probable symptomatic: No measurement with symptoms.
Pseudo: PG &gt;3.9 mmol/L with symptoms.

Doses of basal and bolus insulin and timing of bolus dose were individually adjusted and thus no maximum dose of insulin was specified. Basal rate insulin adjustment: The purpose of adjusting the basal rates was to ensure that BG was kept between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L [71–108 mg/dL] while in a fasting state and during the night. Bolus insulin titration: It was recommended that meal-time bolus insulin was titrated based on carbohydrate-counting using the Bolus Wizard® according to their usual practice and according to instructions from the investigator. Meal-time dosing was defined as bolus infusion initiated 0-2 minutes before a meal.</description>

Doses of basal and bolus insulin and timing of bolus dose were individually adjusted and thus no maximum dose of insulin was specified. Basal rate insulin adjustment: The purpose of adjusting the basal rates was to ensure that BG was kept between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L [71–108 mg/dL] while in a fasting state and during the night. Bolus insulin titration: It was recommended that meal-time bolus insulin was titrated based on carbohydrate-counting using the Bolus Wizard® according to their usual practice and according to instructions from the investigator. Meal-time dosing was defined as bolus infusion initiated 0-2 minutes before a meal.</description>

Doses of basal and bolus insulin and timing of bolus dose were individually adjusted and thus no maximum dose of insulin was specified. Basal rate insulin adjustment: The purpose of adjusting the basal rates was to ensure that BG was kept between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L [71–108 mg/dL] while in a fasting state and during the night. Bolus insulin titration: It was recommended that meal-time bolus insulin was titrated based on carbohydrate-counting using the Bolus Wizard® according to their usual practice and according to instructions from the investigator. Meal-time dosing was defined as bolus infusion initiated 0-2 minutes before a meal.</description>

            <description>The subjects received faster aspart (basal-bolus regimen) by CSII for 16 weeks. Doses of basal and bolus insulin and timing of bolus dose were individually adjusted and thus no maximum dose of insulin was specified. Basal rate insulin adjustment: The purpose of adjusting the basal rates was to ensure that BG was kept between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L [71–108 mg/dL] while in a fasting state and during the night. Bolus insulin titration: It was recommended that meal-time bolus insulin was titrated based on carbohydrate-counting using the Bolus Wizard® according to their usual practice and according to instructions from the investigator. Meal-time dosing was defined as bolus infusion initiated 0-2 minutes before a meal.</description>

            <description>The subjects received faster aspart (basal-bolus regimen) by CSII for 16 weeks. Doses of basal and bolus insulin and timing of bolus dose were individually adjusted and thus no maximum dose of insulin was specified. Basal rate insulin adjustment: The purpose of adjusting the basal rates was to ensure that BG was kept between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L [71–108 mg/dL] while in a fasting state and during the night. Bolus insulin titration: It was recommended that meal-time bolus insulin was titrated based on carbohydrate-counting using the Bolus Wizard® according to their usual practice and according to instructions from the investigator. Meal-time dosing was defined as bolus infusion initiated 0-2 minutes before a meal.</description>

Doses of basal and bolus insulin and timing of bolus dose were individually adjusted and thus no maximum dose of insulin was specified. Basal rate insulin adjustment: The purpose of adjusting the basal rates was to ensure that BG was kept between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L [71–108 mg/dL] while in a fasting state and during the night. Bolus insulin titration: It was recommended that meal-time bolus insulin was titrated based on carbohydrate-counting using the Bolus Wizard® according to their usual practice and according to instructions from the investigator. Meal-time dosing was defined as bolus infusion initiated 0-2 minutes before a meal.</description>

            <description>The subjects received faster aspart (basal-bolus regimen) by CSII for 16 weeks. Doses of basal and bolus insulin and timing of bolus dose were individually adjusted and thus no maximum dose of insulin was specified. Basal rate insulin adjustment: The purpose of adjusting the basal rates was to ensure that BG was kept between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L [71–108 mg/dL] while in a fasting state and during the night. Bolus insulin titration: It was recommended that meal-time bolus insulin was titrated based on carbohydrate-counting using the Bolus Wizard® according to their usual practice and according to instructions from the investigator. Meal-time dosing was defined as bolus infusion initiated 0-2 minutes before a meal.</description>

Doses of basal and bolus insulin and timing of bolus dose were individually adjusted and thus no maximum dose of insulin was specified. Basal rate insulin adjustment: The purpose of adjusting the basal rates was to ensure that BG was kept between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L [71–108 mg/dL] while in a fasting state and during the night. Bolus insulin titration: It was recommended that meal-time bolus insulin was titrated based on carbohydrate-counting using the Bolus Wizard® according to their usual practice and according to instructions from the investigator. Meal-time dosing was defined as bolus infusion initiated 0-2 minutes before a meal.</description>

Doses of basal and bolus insulin and timing of bolus dose were individually adjusted and thus no maximum dose of insulin was specified. Basal rate insulin adjustment: The purpose of adjusting the basal rates was to ensure that BG was kept between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L [71–108 mg/dL] while in a fasting state and during the night. Bolus insulin titration: It was recommended that meal-time bolus insulin was titrated based on carbohydrate-counting using the Bolus Wizard® according to their usual practice and according to instructions from the investigator. Meal-time dosing was defined as bolus infusion initiated 0-2 minutes before a meal.</description>

Reasons for change-of-infusion-sets are categorised as follows:
Category-1: A perceived occlusion by the subject Category-2: Any problems related to the infusion set Category-3: Any technical issues with the pump Category-4: Changes in the insulin solution in the infusion set or reservoir Category-5: High BG with no other explanation which made the subject change the infusion set Category-6: Infusion site reaction Category-7: Missing</description>

Basal rate insulin adjustment: The purpose of adjusting the basal rates was to ensure that BG was kept between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L [71–108 mg/dL] while in a fasting state and during the night. Bolus insulin titration: It was recommended that meal-time bolus insulin was titrated based on carbohydrate-counting using the Bolus Wizard® according to their usual practice and according to instructions from the investigator. Meal-time dosing was defined as bolus infusion initiated 0-2 minutes before a meal.</description>

          <title>Number of Subjects With at Least One Non-routine Change-of-infusion-sets Categorised by Reasons for Change-of-infusion-sets</title>
          <description>Number of subjects with at least one non-routine change-of-infusion-sets categorised by reasons for change-of-infusion-sets was evaluated from week 0 to week 16. The results are based on the last on-treatment value, which included the last available measurement in the on-treatment period.
Reasons for change-of-infusion-sets are categorised as follows:
Category-1: A perceived occlusion by the subject Category-2: Any problems related to the infusion set Category-3: Any technical issues with the pump Category-4: Changes in the insulin solution in the infusion set or reservoir Category-5: High BG with no other explanation which made the subject change the infusion set Category-6: Infusion site reaction Category-7: Missing</description>
