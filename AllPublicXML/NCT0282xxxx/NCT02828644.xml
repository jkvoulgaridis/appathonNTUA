  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory study to assess potential maintenance of clinical benefit (cognition
      and symptoms) following 4 weeks of at-home digital therapy in ADHD children.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a blinded (investigators and outcome assessors), randomized (from parent
      study Akili-001R), parallel group, follow-up study of the sustained effects of 4-weeks of
      treatment with either AKL-T01 (EVO Multi) game-based digital therapy or AKL-T09 (EVO Words)
      game-based digital therapy.

      The trial will consist of 4 visits: Screening (to be conducted at the same time as the
      end-of-study visit for the parent study Akili-001R), FU-Day 28 visit (conducted in clinic),
      and FU-Day 56 and FU-Day 84 visits (conducted remotely via electronically captured parent
      reported outcomes).

    <description>TOVA API is a comparison of the subject's scores based on selected measures that persons with an independent diagnosis of ADHD frequently demonstrated. The API is calculated from variability, response time, and d' (D Prime) using the following formula:
API = Response Time Z score (Half 1) + d' Z score (Half 2) + Variability Z score (Total) + 1.80
where Response Time is the average time it takes to respond correctly to a target, d' score is a response discriminability score reflecting the ratio of hits to &quot;false alarms&quot;, and Variability is a measure of consistency of speed of responding based on the standard deviation of the mean correct response times. API tells how similar the score is to the ADHD profile. A score of less than 0 indicates that the subject had similar performance to a normative ADHD population. A lower score indicates a more severe ADHD profile.
The calculation for difference in TOVA API was API at Day 28 minus API at Day 0 of this study.</description>

        <title>Sustained Effects in Attention From End-of-treatment (Follow-Up Day 0) to Follow-Up Day 28 Within Groups That Were Previously Randomized to Receive 4 Weeks of Digital Therapy</title>
        <description>TOVA API is a comparison of the subject's scores based on selected measures that persons with an independent diagnosis of ADHD frequently demonstrated. The API is calculated from variability, response time, and d' (D Prime) using the following formula:
API = Response Time Z score (Half 1) + d' Z score (Half 2) + Variability Z score (Total) + 1.80
where Response Time is the average time it takes to respond correctly to a target, d' score is a response discriminability score reflecting the ratio of hits to &quot;false alarms&quot;, and Variability is a measure of consistency of speed of responding based on the standard deviation of the mean correct response times. API tells how similar the score is to the ADHD profile. A score of less than 0 indicates that the subject had similar performance to a normative ADHD population. A lower score indicates a more severe ADHD profile.
The calculation for difference in TOVA API was API at Day 28 minus API at Day 0 of this study.</description>
