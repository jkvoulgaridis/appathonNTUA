  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 24-week, Phase 3, open-label, non-comparative, multicentre study aims to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of GSK1278863 in Japanese hemodialysis (HD) patients with renal anemia
      not using erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). The primary objective is to evaluate the
      initial response to GSK1278863 measured by hemoglobin (Hgb) levels in HD patients not using
      ESAs enrolled in this study. The study is designed to evaluate the appropriateness of the
      starting dose of GSK1278863 and of the GSK1278863 dose adjustment regimen to achieve or
      maintain the target Hgb levels. This study will consist of a 4-week screening period, a
      24-week treatment period (4-week fixed-dose period and a 20-week dose adjustment period), and
      a 2- to 4-week follow-up period.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This was a 24-week, Phase 3, open-label, non-comparative, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GSK1278863 in Japanese hemodialysis participants with renal anemia not using Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents. The study was conducted at 18 centers in Japan from 08-Aug-2016 to 17-Oct-2017.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 36 participants were screened and 8 failed screening because of not meeting eligibility criteria (7) and withdrawal by participants (1). The remaining 28 participants were enrolled in this study. This study consisted of a 4-week screening period, a 24-week treatment period and a 2 to 4-week follow-up period.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>All Participants</title>
          <description>Participants with newly started dialysis (dialysis newly started &lt;12 weeks before screening) or with maintenance dialysis (dialysis started &gt;=12 weeks before screening) received GSK1278863 orally once daily initially at 4 milligram (mg) for 4 weeks from Day 1. Subsequently, participants received GSK1278863 orally once a day according to a pre-defined study treatment dose adjustment algorithm to achieve or maintain hemoglobin (Hgb) within the target range (10.0–12.0 grams per deciliter [g/dL]). In participants taking oral iron before the study, their iron dose was not changed during the fixed-dose period. Supplemental iron therapy was administered if ferritin is &lt;=100 nanogram per milliliter (ng/mL) and transferrin saturation (TSAT) is &lt;=20%.</description>

        <title>Time to Reach the Lower Target Hgb Level (10.0 g/dL)</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants for measurement of Hgb values at indicated time points. Hgb was evaluated using Hgb analyzer. Participants who could not reach lower target were regarded as censored. The time (in days) to reach the lower target Hgb level (10.0 g/dL) was summarized using 25th percentile (P25), median, and 75th percentile (P75) by Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

Subsequently, participants received GSK1278863 orally once a day according to a pre-defined study treatment dose adjustment algorithm to achieve or maintain Hgb within the target range (10.0–12.0 g/dL). In participants taking oral iron before the study, their iron dose was not changed during the fixed-dose period. Supplemental iron therapy was administered if ferritin is &lt;=100 ng/mL and TSAT is &lt;=20%.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected to evaluate AUC (0-4) at 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours post dose at Weeks 12 and 24. Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were calculated by standard non-compartmental analysis. PK Population consisted of all participants who received GSK1278863 with the PK samples collected and analyzed. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles). NA indiates data was not available. Geometric coefficient of variation could not be calculated when number of participant was equal to 1.</description>

          <title>Area Under the Concentration-time Curve (AUC) From Time Zero to 4 Hours (AUC [0-4]) of GSK1278863</title>
          <description>Blood samples were collected to evaluate AUC (0-4) at 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours post dose at Weeks 12 and 24. Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were calculated by standard non-compartmental analysis. PK Population consisted of all participants who received GSK1278863 with the PK samples collected and analyzed. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles). NA indiates data was not available. Geometric coefficient of variation could not be calculated when number of participant was equal to 1.</description>

Subsequently, participants received GSK1278863 orally once a day according to a pre-defined study treatment dose adjustment algorithm to achieve or maintain Hgb within the target range (10.0–12.0 g/dL). In participants taking oral iron before the study, their iron dose was not changed during the fixed-dose period. Supplemental iron therapy was administered if ferritin is &lt;=100 ng/mL and TSAT is &lt;=20%.</description>

Subsequently, participants received GSK1278863 orally once a day according to a pre-defined study treatment dose adjustment algorithm to achieve or maintain Hgb within the target range (10.0–12.0 g/dL). In participants taking oral iron before the study, their iron dose was not changed during the fixed-dose period. Supplemental iron therapy was administered if ferritin is &lt;=100 ng/mL and TSAT is &lt;=20%.</description>
