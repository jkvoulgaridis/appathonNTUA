  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The NC NEXUS research study is exploring the utility of next generation sequencing in newborn
      screening and parental decision making. The National Institutes of Health (NICHD and NHGRI)
      are co-funding this study under a single U-19.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will enroll and perform whole exome sequencing on two cohorts of patients.
      One cohort will consist of two hundred newborns with no known conditions whose parents will
      be recruited during the mother's pregnancy. The second cohort will include two hundred
      infants and children up to the age of five years with diagnosed conditions including
      conditions detected through standard newborn screening such as phenylketonuria and other
      inborn errors of metabolism, hearing loss and other rare conditions that may fit criteria for
      newborn screening in the future.

      Parents will be introduced to the study by their clinician or a study recruiter. Those who
      agree to enroll in Phase I will review an online decision guide and be offered a study visit
      conducted by a genetic counselor to obtain informed consent for genomic sequencing of their
      child. Parents consenting to have their child's genome sequenced will be seen after the
      child's birth or at a convenient pre-arranged time and duplicate saliva samples will be
      collected from the children and one sample will be sent to the BioSpecimen Processing (BSP)
      Facility and to Dr. Jonathan Berg's laboratory for sequencing and the other sent to the
      Molecular Genetics Laboratory (MGL) for DNA extraction and storage until needed for clinical
      confirmation. Results will be returned for diagnostic (in the Diagnosed cohort) and medically
      actionable disorders of childhood (both cohorts). Two-thirds of parents who consent to
      sequencing will be randomly assigned to be eligible to request additional findings and use a
      supplement of the online decision aid. All results will be reported to parents by trained
      genetic professionals (genetic counselors and clinical geneticists)

    <description>Investigators analyzed next generation sequencing (NGS) results in the diagnosed cohort to determine the ability of whole exome sequencing to detect pathogenic variants in genes related to phenotype determined by standard newborn screening (NBS). The category of genes analyzed is termed the Next Generation Sequencing/Newborn Screening (NGS/NBS) category. Healthy newborns with no known genetic conditions also had the NGS/NBS category of genes analyzed.</description>

    <measure>Parental Reaction Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Time 3 - 2 weeks after results visit and Time 4 - 3 months after results visit</time_frame>
    <description>Test-related distress is assessed with an adapted version of the Multidimensional Impact of Cancer Risk Assessment (MICRA). It asks participants to report how often in the past week they have experienced worries and distress related to their child's genomic sequencing procedure and test results, and the social and familial consequences of sequencing and the test results. Possible responses are provided on the following scale: 0=Never, 1=Rarely, 3=Sometimes, and 5=Often. Because it refers to respondents' experience of their child's sequencing and the test results they received, it is administered only in assessments that occurred after sequencing at Time 3 (2 weeks after results visit and Time 4 (3 months after results visit). Comparisons are made between couples who could chose to receive additional information about their child's genome and a control group who were not eligible to receive additional information.</description>

        <description>Test-related distress is assessed with an adapted version of the Multidimensional Impact of Cancer Risk Assessment (MICRA). It asks participants to report how often in the past week they have experienced worries and distress related to their child's genomic sequencing procedure and test results, and the social and familial consequences of sequencing and the test results. Possible responses are provided on the following scale: 0=Never, 1=Rarely, 3=Sometimes, and 5=Often. Because it refers to respondents' experience of their child's sequencing and the test results they received, it is administered only in assessments that occurred after sequencing at Time 3 (2 weeks after results visit and Time 4 (3 months after results visit). Comparisons are made between couples who could chose to receive additional information about their child's genome and a control group who were not eligible to receive additional information.</description>

          <description>Healthy infants and their parents enrolled in the study prenatally will participate. After the infant is born saliva sample will be collected for DNA extraction and whole exome sequencing will be done.
Well infant, whole exome sequencing: Whole exome sequencing will be performed in children with diagnosed conditions. Investigators will analyze results that are associated with their condition.</description>

          <description>Infants and children with diagnosed conditions whose parents enroll in the study and consent to having their child sequenced will have saliva samples obtained and whole exome sequencing will be done on extracted DNA.
Diagnosed, whole exome sequencing: In addition to returning results of conditions associated with a child's phenotype, investigators will also analyze genes that are associated with conditions that have childhood onset and are medically actionable.</description>
