    <textblock>
      The SCD (Selective Cytopheretic Device) is an extracorporeal device used as an adjunct to
      renal replacement therapy (RRT) to improve the outcomes of pediatric patients with acute
      kidney injury (AKI). Funding Source - FDA OOPD (SCD-PED-01)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The selective cytopheretic device (SCD) is comprised of tubing, connectors and a hemofilter
      cartridge. The device is connected in series to commercially available Continuous Renal
      Replacement Therapy (CRRT) devices. Blood from the CRRT circuit is diverted after the CRRT
      hemofilter through to the extra capillary space (ECS) of the SCD. Blood circulates through
      this space and it is returned to the patient via the venous return line of the CRRT circuit.
      Regional citrate anticoagulation is used for the entire CRRT and SCD blood circuits.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A patient, or legal representative, has signed a written informed consent form.

          2. Must be receiving medical care in an intensive care unit (e.g., ICU, MICU, SICU,
             CTICU, Trauma).

          3. Age less than 22 years.

          4. Females of child bearing potential who are not pregnant (confirmed by a negative serum
             pregnancy test) and not lactating if recently post-partum.

          5. Intent to deliver full supportive care through aggressive management utilizing all
             available therapies for a minimum of 96 hours.

          6. Clinical diagnosis of AKI due to etiologies requiring CRRT (see Appendix B). AKI is
             defined as acute kidney injury with any one of the following:

               -  Increase in SCr by ≥0.3 mg/dL (≥26.5 μmol/L) within 48 hours or;

               -  Increase in SCr to ≥1.5 times baseline, which is known or presumed to have
                  occurred within the prior 7 days or;

               -  Urine volume &lt;0.5ml/kg/h for 6 hours

          7. At least one non-renal organ failure (defined as receiving mechanical ventilation or
             at least one vasoactive medication to treat hypotension) OR presence (proven or
             suspected) of sepsis. (Appendix C).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Threshold blood pressure of 80/40 mmHg-- patients with both a systolic blood pressure
             of less than 80 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure of less than 40 mmHg.

          2. Irreversible brain damage based on available historical and clinical information.

          3. Patients with a solid organ transplant or those with a bone marrow or stem cell
             transplant in the previous 100 days or who have not engrafted.

          4. Acute or chronic use of circulatory support device other than ECMO such as LVADs,
             RVADs, BIVADs.

          5. Presence of preexisting advanced chronic renal failure (i.e., ESRD) requiring chronic
             renal replacement therapy prior to this episode of acute kidney injury or with
             pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) defined as a eGFR&lt;30ml/min/1.73m2. Patients
             who have never seen a pediatric nephrologist will be assumed not to have pre-existing
             CKD.

             from an outside hospital.

          9. Metastatic malignancy which is actively being treated or may be treated by
             chemotherapy or radiation during the subsequent three month period after study
             therapy.

         14. Patient not expected to survive 28 days because of an irreversible medical condition.
             (This is not restrictive to AKI, and may include situations such as the presence of
             irreversible brain damage, untreatable malignancy, inoperable life threatening
             condition, or any condition to which therapy is regarded as futile by the PI.)

             objectives.

         16. Physician refusal.
