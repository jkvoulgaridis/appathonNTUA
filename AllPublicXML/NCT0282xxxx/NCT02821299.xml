  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The experience of face and hand composite tissue transplantations reported in the
      international community have mainly concerned trauma patients. Feasibility and individual
      benefit have been demonstrated for these indications, in properly selected patients. The
      first laryngeal transplantation also concerned a case of post-traumatic reconstruction. A
      certain number of patients, who have suffered direct (extended period of intubation during a
      stay in the ICU, road traffic accident etc.) or indirect trauma (thermal or chemical burns)
      to the larynx, present irreversible trauma or injury to the larynx in which conventional
      treatments are unable to restore laryngeal function. These patients find themselves severely
      disabled, with a significant reduction in their quality of life. They suffer from
      stigmatization which leads to social isolation (professional and personal). In some
      circumstances, providing healthy tissue and anatomical or functional components (cartilage,
      muscle, nerves, blood vessels) by means of an allogeneic laryngeal transplantation, is the
      only way of allowing patients, whose quality of life has been seriously affected, to speak,
      breath and swallow normally. The extremely promising results from other international teams
      in this area have encouraged the investigators to present this project.

      The specificities of the protocol compared to previous transplantations carried out by other
      teams are:

        -  The technique for nerve re-innervation which should make it possible to decannulate all
           patients and improve functional outcomes in the graft.

        -  A dual therapy immunosuppressive regimen will be used, if the patient's clinical and
           biological status permits, which can be adjusted according to the type of tissue
           grafted.

      It might be thought that the need for immunosuppressive therapy means the indications will
      remain rare, representing an incidence of less than five patients a year in France. However,
      the interest of this research project does not reside in the number of patients concerned but
      rather the total lack of any existing therapeutic solution. Conducting a case series will
      help determine whether, under certain conditions, laryngeal transplantation can improve the
      management of patients for whom the usual reconstructive surgery options are unsatisfactory.

      The study is intended to provide a descriptive analysis of a case series of three laryngeal
      transplantations before and after comparisons, each patient serving as their own control.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients presenting with the permanent loss of laryngeal functions. Loss of laryngeal
             function is considered when a patient is permanently tracheotomized, is mutic and
             presented failure for each of the three conventional treatment. Conventional treatment
             lines are organized in the following manner firstly laser, then prosthesis and lastly
             surgery) Diet may be normal.

          -  Adults aged between 18 to 60 years;

          -  ASA (American Society of Anesthesiology) score &lt; 3 and the health status of the
             patients must be compatible not only with the graft but also with all the treatments
             envisaged by the study (according investigator assessment);

             the study, and capable of making their own decision regarding the transplantation
             according investigator assessment;

          -  Having given written informed consent prior to any procedure related to the study;
