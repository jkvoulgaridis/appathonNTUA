    <textblock>
      This research study is designed to see if a drug called Nivolumab is effective in treating
      patients with advanced refractory biliary tract cancers. Nivolumab has been approved by the
      U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of certain types of cancer but is not
      approved by the FDA for treatment of your type of cancer.

             cell rescue. 6) Investigational drug therapy outside of this trial during or within 4
