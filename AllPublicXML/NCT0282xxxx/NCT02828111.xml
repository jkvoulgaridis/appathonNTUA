  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, dose escalating, randomized, vehicle-controlled study designed to
      compare the efficacy and safety of patidegib gel 2% and 4% applied once or twice daily in
      comparison with that of vehicle in patients with Basal Cell Carcinoma. One investigational
      center (metasite) in the United States will participate in this study. Approximately 36
      subjects who meet the study entry criteria will be enrolled into one of four sequential
      cohorts. Within each cohort subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive active or
      vehicle gel.

      This is a double-blind, dose escalating, randomized, vehicle-controlled study designed to
      compare the efficacy and safety of patidegib gel 2% and 4% applied once or twice daily in
      comparison with that of vehicle. Approximately 36 subjects who meet the study entry criteria
      will be enrolled into one of four sequential cohorts. As soon as one cohort has been
      completely enrolled, the next cohort will be enrolled. Each subject will treat no more than
      two previously untreated biopsy confirmed treatment-targeted nodular BCCs. If the subject has
      additional non-treatment targeted BCCs they can be treated surgically prior to or during the
      trial. Within each cohort subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive active or
      vehicle gel. The sequential cohorts will be:

        -  Cohort 1: patidegib gel 2% or vehicle, once daily

        -  Cohort 2: patidegib gel 4% or vehicle, once daily

        -  Cohort 3: patidegib gel 2% or vehicle, twice daily

        -  Cohort 4: patidegib gel 4% or vehicle, twice daily

      The study drug will be applied topically to the treatment-targeted BCCs and a rim of adjacent
      skin for 12 weeks. Information on reported and observed adverse events (AEs) will be obtained
      at each visit. An abbreviated physical examination (PE) will be performed at Baseline and
      Week 12. The treatment-targeted BCCs will be identified by the Investigator at the Baseline
      visit and will be circled in ink at Baseline, Weeks 6 and 12 and photographed, and measured
      at all study visits (Baseline, Weeks 2, 6, 8, 10, and 12). Blood samples for complete blood
      count and serum chemistry and urine for urinalysis will be collected from subjects at
      Screening, Week 6, and Week 12. Subjects who terminate study participation early will be
      asked to complete all Week 12 assessments, as appropriate, prior to commencement of any
      alternative therapy for BCCs (if possible). Subjects who discontinue from the study during
      the treatment period will not be replaced.

    <measure>Molecular Efficacy: Percent Change From Baseline in the Hedgehog (HH) Signaling Pathway Target Gene Glioma-associated Oncogene Homolog 1 (GLI1) Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) Levels at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>GLI1 change is a biomarker of the HH signaling pathway. A change in GLI1 mRNA levels reflect a change in the HH pathway. Surgically eligible basal cell carcinomas (SEBs) were defined as clinically diagnosed basal cell carcinoma (BCC) 5 to 20 millimeters (mm) in diameter on the face, excluding the nose and periorbital skin, and 9 to 20 mm at sites other than the face. A single baseline BCC designated as a treatment-targeted tumor at Baseline was biopsied first at Baseline and again following 12 weeks of treatment. This was used to assess percent change in GLI1 mRNA levels as follows: (Baseline - Week 12) / Baseline * 100, with positive numbers to represent increases and negative numbers to represent decreases. Any missing values were not imputed; all available data is summarized.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Efficacy: Percent Change From Baseline in Tumor Size of Treatment-targeted SEBs at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>SEBs were defined as clinically diagnosed BCC 5 to 20 mm in diameter on the face, excluding the nose and periorbital skin, and 9 to 20 mm at sites other than the face. The percent change in greatest diameters of treatment-targeted surgically eligible basal cell carcinomas (SEBs) from Baseline to Week 12 was calculated as follows: (sum [Baseline] - sum [Week 12] / sum [Baseline] * 100), where sum = the greatest diameters of treatment-targeted SEBs and positive numbers to represent increases and negative numbers to represent decreases. Missing values were imputed using Last-Observation Carried Forward (LOCF).</description>

    <measure>Clinical Efficacy: Percentage of SEBs Showing Complete or Partial Response at Week 12 as Determined by Blinded Photographic Review</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>SEBs were defined as clinically diagnosed BCC 5 to 20 mm in diameter on the face, excluding the nose and periorbital skin, and 9 to 20 mm at sites other than the face. The percentage of tumors showing a complete or partial response at Week 12 was calculated as follows: (Number of baseline treatment-targeted SEBs showing complete or partial response at Week 12) / (Number of Baseline treatment-targeted SEBs) * 100. Missing values were not imputed.Complete Response is determined when there is no longer any visible evidence of a lesion consistent with BCC at the site, and Partial Response is determined when although a BCC still remains at this site, it has demonstrated a visible decrease in size compared with baseline.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Treatment-targeted SEBs Achieving Clear or Almost Clear on the Investigator Static Global Tumor Assessment (ISGTA) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 2, 6, 8, 10, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The ISGTA is a scale with scores ranging from 0 (clear), 1 (almost clear), 2 (minimal residual tumor), to 3 (clearly visible tumor). The Investigator assessed each Baseline treatment-targeted SEB at Weeks 2, 6, 8, 10, and 12. SEBs were defined as clinically diagnosed BCC 5 to 20 mm in diameter on the face, excluding the nose and periorbital skin, and 9 to 20 mm at sites other than the face. The percentage of Baseline treatment-targeted SEBs evaluated as being clear or almost clear at Week x (Week x = 2, 6, 8, 10, or 12) based on the ISGTA scale was calculated as follows: (Number of baseline treatment-targeted SEBs with ISGTA score of 0 or 1 at Week x) / (Number of Baseline treatment-targeted SEBs) * 100. Missing data were imputed using LOCF. The percentage of responders achieving clear (0) or almost clear (1) on the ISGTA scale are presented by Week.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The participant is from 18 to 85 years of age, inclusive.

          2. The participant must provide electronic informed consent prior to any study
             procedures.

          3. If the participant is a woman of childbearing potential, she is willing to use two
             effective methods of birth control during the duration of the trial and for one month
             after the last application of the gel. The two forms of birth control authorized are
             defined as the use of a barrier method of contraception (condom with spermicide) in
             association with one of the following methods of birth control: bilateral tubal
             ligation; combined oral contraceptives (estrogens and progesterone) or implanted or
             injectable contraceptives with a stable dose for at least 1 month prior to Baseline;
             hormonal intra-uterine device (IUD) inserted at least 1 month prior to Baseline. This
             proscription is based on the key role of the hedgehog (HH) pathway in embryogenesis,
             the known preclinical teratogenic effects of systemic cyclopamine, a naturally
             occurring inhibitor of smoothened (SMO), and the unknown level of systemic exposure
             following topical application of patidegib in humans.

          4. If the participant is a male with a female sexual partner who is of childbearing
             potential, the couple is willing to use two effective methods of birth control during
             the duration of the trial and for one month after the last application of the gel.
             Authorized birth control methods are outlined in Inclusion Criterion #3. Any woman of
             childbearing potential applying the gel to themselves, or assisting a subject, must
             comply with the same birth control measures.

          5. One or two previously untreated basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) with the clinical
             features of a nodular BCC confirmed by a biopsy done at or prior to screening
             confirming nodular BCC. These tumors must be suitable for surgical excision. The BCCs
             prior to biopsy must be no less than 5 millimeters (mm) or greater than 15 mm in
             greatest diameter on the face and no less than 9 mm or more than 20 mm in greatest
             diameter at sites other than the face. Tumors on the nose, periorbital skin, or on or
             below the knee are excluded.

          6. The participant is willing to abstain from application of non-study topical
             prescription and over the counter medications within 5 centimeters (cm) of a
             treatment-targeted BCC for the duration of the study except as prescribed by the
             Investigator. Moisturizers and emollients are allowable. Subjects will be encouraged
             to use sunscreen with a sunscreen protection factor (SPF 15 or higher) at least once
             daily on all exposed skin sites.

          7. Female participant must have negative serum pregnancy test at Screening.

          8. The participant is willing to contact the study center after each primary skin care
             physician (PSCP) visit to provide the study center details of the visit and any
             treatment of skin tumors.

          9. The participant is willing to forego alternative treatment of the treatment-targeted
             baseline BCC for the duration of the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants with basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS, Gorlin syndrome, nevoid basal cell
             carcinoma syndrome; Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man [OMIM] #109400).

          2. The participant has used topical products within 5 cm of a treatment- targeted BCC or
             systemic therapies that might interfere with the evaluation of the study medication
             during the study. Specifically, these include the use of:

               1. Topical glucocorticoids 30 days prior to screening

               2. Retinoids (such as etretinate, isotretinoin, tazarotene, tretinoin, adapalene)
                  systemically or topically, or &gt; 5% of an alphahydroxy acid (such as glycolic
                  acid, lactic acid), photodynamic therapy (PDT), or 5-fluorouracil or imiquimod
                  (except as topical treatment to discrete BCCs) systemically or topically to the
                  skin during the six months prior to entry.

               3. Systemic chemotherapy within one year prior to screening. (Note: field therapy
                  with topically applied treatments can be done as long as they are not applied
                  within 5 cm of a treatment-targeted tumor).

               4. Known inhibitors of the HH signaling pathway (such as vismodegib, patidegib,
                  sonidegib, and itraconazole) topically or systemically within 6 months of entry
                  into the study.

          3. The participant has a history of hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in the
             study medication formulation.

          4. The participant is unable or unwilling to make a good faith effort to be present for
             all follow-up visits and tests.

          5. The participant is a woman who is currently nursing.

          6. The participant has any systemic disease that in the Investigator's opinion would
             interfere with the subject's ability to participate.

          7. The participant has a clinically significant history of liver disease, including viral
             hepatitis, current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis, that in the investigator's opinion
             would interfere with the participant's ability to participate.

          8. The participant has any condition or situation which in the Investigator's opinion may
             put the subject at significant risk, could confound the study results, or could
             interfere significantly with the participant's participation in the study. This
             includes history of other skin conditions or diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical
             examination findings, or clinical laboratory findings giving reasonable suspicion of a
             disease or condition that contraindicates use of this investigational drug or that
             might affect interpretation of the results of the study or render the participant at
             high risk from treatment complications.

          9. The participant has a history of invasive cancer within the past five years excluding
             non-melanoma skin cancer, Stage I cervical cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ of breast,
             or chronic lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) (Stage 0).

         10. The participant is currently participating in an experimental drug study (within 4
             weeks of Baseline visit) or plans to participate in an experimental drug study while
             enrolled in this study.

         11. The participant is on a concomitant medication that is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor.
             These include, but are not limited to: larithromycin, telithromycin, nefazodone,
             itraconazole, ketoconazole, atazanavir, darunavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir,
             ritonavir, saquinavir, and tipranavir.

        <description>GLI1 change is a biomarker of the HH signaling pathway. A change in GLI1 mRNA levels reflect a change in the HH pathway. Surgically eligible basal cell carcinomas (SEBs) were defined as clinically diagnosed basal cell carcinoma (BCC) 5 to 20 millimeters (mm) in diameter on the face, excluding the nose and periorbital skin, and 9 to 20 mm at sites other than the face. A single baseline BCC designated as a treatment-targeted tumor at Baseline was biopsied first at Baseline and again following 12 weeks of treatment. This was used to assess percent change in GLI1 mRNA levels as follows: (Baseline - Week 12) / Baseline * 100, with positive numbers to represent increases and negative numbers to represent decreases. Any missing values were not imputed; all available data is summarized.</description>

        <description>SEBs were defined as clinically diagnosed BCC 5 to 20 mm in diameter on the face, excluding the nose and periorbital skin, and 9 to 20 mm at sites other than the face. The percentage of tumors showing a complete or partial response at Week 12 was calculated as follows: (Number of baseline treatment-targeted SEBs showing complete or partial response at Week 12) / (Number of Baseline treatment-targeted SEBs) * 100. Missing values were not imputed.Complete Response is determined when there is no longer any visible evidence of a lesion consistent with BCC at the site, and Partial Response is determined when although a BCC still remains at this site, it has demonstrated a visible decrease in size compared with baseline.</description>

        <description>The ISGTA is a scale with scores ranging from 0 (clear), 1 (almost clear), 2 (minimal residual tumor), to 3 (clearly visible tumor). The Investigator assessed each Baseline treatment-targeted SEB at Weeks 2, 6, 8, 10, and 12. SEBs were defined as clinically diagnosed BCC 5 to 20 mm in diameter on the face, excluding the nose and periorbital skin, and 9 to 20 mm at sites other than the face. The percentage of Baseline treatment-targeted SEBs evaluated as being clear or almost clear at Week x (Week x = 2, 6, 8, 10, or 12) based on the ISGTA scale was calculated as follows: (Number of baseline treatment-targeted SEBs with ISGTA score of 0 or 1 at Week x) / (Number of Baseline treatment-targeted SEBs) * 100. Missing data were imputed using LOCF. The percentage of responders achieving clear (0) or almost clear (1) on the ISGTA scale are presented by Week.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Treatment-targeted SEBs Achieving Clear on the ISGTA Scale and BCC Not Present at Week 12</title>
        <description>The ISGTA is a scale with scores ranging from 0 (clear), 1 (almost clear), 2 (minimal residual tumor), to 3 (clearly visible tumor). The Investigator assessed each Baseline treatment-targeted SEB at Week 12. SEBs were defined as clinically diagnosed BCC 5 to 20 mm in diameter on the face, excluding the nose and periorbital skin, and 9 to 20 mm at sites other than the face. The percentage of Baseline treatment-targeted SEBs evaluated as being clear at Week 12 based on the ISGTA scale and BCC not present was calculated as follows: (Number of baseline treatment-targeted SEBs with ISGTA score of 0 and BCC not present at Week 12) / (Number of Baseline treatment-targeted SEBs) * 100.</description>
