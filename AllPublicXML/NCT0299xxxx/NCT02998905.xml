      To determine the feasibility of a controlled trial examining the efficacy and safety of
      non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) compared with ASA for stroke prevention
      in patients with a high-risk of atrial fibrillation and previous intracerebral hemorrhage.

    <textblock>
      The NASPAF-ICH study is an open-label, randomized, controlled, phase II study that will
      assess the feasibility of a controlled trial examining the efficacy and safety of non-vitamin
      K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) compared with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) for stroke
      prevention in patients with high-risk atrial fibrillation and previous intracerebral
      hemorrhage, as well as provide evidence of efficacy and safety for planning of a phase III
      trial. Recruitment will occur at 10 high-volume stroke research centres across Canada over 2
      years, at which 100 adult patients with high-risk atrial fibrillation (CHADS2 ≥2) and
      previous spontaneous or traumatic ICH (intraparenchymal or intraventricular hemorrhage while
      on or off anticoagulation) will be randomly assigned to receive a NOAC (particular agent at
      the discretion of the local investigator) or ASA 81 mg per day. Patients will be followed for
      a mean of 1 year to a common end-study date. The feasibility of recruitment will also be
      tested. The investigators estimate that five patients per year per centre can be recruited.
