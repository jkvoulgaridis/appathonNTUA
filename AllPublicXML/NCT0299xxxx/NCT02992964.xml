  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, multi-center, pilot study of Nivolumab in pediatric
      patients with recurrent or refractory hypermutant malignancies aged 12 months to 18 years of
      age. This study is to assess clinical and radiological benefits of treatment with Nivolumab
      in children with hypermutated cancers, including those with bMMRD syndrome. It is our
      expectation that patients with bMMRD syndrome will account for the majority of patients
      enrolled on this study.

             known curative therapy or therapy proven to prolong survival with an acceptable
             quality of life. Chemotherapy-naïve patients will be eligible in cases where
             first-line therapy does not include chemotherapy (e.g. surgery alone for management of

             who are up in a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing
             the performance score.

          8. Previous treatment: patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of
             all prior anti-cancer therapy.

               1. Myelosuppressive chemotherapy: at least 21 days after the last dose of
                  myelosuppressive chemotherapy (42 days if prior nitrosourea).

                  long-acting growth factor (e.g. Neulasta) or 7 days for short-acting growth
                  factor. For agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after
                  administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse
                  events are known to occur. The duration of this interval must be discussed with
                  the Study Chair or Co-Chair.

               3. Biologic (anti-neoplastic agent): at least 14 days after the last dose of a
                  biologic agent. For agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 14
                  days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during
                  which adverse events are known to occur. The duration of this interval must be
                  discussed with the Study Chair or Co-Chair.

               4. Monoclonal antibodies: at least three (3) half-lives of the antibody after the
                  last dose of a monoclonal antibody.

               5. Radiation Therapy (XRT): at least 14 days after local palliative XRT (small
                  port). At least 150 days must have elapsed if prior Total Body Irradiation,
                  craniospinal XRT or if ≥ 50% radiation of pelvis. At least 42 days must have
                  elapsed if other substantial BM radiation.

               6. Stem Cell Infusion without Total Body Irradiation (TBI): no evidence of active
                  graft vs. host disease and at least 56 days must have elapsed after transplant or
                  stem cell infusion. Patients with prior allogeneic transplants (including solid
                  organ) are not eligible.

          9. Organ Function Requirements:

             independent, defined as not receiving platelet transfusions for at least 7 days prior
             to enrollment.

             iii. Hemoglobin ≥ 90g/L (transfusion permitted). iv. Patients with known BM metastatic
             disease or haematological malignancies will be eligible for study provided they meet
             haematological criteria. These patients may receive transfusions (e.g. to achieve
             platelet threshold) provided they are not known to be refractory to platelet
             transfusions but will not be evaluable for hematologic toxicity.

             b. Adequate Renal Function Defined as: A serum creatinine based on age/gender as
             provided in Table 3 (see Section 4.2.2) c. Adequate Liver Function Defined as: i.
             Bilirubin (sum of conjugated + unconjugated or total bilirubin) ≤1.5x institutional
             upper limit of normal (ULN) for age (except for patients with Gilbert's Syndrome, when
             bilirubin of &lt; 51 µmol/L or 3.0 mg/dL is permitted).

             ii. ALT/AST:

        intolerance should be on a stable regiment and be monitored.

        10. For patients with brain tumors, debulking surgery prior to treatment with nivolumab
        should be considered when appropriate to reduce the risk of pseudoprogression-associated
        toxicities. Such debulking surgery is not mandatory for trial enrollment. Patients should
        be recovered from surgery and wait at least 7 days from surgery before first dose.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Part II Only

          1. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding and men who are sexually active with women of
             childbearing potential (WOCBP)* who are not willing to use effective contraception, or
             to practice abstinence if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for
             the patient. **

               -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women will not be entered on this study due to risks
                  of fetal and teratogenic adverse events as there is yet no available information
                  regarding human fetal or teratogenic toxicities.

               -  WOCBP must have a negative serum pregnancy test every 4 weeks. and During Part II
                  screening, WOCBP must have a negative serum pregnancy test. WOCBP must have a
                  negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent
                  units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the start of nivolumab administration.
                  WOCBP who are sexually active, must be willing to adhere to effective
                  contraception during treatment and for 5 months after the last dose of nivolumab.

               -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must be willing to adhere to effective
                  contraception during treatment and for 7 months after the last dose of nivolumab.

               1. Corticosteroids: Patients requiring systemic steroid therapy or any other form of
                  immunosuppressive therapy within seven (7) days prior to first dose of trial
                  therapy or while on trial are not eligible. The use of physiologic doses of
                  corticosteroids (up to 5mg/m2/day prednisone equivalent) is permitted following
                  discussion with the Study Chair or Co-Chair.

               2. Investigational Drugs: Patients who are currently receiving another
                  investigational drug are not eligible.

             (e.g. ANA, rheumatoid factor, altered thyroid function studies) will not render a
             patient ineligible in the absence of a diagnosis of an autoimmune disorder.
             Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin or physiologic corticosteroid replacement
             therapy) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.
