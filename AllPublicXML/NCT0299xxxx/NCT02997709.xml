  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men and nearly 30,000 men die from the
      disease each year. Not only is there significant mortality, there is considerable morbidity
      from primary and salvage therapies. Understanding which patients require intensified
      treatment, as well as those who may not, would improve outcomes on multiple levels. The
      cohort to be investigated will be composed of men diagnosed with prostate cancer who are
      planned to be treated with (i) external beam radiotherapy to the prostate (primary treatment)
      (ii) prostatectomy (added in amendment) or (iii) postoperative radiotherapy (adjuvant or
      salvage treatment post-prostatectomy). Adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy is defined as men
      having a PSA&lt;0.1 ng/mL and salvage postoperative radiotherapy as those having a PSA ≥0.1. The
      overarching objective of the CoMBINe trial is to identify pre-treatment and post-treatment
      prognostic and predictive factors derived from quantitative imaging prostate or prostate bed
      features, tumor tissue gene expression signatures, and circulating tumor cells (CTCs). The
      CoMBINe trial is a sister trial to another study, termed BLaStM (IRB# 20140627), in men who
      are candidates for primary radiotherapy. CoMBINe also allows for men with oligometastasis
      from prostate cancer who are treated to all sites of known disease by radiotherapy and/or
      surgery.

      Treatment: Prostatectomy, radiotherapy technique, radiotherapy dose, and the use of androgen
      deprivation therapy (ADT), are per the standard of care at the University of Miami, and are
      not specified in this protocol.

      Measurements: Prior to treatment and at 3 months, 9 months, and at 2.0-2.5 years after
      completion of all treatment, the patients will have blood drawn for CTCs and additional blood
      stored for future studies. Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI; depending on whether there was an
      index lesion) and potentially PET/CT (depending on wheter there was an index lesion and
      funding) will be done at these same time points. Health related quality of life is also being
      assessed at these time points.

      Overarching goal: To determine the relationships to quantitative imaging features (imaging
      biomarkers) to blood based biomarkers and tissue based gene expression marker/signatures, as
      well as to patient outcome.

    <description>Pre-Treatment and Post-Treatment quantitative imaging parameters will be associated with circulating tumor cell (CTC) changes over time in prostate cancer (PCa) patients who receive treatment with RT ± androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) or prostatectomy per standard of care. CTC and quantitative imaging changes will be determined at each of the planned research acquisition time points (8 days prior to completion of radiation therapy (RT), 3 months post-RT, 9 months post-RT, and 2-2.5 years post-treatment) comparing to the Baseline.</description>

    <description>CTC changes between baseline and 2-2.5 years will be compared with 2-2.5 year biopsy positivity status (positive vs. negative) for patients whose baseline and 2-2.5 year biopsy samples are available. CTC changes from two different time points will be tested for significance using t-test by 2-2.5 year biopsy positivity status.

    <description>Gene expression data obtained at baseline will be analyzed in order to investigate the relationship between the gene expression and the following: CTCs, mpMRI imaging parameters, histopathological tumor parameters, and biochemical/clinical failure.
CTC changes between baseline and 2-2.5 years will be compared with 2-2.5 year biopsy positivity status (positive vs. negative) for patients whose baseline and 2-2.5 year biopsy samples are available. CTC changes from two different time points will be tested for significance using t-test by 2-2.5 year biopsy positivity status. Changes in gene expression and imaging parameters will be analyzed in the same manner. Correlation structures between CTC and imaging parameters; CTC and gene expression; and imaging parameters and gene expression will be analyzed using linear mixed-effect model by 2-2.5 year biopsy positivity status.</description>

    <measure>Determination of the added value of PET/CT using newer tracers to MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>Between Baseline and 2-2.5 Years Post-RT</time_frame>
    <description>PET/CT using newer tracers (fluciclovine, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), or Choline) to MRI may add value in the above secondary analyses. The investigators hypothesize that targeted PET agents will enhance the rate of accuracy of mpMRI in establishing high risk areas in the prostate, prostate bed, and pelvic lymph nodes, as well as provide unique information on early metastatic disease.</description>

      Blood will be collected pre-RT and in post-RT follow-up for research. Plasma and serum, as
      well as red cells and lymphocytes (buffy coat) will be collected. The procedures will evolve
      with new developments, such as the ability to isolate viable CTCs for cell culture and gene
      expression analyses. Excess blood that is not processed for CTC or biomarkers will be stored
      for future research.

      Genomic studies, including genome-wide association studies (GWAS), will examine associations
      with health conditions are planned. Gene expression from mpMRI-defined high risk tumor
      regions will be related to pathologic parameters and RT response. Using a 1.4M marker
      oligonucleotide microarray that is essentially a whole transcriptome assay, selected pathways
      will be examined in pre-Tx biopsies.

               -  Extended ADT is defined as &gt;36 months (e.g., M1 patients).

          6. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤100 ng/mL within (+/-) 4 months of signing of
             consent. If PSA was above 100 and drops to &lt;100 with antibiotics, this is acceptable
             for enrollment.

          7. No previous pelvic radiotherapy.

          8. The ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document

             estimate Zubrod):

         10. Age ≥ 30 at signing of consent.

         11. Subjects must be planned to receive radiation therapy or to undergo prostatectomy.

         12. Subjects treated primarily with RT are recommended to have had an MUFgBx prior to
             radiation treatment.
