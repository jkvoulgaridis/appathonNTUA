  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 / Phase 2 study of newly diagnosed patients with biopsy-proven head and
      neck cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) who are undergoing standard radiation therapy and
      treatment with cisplatin. BMX-001 added to radiation therapy and cisplatin is expected to
      reduce radiation-induced mucositis and xerostomia and also has the potential to benefit the
      survival of head and neck cancer patients. In Phase 1, safety and tolerability of BMX-001
      will be assessed using a Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) and a maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) will be determined. BMX-001 will be given subcutaneously first with a loading dose zero
      to four days prior to the start of chemoradiation and followed by twice a week doses at
      one-half of the loading dose for the duration of radiation therapy plus two weeks. In Phase 2
      both safety and efficacy of BMX-001 will be evaluated. Impact on mucositis and xerostomia
      will also be assessed. A maximum of 48 patients will be enrolled to the MTD dose determined
      in Phase 1 to confirm the MTD. The investigators hypothesize that BMX-001 when added to
      standard radiation therapy and cisplatin will be safe at pharmacologically relevant doses in
      patients with newly diagnosed head and neck cancer. The investigators also hypothesize that
      in Phase 2 of this study the addition of BMX-001 will reduce the severity of
      radiation-induced mucositis and xerostomia in patients receiving head and neck radiation
      therapy.
