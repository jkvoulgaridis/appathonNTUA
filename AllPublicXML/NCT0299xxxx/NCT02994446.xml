        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Patient has recurrent, symptomatic, monomorphic VT

          2. Patient has drug refractory or drug intolerant VT following use of at least one Class
             III antiarrhythmic as demonstrated by a recurrent arrhythmia and is not a suitable
             candidate per the investigator's expert opinion for ongoing or alternative drug
             therapy

          3. A prior failed ablation as evidenced by ICD device therapy within the prior 6 months.

          4. Patient has minimum 3 month ICD interrogation history available for evaluation

          5. Patient has LVEF &gt; 20%, confirmed by echo or comparable technique during baseline
             evaluation

          6. Patient is at least 18 years old

          7. Patient has signed the informed consent, and is willing and able to participate in all
             study procedures and follow up requirements

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Patients with idiopathic VT

          2. Patients with VT with ECG or MRI/CT findings suggestive of right ventricular free wall
             origin findings.

          3. Patients with VTs of septal origin may be excluded as such ablations require special
             care to minimize the risk of heart block, particularly within 2 cm of the AV
             node/proximal conduction system. Patients requiring ablation at such locations should
             only be included when the arrhythmia itself is life-threatening or otherwise
             sufficiently severe to justify the risk.

          4. Patient with myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina within previous 60 days

          5. Patient with cardiac surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within
             previous 60 days

          6. Patient with class IV (NYHA) heart failure

          7. Patient with mechanical mitral valve, severe aortic stenosis or flail mitral leaflet

          8. Patient with left ventricular assist device planned or required for the procedure

          9. Patients with co-morbidities such that they have less than 1 year life expectancy

         10. Patient with significant intracardiac and/or laminated thrombus evident by
             transesophogeal echo (TEE) or transthoracic echo (TTE) (with contrast) within 2 days
             of the ablation procedure

         11. Patient with thrombocytopenia or other coagulopathy

         12. Women who are or may potentially be pregnant. (must be post-menopausal or have a
             negative pregnancy test)

         13. Patient with other acute illness or active systemic infection (unrelated to VT or its
             origin)

         14. Significant congenital anomaly heart disease or anomaly

         15. Allergy or contraindications to the medications/agents used during a standard
             ablation/EP intervention.

         16. Patient concurrently enrolled in any other investigational drug or device study that
             the investigator deems would interfere with study results.
