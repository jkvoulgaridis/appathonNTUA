      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate the benefit of isatuximab in combination with pomalidomide and low-dose
      dexamethasone in the prolongation of Progression Free Survival (PFS) as compared to
      pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone in participants with refractory or relapsed and
      refractory multiple myeloma (MM).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the Overall Response Rate (ORR) as per International Myeloma Working Group
           (IMWG) criteria in each arm.

        -  To compare the Overall Survival (OS) between the two arms.

        -  To evaluate the Time To Progression (TTP) in each arm.

        -  To evaluate the PFS in high risk cytogenetic population in each arm.

        -  To evaluate the Duration of Response (DOR) in each arm.

        -  To evaluate the safety in both treatment arms.

        -  To determine the Pharmacokinetic profile of isatuximab in combination with pomalidomide.

        -  To evaluate the immunogenicity of isatuximab.

        -  To assess disease-specific and generic health-related quality of life (HRQL), disease
           and treatment-related symptoms, health state utility, and health status.

      The duration of the study for the participants included a period for screening of up to 21
      days (or up to 28 days for women who can become pregnant). Participants continued study
      treatment until disease progression, unacceptable adverse reaction, participants' wish or
      other reason of discontinuation.

      During follow-up, participants who discontinued the study treatment due to progression of the
      disease were followed every 3 months (12 weeks) for survival (or until cut-off date), and
      participants who discontinued the study treatment prior to documentation of disease
      progression were followed-up every 4 weeks until disease progression, and then every 3 months
      (12 weeks) for survival (or until cut-off date).

          -  Age superior or equal to 18 years or country's legal age of majority if the legal age
             was superior to 18 years old.

          -  Participants had a documented diagnosis of multiple myeloma with evidence of
             measurable disease i.e. serum M protein superior or equal to 0.5 grams per decilitre
             (g/dL) measured using serum protein immunoelectrophoresis and or urine M protein
             superior or equal to 200 mg per 24 hours measured using urine protein
             immunoelectrophoresis.

          -  Participants had received at least 2 prior lines of anti-myeloma therapy, which must
             include at least 2 consecutive cycles of lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor
             (bortezomib, carfilzomib or ixazomib) given alone or in combination.

          -  Participants had failed treatment with lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor
             (bortezomib, carfilzomib, or ixazomib) alone or in combination (Intolerant,
             progression within 6 months after reaching Partial Response or better).

          -  Participants had progressed on or within 60 days after end of previous therapy before
             to study entry, i.e., refractory to the last line of treatment.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Primary refractory multiple myeloma defined as participants who had never achieved at
             least a minimal response (MR) with any treatment during the disease course.

          -  Free Light Chain measurable disease only.

          -  Prior therapy with pomalidomide.

          -  Any anti-myeloma drug treatment within 14 days before randomization, including
             dexamethasone.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status superior to 2.

          -  Platelets inferior to 75 000 cells per microliter (mcL) if inferior to 50% of bone
             marrow (BM) nucleated cells are plasma cells, and inferior to 30 000 cells per mcL if
             superior or equal to 50% of BM nucleated cells are plasma cells. Platelet transfusion
             was not allowed within three days before the screening visit.

          -  Absolute neutrophil count inferior to 1000 per mcL (1 x 10^9/L).

          -  Creatinine clearance inferior to 30 mL per minute (Modification of Diet in Renal
             Disease [MDRD] Formula).

          -  Total bilirubin superior to 2 x ULN (Upper Limit of Normal).

          -  Corrected serum calcium superior to 14 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) (superior to
             3.5 millimoles per liter (mmol/L).

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) superior to 3 x
             ULN.

          -  Hypersensitivity to immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) (thalidomide or lenalidomide)
             defined as any hypersensitivity reaction leading to stop IMiDs within the 2 first
             cycles or toxicity, which does meet intolerance definition.

          -  Hypersensitivity to dexamethasone, sucrose histidine (as base and hydrochloride salt),
             and polysorbate 80 or any of the components of study therapy that are not amenable to
             premedication with steroids, or H2 blockers that would prohibit further treatment with
             these agents.

          -  Significant cardiac dysfunction; myocardial infarction within 12 months; unstable,
             poorly controlled angina pectoris.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding woman or female who intends to become pregnant during the
             participation in the study.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 102 sites in 24 countries. A total of 387 participants were screened between 22 December 2016 and 01 February 2018. Out of which, 307 participants were randomized in 1:1 ratio to IPd (Isatuximab + Pomalidomide + Dexamethasone) and Pd (Pomalidomide + Dexamethasone) arms using an interactive response technology (IRT).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Randomization was stratified by age (less than [&lt;] 75 years versus greater than and equal to [&gt;=] 75 years) and number of previous lines of therapy (2 or 3 versus more than 3). Results are reported based on the primary completion date of 22 November 2018.</pre_assignment_details>

If progression or death was not observed, participant was censored at date of last progression-free tumor assessment prior to study cut-off date. Analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method. PD as per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria was defined as increase of &gt;=25% from lowest confirmed value in any one of the following criteria: serum M-protein (the absolute increase must be &gt;=0.5gram(g)/dL), serum M-protein increase &gt;=1g/dL if lowest M component was &gt;=5g/dL; urine M-component (absolute increase must be &gt;=200mg/24hour), appearance of new lesion(s),&gt;=50% increase from nadir in sum of the products of the maximal perpendicular diameters of measured lesions (SPD) of &gt;1 lesion, or &gt;=50% increase in the longest diameter of a previous lesion &gt;1 centimeter in short axis.</description>

          <title>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</title>
          <description>PFS:time from date of randomization to date of first documentation of progressive disease (PD) determined by Independent Response Committee (IRC) or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first. If progression or death was not observed, participant was censored at date of last progression-free tumor assessment prior to study cut-off date. Analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method. PD as per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria was defined as increase of &gt;=25% from lowest confirmed value in any one of the following criteria: serum M-protein (the absolute increase must be &gt;=0.5gram(g)/dL), serum M-protein increase &gt;=1g/dL if lowest M component was &gt;=5g/dL; urine M-component (absolute increase must be &gt;=200mg/24hour), appearance of new lesion(s),&gt;=50% increase from nadir in sum of the products of the maximal perpendicular diameters of measured lesions (SPD) of &gt;1 lesion, or &gt;=50% increase in the longest diameter of a previous lesion &gt;1 centimeter in short axis.</description>

        <description>EORTC-Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 is a cancer-specific instrument with 30 questions for evaluation of new chemotherapy and provides an assessment of participant reported outcome dimensions. EORTC QLQ-C30 included GHS/ QOL, functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, social), symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting), and 6 single items (dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties). Most questions from QLQ-C30 were a 4-point scale (1/Not at All to 4/Very Much), except Items 29-30, which comprise GHS scale and were a 7-point scale (1/Very Poor to 7/Excellent). Answers were converted into grading scale, with values between 0 and 100. A high score represented a favorable outcome with a best quality of life for participant.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Multiple Myeloma Specific Module With 20 Items (EORTC QLQ-MY20): Disease Symptoms Domain Score</title>
        <description>EORTC QLQ-MY20 is a validated questionnaire to assess the overall quality of life in participants with multiple myeloma. Disease symptoms domain is one of the four domain scores. Disease symptoms domain score used 4-point scale (1 'Not at All' to 4 'Very Much'). Scores are averaged, and transformed to 0 -100 scale, where higher scores = more symptoms and lower health-related quality of life (HRQL) and lower score = less symptoms and more HRQL</description>

        <population>Analysis was performed on safety population evaluable for disease symptoms. Here, ‘Number analyzed’ = participants with available data for each specified category.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in European Quality of Life Working Group Health Status Measure 5 Dimensions (5D), 5 Levels (5L) (EQ-5D-5L) Score: Health State Utility Index Value</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized measure of health status that provides a general assessment of health and wellbeing. The EQ-5D descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has a 5-level response: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. Response options are measured with a 5-point Likert scale (for the 5L version). The 5D-5L systems are converted into a single index utility score between 0 to 1, where higher score indicates a better health state and lower score indicate worse health state.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in European Quality of Life Working Group Health Status Measure 5 Dimensions, 5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) Score: Visual Analogic Scale (VAS)</title>
        <description>EQ-5D-5L is a standardized, participant-rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life. The EQ-5D-5L includes 2 components: the EQ-5D-5L health state utility index (descriptive system) and the EQ-5D-5L Visual Analog Scale. The Visual Analogue Scale is designed to rate the participant's current health state on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst imaginable health state and 100 represents the best imaginable health state.</description>

        <title>Time to Best Response (TTBR)</title>
        <description>TTBR was defined as the time from randomization to the date of first occurrence of IRC determined BOR (PR or better) that was subsequently confirmed. PR was defined as &gt;=50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24 hours urinary M-protein by &gt;=90% or to &lt;200 mg/24 h. In addition to the above listed criteria, if present at baseline, a &gt;=50% reduction in the size (SPD) of soft tissue plasmacytomas was also required. BOR was defined as the best sequential response, using the IRC's assessment of response, from the start of treatment until disease progression (provided that the progression is subsequently confirmed in case of progression requiring confirmation), death, initiation of further anti-myeloma treatment, or cut-off date, whichever occurs first.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)</title>
        <description>MRD was assessed by next-generation sequencing in bone marrow samples from participants who achieved CR, to determine the depth of response at the molecular level. IMWG criteria for CR: Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine, disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas, and &lt;5% plasma cells in bone marrow aspirates. MRD was classified as positive or negative at the minimum sensitivity of 1 in 10^5 nucleated cells. MRD negativity was defined as the absence of the dominant clonotype sequence(s) identified in the bone marrow aspirate collected at screening. MRD positivity was defined as the presence of the dominant clonotype sequence(s) identified in the bone marrow aspirate collected at screening.</description>
