  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the current study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of nintedanib over 52
      weeks in patients with Progressive Fibrosing Interstitial Lung Disease (PF-ILD) defined as
      patients who present with features of diffuse fibrosing lung disease of &gt;10% extent on
      high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and whose lung function and respiratory symptoms
      or chest imaging have worsened despite treatment with unapproved medications used in clinical
      practice to treat ILD. There is currently no efficacious treatment available for PF-ILD.
      Based on its efficacy and safety in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), it is anticipated
      that Nintedanib will be a new treatment option for patients with PF-ILD.

    <measure>Annual Rate of Decline in Forced Vital Capacity - Overall Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 52 weeks after first drug intake (planned post-baseline visits)</time_frame>
    <description>Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) is the volume of air (measured in milliliter) which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible. Overall population consists of all randomized participants with HRCT fibrotic pattern=UIP-like fibrotic pattern only or HRCT fibrotic pattern= Other fibrotic patterns. Annual rate of decline in Forced Vital Capacity in milliliter (mL) per year in the overall population is based on a random coefficient regression with fixed effects for treatment, HRCT fibrotic pattern, and baseline FVC [mL], and including treatment−by−time and baseline−by−time interactions. Within−participant errors are modelled by an unstructured variance−covariance matrix.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 12, 24, 36, 52 weeks after first drug intake (planned post-baseline visits)</time_frame>
    <description>King's Brief Interstitial Lung Disease questionnaire (K-BILD) consists of 15 items and 3 domains: breathlessness and activities, psychological, and chest symptoms. Possible score ranges from 0-100, score of 100 representing the best health status. If missing items were &gt;50% per domain, the domain score was set to missing. If any of the domain scores were missing, the total score was set to missing. Absolute change from baseline in K-BILD Total score at week 52 in the overall population was based on a Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM), with fixed effects for baseline K-BILD Total score, HRCT fibrotic pattern, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, baseline-by-visit interactions and random effect for participant. Visit was the repeated measure. Within-participant errors were modelled by unstructured variance-covariance matrix.</description>

    <description>Living with Pulmonary Fibrosis (L-PF) questionnaire is a 44 item questionnaire with two modules Symptoms (23 items) and Impacts (21 items) where the symptoms module yields three domain scores dyspnea, cough and fatigue as well as a total symptoms score (impacts module yields a single impacts score). L-PF Symptoms dyspnea domain score (dyspnea score) ranges from 0-100, the higher the score the greater the impairment. If missing items were ≥50 % within a score, then the corresponding score was set to missing. Absolute change from baseline in dyspnea score at week 52 is based on a Mixed Model Repeated Measures, with fixed effects for baseline dyspnea score, HRCT fibrotic pattern, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, baseline dyspnea score-by-visit interaction and random effect for participant, visit as repeated measure. The Adjusted mean is based on all analysed participants in the model (not only participants with a baseline and measurement at week 52).</description>

             parameters that are found to be abnormal at Visit 1 are allowed to be re-tested (once)
             if it is thought to be a measurement error (i.e. there was no abnormal result of this
             test in the recent history of the patient and there is no related clinical sign) or
             the result of a temporary and reversible medical condition, once that condition is

        <title>Annual Rate of Decline in Forced Vital Capacity - Overall Population</title>
        <description>Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) is the volume of air (measured in milliliter) which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible. Overall population consists of all randomized participants with HRCT fibrotic pattern=UIP-like fibrotic pattern only or HRCT fibrotic pattern= Other fibrotic patterns. Annual rate of decline in Forced Vital Capacity in milliliter (mL) per year in the overall population is based on a random coefficient regression with fixed effects for treatment, HRCT fibrotic pattern, and baseline FVC [mL], and including treatment−by−time and baseline−by−time interactions. Within−participant errors are modelled by an unstructured variance−covariance matrix.</description>

If any of the domain scores were missing, the total score was set to missing. Absolute change from baseline in K-BILD Total score at week 52 in participants with HRCT fibrotic pattern=UIP-like fibrotic pattern only was based on a Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM), with fixed effects for baseline K-BILD Total score, HRCT fibrotic pattern, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, baseline-by-visit interactions and random effect for participant. Visit was the repeated measure. Within-participant errors were modelled by unstructured variance-covariance matrix.</description>

        <title>Time to Progression or Death Over 52 Weeks - Overall Population</title>
        <description>Time to progression or death over 52 weeks is defined as the time from date of first drug intake to date of progression, or date of death (from any cause) if a participant died earlier. Participants with no event (progression or death from any cause) or unknown status were censored. Date of progression is defined as the date when ≥ 10% of absolute decline in FVC percent predicted compared to baseline occured for the first time. Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) is the volume of air (measured in milliliter) which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible. Predicted normal values of FVC were calculated according to the Global Lung Initiative. FVC percent predicted (FVC % pred) is the FVC divided by its predicted value in percent.</description>

        <title>Absolute Change From Baseline in Living With Pulmonary Fibrosis (L-PF) Symptoms Dyspnea Domain Score at Week 52 - Overall Population</title>
        <description>Living with Pulmonary Fibrosis (L-PF) questionnaire is a 44 item questionnaire with two modules Symptoms (23 items) and Impacts (21 items) where the symptoms module yields three domain scores dyspnea, cough and fatigue as well as a total symptoms score (impacts module yields a single impacts score). L-PF Symptoms dyspnea domain score (dyspnea score) ranges from 0-100, the higher the score the greater the impairment. If missing items were ≥50 % within a score, then the corresponding score was set to missing. Absolute change from baseline in dyspnea score at week 52 is based on a Mixed Model Repeated Measures, with fixed effects for baseline dyspnea score, HRCT fibrotic pattern, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, baseline dyspnea score-by-visit interaction and random effect for participant, visit as repeated measure. The Adjusted mean is based on all analysed participants in the model (not only participants with a baseline and measurement at week 52).</description>

          <title>Absolute Change From Baseline in Living With Pulmonary Fibrosis (L-PF) Symptoms Dyspnea Domain Score at Week 52 - Overall Population</title>
          <description>Living with Pulmonary Fibrosis (L-PF) questionnaire is a 44 item questionnaire with two modules Symptoms (23 items) and Impacts (21 items) where the symptoms module yields three domain scores dyspnea, cough and fatigue as well as a total symptoms score (impacts module yields a single impacts score). L-PF Symptoms dyspnea domain score (dyspnea score) ranges from 0-100, the higher the score the greater the impairment. If missing items were ≥50 % within a score, then the corresponding score was set to missing. Absolute change from baseline in dyspnea score at week 52 is based on a Mixed Model Repeated Measures, with fixed effects for baseline dyspnea score, HRCT fibrotic pattern, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, baseline dyspnea score-by-visit interaction and random effect for participant, visit as repeated measure. The Adjusted mean is based on all analysed participants in the model (not only participants with a baseline and measurement at week 52).</description>
