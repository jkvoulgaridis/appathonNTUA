    <measure>Number of Participants With Clinical Resolution Among Who Received SHP640 or Placebo on Day 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 6</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical resolution of adenoviral conjunctivitis was defined as the absence (score=0) of bulbar conjunctival injection and watery conjunctival discharge in the study eye. The study eye was defined based on participant's bulbar conjunctival redness and watery conjunctival discharge scores at baseline as well as his/her cell culture-immunofluorescence assay (CC-IFA) results at baseline. Bulbar conjunctival injection was assessed based on a 0 (Normal conjunctival vascular pattern)-4 (Markedly prominent, intense diffuse hyperemia) scale which used pictures from the validated bulbar redness (VBR) scale. Watery conjunctival discharge was assessed based on a 0-3 scale (0 - None and 3 - Severe: Abundant quantity of watery discharge observed in the lower conjunctival fornix and in the lower lid margin). Higher score represent worse symptoms for both scores. Data analysis was performed in SHP640 and placebo reporting groups only but not in PVP-I 0.6%.</description>

        <description>Clinical resolution of adenoviral conjunctivitis was defined as the absence (score=0) of bulbar conjunctival injection and watery conjunctival discharge in the study eye. The study eye was defined based on participant's bulbar conjunctival redness and watery conjunctival discharge scores at baseline as well as his/her cell culture-immunofluorescence assay (CC-IFA) results at baseline. Bulbar conjunctival injection was assessed based on a 0 (Normal conjunctival vascular pattern)-4 (Markedly prominent, intense diffuse hyperemia) scale which used pictures from the validated bulbar redness (VBR) scale. Watery conjunctival discharge was assessed based on a 0-3 scale (0 - None and 3 - Severe: Abundant quantity of watery discharge observed in the lower conjunctival fornix and in the lower lid margin). Higher score represent worse symptoms for both scores. Data analysis was performed in SHP640 and placebo reporting groups only but not in PVP-I 0.6%.</description>

        <description>Clinical resolution of adenoviral conjunctivitis was defined as the absence (score=0) of bulbar conjunctival injection and watery conjunctival discharge in the study eye. The study eye was defined based on participant's bulbar conjunctival redness and watery conjunctival discharge scores at baseline as well as his/her CC-IFA results at baseline. Bulbar conjunctival injection was assessed based on a 0 (Normal conjunctival vascular pattern)-4 (Markedly prominent, intense diffuse hyperemia) scale which used pictures from the validated bulbar redness (VBR) scale. Watery conjunctival discharge was assessed based on a 0-3 scale (0 - None and 3 - Severe: Abundant quantity of watery discharge observed in the lower conjunctival fornix and in the lower lid margin). Higher score represent worse symptoms for both scores.</description>

          <description>Expanded clinical resolution was defined as a global clinical score of 0, 1, or 2 with neither injection nor discharge having a score of 2. Global clinical score was the sum of bulbar conjunctival injection and watery conjunctival discharge. The study eye was defined based on participants bulbar conjunctival redness and watery conjunctival discharge scores at baseline as well as his/her CC-IFA results at baseline.</description>
