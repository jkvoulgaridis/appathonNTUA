    <textblock>
      The Dose response of three experimental toothpastes (test product 1, test product 2 and test
      product 3) to remove plaque after a single brushing, compared to a positive control and
      negative control dentifrice will be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single centre, controlled, examiner blind, five treatment, five period,
      crossover design study in healthy participants. This study will evaluate the dose response of
      three experimental toothpastes (test product 1, test product 2 and test product 3) to remove
      plaque after a single brushing, compared to a positive control and negative control
      dentifrice. Plaque removal efficacy will be measured by Turesky modification of Quigley Hein
      Plaque Index (TPI).

    <description>The dental examiner used Turesky Modification of the Quigley Hein Index to assess plaque on all gradable teeth.Overall plaque scores were calculated taking average over all tooth sites for participant.Plaque was first disclosed using dye solution followed by disclosing solution.They expectorated and rinsed with 10 milliliters (mL) water for 10 seconds (sec),expectorated again. Plaque was assessed with each tooth being divided into 6 areas including mesiofacial,facial,distofacial,mesiolingual,lingual,distolingual surfaces.Disclosed plaque was scored for each tooth surface separately as:0 No plaque;1 Slight flecks of plaque at cervical margin of the tooth;2 A thin continuous band of plaque(1 mm or smaller) at cervical margin of tooth;3 A band of plaque wider than 1 mm but covering less than 1/3 of the crown of tooth;4 Plaque covering at least 1/3 but less than 2/3 of crown of tooth;5 Plaque covering 2/3 or more of crown of tooth. Score range 0-5.Lower scores indicate less plaque area.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (Pre-brushing) After a Single Brushing Treatment (Post-brushing) Turesky Modification of Quigley Hein Plaque Index (TPI), Positive Control Versus [vs.] Negative Control</title>
        <description>The dental examiner used Turesky Modification of the Quigley Hein Index to assess plaque on all gradable teeth.Overall plaque scores were calculated taking average over all tooth sites for participant.Plaque was first disclosed using dye solution followed by disclosing solution.They expectorated and rinsed with 10 milliliters (mL) water for 10 seconds (sec),expectorated again. Plaque was assessed with each tooth being divided into 6 areas including mesiofacial,facial,distofacial,mesiolingual,lingual,distolingual surfaces.Disclosed plaque was scored for each tooth surface separately as:0 No plaque;1 Slight flecks of plaque at cervical margin of the tooth;2 A thin continuous band of plaque(1 mm or smaller) at cervical margin of tooth;3 A band of plaque wider than 1 mm but covering less than 1/3 of the crown of tooth;4 Plaque covering at least 1/3 but less than 2/3 of crown of tooth;5 Plaque covering 2/3 or more of crown of tooth. Score range 0-5.Lower scores indicate less plaque area.</description>

        <population>Intent to treat (ITT) population was the primary population of analysis. The ITT population was defined as those participants who were randomized, received at least one dose of study product and had at least one post-baseline efficacy measurement.</population>
