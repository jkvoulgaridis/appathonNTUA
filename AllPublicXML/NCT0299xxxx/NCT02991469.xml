      Primary Objective:

      To describe the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of sarilumab in patients aged 1-17 years with
      Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (sJIA) in order to identify the dose and regimen for
      adequate treatment of this population.

      Secondary Objective:

      To describe the pharmacodynamics (PD) profile, the efficacy, and the long term safety of
      sarilumab in patients with sJIA.
