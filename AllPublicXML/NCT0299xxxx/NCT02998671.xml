  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed primarily to assess preliminary efficacy and safety of CJM112 in
      patients with moderate to severe inflammatory acne and to determine if CJM112 has an adequate
      clinical profile for further clinical development. In addition, sustainability of response
      and dose relationship were to be explored.
