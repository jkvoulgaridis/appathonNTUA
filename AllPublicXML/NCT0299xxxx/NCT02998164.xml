  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of using augmentative and alternative communication (AAC)
      technology for enhancing language development in children who are deaf or hard of hearing.
      Half of the participants will receive AAC technology with their speech and language therapy
      and half will continue with their usual care models.
