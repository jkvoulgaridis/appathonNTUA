  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-institutional, consortium-based, non-interventional prospective blinded
      endpoints clinical study to determine whether high activity of Cytochrome C Oxidase (CcO) in
      tumor specimens from subjects with newly diagnosed primary GBM is associated with shortened
      OS (primary outcome) and PFS (secondary outcome) times.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Biomarker trial is designed to prospectively evaluate the hypothesis that the overall
      survival (OS) time of a subject with newly diagnosed primary GBM tumors, treated by standard
      of care (SOC), is a function of the CcO enzymatic activity in the tumor (OS; time interval
      from date of first diagnosis to death from any cause, irrespective of post-SOC therapies,
      assessed up to 24 months from accrual). In particular, tumors with high CcO activity are
      associated with shorter OS time as compared to tumors with low CcO activity. SOC consists of
      post-surgical radiation therapy with concurrent Temozolomide followed by up to 12 cycles of
      adjuvant Temozolomide.

      Additional outcomes are to study the relation between CcO activity in the GBM tumors and
      progression free survival times (PFS; time intervals from dates of diagnosis to documented
      disease progression by MRI or tumor-related death) and, to compare the prognostic abilities
      of CcO activity to other frequently used biomarkers, namely the methylation status of
      O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), on OS and PFS.

      Tumor tissue will be submitted by participating centers for measurements of the CcO/Citrate
      Synthase (CS), MGMT promoter methylation. The subjects will agree to receive the SOC
      treatment. The therapeutic option at the time of first recurrence is at the discretion of the
      treating physician. PFS and OS times will be compared with high vs. low CcO activity and with
      the MGMT methylation status of the tumor. At the time of death or at 24 months s/p enrollment
      (whichever comes first), the site PI will complete an exit form documenting the details of
      enrollees' treatment history and date(s) of any tumor progression.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Willingness and ability to provide written informed consent and to comply with the
             study protocol as judged by Physician interview (NOTE: This could be patient's
             Neurosurgeon, Neuro-Oncologist or Study Investigator). If patient lacks capacity to
             consent, a legally authorized representative is allowed to provide written informed
             consent.

          2. Age ≥ 21 years

          3. Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥ 60.

          4. Subjects' planned upfront treatment to be standard of care treatment with radiotherapy
             and temozolomide (i.e. TEMODAR) for histologically confirmed GBM at initial diagnosis

          5. No history of other malignancies except adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer,
             curatively treated in situ cancer of the cervix, or other curatively treated solid
             tumors with no evidence of disease for at least 5 years.

          6. No serious active infection (e.g., wound infection requiring parenteral antibiotics)
             or other serious underlying medical conditions that in the opinion of the investigator
             would compromise standard of care treatment.

          7. No other condition (e.g., psychological or geographical) that would preclude study
             compliance.

          8. An MRI that is consistent with a primary malignant glioma

          9. Histologically confirmed newly diagnosed primary GBM before treatment using World
             Health Organization (WHO) classification criteria (A local pathology report
             constitutes adequate documentation of histology for initial study enrollment, however
             central pathology review will be required to confirm the diagnosis of GBM for final
             data analysis).

         10. Viability of tumor tissue representative of GBM ≥ 70 mg, snap-frozen within 30 minutes
             of resection, 10 minutes or less at room temperature.

         11. All subjects must have received maximal safe resection followed by standard radiation
             therapy with concomitant Temozolomide taken during the course of radiation therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion criteria are proposed that will exclude subjects with pre-existing co-morbidities
        that could contribute to pre-mature death (e.g., significant cardiovascular history), with
        non-included pretreated tumors occupying either intracranial and extra-axial space,
        significantly impaired neurological performance status (e.g., KPS&gt;60), with glial tumors
        that are genomically distinct from primary GBM tumors (e.g., gliomas arising from a
        previously diagnosed lower grade than GBM) or those unable to complete the fundamental
        requirements of the study.

          1. Inability to fulfill the requirements of the protocol

          2. Secondary GBM or other gliomas.

          3. History of sensitivity to Temozolomide.

          4. Planned upfront treatment with any anti-angiogenic agent targeting the (vascular
             endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway including but not limited to bevacizumab,
             cediranib, vandetanib, sunitinib, pazopanib, aflibercept, or sorafenib or any
             immunotherapy regimen.

          5. Any severe post-operative infection or other complications that may significantly
             delay the initiation of brain tumor therapy, or other conditions that, in the opinion
             of the investigator, would compromise the subject's ability to participate in the
             study.

        Note: Use of Gliadel wafers, in combination with surgical resection, is allowed if the
        patient is to follow standard-of-care treatment post-operatively (i.e., radiation therapy
        with temozolomide). Use of Gliadel wafers during surgery with only radiation therapy
        post-operatively is excluded (i.e., omitting temozolomide).
