  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection that can cause cancer
      (anal, penile, oropharyngeal) and genital warts in men. Due to their sexual practices (e.g.,
      receptive anal intercourse), men who have sex with men (MSM) are at particularly high risk
      for HPV infection and are disproportionately affected by HPV-related cancers. A safe and
      effective vaccine is available to prevent HPV infection, yet HPV vaccination rates in the
      U.S. have been low, particularly among males. To remedy this gap, the goal of this study is
      to develop and pilot test a text messaging intervention to increase HPV vaccination in young
      MSM.

      The study has two specific aims:

        1. Develop, iteratively refine, and pre-test messages using a formative research procedure
           for designing targeted health interventions. The procedure consists of the following
           steps: 1) conduct online focus groups, an online survey, and in-depth interviews to
           inform message content, 2) draft initial messages based on focus group findings and
           pilot data, 3) refine message content and assess acceptability using content advisory
           teams, 4) conduct internal alpha testing to ensure software functionality, and 5) beta
           test the protocol.

        2. Test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the txt2protect (t2p)
           text messaging intervention in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). To achieve
           this aim, 460 unvaccinated MSM (ages 18-25) who live in the Chicago metro area will be
           randomly assigned to the treatment (t2p) or control condition. The treatment condition
           will receive a culturally appropriate text messaging-based HPV vaccination intervention
           based on the Information, Motivation, and Behavioral Skills model, whereas the control
           condition will receive a text messaging-based sexual health intervention that includes
           basic facts about HPV vaccination readily accessible online.

      Primary outcome measures include intervention feasibility (e.g., retention in the trial),
      acceptability (satisfaction with the intervention), and preliminary efficacy as determined by
      initiation (receipt of the first dose) and completion of the 3-dose HPV vaccine series at the
      end of the 9-month trial.

      The study team hypothesizes that participants in the t2p condition (vs. control) will report
      greater acceptability of the intervention and will be significantly more likely to initiate
      and complete the 3-dose HPV vaccine series by the end of the trial.

    <time_frame>9 Month</time_frame>
    <description>Intervention feasibility will be evaluated by retention in the RCT. The retention rate will be computed at the end of the 9-month trial by dividing the total number of participants who completed the trial (i.e., completed the 9-month assessment) by the total number of participants who were randomized to the treatment or control condition at the beginning of the trial. An 80% 9-month retention rate will be used to indicate a feasible intervention.</description>

    <measure>Intervention Acceptability for Phase 1</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Intervention acceptability for the first 3 weeks of the intervention (Phase 1) will be assessed at the 3-week assessment. The scale includes both open-ended (&quot;What did you like about the program? What could be improved?&quot;) and 12 closed-ended questions (e.g., &quot;I would recommend a program like this to my friends&quot; 1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree). Closed-ended items were combined to compute an average score (minimum value = 1; maximum value = 5). Higher scores indicate greater satisfaction with the program. An average score ≥4 will be used to indicate an acceptable intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Intervention Acceptability for Full Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>9 Month</time_frame>
    <description>Intervention acceptability for the full intervention will be assessed at the end the 9-month trial. The scale includes both open-ended (&quot;What did you like about the program? What could be improved?&quot;) and 11 closed-ended questions (e.g., &quot;I would recommend a program like this to my friends&quot; 1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree). Closed-ended items will be combined to compute an average score (minimum value = 1; maximum value = 5). Higher scores indicate greater satisfaction with the program.

    <time_frame>9 Month</time_frame>
    <description>A final confirmatory assessment of HPV vaccination status will be conducted at the 9-month follow-up. Participants will be asked whether they received any doses of HPV vaccine (yes/no) since baseline and if yes, the number of doses and received. Vaccination status will be confirmed by consulting the Illinois Comprehensive Automated Immunization Registry (I-CARE). HPV vaccine initiation was defined as receipt of one or more doses of HPV vaccine by the end of the 9-month trial.</description>

    <ipd_description>The PI agrees to develop a de-identified database, codebook, and mechanism by which IPD could be shared with other investigators upon approval of the PI. Data will be available for request approximately 6 months after completion of the project. Interested investigators will be asked to complete a standardized request form stating the specific aims of the analysis, the analytic plans, resources the requestors have to carry out the project, the proposed timeline, and distribution goals (manuscripts and/or grant application). The PI will review these requests to determine whether the proposed analyses constitute an innovative and significant exploration of the data, whether the proposed team has sufficient resources to undertake the request, how data will be protected/managed, and whether there are sufficient resources to honor the request. If any of these issues are problematic, the PI will attempt to negotiate a fair resolution with the interested parties and/or with NIH program staff.</ipd_description>

          <description>Content was delivered in 2 phases over 36 weeks. During Phase 1 (weeks 1-3), participants received 10-12 messages daily. During Phase 2 (weeks 4-36), message frequency decreased to monthly messages. Phase 1 content was presented in 3 modules; however, unlike the treatment group, content was topic-based rather than theory-based and focused on general sexual health. Module 1 addressed basic facts about HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STI), including HPV. Module 2 addressed HIV/STI prevention (e.g., condom use, PrEP) and will included basic facts about HPV vaccination currently available online. Module 3 addressed tips for healthy relationships. Phase 2 “booster” messages largely reinforced Phase 1 content to foster continued engagement with the program.

        <description>Intervention feasibility will be evaluated by retention in the RCT. The retention rate will be computed at the end of the 9-month trial by dividing the total number of participants who completed the trial (i.e., completed the 9-month assessment) by the total number of participants who were randomized to the treatment or control condition at the beginning of the trial. An 80% 9-month retention rate will be used to indicate a feasible intervention.</description>

One of the three participants who withdrew provided permission to use include his data up until his withdrawal in month 3 and thus this participant was included in the primary analysis.</population>

            <description>Content was delivered in 2 phases over 36 weeks. During Phase 1 (weeks 1-3), participants received 10-12 messages daily. During Phase 2 (weeks 4-36), message frequency decreased to monthly messages. Phase 1 content was presented in 3 modules; however, unlike the treatment group, content was topic-based rather than theory-based and focused on general sexual health. Module 1 addressed basic facts about HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STI), including HPV. Module 2 addressed HIV/STI prevention (e.g., condom use, PrEP) and will included basic facts about HPV vaccination currently available online. Module 3 addressed tips for healthy relationships. Phase 2 “booster” messages largely reinforced Phase 1 content to foster continued engagement with the program.

          <title>Retention</title>
          <description>Intervention feasibility will be evaluated by retention in the RCT. The retention rate will be computed at the end of the 9-month trial by dividing the total number of participants who completed the trial (i.e., completed the 9-month assessment) by the total number of participants who were randomized to the treatment or control condition at the beginning of the trial. An 80% 9-month retention rate will be used to indicate a feasible intervention.</description>
          <population>A total of 150 participants were randomized. Three participants, all of whom were in the txt2protect arm, withdrew from the study. One of the three participants who withdrew provided permission to use include his data up until his withdrawal in month 3 and thus this participant was included in the primary analysis.</population>

Module 2 addressed motivation to receive HPV vaccine. Module 3 addressed behavioral skills and self-efficacy for initiating and completing the 3-dose series (e.g., talking with their doctor about the vaccine). Phase 2 “booster” messages largely reinforced Phase 1 content to foster continued engagement with the program.

During Phase 2 (weeks 4-36), message frequency decreased to monthly messages. Phase 1 content was presented in 3 modules; however, unlike the treatment group, content was topic-based rather than theory-based and focused on general sexual health. Module 1 addressed basic facts about HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STI), including HPV. Module 2 addressed HIV/STI prevention (e.g., condom use, PrEP) and will included basic facts about HPV vaccination currently available online. Module 3 addressed tips for healthy relationships. Phase 2 “booster” messages largely reinforced Phase 1 content to foster continued engagement with the program.

            <description>Content was delivered in 2 phases over 36 weeks. During Phase 1 (weeks 1-3), participants received 10-12 messages daily. During Phase 2 (weeks 4-36), message frequency decreased to monthly messages. Phase 1 content was presented in 3 modules; however, unlike the treatment group, content was topic-based rather than theory-based and focused on general sexual health. Module 1 addressed basic facts about HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STI), including HPV. Module 2 addressed HIV/STI prevention (e.g., condom use, PrEP) and will included basic facts about HPV vaccination currently available online. Module 3 addressed tips for healthy relationships. Phase 2 “booster” messages largely reinforced Phase 1 content to foster continued engagement with the program.

Phase 2 “booster” messages largely reinforced Phase 1 content to foster continued engagement with the program.

          <description>Content was delivered in 2 phases over 36 weeks. During Phase 1 (weeks 1-3), participants received 10-12 messages daily. During Phase 2 (weeks 4-36), message frequency decreased to monthly messages. Phase 1 content was presented in 3 modules; however, unlike the treatment group, content was topic-based rather than theory-based and focused on general sexual health. Module 1 addressed basic facts about HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STI), including HPV. Module 2 addressed HIV/STI prevention (e.g., condom use, PrEP) and will included basic facts about HPV vaccination currently available online. Module 3 addressed tips for healthy relationships. Phase 2 “booster” messages largely reinforced Phase 1 content to foster continued engagement with the program.
