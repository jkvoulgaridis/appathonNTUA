  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out more information about patients who have cancer
      (adenocarcinoma) of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) who have been treated
      with chemotherapy and radiation but have not had surgery. The study will follow patients for
      5 years to monitor for their cancer and to see how the standard medical care affects the
      daily life of patients.

          -  Measurable or evaluable disease

          -  ECOG performance status: 0 to 2 that is able to perform activities of daily living
             with minimal assistance

          -  Adequate bone marrow function (hemoglobulin ≥8 g/dl, neutrophil ≥1.5x109/L and
             platelet ( ≥100x109/L)

          -  Adequate liver function

               -  Bilirubin normal, Meets 1 of the following criteria:

               -  Alkaline phosphatase (AP) normal AND AST/ALT ≤ 5 times upper limit of normal
                  (ULN)

               -  AP ≤ 2.5 times ULN AND AST/ALT ≤ 1.5 times ULN

               -  AP ≤ 5 times ULN AND AST/ALT normal

          -  Adequate kidney function (creatinine ≤1.5 UNL and creatinine clearance ≥ 60 )

          -  Be at least 4 weeks from recent major surgical procedures.

          -  Patients must be able to understand the nature of the study and give written informed
             consent

          -  At least one measurable lesion on CT, MRI or esophageal barium exam.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &lt; 18 years and &gt;80 years

          -  Contraindication for irradiation: complete obstruction of esophagus, deep esophageal
             ulcer, fistula to mediastinum, or hematemesis

          -  Participating in other clinical trials

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Clinically significant and uncontrolled major medical conditions including but not
             limited to active uncontrolled infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             unstable angina pectoris or cardiac arrhythmia, psychiatric illness/ social situation
             that would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  any medical condition, which in the opinion of the study investigator places the
             subject at an unacceptably high risk for toxicities
