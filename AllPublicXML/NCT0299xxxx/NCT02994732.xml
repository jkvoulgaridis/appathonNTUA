  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to characterize the metabolic disposition,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and routes of elimination of [14C]‑labeled BVD‑523 after
      administration of a single, oral dose to healthy male subjects.

      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single
      oral dose of [14C]‑labeled BVD‑523 in healthy male subjects.

      This study will be an open-label, absorption, metabolism, and excretion study of
      [14C]-BVD-523 administered as a 600-mg (approximately 200 µCi) oral dose to 6 healthy male
      subjects following a 2-hour fast from food (not including water) that follows breakfast.
