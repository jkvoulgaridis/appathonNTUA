  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      POEM is a new intervention for the treatment of achalasia and has been reported to relieve
      the dysphagia symptom effectively. Although the cost of POEM method is less than the method
      of Laparoscopic Heller Myotomy and Fundoplication, it is still of an economic burden for the
      patients with achalasia. In this trial, investigators plan to use snare to assist POEM
      procedure, to observe the safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this method, compared
      with other knifes-assisted procedure.

    <description>Adverse events are defined and graded according to the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy lexicon (Cotton PB et al, Gastrointest Endosc 2010). Incidental findings of pneumoperitoneum, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pleural effusion on postoperative imaging, and subcutaneous emphysema were documented while not considered as adverse events.</description>

    <measure>Eckardt score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months and 12 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Eckardt score assesses the severity of achalasia symptoms by combining the sum of symptom frequency scores for dysphagia, regurgitation, and chest pain and a weight loss score. Each component can be graded from 0 to 3 points. The total range is 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms (Eckardt AJ et al, Nat Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol 2011).</description>

    <measure>Gastroesophageal reflux disease questionnaire (GerdQ) score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months and 12 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The GerdQ has been developed as a tool to facilitate the symptom-based diagnosis of GERD. Scores ranging from 0 to 3 were applied for the four positive predictors (heartburn, regurgitation, sleep disturbance due to reflux symptoms and use of over-the-counter medications for reflux symptoms) and from 3 to 0 for two negative predictors (epigastric pain and nausea). The GerdQ score was calculated as the sum of these scores, giving a total score ranging from 0 to 18. A total GerdQ score &gt;7 is considered indicative of significant GERD symptoms (Jones R et al, Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2009).</description>

    <description>POEM is performed by using a snare which is retracted into the sheath to expose the tip, leaving a 1-2mm length for operation.
After submucosal injection, an initial 2-cm mucosal incision is made by a snare in the posterior esophageal wall.
A submucosal tunnel from the esophagus to the gastric cardia is created using a snare.
Full-thickness myotomy is performed and extended 2-3 cm beyond the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) using a snare.
The mucosal incision is closed with endoclips.</description>
