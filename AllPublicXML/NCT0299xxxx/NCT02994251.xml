  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a single-center, single-arm, Phase II study of gemcitabine and cisplatin in
      combination with conventional trans-arterial chemoembolization therapy in adult patients with
      advanced ICC. 25 patients will be enrolled over the course of 2 years, with an additional 1.5
      years for patient follow-up.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients enrolled on study will receive a chemotherapy regimen of gemcitabine and
      cisplatin administered intravenously on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. After every 2 cycles
      of systemic chemotherapy, patients will receive contrast-enhanced MRI to assess liver
      disease; conventional trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) will be performed as indicated
      based on this assessment. Patients will receive a maximum of 8 cycles of the
      gemcitabine/cisplatin combination. Up to 3 TACE treatments may be delivered in this same time
      frame, with the first TACE taking place after 2 cycles of systemic chemotherapy. Following
      the treatment period, patients will continue clinical follow-up at 3 month intervals until
      study exit at 18 months post the start of treatment.

      It is hypothesized that the addition of conventional transarterial chemoembolization to
      standard chemotherapy will result in an improvement in PFS in patients with advanced,
      unresectable ICC, including patients with extra-hepatic disease.

gemcitabine: 1000 mg/m^2 of gemcitabine on Day 1 and 8, Dosages may be modified or delayed due to toxicities

Conventional TACE (transarterial chemoembolization) with Doxorubicin/Mitomycin-C: If conventional transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is warranted based on MRI assessment and the patient meets all the eligibility criteria for TACE therapy, then cTACE will be scheduled to take place during Week 3 of that cycle.

          <title>Progression-free Survival</title>
          <description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the 12-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate in adult patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) after treatment with gemcitabine and cisplatin in combination with conventional TACE. This is the percentage of patients alive and free of progression at 12-months from enrollment on study. Radiographic assessment of disease burden will be evaluated by mRECIST and qEASL using an MRI scan obtained at the IR clinic visit.</description>
