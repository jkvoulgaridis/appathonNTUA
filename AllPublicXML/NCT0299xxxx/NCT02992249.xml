      This is a prospective uncontrolled observational study to evaluate clinical outcomes
      following use of the ReCell Autologous Cell Harvesting Device (ReCell) as an adjunct for
      closure (re-epithelialization) as a treatment of life-threatening wounds requiring grafting
      for closure, and associated skin graft donor sites, in patients who lack adequate available
      skin to harvest for conventional grafting. Treatment with the ReCell device may be performed
      as part of a single operative procedure, or multiple staged procedures as deemed clinically
      necessary. Adverse events associated with the use of the ReCell device/cell suspension will
      be documented. Subjects will be followed for 1 year following ReCell treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient requires treatment of a life-threatening wound requiring grafting.

          -  Patient has inadequate available skin to harvest for conventional skin grafting.

          -  The treating investigator has determined 1) that there is no suitable alternative
             therapy that would be adequate to meet the patient's medical need; and 2) the risk
             associated with use of the ReCell device is no greater than the probable risk from the
             disease or condition.

          -  In the treating investigator's opinion and with consideration of the severity of the
             patient's health status, the patient has the potential to realize benefits from the
             application of the ReCell device.

          -  Patient is hemodynamically stable.

          -  The patient (or legal representative) is able to read and understand instructions and
             give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has active infection at the proposed ReCell treatment site.

          -  The patient is unable to follow the protocol.

          -  The patient has a known hypersensitivity to trypsin or Compound Sodium Lactate for
             Irrigation (Hartmann's) solution.
