    <measure>Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) is a 29-item scale to assess agitation. Each item is rated on a 7-point scale of frequency, from least (1) to most frequent (7). Items are summed to calculate the CMAI total score. The CMAI total score has a range of 29-203 points; higher scores indicate more severe agitation</description>

    <measure>Zarit Burden Interview</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) assess the stresses experienced by caregivers of patients with dementia. It assesses 22 questions about the impact of the patient's disabilities on the caregiver's life, each rated from least (0) to most (4) frequent. Items are summed to calculate the ZBI total score. The ZBI total score ranges from 0 to 88; higher scores denoting more stresses experienced by caregivers.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The study was planned to be conducted in approximately 432 subjects. For business reasons, and not related to safety, recruitment of subjects was stopped after 111 subjects were randomized. The last subject was randomized on 2 Nov 2017.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The screening visit was followed by a 2- to 4-week screening period, including wash-out of antipsychotic agents which were prohibited during the Treatment period (exception: protocol specified agents). Subjects had to be on stable doses of permitted medications for &gt;=4 weeks before Baseline (&gt;=12 weeks for cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine).</pre_assignment_details>

It assesses 22 questions about the impact of the patient's disabilities on the caregiver's life, each rated from least (0) to most (4) frequent. Items are summed to calculate the ZBI total score. The ZBI total score ranges from 0 to 88; higher scores denoting more stresses experienced by caregivers.</description>
