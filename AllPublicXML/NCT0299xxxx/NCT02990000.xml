  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that mental health care (MHC) providers differ significantly in their
      ability to help patients. In addition, providers demonstrate different patterns of
      effectiveness across symptom and functioning domains. For example, some providers are
      reliably effective in treating numerous patients and problem domains, others are reliably
      effective in some domains (e.g., depression, substance abuse) yet appear to struggle in
      others (e.g., anxiety, social functioning), and some are reliably ineffective, or even
      harmful, across patients and domains. Knowledge of these provider differences is based
      largely on patient-reported outcomes collected in routine MHC settings.

      Unfortunately, provider performance information is not systematically used to refer or assign
      a particular patient to a scientifically based best-matched provider. MHC systems continue to
      rely on random or purely pragmatic case assignment and referral, which significantly &quot;waters
      down&quot; the odds of a patient being assigned/referred to a high performing provider in the
      patient's area(s) of need, and increases the risk of being assigned/referred to a provider
      who may have a track record of ineffectiveness. This research aims to solve the existing
      non-patient-centered provider-matching problem.

      Specifically, the investigators aim to demonstrate the comparative effectiveness of a
      scientifically-based patient-provider match system compared to status quo pragmatic case
      assignment. The investigators expect in the scientific match group significantly better
      treatment outcomes (e.g., symptoms, quality of life) and higher patient satisfaction with
      treatment. The investigators also expect to demonstrate feasibility of implementing a
      scientific match process in a community MHC system and broad dissemination of the easily
      replicated scientific match technology in diverse health care settings. The importance of
      this work for patients cannot be understated. Far too many patients struggle to find the
      right provider, which unnecessarily prolongs suffering and promotes health care system
      inefficiency. A scientific match system based on routine outcome data uses patient-generated
      information to direct this patient to this provider in this setting. In addition, when based
      on multidimensional assessment, it allows a wide variety of patient-centered outcomes to be
      represented (e.g., symptom domains, functioning domains, quality of life).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and Significance:

      Mental illness is an extraordinary and highly burdensome public health problem.
      Unfortunately, even for individuals who access mental health care (MHC), the care is too
      often substandard. Research has consistently demonstrated that approximately 10-15% of
      patients will deteriorate or experience harm during treatment. Further, when these rates are
      combined with no-change rates, only 40% or less of patients meaningfully recover.
      Importantly, treatment research has illuminated substantial variability in providers'
      outcomes. Simply put, the MHC provider impacts treatment outcomes, and stakeholders lack
      systematic access to valid and actionable information to optimize effective patient-provider
      matches. Without collecting and disseminating performance data, stakeholders lack vital
      information on which to base health care choices and personalize treatment. Conversely, there
      potentially is immense advantage to matching patients to providers based on scientific
      outcome data. Patients, stakeholders, researchers, and clinicians have all endorsed such
      applied knowledge transfer as a high priority. In response, the investigators have developed
      and piloted a technology to test this match concept and patient-centered health model.

      Prominent health care agencies have placed outcome/performance measurement at the center of
      core initiatives. The Institute of Medicine specifically recommends integrating provider
      performance data in treatment decision-making. Despite this rhetoric, 2 Cochrane Reviews
      combined could only identify 4 studies that addressed this question with minimal methodology
      standards; the results were mixed. Importantly, none involved a targeted dissemination
      intervention, and none involved MHC. Previous research, including our own, has empirically
      demonstrated substantial differences in projected treatment effect sizes depending on to
      which therapist a patient is referred. The key evidence gap is the need for a rigorous test
      of the effectiveness of a targeted MHC provider-performance dissemination intervention
      compared to standard/pragmatic referral and case assignment. Relatedly, the Patient-Centered
      Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) has called for increased &quot;precision&quot; or &quot;personalized&quot;
      treatment, with a focus on tailoring. The match algorithm responds directly to this high
      priority call to customize care in a personal and evidence-based way.

      Specific Aims:

      The aim of this comparative effectiveness research (CER) is to test an innovative,
      scientifically informed patient-therapist referral match algorithm based on MHC provider
      outcome data. The investigators will employ a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare
      the match algorithm with the commonplace pragmatic referral matching (based on provider
      availability, convenience, or self-reported specialty). Psychosocial treatment itself will
      remain naturalistically administered by varied providers (e.g., psychologists, social
      workers) to patients with complex mental health concerns within a partner clinic network,
      Psychological and Behavioral Consultants (PsychBC). The investigators hypothesize that the
      scientific match group will outperform the pragmatic match group in decreasing patient
      symptoms and treatment dropout, and in promoting patient functional outcomes, outcome
      expectations, and care satisfaction, as well as patient-therapist alliance quality. Doing so
      will establish the match algorithm as a mechanism of effective patient-centered MHC.

      Methods:

      The investigators will compare the effectiveness of naturalistic MHC either with or without
      the scientific matching aid with a double blind, individual level RCT. The investigators will
      first conduct a baseline assessment of PsychBC therapists' (target enrollment N=44)
      performance (across at least 15 cases) to determine their strengths in treating 12 behavioral
      health domains measured by the primary outcome tool on which our match algorithm is based --
      the Treatment Outcome Package (TOP). The TOP is already administered routinely in our partner
      network. Based on years of predictive analytic research, this tool classifies therapists as
      &quot;effective,&quot; &quot;neutral,&quot; or &quot;ineffective/harmful&quot; for each TOP domain. The blinded therapists
      will be crossed over conditions.

      Next, for the trial, new adult outpatients (target enrollment N=281) will be randomly
      assigned to the Match condition or case assignment as usual (typically based on pragmatic
      considerations, such as provider availability, convenience, or self-reported specialty). The
      only patient exclusion criterion will be people who are not the primary decision-maker for
      their care. Thus, patients will present with a multitude of problems across a spectrum of
      diagnoses. With therapist assignment as the only manipulation, participating therapists will
      treat patients fully naturalistically. Treatment outcomes will be assessed regularly through
      mutual termination or up to 16 weeks. Primary analyses will involve hierarchical linear
      modeling to examine comparative rates and patterns of change on the outcomes.

    <measure>Average Z-Scores for the Treatment Outcome Package-Clinical Scales (TOP-CS; Kraus, Seligman, &amp; Jordan, 2005)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and biweekly across 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The TOP-Clinical Scales consist of 58 items assessing 12 symptom and functional domains (risk-adjusted for case mix variables assessed via 37 items on the companion TOP-Case Mix form, such as divorce, job loss, comorbidity): work functioning, sexual functioning, social conflict, depression, panic/somatic anxiety, psychosis, suicidal ideation, violence, mania, sleep, substance abuse, and quality of life. Global symptom severity was assessed by averaging the z-scores (i.e., standard deviation units relative to the general population mean) across the 12 clinical scales. Higher scores indicate greater impairment. Given that we examined change over the entire treatment period for this outcome (in a longitudinal hierarchical linear model), we provide the average mean and standard deviation for the TOP-CS z-scores across all measurement occasions.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and biweekly across 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Global psychological distress was assessed with the Symptom Checklist-10 (SCL-10; Rosen, Drescher, Moos, &amp; Gusman, 1999), a 10-item, well validated and widely used self-report inventory that assesses psychological well-being. Total scores can range from 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating greater distress. Given that we examined change over the entire treatment period for this outcome (in a longitudinal hierarchical linear model), we provide the average mean and standard deviation for the SCL-10 total score across all measurement occasions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Working Alliance Inventory—Short Form, Patient Version (WAI-SF-P; Tracey, &amp; Kokotovic, 1989) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Biweekly across 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The WAI is the most widely used alliance measure, assessing patient-therapist agreement on the goals and tasks of treatment, and the quality of their relational bond. This 12-item short form assesses these dimensions from the patient's perspective, with higher scores indicating a more positive relationship (theoretical range = 12 to 84). Given that we examined change over the entire treatment period for this outcome (in a longitudinal hierarchical linear model), we provide the average mean and standard deviation for the WAI total score across all measurement occasions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Outcome Expectation (OE) Subscale of the Credibility/Expectancy Scale (CEQ; Devilly, &amp; Borkovec, 2000)</measure>
    <time_frame>Biweekly across 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The OE subscale of the CEQ is the most widely used and psychometrically sound measure of patients' expectations for the personal efficacy of treatment. The three OE items range from 1-9 or 0-100% (in 10 percentage point increments), with higher ratings indicating greater expectation for improvement. Given that the OE CEQ items are assessed on different scales, we re-scaled the items to the same metric before creating a total score (theoretical range = 3 to 27). Given that we examined change over the entire treatment period for this outcome (in a longitudinal hierarchical linear model), we provide the average mean and standard deviation for the OE subscale across all measurement occasions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Domain-Specific Impairment on the Most Elevated Domain of the Treatment Outcome Package-Clinical Scales (TOP-CS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and biweekly across 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The TOP-CS consists of 58 items assessing 12 symptom and functional domains (risk-adjusted for case mix variables assessed via 37 items on the companion TOP-Case Mix form, such as divorce, job loss, comorbidity): work functioning, sexual functioning, social conflict, depression, panic/somatic anxiety, psychosis, suicidal ideation, violence, mania, sleep, substance abuse, and quality of life. Domain-specific impairment reflects each patient's scores on their most elevated problem domain (i.e., the domain that was most elevated at baseline). These scores were standardized z-scores (i.e., standard deviation units relative to the general population mean), with higher scores indicating greater impairment. Given that we examined change over the entire treatment period for this outcome (in a HLM), we provide the average mean and standard deviation for the most elevated TOP domain across all measurement occasions. Note that this measure was positively skewed so we log-transformed it.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Early Treatment Discontinuation (i.e., Attending 2 or Fewer Treatment Sessions)</measure>
    <time_frame>Early treatment discontinuation/continuation at session 2</time_frame>
    <description>Early treatment discontinuation was operationalized as a patient discontinuing treatment after 2 or fewer sessions, whereas early continuation was operationalized as attending 3 or more treatment sessions. For analyses, early treatment discontinuation was coded 1 and early continuation was coded 0.</description>

    <measure>Overall Provider Quality Subscale of the Treatment Outcome Package (TOP) Satisfaction Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed after 16 weeks of treatment or at the point of naturalistic treatment termination, whichever comes sooner</time_frame>
    <description>The Overall Provider Quality subscale of the TOP Satisfaction Scale assesses the extent to which patients are satisfied with their mental health care provider. This subscale reflects the average of 4 items, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction (theoretical range = 1 to 6).</description>

Scientific Match: We have developed an innovative, personalized Match System based on provider track records determined with a multidimensional outcomes tool – the Treatment Outcome Package (TOP). Specifically, patients are assigned to therapists with previously established strengths (i.e., being historically effective) in treating their primary problems (e.g., depression, anxiety).</description>

          <description>The TOP-CS consists of 58 items assessing 12 symptom/functional domains: depression, quality of life, mania, panic, psychosis, substance abuse, social conflict, sexual functioning, sleep, suicidality, violence, and work functioning. The items are used to create domain-specific z-scores that reflect SDs relative to the general population mean. To create an index of global impairment, the 12 domain-specific z-scores are averaged. Higher scores represent greater impairment (e.g., 0 represents the general population mean, +2 represents impairment that is 2 SDs above the population mean).</description>

        <description>The TOP-Clinical Scales consist of 58 items assessing 12 symptom and functional domains (risk-adjusted for case mix variables assessed via 37 items on the companion TOP-Case Mix form, such as divorce, job loss, comorbidity): work functioning, sexual functioning, social conflict, depression, panic/somatic anxiety, psychosis, suicidal ideation, violence, mania, sleep, substance abuse, and quality of life. Global symptom severity was assessed by averaging the z-scores (i.e., standard deviation units relative to the general population mean) across the 12 clinical scales. Higher scores indicate greater impairment. Given that we examined change over the entire treatment period for this outcome (in a longitudinal hierarchical linear model), we provide the average mean and standard deviation for the TOP-CS z-scores across all measurement occasions.</description>

Based on this a priori power analysis, we will need a total of 44 therapists and 211 patients to achieve a power of .80 to detect moderate condition effects. Factoring in a 25% dropout rate, enrolling 281 patients should provide sufficient statistical power.</non_inferiority_desc>

The three OE items range from 1-9 or 0-100% (in 10 percentage point increments), with higher ratings indicating greater expectation for improvement.

Domain-specific impairment reflects each patient's scores on their most elevated problem domain (i.e., the domain that was most elevated at baseline). These scores were standardized z-scores (i.e., standard deviation units relative to the general population mean), with higher scores indicating greater impairment. Given that we examined change over the entire treatment period for this outcome (in a HLM), we provide the average mean and standard deviation for the most elevated TOP domain across all measurement occasions.

            <groups_desc>To account for the nested nature of the data (time points nested within patients nested within therapists), a 3-level hierarchical linear model was used to test the effect of condition (Scientific Match = 1; Pragmatic Match = 0) on weekly during-treatment change on the log-transformed TOP-CS domain-specific z-scores. Given that higher z-scores indicate greater impairment, negative slopes indicate a weekly decrease in impairment during treatment (i.e., a better outcome or more improvement).</groups_desc>
