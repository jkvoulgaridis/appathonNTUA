  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this trial is to determine if hydrodistention at the time of
      intradetrusor injection of botulinum toxin A has additional benefit in patients with
      refractory overactive bladder (OAB) and urgency symptoms compared to intradetrusor injection
      of botulinum toxin A alone.

      Consented patients will be randomized to hydrodistention at a pressure of 80 cm H2O for 5
      minutes, prior to the intradetrusor injection of 100 units of botulinum toxin A
      (hydrodistention group) or intradetrusor injection of 100 units of botulinum toxin A alone
      (botulinum toxin A alone group).

      The primary aim will be subjective improvement measured as change from baseline at 12 weeks
      using the OAB-q bother subscale.
