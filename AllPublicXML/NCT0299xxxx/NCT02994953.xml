  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of 2 parts: Dose Escalation phase (Part A) and Expansion phase (Part B).
      The dose escalation phase will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of avelumab in
      combination with M9241 in subjects with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic solid
      tumors. Expansion phase will assess the safety and clinical activity of the combination
      regimen in selected tumor types. In Expansion phase subjects who have completed the
      combination treatment of avelumab at a given dose level of M9241, a safety review will be
      performed by the Safety monitoring committee in order to make a decision on the next dose
      level. Successive cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects will be treated with escalating doses of M9241
      with avelumab intravenous (IV).

          -  Negative blood pregnancy test at Screening for women of childbearing potential. For
             purposes of this trial, women of childbearing potential are defined as all female
             subjects after puberty unless they are postmenopausal for at least 1 year, surgically
             sterile or sexually inactive.

          -  Highly effective contraception (ie, methods with a failure rate of less than 1% per
             year) must be used before start of treatment, for duration of trial treatment, and for
             at least 50 days after stopping study treatment for both men and women if risk of
             conception exists. The effects of avelumab and M9241 on developing human fetus are
             unknown; thus, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use highly
             effective contraception.

        Part B:

          -  Availability of a fresh tumor biopsy is mandatory for eligibility in the RCC cohort.
             The biopsy or surgical specimen should be collected within 28 days prior to the first
             IMP administration. If a subject has 2 separate biopsy attempts in which usable tissue
             is not obtained, enrollment may be possible after discussion with the Medical Monitor.
             For other expansion cohorts, availability of either tumor archival material (&lt; 6
             months old) or fresh biopsies (obtained within 28 days) is acceptable with one of
             these being mandatory. For formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, either block or
             sections (&gt; 15) may be provided. Tumor biopsies and tumor archival material must be
             suitable for biomarker assessment

          -  Locally advanced or metastatic UC that has progressed during or after at least one
             previous platinum-based chemotherapy and not previously treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1
             agents: Histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic
             transitional cell carcinoma of urothelium(including renal pelvis, ureters, urinary
             bladder, and urethra). Subjects must have progressed during or after treatment with at
             least 1 platinum-containing regimen for inoperable locally advanced or metastatic UC
             or disease recurrence. Subjects who received prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy
             and progressed within 12 months of treatment with a platinum-containing regimen will
             be considered as second line. Subjects with mixed histologies are required to have a
             dominant transitional cell pattern.

          -  Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), first-line metastatic: Stage IV (per seventh
             International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer classification) histologically
             confirmed NSCLC. Subjects must not have received treatment for their metastatic
             disease. Subjects could have received adjuvant chemotherapy or loco-regional treatment
             that included chemotherapy for locally advanced disease, as long as disease recurrence
             occurred at least 6 months after the completion of the last administration of
             chemotherapy. Only epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma
             kinase (ALK) wild-type are allowed (ie, EGFR mutation and ALK translocation / re
             arrangement excluded). Non squamous cell histologies and never / former light smoker
             (&lt; 15 pack years) squamous cell carcinoma subjects (per local standard of care)
             require testing if status is unknown. Subjects must have low tumor PD-L1 expression
             defined as &lt; 50% tumor proportion score determined using PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx test
             or an equivalent Food and Drug Administration (FDA)- approved PD-L1 test. Availability
             of either tumor archival material or fresh biopsies within 28 days is acceptable with
             one of these being mandatory. For FFPE samples, either block or sections (&gt; 15) may be
             provided. Tumor biopsies and tumor archival material must be suitable for biomarker
             assessment. This cohort will not be opened for enrollment in Belgium, Czech Republic,
             France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, and United Kingdom.

          -  Colorectal cancer (CRC): Histologically or cytologically confirmed recurrent or
             refractory metastatic CRC (according to American Joint Committee on Cancer /
             International Union Against Cancer Tumor Node Metastasis [TNM] Staging System seventh
             edition) after failure of prior therapy containing oxaliplatin / fluoropyrimidine and
             / or irinotecan / fluoropyrimidine and, if eligible, cetuximab (Erbitux®) and
             bevacizumab (Avastin®). Only subjects with microsatellite instability (MSI)-low or
             microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic CRC are eligible. Subjects without existing MSI
             test results will have MSI status performed locally by a Clinical Laboratory
             Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified IHC or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based
             test (PCR based MSI test is preferred). Subjects must be willing to undergo an
             on-treatment biopsy procedure. Availability of either tumor archival material or fresh
             biopsies within 28 days is acceptable with one of these being mandatory. For FFPE
             samples, either block or sections (&gt; 15) may be provided. Tumor biopsies and tumor
             archival material must be suitable for biomarker assessment. For Belgium, Czech
             Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, and United Kingdom,
             subjects in the second-line setting should have exhausted or be considered ineligible
             or intolerant (in the opinion of the Investigator) of available second-line
             chemotherapy options.

          -  Renal cell carcinoma (RCC), primary immune checkpoint inhibitor failure:
             Histologically or cytologically documented metastatic RCC with a component of clear
             cell subtype. Subjects must have had progressive disease (PD) within 6 months or best
             overall response of stable disease (SD) for ≥ 6 months following start of therapy with
             any antibody / drug targeting T cell co-regulatory proteins (immune checkpoints) such
             as anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anticytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) for
             advanced or metastatic disease (either as monotherapy or combination therapy, in any
             line). Fresh tumor biopsy is required for enrollment. If a subject has 2 separate
             biopsy attempts in which usable tissue is not obtained, enrollment may be possible
             after discussion with Medical Monitor. Subjects must be willing to undergo an
             on-treatment biopsy procedure. In France, in addition to having received checkpoint
             inhibitor therapy, subjects should have already received recommended local-standard
             therapy per discretion of the Investigator.

                  to start of trial treatment, or not recovered from adverse event (AE) related to
                  such therapies, with the following exceptions: Palliative radiotherapy delivered

                  Previous or ongoing administration of systemic steroids for the management of an
                  acute allergic phenomenon is acceptable as long as it is anticipated that the
                  administration of steroids will be completed in 14 days, or that the dose after
                  14 days will be equivalent to &lt;= 10 mg prednisone daily.

             without further recurrence was achieved at least 2 years prior to trial entry and
