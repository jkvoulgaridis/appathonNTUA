  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine whether a sensor-enabled, clinically integrated,
      mobile health asthma program can improve asthma outcomes among 4-17 year old children with
      moderate-to-severe asthma.

      Primary Aims:

        -  Assess whether asthma control in patients enrolled in the intervention arm improved in
           comparison to the control arm through the (ACT) measurement tool.

        -  Assess healthcare utilization (asthma-related ED visits and hospitalizations,
           asthma-related oral corticosteroid use) obtained through electronic medical record and
           parent report.

      Secondary Aims:

      Investigators will use parent-report surveys of the following psycho-social outcome measures:

        -  Days missed from school due to asthma; 2) pediatric asthma-related quality of life
           (PACQLQ); and 3) Parental Asthma Management Self-Efficacy (PAMSE).

        -  Enhance parental management through improved inhaler use. The investigators will use the
           Propeller Sensor Platform (referenced as Remote Health Management Platform) to allow
           parents to track their child's ICS and SABA inhaler use daily. The Platform also will
           have specific educational messaging to help parents and their children achieve adherence
           to their prescribed plan. This constant feedback and reinforcement may lead to improved
           asthma control therefore reducing frequency and severity of asthma exacerbations. The
           investigators will also be assessing the factors associated with the feasibility and
           sustainability of the Propeller Sensor Platform by observing trends in utilization.
           Utilization and drop-off will be measured by monitoring use of the inhalers and periodic
           surveys of families.

        -  Improve management by the healthcare team. The investigators will use the Remote Health
           Management Platform to integrate inhaler use data into a web portal that the physician's
           office can access. Through the development of this interface, the Propeller Sensor
           Platform will be able to provide inhaler use feedback to healthcare teams.

      Types of feedback:

        -  Emergency Management: data on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and short-acting
           beta-agonist (SABA) use

        -  Long-term Management: data on ICS and SABA use. This interface will include data on both
           ICS and SABA inhaler use. The interface will also have flags to notify the office of
           under or overuse of inhalers, with a protocol in place to reach out to patients. The
           investigators will also be assessing the factors associated with the feasibility and
           sustainability of the Remote Health Management Platform by the healthcare team. This
           will be done by weekly contact with the healthcare team, rapid cycle improvement of the
           web portal, and written assessments.

    <description>The intervention group will have the full Remote Health Management Sensor Platform. Research staff will review uploaded sensor data on a daily basis. If participants are enrolled into the control group, they will only receive Standard Asthma Education. The Standard Asthma Education follows the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines for asthma management. This will include the following topics: 1. Explanation of symptoms; 2. Asthma triggers (description and how to avoid them); 3. Using medications (how to use prescribed asthma medications, the difference between controller medications and rescue inhalers, how to use a spacer, how to use a mask); and 4. Managing asthma control (purpose of asthma control test, asthma action plan, how to use a peak flow meter).</description>

    <description>The Propeller sensor monitors the use of inhaled medications, capturing the date, time, and number of uses. The sensor then transmits this information using Bluetooth to a paired smart phone or hub. Data can be uploaded to the caregiver's smart phone and to the patient's web portal, which their healthcare team will have access to help overall management.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  English-speaking parents

          -  Children 4-&lt;17 years of age. Using both NHLBI (National Heart, Lung, and Blood
             Institute) guidelines and based off of a physician expert panel, the research team has
             limited the ages to 4-&lt;17 years old. It has been shown to be difficult to properly
             diagnose individuals less than 4 years of age with asthma. Usually, they are diagnosed
             with reactive airway disease or bronchial virus. Individuals &lt;17 years old was the
             oldest group because investigators wanted to avoid adolescence and make sure that
             parents have an active role in the health management of the child.

          -  Moderate or severe persistent asthma, defined by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood
             Institute. This will be done by a physician-trained research assistant who will be
             able to identify potential participants prior to recruitment.

          -  At least one asthma exacerbations that required a course of oral corticosteroids in
             the past year

          -  Prescription and utilization of an ICS inhaler for at least the past year.

          -  Who are seen at: Clark and Deming Resident Clinic, Lurie Children's Pulmonary Clinic,
             Lurie Children's Uptown Clinic, Chicago Family Asthma and Allergy Clinic or Children's
             Healthcare Associates

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-English speaking parents/families

          -  Patients seen in the hospital who receive primary care outside of the study's clinics

          -  Children with any comorbid conditions, which interfere with appropriate assessment of
             asthma symptoms: Chronic Lung Disease, Broncho-Pulmonary Dysplasia, Cystic Fibrosis,
             Pulmonary Hypertension, Interstitial Lung Disease, Immunodeficiency, Bronchiectasis,
             Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia, Chronic Respiratory Insufficiency, Neuromuscular Weakness,
             Sickle Cell Lung Disease, Restrictive Lung Disease, and Tracheostomy or
             Ventilator-dependence

          -  Child-patients who are participating in any other research studies that would
             interfere with our ability to use and track the inhaler sensor
