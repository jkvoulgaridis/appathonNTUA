      Objectives: The primary purpose of this study is to explore the benefits of vibration
      dumbbell resistance training over standard dumbbell resistance training for improving upper
      limb strength, function and pain among manual wheelchair users with paraplegia.

      Experimental Design: Design: Randomized Control Trial

      Methods: Twenty subjects with paraplegia will be recruited and randomized into two groups, a
      vibration dumbbell training (V-DT) group and a standard dumbbell training group (S-DT). Both
      groups will participate in a supervised 12-week (3 sessions per week) dumbbell (free-weight)
      strength training program consisting of nine exercises specifically designed to improve upper
      limb muscle function to support propulsion and transfer activities and protect the shoulders
      from developing pain. For each of the nine exercises the vibration group will hold a
      high-frequency (40 Hz) vibrating dumbbell in a static arm posture (isometric training) while
      the control group will move a non-vibrating dumbbell through the full range of motion for a
      given exercise (isotonic training). Both groups will follow a standardized protocol for
      assessing and progressing the amount of weight that is added to the dumbbell to achieve
      optimal training effects.

      All participants will participate in laboratory testing for various outcome measures at
      baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks .

    <description>Supervised training sessions will occur optimally, 3 times per week for a total of 12 consecutive weeks. The sessions will involve nine exercises specifically designed to improve upper limb muscle function. The beginning training intensity for each participant will be based on their one rep max for each exercise, which is determined during baseline laboratory testing in accordance with standard procedures. Training intensity will be adjusted progressively, first by increasing the frequency of the vibration (max. 40 Hz) then by the addition of more weight, based on weekly assessments and consultation with the senior investigators.</description>

            <description>Study participants who are randomized into the vibration exercise group will complete an in-home exercise program using a vibrating dumbbell.
Vibrating Dumbbell: Supervised training sessions will occur optimally, 3 times per week for a total of 12 consecutive weeks. The sessions will involve nine exercises specifically designed to improve upper limb muscle function. The beginning training intensity for each participant will be based on their one rep max for each exercise, which is determined during baseline laboratory testing in accordance with standard procedures. Training intensity will be adjusted progressively, first by increasing the frequency of the vibration (max. 40 Hz) then by the addition of more weight, based on weekly assessments and consultation with the senior investigators.</description>

            <description>Study participants who are randomized into the control exercise group will complete an in-home exercise program using standard dumbbells.
Standard Dumbbell: Supervised training sessions will occur optimally, 3 times per week for a total of 12 consecutive weeks.
The sessions will involve nine exercises specifically designed to improve upper limb muscle function. The beginning training intensity for each participant will be based on their one rep max for each exercise, which is determined during baseline laboratory testing in accordance with standard procedures. Training intensity will be adjusted progressively by the addition of more weight, based on weekly assessments and consultation with the senior investigators.
To obtain as much data as possible on resistance training with vibration within study timeline, a modification was recently approved by the IRB to cease enrolling subjects into standard dumbbell training.</description>
