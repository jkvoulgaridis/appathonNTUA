  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who are obese often have insulin resistance (inability of insulin to properly control
      blood sugar) and high blood sugar. However, not all people with obesity have this problem.
      About one-third of people with obesity have normal sugar metabolism (the way your body uses
      sugar). Similarly, not all people who are lean are also metabolically healthy and a subset of
      people who are lean are referred to as metabolically abnormal lean (MAL) or metabolically
      obese lean because they have the abnormalities in glucose metabolism typically associated
      with obesity. The reasons why some people with obesity have a problem with blood sugar
      control and others do not are not entirely clear. It is thought that impaired muscle sugar
      uptake is the main problem related to high blood sugar in people with obesity. However,
      adipose tissue (fat tissue) also consumes a substantial amount of blood sugar. Therefore, it
      is unclear whether muscle or adipose tissue (fat tissue) are primarily responsible for
      altered blood sugar concentrations in persons with metabolically abnormal obesity (MAO)
      (those with insulin resistance), compared to those with metabolically normal (healthy)
      obesity (MNO), or whether &quot;healthy&quot; adipose tissue (fat tissue) expansion in MNO people
      compared with lean people provides a vessel for blood sugar removal that helps maintain
      normal blood sugar concentration.

      Accordingly, the investigators will determine the amount of sugar that is taken up by the
      body and in the cells of adipose tissue (fat tissue) and muscle by infusing labeled sugar
      into the blood and looking at its disappearance from blood and appearance in adipose tissue
      (fat tissue) and muscle. The investigators will also determine how well insulin, a hormone
      that controls blood sugar, turns on signals that stimulate sugar uptake in fat and muscle
      cells. These studies will be done after an overnight fast and during an infusion of sugar and
      insulin (hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp), in sex- and age-matched people who are insulin
      resistant and insulin sensitive. People with obesity will also be invited to complete a ~10%
      diet-induced weight loss program and will be studied again after they have achieved the
      weight loss goal. A group of sex- and age-matched metabolically normal lean participants will
      serve as control group. An attempt will be made to also study a group of sex- and age-matched
      metabolically abnormal lean participants.

        The investigators plan to study a total of 45 men and women of all races and ethnic groups:
        15 MAO (metabolically abnormal obese, likely insulin resistant), 15 MNO (metabolically
        normal obese, likely insulin sensitive), and 15 lean. All three groups will be balanced
        with regards to sex and race/ethnicity distribution, and the two obese groups will also be
        matched on percent total body fat. They will also attempt to recruit 15 metabolically
        abnormal lean participants.
