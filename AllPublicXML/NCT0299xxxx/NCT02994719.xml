  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether speed-dependent measures of gait can be
      identified in patients with neurological conditions that affect gait, particularly in
      subjects with parkinsonian disorders.

      This study aims to determine whether the gait patterns in these subjects differ in
      predictable and quantifiable ways from those of age- and sex-matched healthy controls. This
      will be conducted by asking 40 Parkinsonian disorder subjects and 40 age-matched healthy
      control subjects to walk 9 trials over an 18 ft walkway embedded with pressure sensors at
      baseline, self-selected slower and faster speeds. In addition, the protocol aims to
      investigate whether clusters of gait patterns can be identified within subgroups of
      individuals with parkinsonian disorders with varying co-morbidities or treatment conditions
      as well as patients with ataxia syndromes. For this aim an additional 20 Parkinsonian
      disorder subjects need to be recruited. Patients with parkinsonism as defined by UK PD Brain
      Bank Criteria (n=60), subjects with acquired or inherited ataxic syndromes (n=10) and age-
      and sex matched controls (n=40) will be recruited. There is an optional second visit in the
      protocol during which approximately 20 subjects with Parkinsonian disorders, who are willing
      to come off antiparkinson medication and if applicable, off both medication and deep brain
      stimulation, are asked to walk an additional 9 trials.

        includes subjects with Parkinson's Disease and may also include subjects who may have
        indeterminate parkinsonism, when it is not clear whether they have idiopathic Parkinson's
        Disease versus one of the Atypical Parkinsonisms, such as Vascular Parkinsonism, Multiple
        System Atrophy, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus or
        Corticobasal Degeneration.
