      This randomized clinical trial studies how well online genetics educational video with or
      without pre- and/or post-telephone genetics counseling works in assessing cancer-risk
      distress in patients with triple negative breast cancer. Online genetic education and
      telephone genetic counseling may help the doctors learn the stress a person feels about their
      risk of cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the effects of online genetic education versus telephone genetic counseling on
      cancer-risk distress.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the effects of online genetic education versus telephone genetic counseling on
      testing completion rates.

      II. To evaluate the role of psychological and social variables in women's reactions to
      genetic testing for ovarian cancer risk with variable education strategies.

      III. To consider the effects of variations of genetic education/counseling on genetic
      knowledge, satisfaction with the decision to undergo testing, and family communication.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 4 arms.

      ARM A: Patients watch genetic testing online educational video and receive genetic testing
      online test results report.

      ARM B: Patients watch genetic testing online educational video, receive genetic testing
      online test results report, and post-telephone genetic counseling.

      ARM C: Patients watch genetic testing online educational video, receive pre-telephone genetic
      counseling, genetic testing online test results report, and post-telephone genetic
      counseling.

      ARM D: Patients watch genetic testing online educational video, receive pre-telephone genetic
      counseling, and genetic testing online test results report.

    <measure>Mean cancer stress scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Mean cancer stress scores are measured on the Impact of Events Scale (IES), a 15-item self-report measure that assesses subjective distress caused by traumatic events, which may include a positive genetic test result.There are two subscales, Intrusion and Avoidance, used to calculate a total. The range for Intrusion is 0-35 and the range for Avoidance is 0-40. The range of the total score is 0-75. Higher scores reflect more stressful impact, and therefore, a worse outcome.
Subscales are summed to compute the total score.</description>
