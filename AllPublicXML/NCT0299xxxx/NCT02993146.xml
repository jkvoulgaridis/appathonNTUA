      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ropidoxuridine when given
      together with whole brain radiation therapy in treating patients with cancer that has spread
      to the brain (brain metastases). Ropidoxuridine may help whole brain radiation therapy work
      better by making cancer cells more sensitive to the radiation therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To conduct a phase 1 dose escalation trial in patients with brain metastases to determine
      the recommended phase -2 dose of ropidoxuridine (5-iodo-2-pyrimidinone-2'-deoxyribose [IPdR])
      when administered alone orally once daily for 7 consecutive days and then concurrently with
      conventionally fractionated whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) for additional 21 days.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity to IPdR-mediated radiosensitization.

      II. To estimate 6 month intracranial progression-free survival (PFS) in brain metastasis
      cancer patients who receive daily oral IPdR x 28 days and WBRT.

      III. To establish the pharmacokinetics of daily oral dosing of IPdR times 8 days.

      IV. To evaluate safety and tolerability of oral IPdR x 28 days and WBRT.

      V. To estimate the incidence of delayed neurological toxicity at 2, 4, and 6 months (+/-1
      week) post-completion of WBRT (for patients without intracranial progression) including:

      Va. Delayed-recall through Hopkins Verbal Learning Test Revised (HVLT-R). Vb. Quality of life
      as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-BR).

      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess for biochemical evidence of IPdR effect in normal tissues (circulating
      granulocytes) by measuring %IUdR-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) cellular incorporation by flow
      cytometry and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses as an exploratory biomarker
      for the following:

      Ia. %IUdR-DNA tumor cell incorporation from day 8 extracranial tumor biopsies in brain
      metastasis cancer patients receiving RP2D doses of IPdR as an exploratory biomarker of tumor
      radiosensitization using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.

      Ib. %IUdR-DNA cellular incorporation in patients' circulating granulocytes taken weekly
      during the 28-day IPdR RP2D dose, on day 29, and week 8 as an exploratory biomarker of IPdR
      systemic toxicities to bone marrow as measured by serial complete blood count
      (CBC)/differential values.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of ropidoxuridine.

      Patients receive ropidoxuridine orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and undergo WBRT
      daily for not more than 5 days per week beginning on day 8 for a total of 15 fractions in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 6 months,
      every 3-4 months for 6 months, and every 6 months for 1 year.

          -  Negative urine or serum pregnancy test result for females of child bearing potential
             only; Note: The effects of IPdR on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this
             reason and because radiation therapy is known to be teratogenic, women of
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration
             of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her
             treating physician immediately; men and women treated or enrolled on this protocol
             must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of
             study participation, and 4 months after completion of IPdR administration

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of diffuse lepto or pachy meningeal carcinomatosis (focal/localized
             involvement from limited meningeal based metastases acceptable), greater than 1 cm
             mid-line shift, uncal herniation, or severe hemorrhage/hydrocephalous (small
             intra-lesional hemorrhage or anticipated surgical cavity is acceptable); patients with
             seizure at presentation who have been started on levetiracetam and have been stable
             for 48 hours prior to study registration are eligible at the discretion of treating
             physician

          -  Patients who have received systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy or approved oral targeted
             therapy or immunotherapy for 2 weeks, or other investigational agents for 3 weeks (4
             half-lives for any oral targeted agents), or radiotherapy to a non-brain site for 2
             weeks before initiation of IPdR therapy; patients who have recovered from serious
             (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] grade 3 or more higher) to
             grade 1 or less adverse events from the previous therapies are eligible;
             prior/current/future hormonal therapy and/or bisphosphonates are permitted with no
             minimum interval to initiation of study therapy; if indicated, patients can receive
             palliative radiation therapy to a non-brain site concurrent or immediately post-study
             treatment with no minimum interval to initiation of study therapy

          -  Patients must not have received prior whole brain radiation therapy; previous SRS/SRT
             done at least 3 weeks from the planned start of IPdR therapy is acceptable;
             SRS/SRT/fractionated boosts or neurosurgery can be performed once the dose limiting
             toxicity (DLT) assessment has been completed, if felt clinically necessary

          -  Patients with primary tumors including germ cell tumor, or lymphoma/leukemia

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agent

          -  Patients needing more than 8 mg dexamethasone per day at the time of start of WBRT
             will not be eligible to participate in the study; however, patients will be allowed
             entry into the study if it is medically safe to reduce the daily dose of dexamethasone
             to 8 mg or less from the day of the start of WBRT; the dexamethasone dose for such
             patients may be increased beyond 8 mg per day during the course of treatment if
             medically necessary; this increased need for dose should be communicated to the
             study's principal investigator, Dr Mohindra at the University of Maryland

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to IPdR

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness if it would increase the risk of toxicity or limit
             compliance with study requirements; this includes, but is not limited to, ongoing
             uncontrolled serious infection requiring intravenous (i.v.) antibiotics, progressive
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because IPdR is an agent with the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with IPdR, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with
             IPdR
