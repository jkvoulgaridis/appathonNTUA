      A Multicenter, Double-Blind, Randomized, Split-Face Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy
      of Revanesse® Ultra + (with Lidocaine) versus Revanesse® Ultra for the Correction of
      Nasolabial Folds to compare the safety and efficacy profiles of Revanesse® Ultra + (with
      lidocaine, hereafter referred to as Revanesse Ultra +) to Revanesse Ultra for subjects
      undergoing correction of nasolabial folds (NLFs)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, split-face study in subjects seeking
      nasolabial fold correction. Subjects will be treated with Revanesse Ultra + in the NLF on one
      side of the face and Revanesse Ultra in the NLF on the other side of the face. The side of
      the face for each study product will be randomly assigned. The investigator and the subject
      will be blinded to the treatment; injections of the study product will be performed by an
      unblinded injecting investigator.

      At each visit, investigator and subject evaluations of the treated areas will be performed
      and recorded

          -  Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible for the study:

               1. Men or women 22 years of age or older seeking augmentation therapy for correction
                  of bilateral nasolabial folds.

               2. Two fully visible bilateral nasolabial folds each with a Wrinkle Severity Rating
                  Scale Score (WSRS) of 3 or 4 that may be corrected with an injectable dermal
                  filler. The NLFs should be symmetrical, i.e., WSRS scores at NLFs on both sides
                  should be the same (both Moderate [3] or both Severe [4]).

               3. If female and of childbearing potential, a negative urine pregnancy test and

                  (excluding women who are surgically sterilized or postmenopausal for at least 2
                  years) must have a negative urine pregnancy test and must be willing to use a
                  medically accepted method of contraception during the study. The following are
                  considered acceptable methods of birth control for the purpose of this study:
                  oral contraceptives, contraceptive patches, contraceptive implant, vaginal
                  contraceptive, double barrier methods (e.g., condom and spermicide),
                  contraceptive injection (Depo-Provera®), intrauterine device (IUD), hormonal IUD
                  (Mirena®), and abstinence with a documented second acceptable method of birth
                  control if the subject becomes sexually active. Subjects entering the study who
                  are on hormonal contraceptives must have been on the method for at least 90 days
                  prior to the study and continue the method for the duration of the study.
                  Subjects who had used hormonal contraception and stopped must have stopped no
                  less than 90 days prior to Visit 1/Day 1.

               4. Ability to understand and comply with the requirements of the study.

               5. Willingness and ability to provide written informed consent. 6. Agree to refrain
                  from seeking other treatment for this condition during the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:

             procedures) within 6 months (180 days) prior to study entry.

          4. Use of any facial tissue augmenting therapy with non-permanent filler or aesthetic
             facial surgical therapy within 9 months prior to study entry.

          5. Has ever received semi-permanent fillers anywhere in the face or neck, or is planning
             to be implanted with these products during the study.

          6. Has a permanent implant placed in the NLF area.

          7. Evidence of scar-related disease or delayed healing activity within the past 1 year.

         16. Clinically significant organic disease including clinically significant
             cardiovascular, hepatic, pulmonary, neurologic, or renal disease or other medical
             condition, serious intercurrent illness, or extenuating circumstance that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, preclude participation in the trial.

         17. Received any investigational product within 30 days of signing the Informed Consent
             Form.
