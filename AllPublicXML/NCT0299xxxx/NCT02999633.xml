    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the efficacy of isatuximab.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the safety profile of isatuximab.

        -  To evaluate the duration of response (DOR).

        -  To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of isatuximab in participants with T-ALL or T-LBL.

        -  To evaluate immunogenicity of isatuximab in participants with T-ALL or T-LBL.

        -  To assess minimal residual disease (MRD) and correlate it with clinical outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study duration per participant included a 3-week screening period, an approximately 1
      year of treatment period or until disease progression or discontinuation for any other
      reason, and a follow-up period of at least 30 days after the last investigational medicinal
      product administration.
    </textblock>
  </detailed_description>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Due to an unsatisfactory benefit/risk ratio, as specified in &amp; 14.8.1 of the protocol, Sanofi
    decided to stop enrollment and terminate ACT14596 prematurely

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Objective Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until disease progression or death (maximum duration: 12.1 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response was defined as percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or with complete response with incomplete peripheral recovery (CRi) as per National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. CR was defined as no circulating blasts or extramedullary disease, no lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, skin/gum infiltration/testicular mass/central nervous system involvement, trilineage hematopoiesis and less than 5 percentage blasts, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than 1000 per micro liter, platelets less than 100 000 per micro liter, no recurrence for 4 weeks. CRi meet all criteria for complete response except platelet count and/or ANC.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until disease progression or death (maximum duration: 12.1 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>DOR defined as time (in days) from date of first response until date of first documented progressive disease (PD) or death (from any cause), whichever came first. Progressive disease as per NCCN guidelines was defined as increase of at least 25 percentage (%) in the absolute number of circulating or bone marrow blasts or development of extramedullary disease.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until disease progression or death (maximum duration: 12.1 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time interval (in days) from the date of first study drug administration to the date of first observation of PD or death due to any cause, whichever came first. PD as per NCCN guidelines was defined as increase of at least 25% in the absolute number of circulating or bone marrow blasts or development of extramedullary disease.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until death (maximum duration: 12.1 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Survival was defined as the time interval from the date of first study drug administration to the date of death due to any cause.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until death or study cut-off (maximum duration: 12.1 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Presence of MRD was measured by sequencing and/or flow cytometry in participants achieving CR and CRi. CR was defined as no circulating blasts or extramedullary disease, no lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, skin/gum infiltration/testicular mass/central nervous system involvement, trilineage hematopoiesis and less than 5 percentage blasts, ANC greater than 1000 per micro liter, platelets less than 100 000 per micro liter, no recurrence for 4 weeks. Complete response with incomplete blood count recovery meet all criteria for complete response except platelet count and/or ANC.</description>

          -  Participants must had a known diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) of T
             cell origin, including T-LBL and T-ALL with extramedullary involvement at relapse
             confirmed by biopsy.

          -  Participants must be previously treated for T-ALL or T-LBL and have relapsed or are
             refractory to most recent treatment. Participants in first relapse were be eligible

          -  Participants must had been previously exposed to nelarabine in countries where this
             drug is available (unless due to a contraindication to its use or administrative
             issue).

          -  No more than 3 prior salvage therapies.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with immunotherapy/investigational agents within 3 weeks, chemotherapy
             within 2 weeks of study treatment. Must have recovered from acute toxicity before

          -  Prior stem cell transplant within 4 months and/or evidence of active systemic Graft
             versus Host Disease and/or immunosuppressive therapy for Graft versus Host Disease
             within 1 week before the first study treatment administration.

          -  Clinical evidence of active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia.

          -  T-ALL with testicular involvement alone.

        The above information was not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a
