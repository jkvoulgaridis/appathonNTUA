    <time_frame>Day 6</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical resolution of adenoviral conjunctivitis was defined as the absence (score = 0) of bulbar conjunctival injection and watery conjunctival discharge in the study eye. Bulbar conjunctival injection was assessed based on a 0 (Normal conjunctival vascular pattern)-4 (Markedly prominent, intense diffuse hyperemia) scale which used pictures from the validated bulbar redness (VBR) scale. Watery conjunctival discharge was assessed based on a 0-3 scale (0 - None and 3 - Severe: Abundant quantity of watery discharge observed in the lower conjunctival fornix and in the lower lid margin). The study eye was defined based on participants bulbar conjunctival redness and watery conjunctival discharge scores, as well as his/her cell culture-immunofluorescence assay (CC-IFA) results at baseline. Higher scores represented worse symptoms for both scales. Percentage of participants with clinical resolution on Day 6 was reported.</description>

        <description>Clinical resolution of adenoviral conjunctivitis was defined as the absence (score = 0) of bulbar conjunctival injection and watery conjunctival discharge in the study eye. Bulbar conjunctival injection was assessed based on a 0 (Normal conjunctival vascular pattern)-4 (Markedly prominent, intense diffuse hyperemia) scale which used pictures from the validated bulbar redness (VBR) scale. Watery conjunctival discharge was assessed based on a 0-3 scale (0 - None and 3 - Severe: Abundant quantity of watery discharge observed in the lower conjunctival fornix and in the lower lid margin). The study eye was defined based on participants bulbar conjunctival redness and watery conjunctival discharge scores, as well as his/her cell culture-immunofluorescence assay (CC-IFA) results at baseline. Higher scores represented worse symptoms for both scales. Percentage of participants with clinical resolution on Day 6 was reported.</description>

        <description>Clinical resolution of adenoviral conjunctivitis was defined as the absence (score = 0) of bulbar conjunctival injection and watery conjunctival discharge in the study eye. Bulbar conjunctival injection was assessed based on a 0 (Normal conjunctival vascular pattern)-4 (Markedly prominent, intense diffuse hyperemia) scale which used pictures from the validated bulbar redness (VBR) scale. Watery conjunctival discharge was assessed based on a 0-3 scale (0 - None and 3 - Severe: Abundant quantity of watery discharge observed in the lower conjunctival fornix and in the lower lid margin). The study eye was defined based on participant's bulbar conjunctival redness and watery conjunctival discharge scores, as well as his/her cell culture-immunofluorescence assay (CC-IFA) results at baseline. Higher scores represented worse symptoms for both scales. Percentage of participants with clinical resolution on Day 3, 8 and 12/ET was reported.</description>
