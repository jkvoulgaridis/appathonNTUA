    <textblock>
      Chronic Hepatitis B carriers (normal LFTs and viral load &lt; 2 x 10^4 IU/ml are not recommended
      to be treated by guidelines as they are at low risk for complications. However, it is unclear
      if treatment can enhance HBsAg loss which has been shown to be associated with significantly
      lower risk of complications compared to those without HBsAg loss. Consequently, this is a
      proof of concept study to determine the possibility of HBsAg loss in Chronic Hepatitis B
      carriers in a randomised open label clinical trial comparing no treatment to 24 weeks
      peg-interferon alpha 2a or 48 weeks peginterferon alpha 2a (randomised 1:1:1). The primary
      endpoint of HBsAg loss will be evaluated 24 weeks after the end of therapy for those on
      therapy and matched to an equivalent timepoint in the control arm. The sample size
      calculation is 30 patients in each arm for a 20% difference between any experimental arm and
      the control arm.

      1. Hypothesis: Chronic hepatitis B carriers (defined as HBeAg negative hepatitis B patients
      with HBV DNA &lt;2x104 IU/mL, absence of cirrhosis and normal ALT) may experience higher rates
      of HBsAg seroclearance with pegylated interferon therapy.

      2A. Primary Objective

        -  The proportion of subjects with HBsAg loss at Week 24 of followup after treatment with
           24 or 48 weeks of pegylated interferon alpha 2a compared to no therapy.

           2B. Secondary Objective

        -  The proportion of subjects who experience HBsAg loss with 24 versus 48 weeks of
           pegylated interferon at the end of treatment, and at end of followup.

        -  The rate of quantitative HBsAg decline in relation to HBsAg loss

        -  The proportion of subjects with virological response (HBV DNA level &lt;13.5IU/mL) at Weeks
           12 and 24 of treatment, and week 24 of followup.

           2C Study population: 90 patient will be enrolled.

      4.1 Study Treatment

      Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration:

      Peginterferon α-2a (PEG), 180mcg, will be administered weekly by subcutaneous injection for
      the specified period of time (see Study Design, Arms B and C). Pegasys® (Roche
      Pharmaceuticals).

      Peginterferon α-2a (PEG), 180mcg subcutaneous injection once weekly

      randomised after completing screening. Patients will be randomly allocated to three parallel
      arms: no therapy, 24 weeks peg-interferon alpha 2a, and 48 weeks interferon alpha 2a.
      Patients will be monitored 4 weekly initial then 12 weekly till end of therapy, then for an
      additional 24 weeks after completing therapy. Patients on no therapy will be monitored for 72
      weeks.
