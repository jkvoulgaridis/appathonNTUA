      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of Enantone in the
      treatment of CPP in Chinese participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being evaluated in this study is called Enantone (leuprorelin). Enantone is used to
      treat children who have CPP. This study will look at long term safety and efficacy of
      leuprorelin in the treatment of Chinese participants with CPP.

      The study will enroll approximately 300 participants.

      All participants who have received leuprorelin 30 mcg/kg to &lt;90 mcg/kg or 90 mcg/kg to 180
      mcg/kg per body weight, injection, subcutaneously, every 4 weeks up to at least 9 continuous
      months during the index period from September 1st 1998 to September 30th 2018 will be
      observed.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in China. Data will be collected over period of 20
      months.

             of each of the following parameters at the end of enantone treatment in the medical
             records: Tanner staging, estradiol or testosterone level, and FSH and LH level. The
             participant should have at least one record of bone age prior to the initiation
             gonadotropin releasing hormone analogs (GnRHa) therapy with enantone to support the
             diagnosis of CPP. In addition, should have at least one record of bone age during
             treatment with enantone.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has been treated with leuprorelin acetate or any other GnRHa for conditions other than
             CPP.

          <title>Tanner Staging Evaluation</title>
          <description>Tanner Stage is used to define physical measurements of sexual development based on external primary and secondary sex characteristics. Female and male participants were evaluated for breast development and genital development respectively and both genders for pubic hair distribution based on a 5-stage scale ranging from Stage I (prepubertal/preadolescent characteristics) to Stage V (mature or adult characteristics). Participants classified as having progression if either breast/genitals or pubic hair were present. Otherwise participant is classified as regression or no progression.</description>
