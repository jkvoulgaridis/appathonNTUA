      This study will assess the efficacy of a neuromodulation device for the treatment of episodic
      migraine headache.

      This study is a multi-center, triple-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial
      for adjunctive prophylactic treatment of episodic migraine headache (with or without aura)
      using neuromodulation device developed by Scion NeuroStim, LLC (SNS). The investigational use
      of the device for episodic migraine headache has been reviewed by the FDA and is classified
      as NSR (non-significant risk).
