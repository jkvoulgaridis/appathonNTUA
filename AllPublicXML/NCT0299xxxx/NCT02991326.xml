      This study aim to contribute with the investigation of the therapeutic effect of osteopathic
      manipulative treatment in pain intensity and Quality of Life in individuals diagnosed with
      temporomandibular disorder who make use of occlusal splints.

      Objective:

      It is known the multifactorial etiology of Temporomandibular Disorders(TMD) which raises the
      need of a multidisciplinary approach for its treatment. Studies have presented good results
      about the use of occlusal splints along with other therapies. The Osteopathic Manipulative
      Treatment(OMT) has as characteristic the philosophy of global approach and precise functional
      diagnosis. Based on a lack of randomized blind trials about this subject, This study aim to
      contribute with the investigation of the therapeutic effect OMT in pain intensity and Quality
      of Life in participants diagnosed with TMD making use of occlusal splints.

      Methodology:

      This study is a randomized blind trial, with sample composed by 18 participants referred to
      the occlusion clinic of Fluminense Federal University (UFF), diagnosed by the team of
      dentists and interns of occlusion clinic through the Research Diagnostic Criteria for
      Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD). The participants will complete the Short Form 36
      Health Survey(SF-36) to measure the quality of life, and pain intensity diagram with Numeric
      Rating Scale (NRS) to measure the pain intensity. The sample will be randomized into 2 groups
      (9 individuals for each): Test Group (TG) - patients subject to Clinical Treatment with
      splints (CT) offered at the Occlusion Clinic unit along with Osteopathic Manipulative
      Treatment - OMT. Control Group (CG) - patients subject only to CT and will receive a sham
      treatment that simulate the OMT to blind these participants. After the treatment, patients
      will be re-evaluated in 8 weeks' time.

      Statistical analysis:

      The SF-36 and the pain intensity and the most intense pain evaluation diagram with Numeric
      Rating Scale (NRS) will be performed by the Wilcoxon's non parametric test.

    <description>The Osteopathic manipulative treatment will follow the approach bellow (using latex gloves for intra oral techniques):
Compression of the fourth ventricle;
inhibitory intra-oral pressure technique (IPT) of the temporal muscle;
inhibition of the inferior head of the lateral pterygoid muscle;
intra-oral inhibition of the masseter muscle;
Balanced ligamentous tension (BLT) of the accessory ligaments - sphenopalatine;
BLT of the accessory ligaments - pterygomandibular raphe;
sphenopalatine ganglion technique;
Craniosacral rebalancing;</description>
