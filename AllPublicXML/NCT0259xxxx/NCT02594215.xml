      Background:

      Proteus syndrome (PS) is caused by a mutation in the AKT1 gene. This gene makes a protein
      that communicates with other proteins in the body to make cells grow. The AKT1 mutation
      changes chemical signals in the body and causes overgrowth. PS can be fatal. The drug ARQ 092
      reduces signals from the AKT1 protein. This may reduce or stabilize some of the overgrowth in
      people with PS. Researchers want to find the best dose of ARQ 092 based on its effect on
      tissues in people with PS.

      Objective:

      To determine the safety, tolerability, and recommended dose of ARQ 092 in people with PS.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 6 and older with PS

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine tests.

      Participants will take ARQ 092 by mouth once daily for up to 12 28-day cycles.

      Participants must stay near the NIH Clinical Center (CC) during the whole first cycle, for
      weekly visits to the CC. For cycle 2, they will have visits every 2 weeks. They will have 1
      visit before cycles 3 and 4, and once before every other cycle for cycles 5 11. The final
      visit will be at the end of cycle 12. Visits may include:

      Small skin samples taken.

      ECG: Soft electrodes on the skin record heart signals.

      Echocardiogram: A small probe held to the chest takes pictures of the heart.

      MRI: Participants will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body.

      Joint and mobility function tests.

      Participants will complete surveys by phone and in person.

      Participants will keep a daily medication and symptom diary.

    <textblock>
      Proteus syndrome is a rare segmental overgrowth disorder caused by a somatic gain of function
      mutation in the oncogene AKT1, encoding the AKT1 kinase. The disorder is progressive, with
      high morbidity and mortality there are very few living adults with this disease. Tissues and
      cell lines from patients with Proteus syndrome harbor admixtures of mutant alleles that
      ranged from &lt;1% to approximately 50%. This mutation causes constitutive activation of AKT1,
      through Ser473 and Thr308 phosphorylation. This activation stimulates the AKT/PI3K pathway,
      mediating processes including increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis. The
      progressive nature of the disorder and the mechanism of disease (gain of function) make AKT1
      an excellent target for therapeutics, specifically repression. The AKT/PI3K pathway is
      mutated in numerous cancers as well. Because it is commonly mutated in cancer, pharmaceutical
      companies are interested in targeting this molecule with inhibitors. Indeed, Proteus syndrome
      can be considered a simple model for cancer therapeutics, as these patients are known to
      harbor only a single activating mutation instead of the hundreds or thousands that are
      mutated in cancers. ArQule Inc. has developed a small molecule, ARQ 092 that effectively
      inhibits AKT, with the lowest IC(50) for AKT1 (as compared to AKT2 or AKT3, and orders of
      magnitude lower for other kinases). This agent has undergone significant development with
      animal toxicity studies and is currently in phase I trials in patients with different types
      of cancer. In addition, we have performed in vitro testing with ARQ 092 in cells from
      patients with Proteus syndrome and demonstrated reduction in AKT1 phosphorylation at doses in
      the range of achievable blood levels in humans with low toxicity. Because Proteus syndrome is
      a chronic disease, typical approaches to defining the recommended phase II dose by
      determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) are not appropriate - it is unreasonable to
      propose that patients would tolerate significant side effects for prolonged time periods. As
      an initial trial for this disease, we propose a phase I study to determine a recommended dose
      for subsequent trials, which will determine the efficacy of ARQ 092 in Proteus syndrome. The
      recommended phase II dose will be determined based on the tolerability of ARQ 092 in children
      and adults with Proteus syndrome and measures of drug levels in plasma and affected tissues
      in patients with Proteus syndrome and measures of tissue phosphorylation of AKT1. We
      hypothesize that the recommended dose of ARQ 092 will be substantially below that of doses
      used in patients with cancer and that this will lead to a highly favorable risk - benefit
      ratio on which we can base future efficacy studies.

          -  6 years of age or older. The age limits including children and adolescents were chosen
             because childhood and puberty are considered to be the greatest risk for disease
             progression, and ARQ 092 may provide the most benefit to this young group of patients.
             In addition, an important objective of this study is to characterize the
             pharmacokinetics of ARQ 092 in the pediatric population since it has been better
             studied in adults.

          -  Not using nor has used within the past 6 months any medication known to affect the
             AKT/PI3K pathway (e.g., everolimus), reviewed by NIHCC pharmacist.

          -  Performance status: Patients greater than or equal to 16 years of age must have a
             Karnofsky performance level of greater than or equal to 40%, and adolescents 6 - 16

          -  Body surface area of at least 0.5 m^2

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding females are excluded due to potential risks of fetal and

          -  Patients who anticipate the need for surgical intervention within the first three
             cycles (3 months), as surgical intervention during the period of DLT evaluation may
