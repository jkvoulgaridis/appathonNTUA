  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Patients With Objective Response (OR) in Part A According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>CT Scan at Weeks 8 &amp; 12 (for week 12 tumor assessment, time window is +1week), then every 8 weeks thereafter, after week 52, assessments will be performed every 12 weeks until progression or start of further treatment , ie., up to approximately 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of patients with objective response (OR) in part A according to RECIST 1.1. Objective Response defined as patients with tumour size reduction of a predefined amount using RECIST 1.1 in part A. Objective response included both confirmed Partial Response (PR) plus Complete Response (CR) as measured by Computed Tomography (CT) scan or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) according to RECIST 1.1.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions asking as reference the baseline sum LD. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Patients With Disease Control (DC) in Part A</measure>
    <time_frame>CT Scan at Weeks 8 &amp; 12(for week 12 tumor assessment, time window is +1week), then every 8 weeks thereafter, after week 52, assessments will be performed every 12 weeks until progression or start of further treatment, ie up to approximately 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of patients with disease control (DC) in part A. Disease control defined as patients who have achieved confirmed complete response, partial response and stable disease as measured by CT scan or MRI according to RECIST 1.1 in part A.
Tumour Response is based on clinical, radiological or other assessment. Clopper−Pearson method used for confidence limits.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, taking as reference the baseline sum LD, nor sufficient increase to qualify for Progression (PD) taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS) in Part A</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of starting treatment of afatinib to the date of disease progression or to the date of death, ie up to approximately 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Progression Free Survival (PFS) defined as the time from the date of starting treatment of afatinib to the date of disease progression per RECIST 1.1, or to the date of death no matter which happens first in part A.
Median and 95% confidence interval (CI) are calculated from an unadjusted Kaplan−Meier curve.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment of afatinib until death from any cause, ie up to approximately 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (OS) defined as the time from start of treatment of afatinib until death from any cause.
Median and 95% CI are calculated from an unadjusted Kaplan−Meier curve.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Progression (TTP) in Part A</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of starting treatment of afatinib to the date of disease progression , ie up to approximately 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Time to progression (TTP) defined as the time from the date of starting treatment of afatinib to the date of disease progression per RECIST 1.1 in part A.
Median and 95% CI are calculated from an unadjusted Kaplan−Meier curve.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR) in Part A</measure>
    <time_frame>CT Scan at Weeks 8 &amp; 12(for week 12 tumor assessment, time window is +1week), then every 8 weeks thereafter, after week 52, assessments will be performed every 12 weeks until progression or start of further treatment, ie up to approximately 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response (DoR) defined as the time from the first documented response PR or CR to the date of tumor progression evaluated according to RECIST 1.1 or death in part A.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.
No patient had objective response and DoR was not analysed.</description>

Tumour Response is based on clinical, radiological or other assessment. Clopper−Pearson method used for confidence limits.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, taking as reference the baseline sum LD, nor sufficient increase to qualify for Progression (PD) taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>
