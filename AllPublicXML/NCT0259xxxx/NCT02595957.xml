      Background:

      Genes are the instructions a person s body uses to function. Genome sequencing is a new way
      to look at genes that your main research team is using to learn the causes of the condition
      they are studying. When a new cause is found this way, it is called a primary variant. Each
      person has many variants. Most do not cause disease. Sequencing can also find secondary
      variants. These are not related to the condition your main research team is studying, but may
      show a person to be at high risk for cancer or another condition. Researchers want to learn
      more about what it means to have a secondary variant.

      Objectives:

      To find new gene changes that lead to certain medical conditions. To better understand the
      causes of certain diseases. To learn about how people understand their genetic test results.

      Eligibility:

      People with rare diseases who have already consented to and enrolled in another protocol run
      by a group other than the National Human Genome Research Institute.

      Design:

      DNA samples that were already collected will be studied.

      Participants may be asked to send in a second DNA sample (blood or saliva). These will be
      used to verify any findings.

      If a primary variant for the participant s health condition is found through genome
      sequencing, this will be shared with the participant by their primary research team.

      If the participant has a secondary finding, it will be shared by phone call or
      videoconference by this research group in the National Human Genome Research Institute. Some
      participants may get their results in person at the clinic.

      Three months after getting their secondary findings, participants will do an online survey
      and phone interview. They will be asked about how they have used the information.

      Some people who do not receive a secondary finding from genome sequencing will be asked to do
      an online survey three months after the get that result.

      Participants who have a secondary finding can get genetic counseling.

      The implementation of genome and exome sequencing creates challenges and opportunities,

      particularly with respect to the return of medically-actionable secondary findings (SF). This
      study seeks to investigate the utility and effectiveness of returning SF generated via
      research or clinical sequencing by studying individuals who have received such findings. Our
      objectives with this protocol have evolved over time and have been substantially informed by
      our experiences in returning SF through sequencing initiatives such as the ClinSeq study, the
      Clinical Center Genomics Opportunity (CCGO), and the Secondary Genomic Findings Service
      (SGFS). Our work with these studies/initiatives suggests that much remains unknown about how
      recipients of SF understand these findings, communicate them to their health professionals
      and families, and whether they adhere to recommended health-preserving actions in both the
      short and longterm. As well, recipients of SF are an unselected population in which to
      investigate penetrance of disorders associated with SF genes. Thus, this protocol aims to
      explore important questions of clinical utility associated with SF return and penetrance of
      SF-related disorders. Healthcare actions and family communication (clinical utility) are
      assessed by interviews and surveys with SF recipients. This protocol also includes a pilot
      program in which selected participants will be invited to the NIH for bespoke phenotyping to
      uncover the presence of disease and explore avenues to develop interventions to enhance
      outcomes.

        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:

          -  Any English- or Spanish-speaking recipient of a SF. The circumstances under which SF
             are generated (either clinically or as part of research studies) indicate that these
             individuals may represent a wide range of ages of patients, children and

        adults.

          -  For minors or decisionally-impaired adults, one parent/guardian, typically the self
             designated primary health care support parent, will be enrolled. If the parents claim
             equal roles, whichever of the parents selects to participate in the interview/survey
             will be enrolled.

          -  It is important to emphasize that we will not ask minors or decisionally impaired
             adults to participate in the social and behavioral components of the study. Because
             validated instruments for our surveys largely do not exist in languages other than
             English, we cannot administer these measures to non-English speakers.
