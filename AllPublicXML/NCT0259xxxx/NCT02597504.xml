  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study will evaluate a standalone software application and is designed to
      standardize and validate new neurocognitive screening testing for children aged 6 through 11,
      and adolescents and adults ages 12 through 75.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate recently developed computerized tasks sensitive to
      changes in neurocognitive performance after a concussion. These tests were designed to help
      measure the effects of concussion on cognitive processes (e.g., memory, attention, brain
      speed) and visual functioning.
