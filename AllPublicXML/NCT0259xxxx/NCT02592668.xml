  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study to test the use of epidural stimulation to restore volitional
      function previously lost due to spinal cord injury.

      Previous studies conducted in animal models, performed elsewhere and here at Mayo Clinic,
      have shown that direct electrical stimulation of the spinal cord increases the excitability
      of spared neuronal connections within the site of injury, thereby enhancing signal
      transmission and allowing recovery of previously lost volitional function. Recently, epidural
      electrical stimulation of the lumbosacral spinal cord in four individuals with spinal cord
      injury (SCI) has restored motor and autonomic function below the level of injury. Despite
      positive results, further translational research is needed to validate these findings. The
      goal of this proposal is to perform epidural stimulation to restore volitional function in
      patients with SCI. In two patients, we will implant an epidural stimulator onto the dorsal
      aspect of the lumbosacral spinal cord dura mater. Patients will undergo a structured program
      of daily physical rehabilitation, treadmill step training, and epidural stimulation to
      recover motor, sensory, and autonomic function.
