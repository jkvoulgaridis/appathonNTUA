  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination product (URG101) is safe and
      effective versus its individual components (Heparin Sodium and Lidocaine Hydrochloride) for
      the treatment of Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome. The study is randomized and
      double-blinded such that neither the subject nor doctor will know which drug or placebo is
      received.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter, single-dose,
      pharmacokinetic study designed to determine the efficacy and safety of the combination
      product (URG101) compared with its individual components (Heparin Sodium and Lidocaine
      Hydrochloride).

      Eligible subjects exhibiting moderate to severe symptoms of bladder pain associated with
      their diagnosis of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome who have signed informed
      consent, will be screened and provisionally enrolled for intravesical treatment.

      On the day of study drug administration subjects will be randomized (2:1:2:1;
      URG101:placebo:lidocaine:heparin) and will receive a single administration of one of four
      intravesical treatments in a blinded fashion, based on random assignment:

        1. URG101 (buffered lidocaine-heparin)

        2. Placebo (phosphate buffer)

        3. Lidocaine hydrocholoride buffered alone

        4. Heparin sodium buffered alone

      Efficacy and safety assessments will be completed for 24 hours after study drug
      administration. End of Study Follow-up will be completed by telephone 48 to 72 hours after
      study drug administration.

             interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome prior to or at time of screening

          5. Have a score of ≥ 15 and &lt; 30 on the PUF questionnaire, completed at screening

          6. A minimum score of 5 is required on the VAS

          7. Have been using a stable dose of hormone therapy for ≥ 3 months, if female and
             currently taking hormone therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or breastfeeding. For females of child bearing potential and males, if
             sexually active, must be willing to commit to an acceptable method of birth control
             for the duration of the study.

          2. Have a known hypersensitivity to heparin or lidocaine

          3. Have used any local anesthetic by any route within 24 hours prior to study drug
             administration, or used a lidocaine patch within 14 days prior to study drug
             administration

          4. Have used a tricyclic antidepressant or a gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) analogue
             (gabapentin or pregabalin) unless taking the medication for ≥ 3 weeks. The stable dose
             of gabapentin may not exceed 1,200 mg per day, and the stable dose of pregabalin may
             not exceed 150 mg per day.

          5. Have used any pain medication within 6 hours prior to study drug administration

          6. Have used narcotics or medical marijuana ≤ 3 weeks prior to study entry (generic
             names: fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, levorphanol, medical marijuana,
             methadone, morphine, oxycodone, propoxyphene, tramadol). Subjects who have received
             codeine within this time period may be admitted if the use is not chronic, and not
             within 6 hours of enrollment, such that they are not at risk for GI or opiate
             withdrawal symptoms that in the opinion of the investigator would impact the subject's
             study participation due to their ability to follow the study protocol or bias study
             results.

          7. Have used prohibited drugs as determined by self-report, positive urine drug screen,
             or in the opinion of the investigator be under the influence of drugs affecting

             may cause neurogenic bladder (including Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis,
             epilepsy, myasthenia gravis, movement disorders, spinal cord damage)

         10. Have pain or a pain disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make it

         13. Had bladder instillation therapy within 7 days prior to study entry or had a prior
             bladder instillation with heparin and lidocaine and did not respond

         20. Have had any of the following: bacterial, chemical (including ketamine and
             cyclophosphamide) or radiation cystitis; gynecological, urological or rectal cancer;
