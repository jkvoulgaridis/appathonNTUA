  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 dose-exploration study of LAM-002A administered by mouth in patients with
      relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL. Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK),
      pharmacodynamics (PD),and preliminary anti-tumor activity will be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LAM-002A is supplied as 25-mg or 50-mg capsules and will be administered two times daily or
      three times daily by mouth in repeated 28-day cycles. Patients will be advised to take the
      doses at the same time each day.

      A 3 + 3 design will be utilized to define a maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The MTD is defined
      as the highest dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients (i.e., &lt; 33%) experiences a
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in the dose cohort.

      Once the dose and schedule are established, additional patients will be treated to better
      characterize the safety, tolerability,PK, PD, and anti-tumor activity of LAM-002A when
      administered alone or in combination with rituximab or atezolizumab.
