    <measure>Positive Blood Cultures (PBC's) Per 1,000 Central Venous Catheter (CVC)-Days</measure>
    <time_frame>Through the 13-month intervention period.</time_frame>
    <description>This was calculated by dividing the cumulative number of PBCs by cumulative time at-risk as follows.
The National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Center for Disease Control (CDC) 21-day outpatient hemodialysis patient rule is as follows: A PBC is considered a new event and counted only if it occurred 21 days or more after a previously reported PBC in the same patient; new PBC events are based on blood cultures drawn as an outpatient or within one calendar day after a hospital admission. Following a PBC additional same-type events were counted beginning 21 days following the initial event; the CVC-days were counted during this period. The CVC-days were calculated by summing the number of days each patient was at-risk of accruing a PBC. This analysis included all subjects that participated in the study that were not otherwise censored to more accurately count CVC-days.</description>

        <title>Positive Blood Cultures (PBC's) Per 1,000 Central Venous Catheter (CVC)-Days</title>
        <description>This was calculated by dividing the cumulative number of PBCs by cumulative time at-risk as follows.
The National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Center for Disease Control (CDC) 21-day outpatient hemodialysis patient rule is as follows: A PBC is considered a new event and counted only if it occurred 21 days or more after a previously reported PBC in the same patient; new PBC events are based on blood cultures drawn as an outpatient or within one calendar day after a hospital admission. Following a PBC additional same-type events were counted beginning 21 days following the initial event; the CVC-days were counted during this period. The CVC-days were calculated by summing the number of days each patient was at-risk of accruing a PBC. This analysis included all subjects that participated in the study that were not otherwise censored to more accurately count CVC-days.</description>

      <desc>The run-in data was used to determine pre-study demographics and PBC rate. No adverse event analysis was performed for this period since these patients were not enrolled in the study. This was a pragmatic post market study. There was an informed consent waiver and there were no study case report forms (CRF's). Treatment arm adverse events were monitored during the 13-month intervention period using the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database.</desc>
