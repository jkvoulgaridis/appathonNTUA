  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the potential effect of reducing nicotine content or menthol or both in
      men. It will also examine whether there are gender differences in manipulating tobacco
      flavors and nicotine concentrations in cigarettes on smoking behavior.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The FDA has the regulatory authority to reduce, but not eliminate, nicotine from cigarettes.
      The Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee has noted, among other things, that
      removal of menthol cigarettes from the marketplace would benefit the public health. A parent
      study (NCT02048852) examines the potential impact of these two regulatory actions alone and
      in combination in female menthol smokers. This supplemental study will recruit an additional
      group of male menthol smokers, which will examine whether there are gender differences in
      manipulating flavors and nicotine concentrations in cigarettes on smoking behavior. The
      approach to add the opposite sex allows findings of sex/gender to be incorporated in the
      design and development of new technologies (i.e., modified cigarettes). Emerging research
      shows that women may be more responsive to the non-nicotine sensory aspects of smoking such
      as menthol flavor, whereas men may smoke primarily for nicotine intake. Consequently, this
      study expects to observe gender differences in response to manipulating flavors and nicotine
      content in cigarettes.
