  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase Ib/II, open-label, multicenter, non-randomized study will evaluate the safety,
      efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of induction treatment consisting of atezolizumab in
      combination with either obinutuzumab + bendamustine (Atezo-G-benda) or obinutuzumab + CHOP
      (Atezo-G-CHOP) in participants with FL and atezolizumab + rituximab + chemotherapy
      (Atezo-R-CHOP) in participants with DLBCL, followed by post-induction treatment consisting of
      either atezolizumab plus obinutuzumab (Atezo-G) in participants with FL who achieve a
      complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) at end of induction (EOI) or atezolizumab
      alone in participants with DLBCL who achieve a CR at EOI.

    <time_frame>Up to approximately 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Primary end point was positron emission tomography (PET) CR at EOI by IRC according to modified Lugano classification using PET/CT scan. CR was defined as a score of 1 (no uptake above background), 2 (uptake less than or equal to [&lt;/=] mediastinum), or 3 (uptake less than [&lt;] mediastinum but &lt;/=liver) with or without a residual mass on PET 5-point scale (5-PS), for lymph nodes and extralymphatic sites; no new lesions; no evidence of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid disease in bone marrow; and normal/immunohistochemistry (IHC)-negative bone marrow morphology. All PET evaluable 1L FL and 1L DLBCL patients with at least one dose of atezolizumab were included in efficacy population.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to approximately 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to approximately 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor response assessment was performed by the investigator according to modified Lugano classification using PET/CT scan. CR was defined as a score of 1 (no uptake above background), 2 (uptake &lt;/=mediastinum), or 3 (uptake &lt;mediastinum but &lt;/=liver) with or without a residual mass on PET 5-PS, for lymph nodes and extralymphatic sites; no new lesions; no evidence of FDG-avid disease in bone marrow; and normal/IHC-negative bone marrow morphology. 90% confidence interval (CI) for percentage of responders was calculated using Clopper-Pearson method. All PET evaluable 1L FL and 1L DLBCL patients with at least one dose of atezolizumab were included in efficacy population.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With CR at EOI, as Determined by the IRC Using Modified Cheson 2007 Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Complete response according to the modified Cheson 2007 criteria using PET/CT scan: complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms if present prior to therapy, liver and spleen have returned to normal size (if enlarged at baseline), If the bone marrow was involved by lymphoma prior to treatment, the infiltrate must have cleared on repeat bone marrow biopsy. Partial Response (PR): at least 50% regression of measurable disease compared to tumors measured by a baseline scan and no new sites; no increase in the size of the other nodes, liver, or spleen; with the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs is usually assessable and no measurable disease should be present. All PET evaluable 1L FL and 1L DLBCL patients with at least one dose of atezolizumab were included in efficacy population.</description>

        <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

          <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>
          <population>The safety analysis population consisted of all participants who received at least one dose of study drug. Safety analyses were based on the treatment that participants actually received.</population>

        <description>Tumor response assessment was performed by the investigator according to modified Lugano classification using PET/CT scan. CR was defined as a score of 1 (no uptake above background), 2 (uptake &lt;/=mediastinum), or 3 (uptake &lt;mediastinum but &lt;/=liver) with or without a residual mass on PET 5-PS, for lymph nodes and extralymphatic sites; no new lesions; no evidence of FDG-avid disease in bone marrow; and normal/IHC-negative bone marrow morphology. 90% confidence interval (CI) for percentage of responders was calculated using Clopper-Pearson method. All PET evaluable 1L FL and 1L DLBCL patients with at least one dose of atezolizumab were included in efficacy population.</description>

          <description>Objective response: having CR or PR as assessed according to the modified response criteria for iNHL (Modified Cheson et al, 2007). CR: Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms if present prior to therapy, liver and spleen have returned to normal size (if enlarged at baseline), If the bone marrow was involved by lymphoma prior to treatment, the infiltrate must have cleared on repeat bone marrow biopsy. PR: at least 50% regression of measurable disease compared to tumors measured by a baseline scan and no new sites; no increase in the size of the other nodes, liver, or spleen; with the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs is usually assessable and no measurable disease should be present.
