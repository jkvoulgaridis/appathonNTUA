      The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of i.v. adrenaline infusion as
      an early and fast haemodynamic stabilizer, associated with a tight tissue perfusion
      monitoring, in the context of a stepwise progression in the treatment of cardiogenic shock,
      including ventricular mechanical support.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiogenic shock is characterized by a decrease in cardiac output and increased ventricular
      pressures, with subsequent symptoms and signs of systemic hypoperfusion. In spite of the
      multiple pharmacological chances the in-hospital mortality rate is still very high (around
      60% of patients) and nowadays there is not a therapeutic &quot;reference standard&quot; associated with
      an improved survival at short and midterm. Adrenaline is a mainstay of resuscitation therapy
      during cardiopulmonary arrest, however, it is not clear whether this inotrope actually
      facilitates an improvement in patients affected by cardiogenic shock. In a small local
      evidence-based experience, contrary to current opinion, it has been shown that adrenaline may
      still have a role in the treatment of patients with low output state. This phase II study
      tests the hypothesis that adrenaline infusion, integrated in a multistep approach at
      increasing intensity, can be a valid support with limited side effects.
