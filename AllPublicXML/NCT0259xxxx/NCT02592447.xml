    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Targeted
      Therapy Fatigue (CBT-TTF) with fatigued chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients on
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for feasibility, acceptability and potential efficacy
      relative to usual care only in a small-scale randomized controlled trial.

    <measure>Self-reported Fatigue Scores - Change From Baseline Per Scoring Category</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline versus follow-up fatigue will be assessed with the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale (FACIT-Fatigue) v.4, a 13-item self-report measure yielding total score with demonstrated reliability, validity, sensitivity to change and an identified Minimally Clinically Important Difference (MID). The fatigue subscale consists of 13 items asking about fatigue in the past 7 days. Items are summed to produce a score ranging from 0-52 with lower scores indicating greater fatigue. A difference of 3 points on the fatigue subscale indicates a clinically-important difference.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported Quality of Life (QoL) Scores - Change From Baseline Per Scoring Category</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline versus follow-up quality of life will be assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy General Scale (FACT-G) v.4, a 27-item measure yielding total score and scores for physical, social/family, emotional, and functional well-being of demonstrated reliability, validity, and sensitivity to change. FACT-G consists of 4 subscales: physical well-being (PWB), functional well-being (FWB), emotional well-being (EWB) and social well-being (SWB). Scores on the four subscales are summed to produce a total score ranging from 0 to 108 with higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>

        <title>Self-reported Fatigue Scores - Change From Baseline Per Scoring Category</title>
        <description>Baseline versus follow-up fatigue will be assessed with the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale (FACIT-Fatigue) v.4, a 13-item self-report measure yielding total score with demonstrated reliability, validity, sensitivity to change and an identified Minimally Clinically Important Difference (MID). The fatigue subscale consists of 13 items asking about fatigue in the past 7 days. Items are summed to produce a score ranging from 0-52 with lower scores indicating greater fatigue. A difference of 3 points on the fatigue subscale indicates a clinically-important difference.</description>

Therapy for Targeted Therapy-related Fatigue (TTF): Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Targeted Therapy-related Fatigue (CBT-TTF) group will receive cognitive behavior therapy to help manage fatigue via FaceTime on an iPad, which will be provided to participants. Participants will meet with a trained therapist who will outline their therapy plan and will be taught how to use the iPad for upcoming therapy sessions. The sessions will initially be held weekly, but the therapist may schedule sessions at 1-, 2-, or 3-week intervals during the 18 week study period.

Wait-List Control Condition (WLC): Participants randomized to Wait-List Control Condition will continue to receive care under direction of their Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) physician. Physicians will be informed by email of patients’ participation on the basis of elevated fatigue and their randomization to WLC. Chart review and a patient self-report form will be used at baseline and follow-up assessments to determine what, if any, services or interventions participants received in the preceding 18 weeks that might address fatigue.</description>
