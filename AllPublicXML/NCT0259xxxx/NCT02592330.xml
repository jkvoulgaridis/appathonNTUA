      The main aim of the study is to determine the safety and feasibility of a cultivated
      autologous limbal epithelial cell (CALEC) transplantation in the treatment of limbal stem
      cell deficiency.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single center study to assess safety, feasibility, and efficacy of
      Cultivated Autologous Limbal Epithelial Cell (CALEC) grafts in 17 patients with unilateral
      limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD).

      Participants will have a corneal biopsy in their non-diseased eye, which will provide cells
      for the creation of the CALEC graft. The CALEC will be made at the Good Manufacturing
      Practice (GMP) Laboratory, Dana Farber Cancer Institute and transported to Mass. Eye and Ear
      Infirmary for application to the participant's diseased eye during their standard corneal
      reconstruction procedure. Subjects will be monitored up to month 18 post-transplant to assess
      for any delayed adverse events of the product (CALEC) or procedure as well as assessment of
      the durability of the transplant.

    <description>Cultivated autologous limbal epithelial cell (CALEC) therapy utilizes a bio-engineered composite of ex vivo expanded autologous corneal epithelial cells and an FDA-approved amniotic membrane (AmnioGraft®, Bio-Tissue, Inc.) to reconstruct the ocular surface. A small biopsy (2-3 mm2) from the patient's contralateral eye serves as a source epithelial (stem) cells that are expanded on the amniotic membrane in culture and the resulting product is surgically transplanted onto the cornea after excision of the fibrovascular pannus.</description>
