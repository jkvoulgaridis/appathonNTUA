      This study will generate safety data on Nivolumab given by itself in treatment of advanced
      Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC). The primary objective of this study is to assess immune related
      side effects, also known as immune-mediated adverse events (IMAEs), in patients treated with
      Nivolumab.

    <time_frame>Up to 100 days of the last dose of study drug (Approximately 2 years)</time_frame>
    <description>IMAEs were tabulated using worst grade per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, National Cancer Institute (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.0 criteria by system organ class and MedDRA version 20.1 preferred term.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Time to Onset of High Grade (Grade 3-5) Immune Mediated Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 100 days of the last dose of study drug (Approximately 2 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Time to onset was calculated from first dosing date to the event onset date. If a participant never experienced the given AE, the participant will be censored at the last contact date.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Time to Resolution of High Grade (Grade 3-5) Immune Mediated Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 100 days of the last dose of study drug (Approximately 2 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Time-to resolution of grade 3-5 AE was defined as the longest time from onset to complete resolution or improvement to the grade at baseline among all clustered select AEs in the category experienced by the participant. Events which worsened into grade 5 events (death) or have a resolution date equal to the date of death are considered unresolved. If a clustered AE is considered as unresolved, the resolution date will be censored to the last known date alive.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Receive Immune Modulating Medication for the Immune-Mediated Event (Any Grade)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 100 days of the last dose of study drug (Approximately 2 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Immune modulating medication includes corticosteroids, infliximab, cyclophosphamide, Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and mycophenolate mofetil</description>
