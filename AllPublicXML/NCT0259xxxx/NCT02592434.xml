  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized withdrawal, double blind, placebo controlled study of pediatric subjects
      (2 to &lt;18 years of age) with JIA. The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of
      tofacitinib versus placebo for the treatment of signs and symptoms of JIA at Week 26 of the
      double blind phase as measured by the percentage of subjects with disease flare (according to
      PRCSG/PRINTO Disease Flare criteria) after Week 18 of the open label run in phase.All
      eligible subjects enrolled in the study will initially receive open label tofacitinib for 18
      weeks (run in phase). At the end of the 18 week run in phase, only subjects who achieve at
      least a JIA ACR 30 response will be randomized to the 26 week double blind, placebo
      controlled phase. Subjects who do not achieve a JIA ACR 30 response at this time point will
      be discontinued from the study. In addition, subjects who experience a single episode of
      disease flare at any time during the study (including the open label run in and double blind
      phase) will also be discontinued from the study. All subjects participating in this study,
      including those discontinued from the study, will have the option, if eligible (based on
      inclusion and exclusion criteria), of enrolling in the tofacitinib JIA long term extension
      study (A3921145).

      Subjects who are eligible for the 26 week double blind phase will be randomized (1:1 ratio)
      to either active tofacitinib or placebo. For subjects with polyarticular course JIA (ie,
      extended oligoarthritis, polyarthritis RF+, polyarthritis RF , systemic JIA with active
      arthritis but without active systemic features), randomization will be stratified by JIA
      category and baseline CRP (normal, above normal). For subjects with psoriatic and enthesitis
      related arthritis, randomization will be stratified by JIA category.

      Approximately 210 subjects will be enrolled in the open label run in phase. Among subjects
      with polyarticular course JIA, stratification will target at least 50% with a baseline CRP
      above the upper limit of normal. The first cohort (ie, polyarticular course JIA) will have at
      least 170 subjects enrolled in the run in phase with the minimum number of JIA categories as
      follows: 24 with extended oligoarthritis, 20 with polyarthritis RF+, 62 with polyarthritis
      RF-, and no minimum for subjects with systemic JIA with active arthritis but without active
      systemic features. Additional cohorts (ie, psoriatic and enthesitis related arthritis) will
      include a minimum of 20 subjects with psoriatic arthritis, and 20 subjects with enthesitis
      related arthritis. The overall target minimum number of subjects to be enrolled in the study
      by age is as follows: 20 subjects 2 to &lt;6 years, 20 subjects 6 to &lt;12 years, and 20 subjects
      12 to &lt;18 years. The duration of subject participation among those who complete the study
      (without discontinuation) is expected to be approximately 44 weeks.

    <measure>Double Blind Phase: JIA ACR Core Variable- Change From Double-Blind Baseline in Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire- Disability Index (CHAQ-DI) Total Score at Week 44</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 44</time_frame>
    <description>CHAQ is a valid assessment of functional disability, discomfort in participants with rheumatic diseases. It comprises of three indices: Disability and Discomfort, and global assessment of arthritis (overall well-being). CHAQ-DI: as a measure of functional ability, consists of 30 questions in 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities-distributed, among a total of 30 items. Each question was rated on a 4-point scale of difficulty in performance ranges from 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). To calculate the overall score, the participant must have a domain score in at least 6 of the 8 domains. Scores of 8 domains were averaged to calculate the CHAQ-DI total score which ranges from 0 (no or minimal physical dysfunction) to 3 (very severe physical dysfunction), higher score indicates more disability. Change from double-blind baseline at Week 44 in DI total score is reported.</description>

CHAQ-DI: as a measure of functional ability, consists of 30 questions in 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities-distributed, among a total of 30 items. Each question was rated on a 4-point scale of difficulty in performance ranges from 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). To calculate the overall score, the participant must have a domain score in at least 6 of the 8 domains. Scores of 8 domains were averaged to calculate the CHAQ-DI total score which ranges from 0 (no or minimal physical dysfunction) to 3 (very severe physical dysfunction), higher score indicates more disability. Change from baseline at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 18 in DI total score is reported.</description>

    <description>Percentage of body surface area affected by psoriasis was estimated using the palm method. One of the participant's palm to proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and thumb =\together represented 1% of total BSA. Regions of the body were assigned specific number of palms with percentage (Head and Neck = 10% [10 palms], Upper extremities = 20% [20 palms], Trunk [axillae and groin] = 30% [30 palms], Lower extremities [buttocks] = 40% [40 palms]). The number of palms of psoriatic skin in a body region was used to determine the extent (%) to which a body region was involved with psoriasis. The total BSA affected was the summation of individual regions affected.</description>

                  case by case basis.

               2. Chest radiograph without changes suggestive of active tuberculosis (TB) infection
                  within 3 months prior to screening is recommended and should be performed
                  according to local standards of care or country-specific guidelines.

               3. No history of either untreated or inadequately treated latent or active TB
                  infection.

             If a subject has previously received an adequate course of therapy for either latent
             (9 months of isoniazid in a locale where rates of primary multi drug resistant TB
             infection are &lt;5% or an acceptable alternative regimen) or active (acceptable multi
             drug regimen) TB infection, neither a PPD test nor a QuantiFERON-Gold®TM test need be
             obtained. A chest radiograph should be obtained if not done within the 3 months prior
             to screening. To be considered eligible for the study, the chest radiograph must be
             negative for active tuberculosis infection.

             A subject who is currently being treated for latent TB infection can only be enrolled
             with confirmation of current incidence rates of multi-drug resistant TB infection,
             documentation of an adequate treatment regimen, and prior approval of the Sponsor.

             and at risk for pregnancy with their partner(s) must be willing and able to use a
             highly effective method of contraception as outlined in this protocol during the study
             and for at least 28 days after the last dose of study medication.

        6 Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan,
        laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

        7. Evidence of a personally signed and dated Informed Consent document and Assent document
        (as appropriate) indicating that the subject and a legally acceptable
        representative/parent(s)/legal guardian has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the
        study.

        <title>Double Blind Phase: JIA ACR Core Variable- Change From Double-Blind Baseline in Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire- Disability Index (CHAQ-DI) Total Score at Week 44</title>
        <description>CHAQ is a valid assessment of functional disability, discomfort in participants with rheumatic diseases. It comprises of three indices: Disability and Discomfort, and global assessment of arthritis (overall well-being). CHAQ-DI: as a measure of functional ability, consists of 30 questions in 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities-distributed, among a total of 30 items. Each question was rated on a 4-point scale of difficulty in performance ranges from 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). To calculate the overall score, the participant must have a domain score in at least 6 of the 8 domains. Scores of 8 domains were averaged to calculate the CHAQ-DI total score which ranges from 0 (no or minimal physical dysfunction) to 3 (very severe physical dysfunction), higher score indicates more disability. Change from double-blind baseline at Week 44 in DI total score is reported.</description>

        <title>Double Blind Phase: Percentage of Participants With Disease Flare According to PRCSG/PRINTO Disease Flare Criteria at Week 20, 24, 28, 32, 36 and 40</title>
        <description>According to PRCSG/PRINTO, disease flare defined as worsening of &gt;=30% in &gt;=3 of 6 variables of JIA core set, with no more than 1 variable improving by &gt;=30%. Six core variables were: 1) Number of joints with active arthritis (joint with swelling or in absence of swelling, limited range of motion accompanied by pain/ tenderness), 2) Number of joints with limited range of motion, 3) Physician global evaluation of disease activity (assessed on a VAS of 0 [no activity] to 10 [maximum activity]), 4) Parent/legal guardian/participant global assessment of overall well-being (assessed on VAS of 0 [very well] to 10 [very poor], 5) CHAQ-DI: 30 questions in 8 domains, each question answered on scale of 0=without difficulty to 3=unable to do; scores of each domain were averaged to derive total CHAQ-DI score, which ranges from 0 (minimum dysfunction) to 3 (most severe dysfunction); 6) ESR.</description>

          <title>Double Blind Phase: Time to Disease Flare</title>
          <description>Time to disease flare: time (in days) from first dose of study drug until the day of disease flare in double blind phase. According to PRCSG/PRINTO, disease flare: worsening of &gt;=30% in &gt;=3 of 6 variables of JIA core set, with no more than 1 variable improving by &gt;=30%. 6 core variables were: 1) Number of joints with active arthritis (joint with swelling or in absence of swelling, limited range of motion accompanied by pain/ tenderness), 2) Number of joints with limited range of motion, 3) Physician global evaluation of disease activity (assessed on a VAS of 0 [no activity] to 10 [maximum activity]), 4) Parent/legal guardian/participant global assessment of overall well-being (assessed on VAS of 0 [very well] to 10 [very poor], 5) CHAQ-DI: 30 questions in 8 domains, each question answered on scale of 0=without difficulty to 3=unable to do; scores of each domain were averaged to derive total CHAQ-DI score, which ranges from 0 (minimum dysfunction) to 3 (most severe dysfunction);6) ESR.</description>

        <title>Open Label Phase: Change From Baseline in Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score 27 (JADAS-27) C-Reactive Protein (CRP) Score at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 18</title>
        <description>JADAS-27 is a validated composite disease activity measure for JIA. JADAS-27 CRP score was derived from four components; 1) Physician global assessment of disease activity (assessed on a VAS of 0 [no activity] to 10 [maximum activity]), 2) Parent/legal guardian/subject global assessment of overall well-being (assessed on a VAS of 0 [very well] to 10 [very poor]), 3) Number of joints with active disease(defined as joint with swelling or, in absence of swelling, limited range of motion accompanied by either pain on motion or tenderness), 4) CRP (measured in milligram per liter [mg/L] and value normalized to 0 to 10 scale). The overall JADAS-27 score ranges from 0-57. A higher score indicates more disease activity.</description>

        <title>Open Label Phase: Change From Baseline in JADAS-27 Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) Score at Week 2, 4, 8, 12 and 18</title>
        <description>JADAS-27 is a validated composite disease activity measure for JIA. JADAS-27 ESR score was derived from four components; 1) Physician global assessment of disease activity (assessed on a VAS of 0 [no activity] to 10 [maximum activity]), 2) Parent/legal guardian/subject global assessment of overall well-being (assessed on a VAS of 0 [very well] to 10 [very poor]), 3) Number of joints with active disease (maximum of 27 and defined as joint with swelling or, in absence of swelling, limited range of motion accompanied by either pain on motion or tenderness), 4) ESR. The overall JADAS-27 score ranges from 0-57. A higher score indicates more disease activity.</description>

        <description>JADAS-27 is a validated composite disease activity measure for JIA. JADAS-27 ESR score was derived from four components; 1) Physician global assessment of disease activity (assessed on a VAS of 0 [no activity] to 10 [maximum activity]), 2) Parent/legal guardian/subject global assessment of overall well-being (assessed on a VAS of 0 [very well] to 10 [very poor]), 3) Number of joints with active disease (maximum of 27 and defined as joint with swelling or, in absence of swelling, limited range of motion accompanied by either pain on motion or tenderness), 4) ESR. The overall JADAS-27 score ranges from 0-57. A higher score indicates more disease activity.</description>

        <title>Open-Label Phase: Percentage of Participants With JADAS-27 CRP Minimum Disease Activity at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 18</title>
        <description>Minimum Disease Activity is defined by a JADAS-27 CRP score less than or equal to 3.8 for participants with polyarthritis, and less than or equal to 2 for participants with oligoarthritis. JADAS-27 is a validated composite disease activity measure for JIA. JADAS-27 CRP score was derived from four components; 1) Physician global assessment of disease activity (assessed on a VAS of 0 [no activity] to 10 [maximum activity]), 2) Parent/legal guardian/subject global assessment of overall well-being (assessed on a VAS of 0 [very well] to 10 [very poor]), 3) Number of joints with active disease(maximum of 27 defined as joint with swelling or, in absence of swelling, limited range of motion accompanied by either pain on motion or tenderness), 4) CRP (measured in milligram per liter [mg/L] and value normalized to 0 to 10 scale). The overall JADAS-27 score ranges from 0-57. A higher score indicates more disease activity.</description>

        <title>Open-Label Phase: Percentage of Participants With JADAS-27 CRP Inactive Disease Activity at Week 2, 4, 8, 12 and 18</title>
        <description>JADAS-27 inactive disease is defined by a JADAS score less than or equal to 1. JADAS-27 Inactive Disease cutoff values are defined as: 1) Polyarthritis: Inactive Disease: &lt;=1 and 2) Oligoarthritis (&lt;4 active joints): Inactive Disease: &lt;=1. JADAS-27 is a validated composite disease activity measure for JIA. JADAS-27 CRP score was derived from four components; 1) Physician global assessment of disease activity (assessed on a VAS of 0 [no activity] to 10 [maximum activity]), 2) Parent/legal guardian/subject global assessment of overall well-being (assessed on a VAS of 0 [very well] to 10 [very poor]), 3) Number of joints with active disease (maximum of 27 and defined as joint with swelling or, in absence of swelling, limited range of motion accompanied by either pain on motion or tenderness), 4) CRP (measured in milligram per liter [mg/L] and value normalized to 0 to 10 scale). The overall JADAS-27 score ranges from 0-57. A higher score indicates more disease activity.</description>

        <title>Double Blind Phase: Percentage of Participants With JADAS-27 CRP Inactive Disease Activity at Double Blind Baseline (Week 18), Week 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40 and 44</title>
        <description>JADAS-27 inactive disease is defined by a JADAS score less than or equal to 1. JADAS-27 Inactive Disease cutoff values are defined as: 1) Polyarthritis: Inactive Disease: &lt;=1 and 2) Oligoarthritis (&lt;4 active joints): Inactive Disease: &lt;=1. JADAS-27 is a validated composite disease activity measure for JIA. JADAS-27 CRP score was derived from four components; 1) Physician global assessment of disease activity (assessed on a VAS of 0 [no activity] to 10 [maximum activity]), 2) Parent/legal guardian/subject global assessment of overall well-being (assessed on a VAS of 0 [very well] to 10 [very poor]), 3) Number of joints with active disease (maximum of 27 and defined as joint with swelling or, in absence of swelling, limited range of motion accompanied by either pain on motion or tenderness), 4) CRP (measured in milligram per liter [mg/L] and value normalized to 0 to 10 scale). The overall JADAS-27 score ranges from 0-57. A higher score indicates more disease activity.</description>

        <title>Open Label Phase: JIA ACR Core Variable- Change From Baseline in Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire- Disability Index (CHAQ-DI) Total Scores at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 18</title>
        <description>CHAQ is a valid assessment of functional disability, discomfort in participants with rheumatic diseases. It comprises of three indices: Disability and Discomfort, and global assessment of arthritis (overall well-being). CHAQ-DI: as a measure of functional ability, consists of 30 questions in 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities-distributed, among a total of 30 items. Each question was rated on a 4-point scale of difficulty in performance ranges from 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). To calculate the overall score, the participant must have a domain score in at least 6 of the 8 domains. Scores of 8 domains were averaged to calculate the CHAQ-DI total score which ranges from 0 (no or minimal physical dysfunction) to 3 (very severe physical dysfunction), higher score indicates more disability. Change from baseline at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 18 in DI total score is reported.</description>

        <title>Double Blind Phase: JIA ACR Core Variable- Change From Double-Blind Baseline in Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire- Disability Index (CHAQ-DI) Total Scores at Weeks 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, and 40</title>
        <description>CHAQ: valid assessment of functional disability, discomfort in participants with rheumatic diseases. It comprises of three indices: Disability and Discomfort, and global assessment of arthritis (overall well-being). CHAQ-DI: as a measure of functional ability, consists of 30 questions in 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities-distributed, among a total of 30 items. Each question was rated on a 4-point scale of difficulty in performance ranges from 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). To calculate overall score, participant must have a domain score in at least 6 of the 8 domains. Scores of 8 domains were averaged to calculate the CHAQ-DI total score which ranges from 0 (no or minimal physical dysfunction) to 3 (very severe physical dysfunction), higher score indicates more disability. Change from double-blind baseline at Weeks 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, and 40 in DI total score is reported.</description>

        <description>CHQ: 50-item, 14 subscale (Global health, physical functioning, social limitations: emotional, social limitations: physical, bodily pain, behavior, global behavior, mental health, self-esteem, general health, Change in health, emotional impact on parent, time impact on parent, family activities, family cohesion) parent or legal guardian assessed instrument of child's physical, emotional, social well-being, and relative burden of disease on the parents. Each subscale rated on Likert-type scale: range 0 to 100; higher scores indicate a more positive health status. Two summary scores: Physical Health and Psychosocial Health were weighted composites derived from subscale items using scoring algorithms (transformed scores); range 0 to 100: higher scores indicate more positive health status.</description>

Each subscale rated on Likert-type scale: range 0 to 100; higher scores indicate a more positive health status. Two summary scores: Physical Health and Psychosocial Health were weighted composites derived from subscale items using scoring algorithms (transformed scores); range 0 to 100: higher scores indicate more positive health status.</description>

        <description>Uveitis is the inflammation of the uvea. Participants were assessed for presence of uveitis (according to Standard Uveitis Nomenclature [SUN]). If Uveitis was present in participant at Baseline, it was considered as &quot;active uveitis&quot;; If Uveitis was not present in participant at Baseline, it was considered as &quot;Inactive uveitis&quot;. As per SUN, Uveitis is defined as: anterior (in which anterior chamber is primary site of inflammation); intermediate (primary site of inflammation: vitreous); posterior (primary site of inflammation: retina or choroid). Percentage of participants with active uveitis (of any type) are reported.</description>

        <title>Double Blind Phase: Percentage of Participants With Active Uveitis at Week 24 and Week 44</title>
        <description>Uveitis is the inflammation of the uvea. Participants were assessed for presence of uveitis (according to Standard Uveitis Nomenclature [SUN]). If Uveitis was present in participant at Baseline, it was considered as &quot;active uveitis&quot;; If Uveitis was not present in participant at Baseline, it was considered as &quot;Inactive uveitis&quot;. As per SUN, Uveitis is defined as: anterior (in which anterior chamber is primary site of inflammation); intermediate (primary site of inflammation: vitreous); posterior (primary site of inflammation: retina or choroid). Percentage of participants with active uveitis (of any type) are reported.</description>

        <title>Open-Label Phase: Change From Baseline in the Modified Schober's Test at Week 2, 4, 8, 12 and 18</title>
        <description>Participants with ERA undergo Modified Schober's Test. In the Modified Schober's Test, a mark was placed 5 cm below the midpoint of a line that joined the posterior superior iliac spines. Another mark was placed 10 cm above the first. The participant then bent maximally forward with the knees fully extended. The distance between the two marks was then re-measured. The full measurement between the two lines was recorded to the nearest tenth of a centimeter and is reported.</description>

        <description>Participants with ERA undergo Overall Back Pain and Nocturnal Back Pain assessment. For Overall Back Pain, parent/legal guardian/participant were asked to provide a response to the question: What is the amount of back pain at any time that your child experienced in the past week? And For Nocturnal Back Pain: What is the amount of back pain at night that your child experienced in the past week?. Response to these questions was provided by parent/legal guardian/participant using a VAS of 0-10, where 0= No Pain and 10= Most Severe Pain, higher score indicated more severe pain.</description>

        <title>Open-Label Phase: Changes From Baseline in Percentage of Body Surface Area (BSA) Affected With Psoriasis at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 18</title>
        <description>Percentage of body surface area affected by psoriasis was estimated using the palm method. One of the participant's palm to proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and thumb =\together represented 1% of total BSA. Regions of the body were assigned specific number of palms with percentage (Head and Neck = 10% [10 palms], Upper extremities = 20% [20 palms], Trunk [axillae and groin] = 30% [30 palms], Lower extremities [buttocks] = 40% [40 palms]). The number of palms of psoriatic skin in a body region was used to determine the extent (%) to which a body region was involved with psoriasis. The total BSA affected was the summation of individual regions affected.</description>

        <title>Open-Label Phase: Changes From Baseline in Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of Psoriasis Assessments at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 18</title>
        <description>The PGA of psoriasis was scored on a 6-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema, induration, and scaling across all psoriatic lesions. Average erythema, induration, and scaling were scored separately over the whole body according to a 5-point severity scale (0 [no symptom] to 5 [severe symptom]). The total score was calculated as average of the 3 severity scores and rounded to the nearest whole number score to determine the PGA score and ranged as 0= no symptom to 5=severe, higher score indicates more severity.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 18</time_frame>
        <population>OLPsA included all participants who were enrolled into the open-label phase of study and received at least 1 dose of study medication in the open-label phase with PsA. Here, “n” signifies participants evaluable for this outcome measure at specified time points.</population>
