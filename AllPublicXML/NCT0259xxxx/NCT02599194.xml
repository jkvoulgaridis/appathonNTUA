    <textblock>
      The goal of this phase 2 study trial is to evaluate the utility of the radiolabel 18F-FSPG
      used before and after treatment to diagnose, predict, and evaluate response to therapy in
      patients with a wide variety of metastatic cancers.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients are evaluated with a PET/CT scan using the radiolabel 18F-FSPG
      [18F-(S)-4-(3-fluoropropyl)-L-glutamic acid] or 18F-FDG ([18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose), before
      and after therapeutic treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      Uptake of the radiolabel 18F-FSPG in patients with biopsy-proven cancer will be evaluated and
      compared to the uptake of 18F-FDG, before and after therapy (non-specified) in the same group
      of patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the agreement of the clinical assessment for cancer status between 18F-FSPG and
           18F-FDG.

        -  Safety and tolerability of 18F-FSPG and 18F-FDG.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Standard Uptake Value Maximum (SUVmax) Post-treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Standard Uptake Values (SUVs) for the radiotracers labels 18F-FSPG and 18F-FDG were assessed in tumor tissues of study participants, before (baseline), and after therapeutic treatment. Time frame was specified by protocol as at baseline, and at the time of clinical assessments during individual patient regular medical care. The time of the post-treatment assessment was not otherwise explicitly defined but could be anytime within 2 years. The outcome is reported as the difference of means from baseline to post-treatment (a number without dispersion), for all lesions for which an SUVmax value was assessed. A negative result indicates less uptake of radiotracer suggesting a small volume of tumor.</description>

    <description>Safety and tolerability of 18F-FSPG and 18F-FDG were assessed as treatment-related adverse events, and reported as the number of events related to each treatment, without dispersion.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Lesion Size Post-treatment, by 18F-FSPG or 18F-FDGs</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Lesion size in centimeters (cm) were assessed in 2 dimensions from the computed tomography (CT) component of PET/CT and the area in cm2 calculated for lesion locations at baseline and after treatment. Time frame was specified by protocol as at baseline, and at the time of clinical assessments during individual patient regular medical care. The time of the post-treatment assessment was not otherwise explicitly defined but could be anytime within 2 years. The outcome is reported the difference in area in cmÂ² for each lesion (a number without dispersion).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Standard Uptake Value Maximum (SUVmax) Post-treatment</title>
        <description>Standard Uptake Values (SUVs) for the radiotracers labels 18F-FSPG and 18F-FDG were assessed in tumor tissues of study participants, before (baseline), and after therapeutic treatment. Time frame was specified by protocol as at baseline, and at the time of clinical assessments during individual patient regular medical care. The time of the post-treatment assessment was not otherwise explicitly defined but could be anytime within 2 years. The outcome is reported as the difference of means from baseline to post-treatment (a number without dispersion), for all lesions for which an SUVmax value was assessed. A negative result indicates less uptake of radiotracer suggesting a small volume of tumor.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and up to 2 years</time_frame>
        <population>Locations (ie, of lesions) that did not produce an SUVmax value either before or after treatment are omitted from the mean. Note that an analysis &quot;mean of differences&quot; would have a dispersion, but an analysis for &quot;difference of means&quot; is simply the delta (a number) between 2 measures of central tendency (mean), and does not have a dispersion.</population>
