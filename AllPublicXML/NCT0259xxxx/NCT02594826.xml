    <textblock>
      This is a randomized trial to evaluate the effects of a community-based intervention on
      increasing cervical cancer screening rates in underserved Korean American women. Due to the
      multiple factors that contribute to screening uptake, an educational program customized to
      Korean culture combined with navigation assistance may be effective in increasing the number
      of Korean American women who can access cervical cancer screening.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of a culturally-appropriate educational intervention compared to
      a general cancer health education program in increasing cervical cancer screening among
      Korean American women.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the effects of a culturally-appropriate intervention on women's knowledge,
      psychosocial beliefs about cervical cancer and screening, and barriers to screening compared
      to a general cancer health education program.

      II. To examine the extent to which changes in knowledge, psychosocial beliefs, and barriers
      mediate the effects of the intervention on screening behavior.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (INTERVENTION CONDITION): Participants undergo a culturally appropriate, church-based
      intervention comprised of four components: 2-hour small group education sessions delivered at
      church sites by professional, bilingual community health educators (CHEs) that include
      culturally appropriate visual aids and print materials in Korean; navigation assistance,
      including language services, appointment scheduling, and transportation assistance from CHEs
      and church health workers (CHWs); referrals to Pap test sites; and a 6-month reminder letter
      for screening.

      ARM II (CONTROL CONDITION): Participants undergo 2-hour general health and cancer education
      by bilingual CHEs, which covers nutrition, regular check-ups, tobacco use, and cancer
      screening. Participants also receive pre-existing written material produced by the American
      Cancer Society (ACS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and Centers for Disease Control
      (CDC)., and are advised to seek regular preventive health services.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up post-intervention and at 12 months.

    <description>Women's knowledge was assessed using 10 items. For each item, women responded whether the statement was true (&quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot;, or &quot;Don't know&quot;). &quot;Don't know&quot; responses were scored as incorrect. Each item that was answered correctly was scored as '1'. Correct responses were summed across all 10 items. Therefore, women's knowledge scores could range from 0 (no correct responses) to 10 (all correct responses), where higher scores represent greater knowledge.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>Following eligibility screening and informed consent, women completed a baseline questionnaire, which included items on screening history and prior medical history. For a small number of women, responses on the baseline questionnaire were deemed to be inconsistent with study eligibility. Therefore, those women were excluded from further analysis.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Women's knowledge was assessed using 10 items. For each item, women responded whether the statement was true (&quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot;, or &quot;Don't know&quot;). &quot;Don't know&quot; responses were scored as incorrect. Each item that was answered correctly was scored as '1'. Correct responses were summed across all 10 items. Therefore, women's knowledge scores could range from 0 (no correct responses) to 10 (all correct responses), where higher scores represent greater knowledge.</description>
        <time_frame>12 months post-program</time_frame>
        <population>Preliminary data cleaning revealed that of the 705 participants who were included in the primary analysis, 29 participants had failed to answer 1/3 or more of the items on the questionnaire. Therefore, due to extensive missing data, these participants were excluded from the analysis of the secondary outcomes.</population>
