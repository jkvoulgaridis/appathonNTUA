  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adverse events are frequent in Neonatal Intensive Care Units' (NICU) patients and account for
      a high morbidity and mortality. Possible severe adverse events are central line associated
      bloodstream infections (CLABSI), ventilator and catheter associated adverse events and
      medication errors. Severity of the patient's outcome after an adverse event can be classified
      using the National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Preventing (NCC
      MERP) Index for categorizing medication errors.

      The study will test the hypothesis that rates of adverse events in NICU patients will be
      reduced by the implementation of an educational program for the NICU caregivers (nurses and
      physicians), consisting of strategies for recognizing and preventing adverse events in their
      unit. These strategies will be oriented to prevent CLABSI, medication errors, skin and nasal
      complications and ventilator and catheter-associated adverse events.

      This trial has a stepped wedge cluster design, in which the NICUs from 12 hospitals in France
      will be randomized to the timing of implementation of the educational program.

      In order to describe the adverse events occurring during the study period, an anonymous
      voluntary adverse event reporting system will be provided to the caregivers of the
      participating units. A nested study will examine how caregivers communicate with the
      patients' parents in case of adverse event (disclosure or not, and caregivers' reasons).

      The rates of adverse events will be measured retrospectively using a neonatal NICU trigger
      tool.

Out of the pool of patients included in the study, 3600 charts (60 charts per 4 months and per unit) will be randomly assigned to be reviewed using the NICU trigger tool.

An adverse event is defined here as an injury, large or small, caused by the use (including non-use) of a drug, test, or medical treatment. (see Trigger tool kit definitions and Raju Ped Research) Preventability is assessed according to the existence of an &quot;error&quot;. Expected complications or side effects from therapeutic or diagnostic interventions are generally non-preventable, and hence are considered complications. (see Raju, Pediatric Research) Healthcare associated infections are considered preventable adverse events.</description>

These &quot;errors&quot; are collected prospectively in each participating unit during the 20 months period, using a multi-source collection file (manual, anonymous and voluntary and/or institutional).
