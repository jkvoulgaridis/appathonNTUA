      The aim of this study is to evaluate the sentinel node policy in early stage endometrial
      carcinomas at intermediate and high risk of recurrence (by comparing the sentinel node policy
      to current initial staging protocols).

      1. Routine exams required for diagnosis:

             -  Endometrioid biopsy or product of a dilatation-curettage under hysteroscopy for
                diagnosis of histologic typing

             -  Tumor assessment: Lombopelvic MRI (1.5 or 3T) with gadolinium injection, studied by
                steady and dynamic sequences. US and CT-Scan in case of intolerance to MRI should
                be discussed. FDG-PET may be an option.

        2. Tumor board: The completed chart will be reviewed to confirm the risk group and
           indication.

        3. Complete physical and gynecological examination by surgical oncologist followed by a
           consultation of anesthesiology to confirm the operability of patient.

        4. Informed and signed consent form.

        5. Study baseline assessment.

           Then,

        6. Surgery should be performed within a maximum of 4 weeks from the first consultation,
           according arm allocated:

           Arm A: Sentinel node policy*

           Arm B:

             -  Bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy (intermediate risk endometrioid)

             -  Or Ilio-infrarenal paraaortic lymphadenectomy (high risk endometrioid)

             -  Or Pelvic + paraaortic lymphadenectomies (high risk non endometrioid)*

                  -  along with a peritoneal staging for each arm (cytology, random biopsies,
                     infracolic omentectomy)

        7. Second tumor board: after definitive pathological results of the
           hysterectomy-annexectomy and node (sentinel or not) specimens.

    <description>Per-operative morbidity will be assessed during surgery according to the Oslo classification of intraoperative unfavourable incidents.
Early post-operative morbidity will be assessed up to 30 days and scored according to Clavien-Dindo scale.

3- Full bilateral laparoscopic lymphadenectomy and Hysterectomy: If bilateral SN are detected, all positive SN are removed, then the surgeon proceeds to a total hysterectomy.
If unilateral SN are detected, surgeon will complete intervention with pelvic LN dissection on the opposite side, in accordance with risk group definition (ex: omentectomy for high-risk non endometrioid carcinomas).
If non SN are detected, surgeon will proceed to a total hysterectomy, a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, a complete and bilateral pelvic LND with more enlarged dissection regardless the pathology</description>
