    <textblock>
      The main purpose is to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Triferic iron administered
      intravenously in pediatric patients with chronic kidney disease on chronic hemodialysis
      (CKD-5HD). It is an open-label, two-period sequential dosing study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, 2-period, single-dose study assessing the safety and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of Triferic (ferric pyrophosphate citrate, or FPC) administered via
      dialysate and IV to pediatric patients (&lt; 18 years of age) receiving chronic hemodialysis
      (CKD-5HD).

      Total participation in the study is approximately three weeks and is comprised of a screening
      visit, two dosing (PK) visits, and a follow-up visit.

      Each patient will receive a single dose of Triferic administered IV into the venous blood
      return line over the duration of the dialysis. At the next scheduled dialysis session each
      patient will receive a single dose of Triferic administered via dialysate during a single
      hemodialysis session.

      Blood samples will be obtained at various times to analyze for serum iron parameters and for
      safety.

    <description>On study Day 1, patients will receive IV Triferic iron 0.07 mg/kg diluted in an appropriate amount of D5W administered as a 100 mL infusion into the venous return port of the blood lines during the time the patient is receiving dialysis.The rate of administration will be calculated as such that the entire amount will be administered over the course of the dialysis treatment. On study Day 3, Triferic will be mixed with the liquid bicarbonate concentrate used in the preparation of the hemodialysate solution. This will result in a final Triferic iron concentration in the dialysate of 2 µM (110 µg/L). The patients will receive Triferic via the hemodialysate over the course of the dialysis treatment.</description>

             support blood flows for hemodialysis treatment.

          6. Patient has a body mass of 11 lbs (5 kg).

          7. Patient is iron-replete as measured by a TSAT 20% and a ferritin &gt;100 micrograms/L at

          9. If patient is receiving ESA, the dose has been stable (unchanged) for at least 3 weeks
             prior to Baseline admission.

         10. Patient has appropriate laboratory values for their disease state at screening (per
             investigator judgment).

         11. Patient has no significant abnormal findings on physical examination that would
             preclude participation in the study.

         12. If the patient is female, she must be pre-pubertal, have had documented surgical

          3. Patient is receiving intravenous or oral antibiotics or antifungals for any infectious
             process. Prophylactic antibiotics administered on a regular basis are allowed.

          4. Patient has evidence of an ongoing active inflammatory process (e.g., systemic lupus
             erythematosus, acute or chronic active hepatitis, etc.).

          5. Patient has participated in an investigational drug study within the 30 days prior to
