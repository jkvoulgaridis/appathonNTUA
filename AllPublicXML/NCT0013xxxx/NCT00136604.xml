  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of a
      booster dose of DTPw-HBV/Hib-MenAC compared to DTPw-HBV/Hib given to healthy subjects at 15
      to 24 months of age primed with 3 doses of Tritanrix-HepB/Hib-MenAC in study 100480. Antibody
      persistence will be evaluated at 24 to 30 months. Immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity
      of a dose of Mencevax ACWY given at 24 to 30 months will also be evaluated when given to
      subjects not boosted with a MenA conjugate and/or MenC containing vaccine.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in two stages. In the DTP booster phase subjects will receive a
      booster dose of Tritanrix-HepB/Hib-MenAC or Tritanrix-HepB/Hib (active control) at 15 to 24
      months in a single-blind manner so that the subjects' parents will not know which vaccine was
      administered to their child (this booster phase is no longer recruiting). In the Mencevax
      ACWY phase at 24-30 months a dose of Mencevax ACWY will be given to subjects who were not
      boosted with a MenA conjugate and/or MenC containing vaccine at 15-24 months in an open
      manner (this booster phase is not yet recruiting). Up to four blood samples will be taken:
      before and one month after the administration of the DTP booster dose and of Mencevax ACWY.
      To comply with the immunisation calender of Thailand, at 15-24 months all subjects will
      receive OPV. At 16-25 months 2 doses of Japanese Encephalitis (JE) vaccine or a dose of
      varicella vaccine will be offered and at 25-31 months a dose of varicella or JE vaccine will
      be offered.
