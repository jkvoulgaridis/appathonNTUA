    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of oral risperidone (Risperdal) to
      risperidone long-acting (Consta) in reducing alcohol use in persons diagnosed with
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Comorbid alcohol/substance use disorder (SUD) in people with schizophrenia is a major
      concern, both in view of the high frequency of SUD among patients with schizophrenia and the
      difficulty in managing such patients. Though antipsychotic medications are effective in
      reducing symptoms and impairment in persons with schizophrenia, the typical antipsychotic
      agents are of limited value in controlling alcohol/substance use in these patients.
      Extrapyramidal, dysphoric side effects of conventional neuroleptics may actually promote the
      use of substances in an attempt to counteract these effects. In addition, medication
      non-compliance is common among patients with schizophrenia.

      Novel antipsychotics have altered treatment expectations and outcomes for patients with
      severe forms of schizophrenia. A growing number of studies have assessed the effects of oral
      risperidone in persons with dual disorders. Potential mechanisms of action by which
      risperidone and other atypical antipsychotics could decrease substance use include being less
      likely to cause extrapyramidal side effects than typical agents, improving negative symptoms
      and ameliorating a dysfunction of the brain reward system. Risperidone long-acting injectable
      medication addresses issues of noncompliance, while avoiding peak blood levels of oral
      preparations, thereby minimizing EPS and improving negative symptoms of schizophrenia.
      Risperidone may also facilitate dopamine neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex and
      correct a hypothesized dysfunction of the brain reward system.

      This study is an open, randomized, controlled study to compare intramuscular long-acting
      risperidone to oral risperidone with blinded ratings to determine whether the long-acting
      form of risperidone has greater efficacy in reducing substance use. Patients with
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, age 18 to 65, who are taking any single oral
      antipsychotic medication except clozapine or risperidone long-acting may be enrolled.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency of heavy drinking days is obtained each week retrospectively as the number of heavy drinking days during the prior week (assessed by the Timeline Followback Scale). A heavy drinking day is defined as 4 or more drinks per day for a female and 5 or more drinks per day for a male. Mixed models are used to obtain estimates of efficacy from the partial data provided by each subject while adherent to assigned treatment (under the 'missing at random' assumption). The 'explanatory' estimands (target of the mixed model estimation) are defined in terms of population quantities that would have occurred had all subjects remained on assigned treatment throughout the study. The point estimate for each arm is reported under Number.</description>

        <title>Change Over Time in Frequency of Heavy Drinking Days (Used to Evaluate Treatment Efficacy)</title>
        <description>Frequency of heavy drinking days is obtained each week retrospectively as the number of heavy drinking days during the prior week (assessed by the Timeline Followback Scale). A heavy drinking day is defined as 4 or more drinks per day for a female and 5 or more drinks per day for a male. Mixed models are used to obtain estimates of efficacy from the partial data provided by each subject while adherent to assigned treatment (under the 'missing at random' assumption). The 'explanatory' estimands (target of the mixed model estimation) are defined in terms of population quantities that would have occurred had all subjects remained on assigned treatment throughout the study. The point estimate for each arm is reported under Number.</description>

          <title>Average Over Time of Severity of Illness and Global Improvement (Used to Evaluate Treatment Efficacy)</title>
          <description>A rater assesses the severity of illness and global impression using a scale from 1 to 7 (Clinical Global Impression), where higher values represent a worse outcome. Mixed models are used to obtain estimates of efficacy from the partial data provided by each subject while adherent to assigned treatment (under the 'missing at random' assumption). The 'explanatory' estimands (target of the mixed model estimation) are defined in terms of population quantities that would have occurred had all subjects remained on assigned treatment throughout the study. The point estimate for each arm is reported under Number.</description>
