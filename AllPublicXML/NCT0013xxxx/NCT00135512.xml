    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score at Week 8 in Observed Cases</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a semi-structured interview rating scale for depression that assesses 10 symptoms. The scale is composed of 10 questions (1, apparent sadness; 2, reported sadness; 3, inner tension; 4, reduced sleep; 5, reduced appetite; 6, concentration difficulties; 7, lassitude; 8, inability to feel; 9, pessimistic thoughts; 10, suicidal thoughts) with a fixed 7 point scale (0, no depression; 60, severely depressed). Total score ranges from 0-60. A higher score indicates more depressive symptoms. MADRS Response was defined as a reduction in MADRS score from Baseline. Change from Baseline in the total score was calculated as the value at Week 8 minus the value at Baseline. Baseline was defined as value at Week 0.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D; 17 Items) Total Score at Weeks 8 and 52 in Observed Cases</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 8, 52</time_frame>
    <description>Each item was rated on either a 3-point scale (0 to 2; 8 questions) or a 5-point scale (0 to 4; 9 questions), with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity. The total score was calculated by summing the individual response scores. Total score ranged from 0 to 52. The following symptoms were rated on a 5-point scale (0-4): depressed mood, low self-esteem (guilt), suicidal thoughts, work and interests, psychomotor retardation, psychomotor agitation, anxiety (psychic), anxiety (somatic), and hypochondriasis (somatization). The following symptoms were rated on a 3-point scale (0-2): insomnia (initial), insomnia (middle), insomnia (late), gastrointestinal symptoms (appetite), somatic symptoms (general), sexual disturbances, insight, and weight loss. Change from Baseline in the total score was calculated as the score at Week 8 and 52 minus the score at Baseline. Baseline was defined as value at Week 0.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Were Clinical Global Impression Global Improvement (CGI-I) Responders at Weeks 8 and 52 in Observed Cases</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8, 52</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I scale was used to rate improvement in the participant's condition (benefits) since Baseline using the following 7-point scale: 1: very much improved, 2: much improved, 3: minimally improved, 4: not changed, 5: minimally worse, 6: much worse and 7: very much worse. A responder was defined as &quot;very much improved&quot; or &quot;much improved&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in CGI Severity of Illness (CGI-SI) at Weeks 8 and 52 in Observed Cases</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 8, 52</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-SI was assessed on an 8-grade scale: 0, not assessed; 1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline mentally ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 5, markedly ill; 6, severely ill and 7, among the most extremely ill. Higher score indicated severely ill. CGI-SI was assessed by the investigator. The change from Baseline in CGI-SI score was calculated as the score at Weeks 8 and 52 minus the score at Baseline. Baseline was defined as value at Week 0.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDISS) Total Score at Weeks 8 and 52 in Observed Cases</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 8, 52</time_frame>
    <description>SDISS is a composite of 3 self-rated items designed to measure the extent to which 3 major sectors in the participant's life are impaired by panic, anxiety, phobic, or depressive symptoms. The participant rates the extent to which his or her (1) work, (2) social life or leisure activities, and (3) home life or family responsibilities were impaired by his or her symptoms on a 10-point visual analog scale. To get a total score, 3 individual scores were added and the total score ranged from &quot;0 = unimpaired&quot; to &quot;30 = highly impaired&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening. The change from Baseline in SDISS total score was calculated as the score at Weeks 8 and 52 minus the score at Baseline. Baseline was defined as value at Week 0.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Motivation Energy Inventory Short Form (MEI-SF) Total Score at Weeks 8 and 52 in Observed Cases</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 8, 52</time_frame>
    <description>The MEI-SF (18 questions) was used to measure the reductions in mental energy, physical energy and social motivation. Minimal clinically important differences were estimated as 0.5 standard deviations or 7.5 points. All items use either a 7-level (0 to 6) or 5-level (0 to 4) response scale; items with a 5-level response scale were rescaled to 7-levels and items were reverse-scored as necessary such that higher scores represent higher health-related quality of life (HRQoL) total score ranges from 0 to 108 points. Recall period was past week prior to administration. The change from Baseline in MEI-SF total score was calculated as the score at Weeks 8 and 52 minus the score at Baseline. Baseline was defined as value at Week 0.</description>

      <recruitment_details>From 01 December 2004 to 28 May 2007, total of 234 participants with major depressive disorder were randomized at 36 centers in Japan.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>During the screening (1 week), participants received Dose Level 1; bupropion sustained release (SR) 100 milligrams (mg) placebo tablet once daily in the morning.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Bupropion SR</title>
          <description>During treatment period, participants received Dose Level 2; bupropion SR 100 mg tablets once daily for 1 week in the morning and then the Dose Level 3; bupropion SR 100 mg tablets twice daily (BID; morning and evening) for the next 1 week of the treatment phase. If no problems were observed in tolerability with insufficient efficacy, then Dose Level 4; bupropion SR 150 mg tablets BID for 6 weeks was administered. Dose reduction back to Dose Level 3 was allowed in participants judged by the investigator to have a safety concern after dose increase to Dose Level 4 and dose adjustment between Dose Levels 3 and 4 was to be chosen optionally. If no tolerability issues were observed at Week 8 of treatment phase, the treatment continued up to a maximum of 52 weeks. One tablet was administered per dose during each dose level.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score at Week 8 in Observed Cases</title>
        <description>The MADRS is a semi-structured interview rating scale for depression that assesses 10 symptoms. The scale is composed of 10 questions (1, apparent sadness; 2, reported sadness; 3, inner tension; 4, reduced sleep; 5, reduced appetite; 6, concentration difficulties; 7, lassitude; 8, inability to feel; 9, pessimistic thoughts; 10, suicidal thoughts) with a fixed 7 point scale (0, no depression; 60, severely depressed). Total score ranges from 0-60. A higher score indicates more depressive symptoms. MADRS Response was defined as a reduction in MADRS score from Baseline. Change from Baseline in the total score was calculated as the value at Week 8 minus the value at Baseline. Baseline was defined as value at Week 0.</description>

        <description>Each item was rated on either a 3-point scale (0 to 2; 8 questions) or a 5-point scale (0 to 4; 9 questions), with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity. The total score was calculated by summing the individual response scores. Total score ranged from 0 to 52. The following symptoms were rated on a 5-point scale (0-4): depressed mood, low self-esteem (guilt), suicidal thoughts, work and interests, psychomotor retardation, psychomotor agitation, anxiety (psychic), anxiety (somatic), and hypochondriasis (somatization). The following symptoms were rated on a 3-point scale (0-2): insomnia (initial), insomnia (middle), insomnia (late), gastrointestinal symptoms (appetite), somatic symptoms (general), sexual disturbances, insight, and weight loss. Change from Baseline in the total score was calculated as the score at Week 8 and 52 minus the score at Baseline. Baseline was defined as value at Week 0.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDISS) Total Score at Weeks 8 and 52 in Observed Cases</title>
        <description>SDISS is a composite of 3 self-rated items designed to measure the extent to which 3 major sectors in the participant's life are impaired by panic, anxiety, phobic, or depressive symptoms. The participant rates the extent to which his or her (1) work, (2) social life or leisure activities, and (3) home life or family responsibilities were impaired by his or her symptoms on a 10-point visual analog scale. To get a total score, 3 individual scores were added and the total score ranged from &quot;0 = unimpaired&quot; to &quot;30 = highly impaired&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening. The change from Baseline in SDISS total score was calculated as the score at Weeks 8 and 52 minus the score at Baseline. Baseline was defined as value at Week 0.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDISS) Total Score at Weeks 8 and 52 in Observed Cases</title>
          <description>SDISS is a composite of 3 self-rated items designed to measure the extent to which 3 major sectors in the participant's life are impaired by panic, anxiety, phobic, or depressive symptoms. The participant rates the extent to which his or her (1) work, (2) social life or leisure activities, and (3) home life or family responsibilities were impaired by his or her symptoms on a 10-point visual analog scale. To get a total score, 3 individual scores were added and the total score ranged from &quot;0 = unimpaired&quot; to &quot;30 = highly impaired&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening. The change from Baseline in SDISS total score was calculated as the score at Weeks 8 and 52 minus the score at Baseline. Baseline was defined as value at Week 0.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Motivation Energy Inventory Short Form (MEI-SF) Total Score at Weeks 8 and 52 in Observed Cases</title>
        <description>The MEI-SF (18 questions) was used to measure the reductions in mental energy, physical energy and social motivation. Minimal clinically important differences were estimated as 0.5 standard deviations or 7.5 points. All items use either a 7-level (0 to 6) or 5-level (0 to 4) response scale; items with a 5-level response scale were rescaled to 7-levels and items were reverse-scored as necessary such that higher scores represent higher health-related quality of life (HRQoL) total score ranges from 0 to 108 points. Recall period was past week prior to administration. The change from Baseline in MEI-SF total score was calculated as the score at Weeks 8 and 52 minus the score at Baseline. Baseline was defined as value at Week 0.</description>
