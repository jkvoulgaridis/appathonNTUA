      The primary object is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture for symptoms
      of women during menopausal transition .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Menopause transition is called perimenopause in the past time. 40-80% women aged 40 to 65
      have symptoms during this period. Hormone therapy is the recommended therapy for menopause
      and there is not enough evidence in favor of alternative medicine's effect.

      Our pilot trial showed that electroacupuncture had better effect for menopause transition
      symptoms than sham electroacupuncture. We are going to conduct a phase Ⅱ clinical trial to
      further evaluate the safety and effect of electroacupuncture for menopause transition
      symptoms.

sham acupuncture: Non-points proximate to RN4 (P1), EX-CA1(P2)，ST25 (P3) and SP6 (P4) (double sides) are used.P1 and P3 are at the sites 1 cm (outward in horizontal direction) proximate to RN4 and ST25 respectively. P2 is 2 cm (outward in horizontal direction) proximate to EX-CA1. P4 is at the middle site of the spleen meridian and the kidney meridian (backward in horizontal direction proximate to SP6).Stick adhesive tapes to all points. Blunt needles will be used to be inserted to but not piercing the skin. Even lifting, thrusting and twisting manipulation methods will be given for each non-point for 3 times. Put the sham electric stimulator on the pair of P2 and P3 with the same parameters as the acupuncture group. But there is no current intensity actual</description>

        <description>The change in menopause rating scale (MRS) total score compared with baseline at week 8 equals MRS total score at week 8 minus MRS total score at baseline.
MRS is a self-report questionnaire for evaluating the severity of menopausal symptoms in women, which contains 11 items. Each of the 11 symptoms contained a scoring scale from &quot;0&quot; (no complaints) to &quot;4&quot; (very severe symptoms). The total score will be calculated as the all items ranging from 0 to 44, with higher scores indicating worse symptoms. The MRS including 3 dimensions: psychological, somatic-vegetative, and urogenital.</description>

The needle will be inserted vertically at SP6 to a depth of 1 cun. Paired alligator clips of the EA apparatus will be attached transversely to the needle holders of the bilateral EX-CA1 and ST25. EA stimulation will last for 30 minutes with a dilatational wave of 10/50Hz and current intensity of 0.1 to 1mA. The current intensity will be increased until the skin around the acupoints shivers. The manipulation on RN4 and SP6 mentioned above should be performed every 10 minutes, three times in 30 minutes.Patients will be treated with EA 3 sessions a week on alternate days for 8 successive weeks, 24 sessions for each patient in total.</description>

        <description>The 24-h hot flash score was daily hot flash episodes multiplied by the corresponding severities. The change from baseline in mean 24-h HF score at weeks 4, 8, 20 and 32 equals the mean 24-h HF score at weeks 4 , 8, 20 and 32 minus the mean 24-h HF score at baseline, respectively.
Hot flashes score consisted the number and the degree of hot flashes. The hot flashes score is the sum of the scores of all the hot flashes occurring in a whole day, with a higher score indicating worse symptoms. A 3-point rating scale allows the women to describe the perceived severity of hot flash. 1 point = mild hot flash, 2 point = moderate hot flash, 3 point = severe hot flash.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Vasomotor Domain of Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The change from baseline in the vasomotor domain of Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MENQOL) at weeks 4, 8, 20 and 32 equals the vasomotor domain of MENQOL at weeks 4, 8, 20 and 32 minus the vasomotor domain of MENQOL at baseline, respectively.
The vasomotor domain contains 3 items (items 1-3). Each of the item scores ranges from 0 to 6. The vasomotor domain score will be calculated as the all vasomotor items ranging from 0 to 18, with lower scores indicating a better quality of life.</description>

The needle will be inserted vertically at SP6 to a depth of 1 cun. Paired alligator clips of the EA apparatus will be attached transversely to the needle holders of the bilateral EX-CA1 and ST25. EA stimulation will last for 30 minutes with a dilatational wave of 10/50Hz and current intensity of 0.1 to 1mA. The current intensity will be increased until the skin around the acupoints shivers. The manipulation on RN4 and SP6 mentioned above should be performed every 10 minutes, three times in 30 minutes.Patients will be treated with EA 3 sessions a week on alternate days for 8 successive weeks, 24 sessions for each patient in total.</description>

        <description>The change from baseline in the physical domain of Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MENQOL) at weeks 4, 8, 20 and 32 equals the physical domain of MENQOL at weeks 4, 8, 20 and 32 minus the physical domain of MENQOL at baseline, respectively.
The physical domain contains 16 items (items 11-26). Each of the item scores ranges from 0 to 6. The vasomotor domain score will be calculated as the all physical items ranging from 0 to 96, with lower scores indicating a better quality of life.</description>

The needle will be inserted vertically at SP6 to a depth of 1 cun. Paired alligator clips of the EA apparatus will be attached transversely to the needle holders of the bilateral EX-CA1 and ST25. EA stimulation will last for 30 minutes with a dilatational wave of 10/50Hz and current intensity of 0.1 to 1mA. The current intensity will be increased until the skin around the acupoints shivers. The manipulation on RN4 and SP6 mentioned above should be performed every 10 minutes, three times in 30 minutes.Patients will be treated with EA 3 sessions a week on alternate days for 8 successive weeks, 24 sessions for each patient in total.</description>
