  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compared the effect of ranibizumab administered as monotherapy versus ranibizumab
      administered in combination with verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT) on visual acuity in
      patients with symptomatic macular polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV). The results of
      this study provided long-term safety and efficacy data used to generate further guidance on
      the management of patients with PCV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients were randomized to the study in 2 treatment groups: ranibizumab + vPDT combination
      therapy, and ranibizumab monotherapy. Based on the results of the primary analysis at Month
      12, patients still in the ranibizumab monotherapy group at the time of the switch cut-off
      time point were switched to the ranibizumab + vPDT combination therapy group until study
      exit. A total of 168 and 154 patients were included in the ranibizumab + vPDT combined
      therapy and ranibizumab monotherapy groups, respectively for the FAS (Month 12 analysis).
      However, the safety set included 172 and 149 patients, respectively. Four patients in the
      combination therapy group never took vPDT . Among them, 1 patient actually received
      verteporfin injection but no laser injection. Thus a total of 3 patients (4-1) in the
      combination therapy group did not take the actual full vPDT treatment. Additionally, 7
      patients in the monotherapy group received vPDT and 1 patient from the monotherapy group did
      not receive ranibizumab treatment. Considering the above numbers, safety set included 172
      patients (i.e., 168-3+7) in the ranibizumab + vPDT combination therapy group and 149 patients
      (i.e., 154-7+3-1) in the ranibizumab monotherapy group for Month 12 analysis. For the Month
      24 safety analysis, the 14 patients in the ranibizumab monotherapy group who were switched to
      ranibizumab +vPDT combination therapy group were analyzed as a separate group, ie,
      ranibizumab 0.5 mg + vPDT (switched).

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) at Month 12 - Study Eye</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) was assessed during all study visits using best correction determined from protocol refraction at a starting test distance of 4 meters. VA measurements were taken in a sitting position using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like visual acuity testing charts. The BCVA score is the number of letters read correctly by the patient, hence an increase in score indicates improvement in acuity.</description>

    <measure>Number of Patients With Complete Polyp Regression From Baseline at Month 12 - Study Eye</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Polyp regression was based on the Indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) assessment by the Central Reading Center (CRC). A patient was considered to have complete polyp regression if the presence of polyps, as assessed by CRC, had value &quot;No.&quot; Polyp regression which may lead to disease stabilization and consequently better vision.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Investigator-Assessed Central Subfield Retinal Thickness (CSFT) at Month 24 - Study Eye</measure>

    <description>The thickness of the retina was measured using Spectral Domain (SD) optical coherence tomography (OCT) equipment (SD-OCT) and reported as a difference, in micrometers. A negative number indicates a reduction in thickness, whereas a positive number indicates an increase. An increase in thickness may indicate a progression of the underlying disease.</description>

    <description>The National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (NEI-VFQ-25) was used to measure a patient's subjective assessment of vision-related quality of life at Months 3, 12 and 24. The 12 subscales in the VFQ-25 are general health, general vision, ocular pain, near activities, distance activities, social function, mental health, role difficulties, dependency, driving, color vision, and peripheral vision. The scores on the subscales were added together for a total score, which ranged from 0 to 100. A higher score indicated poorer function.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) at Month 12 - Study Eye</title>
        <description>Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) was assessed during all study visits using best correction determined from protocol refraction at a starting test distance of 4 meters. VA measurements were taken in a sitting position using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like visual acuity testing charts. The BCVA score is the number of letters read correctly by the patient, hence an increase in score indicates improvement in acuity.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) at Month 12 - Study Eye</title>
          <description>Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) was assessed during all study visits using best correction determined from protocol refraction at a starting test distance of 4 meters. VA measurements were taken in a sitting position using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like visual acuity testing charts. The BCVA score is the number of letters read correctly by the patient, hence an increase in score indicates improvement in acuity.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Composite Scores, National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25) at Months 3, 12 and 24</title>
        <description>The National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (NEI-VFQ-25) was used to measure a patient's subjective assessment of vision-related quality of life at Months 3, 12 and 24. The 12 subscales in the VFQ-25 are general health, general vision, ocular pain, near activities, distance activities, social function, mental health, role difficulties, dependency, driving, color vision, and peripheral vision. The scores on the subscales were added together for a total score, which ranged from 0 to 100. A higher score indicated poorer function.</description>
