  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteosarcoma is the most common type of bone cancer in children, adolescents and young
      adults. Treatment with surgery and a combination of three conventional chemotherapy drugs can
      cure nearly two-thirds patients with osteosarcoma, but the treatment can also cause
      irreversible damage to the kidneys and cause permanent hearing loss. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate new approaches to prevent these side effects without interfering with
      the beneficial effects of the chemotherapy drugs on the cancer by using our knowledge of how
      the drugs damage the kidney and cochlear hair cells in the ear to selectively block these
      side effects. Preventing these side effects without interfering with the anti-cancer effect
      of the drugs will improve the outcome in survivors and may also improve the effectiveness of
      the chemotherapy regimen by preventing treatment delays and dose reductions that are often
      caused by the side effects. Patients will be carefully monitored to ensure that the new
      interventions do not adversely affect response to the treatment and do not increase the other
      side effects of the chemotherapy. Specifically, we will monitor the nutritional status of the
      patients closely and ask patients to complete a survey describing the side effects after each
      treatment cycle. We will also collect a small sample of cancer tissue at the time of biopsy
      and surgery from each patient on this study for testing to determine new classes of
      anti-cancer drugs currently under development may have a role in treating osteosarcoma. If
      effective, these new approaches to prevent kidney damage and hearing loss will be applicable
      in other types of cancers treated with the same chemotherapy drugs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current osteosarcoma treatment regimens include cisplatin and high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX),
      which are nephrotoxic and ototoxic, and the damage to kidneys and cochlear hair cells may be
      irreversible. Preventing these toxicities will improve the outcome in long-term survivors and
      may also prevent short-term treatment delays and dose reductions that can compromise the
      efficacy of the treatment regimen and allow for administration of higher cumulative doses of
      cisplatin. This pilot study evaluates pharmacologically-based approaches to prevent the
      nephrotoxic effect of HDMTX by prolonging the infusion duration and thereby lowering the risk
      of drug precipitation in renal tubules; and to selectively block the uptake of cisplatin into
      renal tubular cells and cochlear hair cells by inhibiting the organic cation transporter 2
      (OCT2) with the proton pump inhibitor (PPI), pantoprazole. Participants with previously
      untreated biopsy-proven, localized or metastatic osteosarcoma will receive six cycles of the
      standard Methotrexate, Adriamycin (doxorubicin),cisplatin (MAP) chemotherapy regimen, which
      includes high-dose methotrexate, doxorubicin and cisplatin. The first 2 cycles are
      administered neoadjuvantly followed by surgery to remove the primary tumor, when feasible.

      A novel randomized, crossover, 2 x 2 factorial clinical trial design allows all patients to
      receive the new interventions to prevent toxicity and to serve as their own controls. New,
      sensitive urinary biomarkers of acute kidney injury serve as primary endpoints for evaluating
      treatment-related renal damage. Ototoxicity will be monitored using audiograms. The effect of
      these interventions on tumor response (radiographic and histologic) and toxicity (including a
      patient reported outcome survey and nutritional status) will be closely monitored. Other
      secondary objectives include evaluating bone-specific alkaline phosphatase as a biomarker of
      tumor burden and constructing a tissue microarray to evaluate expression of proteins that are
      responsible for resistance to the current drugs used to treat osteosarcoma and assess
      expression of proteins that are targeted by new anticancer drugs under development for
      childhood cancers.

        <description>This measure describes the urinary biomarkers of AKI after each course of C throughout Cycles 1-2, compared to baseline (pre-infusion) values.
Biomarkers of AKI, include: Kidney Injury Molecule-1 (KIM-1), and Neutrophil Gelatinase‐Associated Lipocalin (NGAL).</description>

This is a general comparison of the changes in AKI measurements when using the PTZ inhibitor, whether HDTMX is infused for 4 or 12 hours.</population>

        <title>Change in Tumor Volume</title>
        <description>Response of the primary tumor to the first two treatment cycles (Cycles 1 and 2) will be assessed by quantifying the change in tumor volume on MRI, after treatment (pre-operative) relative to the pre-treatment tumor volume. By using the log ratio of the tumor volume post-treatment, to the tumor volume pre-treatment. The larger the change, the more effective the treatment.</description>

    <reported_events>
      <time_frame>Adverse events are tracked from the time of the first subject's enrollment, until completion of study therapy of the last enrolled subject, spanning 3.5 years. Each treatment cycle is 4-5 weeks, and there are 6 treatment cycles per subject (24-30 weeks of treatment cycles). In addition, surgery recovery after Cycle 2 is 1-2 weeks. Each fully evaluable subject participated in the study 25-32 weeks (6-8 months).</time_frame>
      <desc>Adverse events were tracked according to arms/groups of studies, and the cycles at which they occured for each arm/group. Given the nature of how the interventions were implemented, separating each treatment or intervention would not account for the cause of the adverse event, nor identify the time at which the adverse event occured. In order to be consistent, adverse events are reported according to the arm in which they occured.</desc>
