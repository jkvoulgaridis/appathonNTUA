    <measure>Description of the Characteristics of Anticoagulant Initiators</measure>
    <time_frame>From January 2009 to September 2015 (The study period)</time_frame>
    <description>The analyses described the characteristics of patients treated with various oral anticoagulants. CHA2DS2-VASc stroke risk score is calculated based on the following conditions: Congestive heart failure/ Left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, Hypertension, Age (≥ 75), Diabetes Mellitus, Stroke/ transient ischemic attack (TIA) /thromboembolism, Vascular disease, Age 65-74, female gender. HAS-BLED bleeding risk score is calculated based on the following conditions: Hypertension, Abnormal renal and liver function, Stroke (1 point), Bleeding history or predisposition, Labile international normalized ratio (INR), Elderly (&gt;65 years), Drugs and Alcohol. CHA2DS2-VASc stroke risk score may range from 0 to 9 with 0 being the best outcome. HAS-BLED bleeding risk score may range from 0 to 9 with 0 being the best outcome. New initiators of warfarin before Dabigatran became available were only characterized in terms of age and sex (results provided above).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients Initiating Specific Anticoagulant</measure>
    <time_frame>From January 2009 to September 2015 (The study period)</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of patients initiating specific anticoagulant over time per arm in source cohort is estimated and is expressed in percentage. This is related to UnitedHealth database and no treatment initiation rate was estimated in MarketScan as the study cohort was defined from a population of oral anticoagulants users. The overall number of participants analyzed &quot;609201&quot; reported for each of the treatment arm below corresponds to overall patients numbers in UnitedHealth for the entire study period rather than for each of the treatment arm. Likewise the number of participants for each of the treatment arm for different time period corresponds to the total number of participants for the specific study period rather than for each of the treatment arm. Incident users at given time period could also be counted in later time period if the patient discontinued the drug and had re-entry during the study period.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients Initiating Specific Anticoagulant Dose - Dabigatran</measure>
    <time_frame>From January 2009 to September 2015 (The study period)</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of patients initiating specific anticoagulant dose of dabigatran across all time periods combined in the unmatched cohort for UnitedHealth and MarketScan cohort are presented. Proportion of patients initiating specific anticoagulant over time per arm in source cohort is estimated and is expressed in percentage.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients Initiating Specific Anticoagulant Dose - Apixaban</measure>
    <time_frame>From January 2009 to September 2015 (The study period)</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of patients initiating specific anticoagulant dose of apixaban across all time periods combined in the unmatched cohort for UnitedHealth and MarketScan cohort are presented. Proportion of patients initiating specific anticoagulant over time per arm in source cohort is estimated and is expressed in percentage.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients Initiating Specific Anticoagulant Dose - Rivaroxaban</measure>
    <time_frame>From January 2009 to September 2015 (The study period)</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of patients initiating specific anticoagulant dose of rivaroxaban across all time periods combined in the unmatched cohort for UnitedHealth and MarketScan cohort are presented. Proportion of patients initiating specific anticoagulant over time per arm in source cohort is estimated and is expressed in percentage.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Persistence Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>From January 2009 to September 2015 (The study period)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall treatment persistence in UnitedHealth and MarketScan cohorts are presented as the percentage of patients who were persistent to treatment after 3, 6 and 12 months of follow-up for all time periods combined and matched cohort. Based on two US-based longitudinal healthcare claims databases (MarketScan and unitedHealth Research Database) the three separate study cohorts warfarin vs dabigatran, warfarin vs rivaroxaban and warfarin vs apixaban cohort were formed for each database.</description>

        <description>The analyses described the characteristics of patients treated with various oral anticoagulants. CHA2DS2-VASc stroke risk score is calculated based on the following conditions: Congestive heart failure/ Left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, Hypertension, Age (≥ 75), Diabetes Mellitus, Stroke/ transient ischemic attack (TIA) /thromboembolism, Vascular disease, Age 65-74, female gender. HAS-BLED bleeding risk score is calculated based on the following conditions: Hypertension, Abnormal renal and liver function, Stroke (1 point), Bleeding history or predisposition, Labile international normalized ratio (INR), Elderly (&gt;65 years), Drugs and Alcohol. CHA2DS2-VASc stroke risk score may range from 0 to 9 with 0 being the best outcome. HAS-BLED bleeding risk score may range from 0 to 9 with 0 being the best outcome. New initiators of warfarin before Dabigatran became available were only characterized in terms of age and sex (results provided above).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Patients Initiating Specific Anticoagulant</title>
        <description>Proportion of patients initiating specific anticoagulant over time per arm in source cohort is estimated and is expressed in percentage. This is related to UnitedHealth database and no treatment initiation rate was estimated in MarketScan as the study cohort was defined from a population of oral anticoagulants users. The overall number of participants analyzed &quot;609201&quot; reported for each of the treatment arm below corresponds to overall patients numbers in UnitedHealth for the entire study period rather than for each of the treatment arm. Likewise the number of participants for each of the treatment arm for different time period corresponds to the total number of participants for the specific study period rather than for each of the treatment arm. Incident users at given time period could also be counted in later time period if the patient discontinued the drug and had re-entry during the study period.</description>
        <time_frame>From January 2009 to September 2015 (The study period)</time_frame>
        <population>Source cohort in a calendar time window includes all patients with at least one day eligibility. A random date within the time window selected and set as the index date. Patients dispensed of an anticoagulant before assigned index date will be removed, unless they are identified as new initiators for that particular time period.</population>

          <title>Percentage of Patients Initiating Specific Anticoagulant</title>
          <description>Proportion of patients initiating specific anticoagulant over time per arm in source cohort is estimated and is expressed in percentage. This is related to UnitedHealth database and no treatment initiation rate was estimated in MarketScan as the study cohort was defined from a population of oral anticoagulants users. The overall number of participants analyzed &quot;609201&quot; reported for each of the treatment arm below corresponds to overall patients numbers in UnitedHealth for the entire study period rather than for each of the treatment arm. Likewise the number of participants for each of the treatment arm for different time period corresponds to the total number of participants for the specific study period rather than for each of the treatment arm. Incident users at given time period could also be counted in later time period if the patient discontinued the drug and had re-entry during the study period.</description>
          <population>Source cohort in a calendar time window includes all patients with at least one day eligibility. A random date within the time window selected and set as the index date. Patients dispensed of an anticoagulant before assigned index date will be removed, unless they are identified as new initiators for that particular time period.</population>
