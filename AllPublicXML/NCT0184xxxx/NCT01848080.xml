  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Telerehabilitation is a promising alternative approach that can help improve access to
      rehabilitation services once patients are discharged home after stroke. The investigators
      therefore postulate a non-inferiority hypothesis of the telerehabilitation approach compared
      to home visits to improve balance problem related to stroke. The platform used will be based
      on a technological infrastructure that was developed and tested in previous
      telerehabilitation studies. The study is a randomized control trial (RCT).The study
      population of interest will target individuals who have had a stroke who stayed in a hospital
      or chronic stroke population. Participants will be recruited during the hospitalization
      period at each of the three sites or in the community. The investigators expect to recruit
      240 participants, 120 per group. The first evaluation will be conducted at recruitment to
      establish the baseline measures. The two other evaluations will be conducted 2 months (T2)
      and four months (T3) following recruitment.

    <description>An individualized exercise program, based on Tai Chi, was developed by our team for previous studies aiming to improve balance in elderly, diabetic individuals and in frail, elderly individuals with balance problems. The exercise program consists of movements based on a combination of alignments and body-specific orientations, weight transfers and changes in direction inspired by Tai Chi. This group will receive this program via telerehabilitation.</description>
