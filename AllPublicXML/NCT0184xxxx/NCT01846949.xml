  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to be a prospective observational study at multiple sites, not a
      randomized controlled trial (RCT). The uses of the biomarkers has been approved by government
      regulations and adopted for surveillance programs in some countries, thus an RCT which
      compares patients followed by US alone with patients followed by both US and the biomarkers
      would raise an ethical conflict, especially in countries where the biomarkers have been
      routinely used.

      For this study, enrolled patients will be followed by US and the biomarkers at regular
      intervals and classified after completing the study to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of
      the biomarkers. The comparisons of sensitivity, specificity, and other parameters with
      respect to tumor characteristics will be made among US alone, the biomarkers, and combined
      use of US and the biomarkers. Also economical effectiveness of using the biomarkers will be
      investigated in this study.

      Requirement status is monitored every month.
