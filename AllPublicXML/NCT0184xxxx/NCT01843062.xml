    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Study conducted between 27 Aug 2013 and 06 Mar 2019. 42 centres in 8 countries randomised patients in the study. A primary analysis was performed for the 18 months post-radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment period with a data cut-off of 18 May 2018. All primary and secondary outcome measures were reported at the time of the primary analysis.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Eligible patients with differentiated thyroid cancer at high risk of primary treatment failure were randomly assigned (ratio 2:1), to receive selumetinib in combination with adjuvant RAI therapy or placebo and adjuvant RAI therapy for a period of approximately 5 weeks.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Selumetinib 75 mg BD + RAI</title>
          <description>Patients received selumetinib (75 milligrams [mg], orally twice daily [BD]), for a period of approximately 5 weeks. Selumetinib was to be started approximately 4 weeks prior to the planned day of RAI therapy administered as a single oral dose of 100 millicuries (mCi). To stimulate iodide uptake, patients received a recombinant human thyroid stimulating hormone (rhTSH) injection for each of the 2 days immediately prior to RAI therapy.</description>

        <group group_id="P2">
          <title>Placebo + RAI</title>
          <description>Patients received placebo capsules (to match selumetinib, orally BD), for a period of approximately 5 weeks. Placebo was to be started approximately 4 weeks prior to the planned day of RAI therapy administered as a single oral dose of 100 mCi. To stimulate iodide uptake, patients received a rhTSH injection for each of the 2 days immediately prior to RAI therapy.</description>

No confirmed evidence of thyroid cancer on neck ultrasound, as assessed by investigator site review.
