      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GLASSIA as an add-on
      biopharmacotherapy to standard-of-care steroid treatment as the first-line treatment in
      participants with acute GvHD with lower GI involvement.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Study was conducted between 26 April 2017 (first participant first visit) and 03 May 2018 (last participant last visit).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 1 participant was enrolled and completed Part 1 (GLASSIA) of the study, and was analyzed for efficacy and safety with individual PK parameters estimated. Part 2 (GLASSIA versus albumin [control]) was not initiated following discontinuation of the study due to operational and business considerations.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Acute Graft-versus-host Disease (GvHD) Grading at Days 28, 56 and 180</title>
        <description>Grading of GvHD was performed by the investigator according to the modified International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry (IBMTR) grading system which classifies the degree of involvement of each organ system by stage on a scale of 0 to 4. The degree of skin involvement was staged depending upon degree and severity of the lesions: Stage 1: Maculopapular rash over less than (&lt;) 25% of body area, Stage 2: Maculopapular rash over 25 to 50% of body area, Stage 3: Generalized erythroderma, Stage 4: Generalized erythroderma with bullous formation. Degree of GI involvement was staged based on severity of diarrhoea: Stage 1: 500 to 1000 mL/day,Stage 2: 1000 to 1500 mL/day, Stage 3: 1500 to 2000 mL/day, Stage 4: greater than (&gt;) 2000 mL/day OR pain OR ileus. Degree of liver involvement was staged based upon serum total bilirubin level as follows: Stage 1: 2 to 3 mg/dL, Stage 2: 3 to 6 mg/dL, Stage 3: 6 to 15 mg/dL, Stage 4: &gt;15 mg/dL.</description>

        <population>Efficacy analysis set included all participants who were evaluated for overall response at Day 28. Participants who received at least 1 dose of study treatment and who had a lower GI biopsy that was consistent with acute GvHD were considered evaluable.</population>

          <title>Acute Graft-versus-host Disease (GvHD) Grading at Days 28, 56 and 180</title>
          <description>Grading of GvHD was performed by the investigator according to the modified International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry (IBMTR) grading system which classifies the degree of involvement of each organ system by stage on a scale of 0 to 4. The degree of skin involvement was staged depending upon degree and severity of the lesions: Stage 1: Maculopapular rash over less than (&lt;) 25% of body area, Stage 2: Maculopapular rash over 25 to 50% of body area, Stage 3: Generalized erythroderma, Stage 4: Generalized erythroderma with bullous formation. Degree of GI involvement was staged based on severity of diarrhoea: Stage 1: 500 to 1000 mL/day,Stage 2: 1000 to 1500 mL/day, Stage 3: 1500 to 2000 mL/day, Stage 4: greater than (&gt;) 2000 mL/day OR pain OR ileus. Degree of liver involvement was staged based upon serum total bilirubin level as follows: Stage 1: 2 to 3 mg/dL, Stage 2: 3 to 6 mg/dL, Stage 3: 6 to 15 mg/dL, Stage 4: &gt;15 mg/dL.</description>
