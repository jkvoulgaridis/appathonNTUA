  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Antiretroviral Therapy as Long Acting Suppression (ATLAS) study is being conducted to
      establish if human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infected adult subjects with current
      viral suppression on a regimen with 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)
      plus a third agent, remain suppressed upon switching to a two-drug intramuscular (IM)
      long-acting (LA) regimen of cabotegravir (CAB) and rilpivirine (RPV). This is a Phase 3,
      multi-phase, randomized, open label, active-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group,
      non-inferiority study in HIV-1, antiretroviral therapy (ART)-adult subjects who are stably
      suppressed on a current antiretroviral (ARV) regimen. This study is designed to demonstrate
      the non-inferior antiviral activity of switching to a two drug CAB LA 400 mg + RPV LA 600 mg
      regimen every 4 weeks (Q4W: monthly) compared with maintenance of current ARV regimen
      containing 2 NRTIs plus an INI, NNRTI, or a PI. Eligible subjects will be randomized (1:1)
      into the Maintenance Phase at Day 1 to either continue current ART or switch to initiate oral
      therapy with CAB 30 mg + RPV 25 mg once daily for 4 Weeks followed by Q4 weekly (monthly) CAB
      LA + RPV LA injections. Following the Maintenance phase at Week 52, subjects who were
      randomized to continue their current ART regimen will be given an option to switch to CAB LA
      + RPV LA injections. Those subjects would transition to LA dosing, beginning with 4 weeks
      oral CAB + RPV therapy at Week 52, and receive the first IM CAB LA + RPV LA injections at
      Week 56.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Individual Item Scores of HIVTSQc at Weeks 4b, 24 and 44</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 4b, 24 and 44</time_frame>
    <description>HIVTSQc is a 12 item questionnaire. The individual treatment change item scores on HIVTSQc scale are rated as +3 ('much more satisfied', 'much more convenient', 'much more flexible',etc.) to -3 ('much less satisfied', 'much less convenient', 'much less flexible', etc.). The higher the score, the greater the improvement in satisfaction with each aspect of treatment and the lower the score, the greater the deterioration in satisfaction with each aspect of treatment. LOCF was used as primary method of analysis. Baseline value is defined as the latest pre-treatment assessment with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline value is calculated as the value at the post-dose visit minus the Baseline value.</description>

          <description>During Maintenance phase (Day 1-Week 52), participants received oral CAB 30 milligram (mg)+RPV 25 mg once daily from Day 1 for 4 weeks. At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA. Participants withdrawn from study treatment who received at least one CAB LA+RPV LA injection were required to enter a 52-week long term follow-up period</description>

At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA.

At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA. Participants withdrawn from study treatment who received at least one CAB LA+RPV LA injection were required to enter a 52-week long term follow-up period</description>

At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA. Participants withdrawn from study treatment who received at least one CAB LA+RPV LA injection were required to enter a 52-week long term follow-up period</description>

At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA. Participants withdrawn from study treatment who received at least one CAB LA+RPV LA injection were required to enter a 52-week long term follow-up period</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of hematology parameters including basophil, eosinophils, leukocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, and platelets at indicated timepoints. Baseline value is defined as the latest pre-treatment assessment with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline was defined as post-dose visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA. Participants withdrawn from study treatment who received at least one CAB LA+RPV LA injection were required to enter a 52-week long term follow-up period</description>

At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA. Participants withdrawn from study treatment who received at least one CAB LA+RPV LA injection were required to enter a 52-week long term follow-up period</description>

At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA. Participants withdrawn from study treatment who received at least one CAB LA+RPV LA injection were required to enter a 52-week long term follow-up period</description>

At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA. Participants withdrawn from study treatment who received at least one CAB LA+RPV LA injection were required to enter a 52-week long term follow-up period</description>

At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA. Participants withdrawn from study treatment who received at least one CAB LA+RPV LA injection were required to enter a 52-week long term follow-up period</description>

At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA.

At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA. Participants withdrawn from study treatment who received at least one CAB LA+RPV LA injection were required to enter a 52-week long term follow-up period</description>

        <description>The dipstick test gives results in a semi-quantitative manner and results for urinalysis parameters (ketones, glucose, bilirubin, occult blood, nitrite and blood protein) can be read as positive, trace, 1+, 2+, 3+ and 4+ indicating proportional concentrations in the urine sample. The urine parameters were graded according to Division of AIDS (DAIDS) scale where Grade 1 indicates mild (trace to 1+), Grade 2 indicates moderate (2+) and Grade 3 indicates severe (3+ or higher). Only participants with abnormal findings for urinalysis at any visit has been presented.</description>

At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA. Participants withdrawn from study treatment who received at least one CAB LA+RPV LA injection were required to enter a 52-week long term follow-up period</description>

        <description>Urine samples were collected for analysis of urine pH. pH is calculated on a scale of 0 to 14, values on the scale refer to the degree of alkalinity or acidity. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH of less than 7 is acidic and a pH of greater than 7 is basic. Normal urine has a slightly acidic pH (5.0-6.0).</description>

At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA.

At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA. Participants withdrawn from study treatment who received at least one CAB LA+RPV LA injection were required to enter a 52-week long term follow-up period</description>

At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA. Participants withdrawn from study treatment who received at least one CAB LA+RPV LA injection were required to enter a 52-week long term follow-up period</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of clinical chemistry parameters including bilirubin, creatinine and direct bilirubin. Baseline value is defined as the latest pre-treatment assessment with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline value is calculated as the value at the post-dose visit minus the Baseline value.</description>

At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA. Participants withdrawn from study treatment who received at least one CAB LA+RPV LA injection were required to enter a 52-week long term follow-up period</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Values for Clinical Chemistry Parameters Over Time Including Week 48</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of clinical chemistry parameters which includes total CO2, chloride, glucose, phosphate, potassium, sodium and urea. Baseline value is defined as the latest pre-treatment assessment with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline value is calculated as the value at the post-dose visit minus the Baseline value.</description>

            <description>During Maintenance phase (Day 1-Week 52), participants received oral CAB 30 milligram (mg)+RPV 25 mg once daily from Day 1 for 4 weeks. At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA. Participants withdrawn from study treatment who received at least one CAB LA+RPV LA injection were required to enter a 52-week long term follow-up period</description>

At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA.

        <title>Change From Baseline Values for Clinical Chemistry Parameter Over Time Including Week 48: Creatinine Clearance.</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of clinical chemistry parameter-creatinine clearance. GFR will be estimated by the central laboratory using the CKD-EPI. Baseline value is defined as the latest pre-treatment assessment with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline value is calculated as the value at the post-dose visit minus the Baseline value.</description>

At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA. Participants withdrawn from study treatment who received at least one CAB LA+RPV LA injection were required to enter a 52-week long term follow-up period</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of fasting lipid parameters- total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Baseline value is defined as the latest pre-treatment assessment with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline value is calculated as the value at the post-dose visit minus the Baseline value.</description>

At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA. Participants withdrawn from study treatment who received at least one CAB LA+RPV LA injection were required to enter a 52-week long term follow-up period</description>

        <description>Urine biomarker samples were collected for the analysis of urine specific gravity. Urine specific gravity is a measure of the concentration of solutes in the urine and provides information on the kidney's ability to concentrate urine. The dipstick test gives results in a semi-quantitative manner. Baseline value is defined as the latest pre-treatment assessment with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline value is calculated as the value at the post-dose visit minus the Baseline value. The urine specific gravity was measured as the ratio of urine density compared with water density.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Values in Urine pH Over Time Including Week 48</title>
        <description>Urine samples were collected for analysis of urine pH. pH is calculated on a scale of 0 to 14, values on the scale refer to the degree of alkalinity or acidity. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH of less than 7 is acidic and a pH of greater than 7 is basic. Normal urine has a slightly acidic pH (5.0-6.0). The dipstick test gives results in a semi-quantitative manner. Baseline value is defined as the latest pre-treatment assessment with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline value is calculated as the value at the post-dose visit minus the Baseline value.</description>

          <description>Urine samples were collected for analysis of urine pH. pH is calculated on a scale of 0 to 14, values on the scale refer to the degree of alkalinity or acidity. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH of less than 7 is acidic and a pH of greater than 7 is basic. Normal urine has a slightly acidic pH (5.0-6.0). The dipstick test gives results in a semi-quantitative manner. Baseline value is defined as the latest pre-treatment assessment with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline value is calculated as the value at the post-dose visit minus the Baseline value.</description>

            <description>During Maintenance phase (Day 1-Week 52), participants received oral CAB 30 milligram (mg)+RPV 25 mg once daily from Day 1 for 4 weeks. At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA. Participants withdrawn from study treatment who received at least one CAB LA+RPV LA injection were required to enter a 52-week long term follow-up period</description>

            <description>During Maintenance phase (Day 1-Week 52), participants received oral CAB 30 milligram (mg)+RPV 25 mg once daily from Day 1 for 4 weeks. At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA. Participants withdrawn from study treatment who received at least one CAB LA+RPV LA injection were required to enter a 52-week long term follow-up period</description>

At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA. Participants withdrawn from study treatment who received at least one CAB LA+RPV LA injection were required to enter a 52-week long term follow-up period</description>

At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA. Participants withdrawn from study treatment who received at least one CAB LA+RPV LA injection were required to enter a 52-week long term follow-up period</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Values for Clinical Chemistry Parameters Using Baseline Third Agent Treatment Class Overtime Including Week 48: ALT, ALP, AST and CK</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of clinical chemistry parameters: ALT, ALP, AST and CK to assess the impact of Baseline third agent treatment class (PI, NNRTI and INI). Baseline value is defined as the latest pre-treatment assessment with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline value is calculated as the value at the post-dose visit minus the Baseline value.</description>

At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA. Participants withdrawn from study treatment who received at least one CAB LA+RPV LA injection were required to enter a 52-week long term follow-up period</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of clinical chemistry parameter: albumin to assess the impact of Baseline third agent treatment class (PI, NNRTI and INI). Baseline value is defined as the latest pre-treatment assessment with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline value is calculated as the value at the post-dose visit minus the Baseline value.</description>

At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA. Participants withdrawn from study treatment who received at least one CAB LA+RPV LA injection were required to enter a 52-week long term follow-up period</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Values for Clinical Chemistry Parameters Using Baseline Third Agent Treatment Class Overtime Including Week 48: Bilirubin, Direct Bilirubin and Creatinine</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of clinical chemistry parameter: bilirubin, direct bilirubin and creatinine to assess the impact of Baseline third agent treatment class (PI, NNRTI and INI). Baseline value is defined as the latest pre-treatment assessment with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline value is calculated as the value at the post-dose visit minus the Baseline value.</description>

            <description>During Maintenance phase (Day 1-Week 52), participants received oral CAB 30 milligram (mg)+RPV 25 mg once daily from Day 1 for 4 weeks. At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA. Participants withdrawn from study treatment who received at least one CAB LA+RPV LA injection were required to enter a 52-week long term follow-up period</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Values for Clinical Chemistry Parameters Using Baseline Third Agent Treatment Class Overtime Including Week 48: Creatinine Clearance</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of clinical chemistry parameter: creatinine clearance to assess the impact of Baseline third agent treatment class (PI, NNRTI and INI). GFR will be estimated by the central laboratory using the CKD-EPI. Baseline value is defined as the latest pre-treatment assessment with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline value is calculated as the value at the post-dose visit minus the Baseline value.</description>

At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA. Participants withdrawn from study treatment who received at least one CAB LA+RPV LA injection were required to enter a 52-week long term follow-up period</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Values for Clinical Chemistry Parameters Using Baseline Third Agent Treatment Class Overtime Including Week 48: Lipase</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of clinical chemistry parameter: lipase to assess the impact of Baseline third agent treatment class (PI, NNRTI and INI). Baseline value is defined as the latest pre-treatment assessment with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline value is calculated as the value at the post-dose visit minus the Baseline value.</description>

At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA. Participants withdrawn from study treatment who received at least one CAB LA+RPV LA injection were required to enter a 52-week long term follow-up period</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Values for Clinical Chemistry Parameters Using Baseline Third Agent Treatment Class Overtime Including Week 48</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of clinical chemistry parameters: CO2, chloride, glucose, phosphate, potassium, sodium and urea to assess the impact of Baseline third agent treatment class (PI, NNRTI and INI). Baseline value is defined as the latest pre-treatment assessment with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline value is calculated as the value at the post-dose visit minus the Baseline value.</description>

            <description>During Maintenance phase (Day 1-Week 52), participants received oral CAB 30 milligram (mg)+RPV 25 mg once daily from Day 1 for 4 weeks. At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA. Participants withdrawn from study treatment who received at least one CAB LA+RPV LA injection were required to enter a 52-week long term follow-up period</description>

          <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of clinical chemistry parameters: CO2, chloride, glucose, phosphate, potassium, sodium and urea to assess the impact of Baseline third agent treatment class (PI, NNRTI and INI). Baseline value is defined as the latest pre-treatment assessment with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline value is calculated as the value at the post-dose visit minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Values for Fasting Lipid Panel Using Baseline Third Agent Treatment Class Overtime Including Week 48</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of fasting lipid panel: triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol to assess the impact of Baseline third agent treatment class (PI, NNRTI and INI). Baseline value is defined as the latest pre-treatment assessment with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline value is calculated as the value at the post-dose visit minus the Baseline value.</description>

Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA.

Baseline value is defined as the latest pre-treatment assessment with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline value is calculated as the value at the post-dose visit minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <description>Plasma samples were collected from participants who met confirmed virologic withdrawal criteria to assess the impact of Baseline third agent treatment class (PI, NNRTI and INI). Phenotypic Resistance data for the following drugs: CAB, DTG, EVG, RAL, DLV, EFV, ETR, NVP, RPV, 3TC, ABC, FTC, TDF, ZDV, d4T, ddI, ATV, DRV, FPV, IDV, LPV, NFV, RTV, SQV and TPV in participants meeting CVF criteria has been presented. Phenotypic resistance, partially sensitive, and Sensitive were defined based on FC value from Monogram as: resistance (FC&gt;clinical higher cutoff/biologic cutoff), partially sensitive (FC &lt;=clinical higher cutoff and &gt; clinical lower cutoff), sensitive (FC &lt;= clinical lower cutoff/biologic cutoff).</description>

At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA. Participants withdrawn from study treatment who received at least one CAB LA+RPV LA injection were required to enter a 52-week long term follow-up period</description>

        <title>Change From Week 5 in Dimension Scores Using Percerption of Injection Questionnaire (PIN)-Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) in Q4W Arm</title>
        <description>The PIN questionnaire explores the bother of pain at the injection site and injection site reactions (ISR), anxiety before and after injection, willingness to receive an HIV injectable treatment the following visit and satisfaction with the mode of treatment administration of individuals receiving injection and perceptions of individuals associated with receiving injections.This measure contains 21 items that measure pain at injection site, local site reactions, impact on functioning and willingness to pursue injectable treatment outside of a clinical trial.Scores range from 1 to 5, and questions are phrased in such a way as to ensure that 1 always equated with the most favourable perception of vaccination, and 5 the most unfavourable.Dimension scores include bother from ISR, leg movement, sleep and acceptability.The score of a domain is calculated as the mean of all items with the domain.Higher scores represent worse perception of injection.

At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA. Participants withdrawn from study treatment who received at least one CAB LA+RPV LA injection were required to enter a 52-week long term follow-up period</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Life Satisfaction (LISAT) Using HIV/AIDs-targeted Quality of Life (HATQoL) Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The HATQoL questionnaire was used to assess the health related QoL (HRQoL). It comprises of three dimensions: LISAT, medication worries (MEDWO) and disclosure worries (DISWO). The total imputed value score for LISAT is calculated on a 0-100 scale using the formula: LISAT 100=[100 divided by (20 minus 4)]*(LISAT minus 4). A response of 5 in LISAT score shows satisfaction all of the time and 1 as none of the time. The higher the score, the greater satisfaction to life and the less worry. The transformed dimension score for each domain was summarized and analyzed. LOCF was used as primary method of analysis. Measure type was considered as mean for adjusted mean and dispersion measure as 95% confidence interval (CI).Baseline value is defined as the latest pre-treatment assessment with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline value is calculated as the value at the post-dose visit minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in DISWO Using HATQoL</title>
        <description>The HATQoL questionnaire was used to assess the health related QoL (HRQoL). It comprises of three dimensions: LISAT, medication worries (MEDWO) and disclosure worries (DISWO). The total imputed value score for DISWO is calculated on a 0-100 scale using the formula: DISWO 100=[100 divided by (20 minus 5)]*(DISWO minus 5). A response of 1 in DISWO score shows less medication worries all of the time and 5 as none of the time. The higher the score, the greater satisfaction to life and the less worry. The transformed dimension score for each domain was summarized and analyzed. LOCF was used as primary method of analysis. Measure type was considered as mean for adjusted mean and dispersion measure as 95% CI. Baseline value is defined as the latest pre-treatment assessment with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline value is calculated as the value at the post-dose visit minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Status Using 12-item Short Form Survey (SF-12)</title>
        <description>The SF-12 questionnaire consists of 7 questions which measures the degree of general health status and mental health distress. Each question is scored 0-5, except for question 2 scored 0-3. The HRQoL using SF-12 for the total score, physical component summary (PCS) and the mental component summary (MCS) were assessed for the two treatment groups. Missing Total or the component scores was imputed using LOCF. The PCS/MCS are calculated using computer software purchased from QualityMetric (http://www.qualitymetric.com). The higher the score, the better will be the health status. Measure type was considered as mean for adjusted mean and dispersion measure as 95% CI. Baseline value is defined as the latest pre-treatment assessment with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline value is calculated as the value at the post-dose visit minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Treatment Satisfaction Using HIV Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (HIVTSQs) at Weeks 4b, 24 and 44</title>
        <description>The HIVTSQ for total treatment satisfaction score is computed with 1-11 items. These 1-11 items are summed to produce a score with a possible range of -33 to 33. The item 12 in the scale will be calculated as an individual score.The higher the score, the greater the improvement in satisfaction with treatment; the lower the score, the greater the deterioration in satisfaction with treatment.A score of 0 represents no change. A maximum of 5 items can be missing, the missing scores will be imputed with the mean of the completed item scores. If 6 or more items are missing, then the overall treatment satisfaction scale score should not be computed and will remain missing.LOCF was used as primary method of analysis. Baseline value is defined as the latest pre-treatment assessment with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline value is calculated as the value at the post-dose visit minus the Baseline value. Data has been presented with respect to actual treatment received to the participants</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Treatment Acceptance at Weeks 8, 24 and 48 Using &quot;General Acceptance&quot; Dimension of the Chronic Treatment Acceptance (ACCEPT) Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The ACCEPT questionnaire is a generic medication acceptance measure assessing how participants weigh advantages and disadvantages of long-term medication.The questionnaire consists of 25 items that capture six dimensions.3 questions that focus on general acceptance of study medication will be analyzed.Items on the scale are rated as 1-5 scores:1:totally disagree,2:somewhat disagree,3:somewhat agree, 4:totally agree and 5:I don't know.Total score of the dimension is calculated as the mean of the recoded items of the dimension and then linearly transformed to be on a scale from 0 to 100:score:Total Score=(mean of the recoded items in the dimension minus1)divided by2*100.LOCF was used as primary method of analysis.Measure type was considered as mean for adjusted mean and dispersion measure as 95% CI.Baseline value is defined as the latest pre-treatment assessment with a non-missing value.Change from Baseline value is calculated as the value at the post-dose visit minus the Baseline value</description>

            <description>During Maintenance phase (Day 1-Week 52), participants received oral CAB 30 milligram (mg)+RPV 25 mg once daily from Day 1 for 4 weeks. At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA. Participants withdrawn from study treatment who received at least one CAB LA+RPV LA injection were required to enter a 52-week long term follow-up period</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Treatment Acceptance at Weeks 8, 24 and 48 Using &quot;General Acceptance&quot; Dimension of the Chronic Treatment Acceptance (ACCEPT) Questionnaire</title>
          <description>The ACCEPT questionnaire is a generic medication acceptance measure assessing how participants weigh advantages and disadvantages of long-term medication.The questionnaire consists of 25 items that capture six dimensions.3 questions that focus on general acceptance of study medication will be analyzed.Items on the scale are rated as 1-5 scores:1:totally disagree,2:somewhat disagree,3:somewhat agree, 4:totally agree and 5:I don't know.Total score of the dimension is calculated as the mean of the recoded items of the dimension and then linearly transformed to be on a scale from 0 to 100:score:Total Score=(mean of the recoded items in the dimension minus1)divided by2*100.LOCF was used as primary method of analysis.Measure type was considered as mean for adjusted mean and dispersion measure as 95% CI.Baseline value is defined as the latest pre-treatment assessment with a non-missing value.Change from Baseline value is calculated as the value at the post-dose visit minus the Baseline value</description>

        <description>HIVTSQc is a 12 item questionnaire. The individual treatment change item scores on HIVTSQc scale are rated as +3 ('much more satisfied', 'much more convenient', 'much more flexible',etc.) to -3 ('much less satisfied', 'much less convenient', 'much less flexible', etc.). The higher the score, the greater the improvement in satisfaction with each aspect of treatment and the lower the score, the greater the deterioration in satisfaction with each aspect of treatment. LOCF was used as primary method of analysis. Baseline value is defined as the latest pre-treatment assessment with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline value is calculated as the value at the post-dose visit minus the Baseline value.</description>

At Week 4B, the participants were given the last dose of oral CAB+RPV and the first dose of CAB LA 600 mg+RPV LA 900 mg injections within 2 hours of the final oral dose. Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg every four weeks (Q4W) through Week 52. After completion of Maintenance phase, participants who chose to enter Extension phase continued to receive both CAB LA and RPV LA.
