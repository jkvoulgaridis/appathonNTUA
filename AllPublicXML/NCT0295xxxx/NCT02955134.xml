  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy of Chinese medicine treatment for chronic
      atrophic gastritis. It is a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial is carried
      out in this study.The sample size is 468 patients ( 312 in treatment group, 156 in control
      group). The investigators will screen the patients for inclusion according to the inclusion
      and exclusion criteria. All patients detect of H.pylori, undergo upper digestive endoscopy
      and biopsies for histological investigation. Patients infected of H.pylori must receive
      H.pylori eradication therapy under the guidance of Kyoto global consensus report on H.pylori
      gastritis. Then they are assigned to treatment group or control group with an allocation
      ratio of 2:1. Patients intreatment group take the traditional Chinese medicine prescription,
      while the control group take simulate granule of the prescription. Both two groups are under
      symptomatic treatment. Treatment duration lasts 24 weeks. Investigators also follow up
      another 24 weeks. Histological changes are used as the primary outcome index. Endoscopy
      findings, symptoms are assessed. Serum level of pepsinogen and patient-reported outcome
      instrument are also administered during the study. All biopsy specimens are collected to
      build the biological specimen bank. Central blinded histological assessment (Histological
      diagnosis is determined independently by three experienced pathologists who are blinded to
      the information of the patients.) are used to insure the accuracy and consistency.
      Tele-medicine and information management system is established to help achieve follow-up
      interviews.

      Random numbers are generated by SAS 9.4 software. The subjects, caregivers, investigators and
      outcomes assessors in this study are all blinded.

    <description>Gastric mucosa samples are subsequently evaluated according to updated Sydney system with the degree of H.pylori density, polymorphonuclear neutrophil activity, chronic inflammation, glandular atrophy, and intestinal metaplasia classified as: 0,'absent'; 2, 'mild'; 4, 'moderate'; and 6, 'marked'. Grade of histological gastritis is evaluated with this score 0, 2, 4, and 6. Dysplasia was assessed according to the revised Vienna classification, scored as 0 (absent), 2 (mild), 4 (moderate), or 6 (marked).</description>

    <description>Symptoms of dyspepsia, regurgitation and defecation are assessed for severity and frequency at enrollment in every interview during the study.For each symptom, the scores are calculated by multiplying frequency by severity.
All symptom scores are added to define the total symptom score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of endoscopic atrophy</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline endoscopic atrophy at 6 months and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Endoscopic atrophy are defined using an endoscopicatrophic border scale previously reported by Kimura and Takemoto. This scale correlates with histological results and includes the following classifications: 1 close-type, when the atrophic border remains on the lesser curvature of the stomach; 2 open-type, when the atrophic border extends along the anterior and posterior walls of the stomach and is not associated with the lesser curvature of the stomach. Close-type and open-type atrophy are further classified as none (C0), mild (C1, 2),moderate (C3, O1), and severe (O2, 3) atrophy. In this study, atrophy grade are also scored as C0: 0, C1: 1, C2: 2, C3:3, O1: 4, O2: 5, and O3: 6 respectively, with 0 representing an absence of atrophy and 6 indicating severe atrophy.</description>

    <description>Three expert GI pathologists, who are blinded for the endoscopic findings, independently assessed all biopsy specimens of the surveillance endoscopy. The type and grade of the different stages of changes are classified according to the updated Sydney system and scored as 0 (absent), 1 (mild), 2(moderate), or 3 (marked) by using the Sydney system visual analog scale. On the basis of the standardized sites, the gastritis stages areassess according to the OLGA.</description>
