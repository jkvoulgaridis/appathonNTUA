  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of SPI-2012 with pegfilgrastim in
      patients with early-stage breast cancer receiving docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (TC) to
      prevent and reduce Neutropenia that is associated with cancer chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter study to compare
      the efficacy and safety of SPI-2012 with pegfilgrastim in breast cancer patients treated with
      TC chemotherapy to prevent and reduce Neutropenia.

      Approximately 218 patients will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 2 treatment
      arms:

      Each cycle will be 21 days. Total 4 cycles will be evaluated for this study. On Day 1 of each
      cycle, patients will receive TC chemotherapy. On Day 2 of each cycle, patients will received
      study drug (SPI-2012 or pegfilgrastim).

      After cycle 1, as applicable, patients who have received at least one dose of study drug will
      be followed for 12 months after the last dose of study treatment for safety.
