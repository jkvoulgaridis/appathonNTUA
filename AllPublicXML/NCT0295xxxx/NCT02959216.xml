  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of aerobic exercise treatment in the chronic phase of concussion recovery is
      well-described in the literature but there are limited existing data on the effect of
      exercise treatment in the acute phase after sport-related concussion (SRC). This study will
      compare the outcomes of adolescents with a recent SRC who are randomized to sub-threshold
      aerobic exercise versus those randomized to placebo stretching to evaluate the effect of
      aerobic exercise in the acute recovery phase.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Historically, concussion has been described as a cognitive injury and patients have been
      advised not to engage in any cognitive or physical exertion while symptomatic. More recently,
      however, concussion has been described as a physiological injury affecting both the heart and
      autonomic nervous system, and patients suffering from prolonged concussion-related symptoms
      and deficits have been encouraged to begin aerobic exercise as part of their concussion care.
      While intensive exercise too soon after concussion has been associated with delayed recovery
      and used to justify prolonged periods of rest, recent studies have shown that controlled,
      sub-symptom threshold aerobic exercise may aid recovery by improving autonomic balance and
      cerebral blood flow auto-regulation after concussion. This study will randomly assign
      pediatric patients with concussion to a treatment group in which they will complete
      sub-symptom threshold aerobic exercise or to a placebo group in which they will complete a
      standardized stretching protocol. All participants will have routine visits that consist of a
      physical examination and exercise test until the intervention ends at recovery or 1-month
      post-randomization.

    <description>Aerobic exercise participants will receive an exercise prescription based on their heart rate threshold (HRT) for symptom exacerbation during an initial treadmill test. Participants will be asked to exercise once a day up to 90% of their assigned HRT for a minimum of 20 minutes. Participants will wear a heart rate monitor to track their heart rate during aerobic exercise. The treatment will continue until the participant is recovered from his/her concussion, as determined by exercise tolerance and a normal symptom count and clinical examination.</description>
