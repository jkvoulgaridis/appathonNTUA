  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1/2 study in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
      The study has three separate treatment groups where separate epigenetic agents are evaluated
      with an immunotherapy combination. Treatment Group A will evaluate the DNA methyltransferase
      inhibitor azacitidine in combination with the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) inhibitor
      pembrolizumab and the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1) inhibitor epacadostat; Treatment
      Group B will evaluate the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitor INCB057643 with
      pembrolizumab and epacadostat; and Treatment Group C will evaluate the lysine-specific
      demethylase 1A (LSD1) inhibitor INCB059872 with pembrolizumab and epacadostat. The study will
      be divided into 2 parts (Part 1 and 2). Part 1 is a dose-escalation assessment to evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of the combination therapies. Once the recommended doses have
      been determined, subjects with previously treated NSCLC, microsatellite-stable colorectal
      cancer (CRC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, and melanoma will
      be enrolled into expansion cohorts in Part 2.

    <time_frame>Every 9 weeks for the duration of study participation; estimated minimum of 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants having a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by investigator assessment of radiographic disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. CR is disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. A participant was considered as an objective responder if the participant had a best overall response of CR or PR.</description>

    <description>A treatment-emergent AE was defined as an event occurring after exposure to at least 1 dose of study drug. A treatment-related AE was defined as an event with a definite, probable, or possible causality to study medication. A serious AE is an event resulting in death, hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is life threatening, a congenital anomaly/birth defect or requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes above. The intensity of an AE was graded according to the National Cancer Institute common terminology criteria for adverse events (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.03: Grade 1 (Mild); Grade 2 (Moderate); Grade 3 (Severe); Grade 4 (life-threatening).</description>

        <title>Part 1 and 2: Objective Response Rate Based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)</title>
        <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants having a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by investigator assessment of radiographic disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. CR is disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. A participant was considered as an objective responder if the participant had a best overall response of CR or PR.</description>
        <time_frame>Every 9 weeks for the duration of study participation; estimated minimum of 6 months.</time_frame>
        <population>The response evaluable population includes all subjects enrolled in the study who received at least 1 dose of study drug, completed a baseline scan and have at least 1 post baseline scan, or has been on study for a minimum of 70 days of follow-up or who discontinued treatment.

        <description>A treatment-emergent AE was defined as an event occurring after exposure to at least 1 dose of study drug. A treatment-related AE was defined as an event with a definite, probable, or possible causality to study medication. A serious AE is an event resulting in death, hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is life threatening, a congenital anomaly/birth defect or requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes above. The intensity of an AE was graded according to the National Cancer Institute common terminology criteria for adverse events (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.03: Grade 1 (Mild); Grade 2 (Moderate); Grade 3 (Severe); Grade 4 (life-threatening).</description>
