  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase IIIb study is to assess the long-term safety, tolerability, and
      immunogenicity of the subcutaneous (SC) treatment with Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (IGSC)
      facilitated with recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) (HYQVIA/HyQvia) in participants
      with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) who have completed
      Baxalta Clinical Study Protocol 161403 Epoch 1 without CIDP worsening.

    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing any Treatment-Emergent Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and/or Adverse Events (AEs), Regardless of Causality</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the study period of approximately 7 years</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants experiencing any treatment-emergent SAEs and/or AEs, regardless of causality will be assessed. An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered an IP that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an untoward medical occurrence that at any dose meets one or more of the following criteria: outcome is fatal/results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or results in prolongation of an existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, is a medically important event.</description>
