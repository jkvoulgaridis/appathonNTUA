  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acromegaly is a rare, chronic, and debilitating disease, usually caused by a benign tumor on
      the pituitary gland, which leads to excessive production of growth hormone (GH). GH excess in
      turn causes overproduction of another hormone called insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1).
      IGF-1 levels are currently the most widely accepted measure of disease activity.

      In Canada, medical therapy with a type of medicine called &quot;somatostatin analogues&quot; (SSA),
      such as octreotide and lanreotide, is recommended for treatment of acromegaly. However,
      studies have shown that a significant number of patients who take SSA medications alone
      remain with elevated levels of IGF-1 in their blood.

      Another medication that is used to treat acromegaly is pegvisomant (PEGV), and the
      investigators plan to study whether strict control of IGF-1, by adding or optimizing the use
      of PEGV, results in a significant health benefits to patients who still have modestly high
      levels of IGF-1 in their blood.

    <description>Study medications will be prescribed as per clinical practice with PEGV being added, or optimally dosed, at the Month 0 visit. Subjects who are naïve to PEGV should start their injections from 10 mg twice a week to 10 mg daily if used as combination therapy or 10 to 20 mg daily if used as monotherapy. Maximum dosing should not exceed 40mg/day. Dosing of PEGV can be adjusted as per clinical judgement to meet the normalization of IGF-1 levels (&lt;1.0 ULN) in increments of 5-10mg/day. In the event of a reduction in IGF-1 below the LLN, the dose of PEGV could be decreased by 5-10 mg/day.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients (at least 18 years old) with confirmed acromegaly whose IGF-I levels
             are persistently but modestly (1.0 ULN &lt; [IGF-1 serum level] &lt; 1.5 ULN) elevated
             following medical therapy such as SSA, PEGV, cabergoline alone or in combination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Progressive or recent visual field loss or optic chiasmal compression, or pituitary
             tumors within 2mm from the chiasm. Patients whose visual field loss, optic chiasmal
             compression or pituitary tumor has been stable for at least a year will be eligible.

          2. Cranial nerve palsies or intracranial hypertension requiring tumour decompression
             surgery

          3. Clinically significant hepatic disease and/or elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST &gt; 3 x
             ULN)

          4. Patients who have received pituitary surgery within one year prior to screening visit

          5. Patients who have received radiation therapy within one year prior to screening visit

          6. History of hypersensitivity to any components of Pegvisomant

          7. Inability to fully comprehend the nature of the study or cooperate with study
             procedures

          8. Pregnant / lactating women and subjects refusing to use adequate contraception to
             prevent pregnancy during the study.

          9. Subjects unwilling or unable to self-administer medication on a daily basis

         10. known or suspected alcohol / drug abuse
