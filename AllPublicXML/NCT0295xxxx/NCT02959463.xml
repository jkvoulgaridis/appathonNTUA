      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best way to give pembrolizumab after
      radiation therapy in treating patients with pleural malignant mesothelioma. Radiation therapy
      uses high energy radiation to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Immunotherapy with
      monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving
      pembrolizumab after radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab administered after radiation
      therapy in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) who have not undergone
      extrapleural pneumonectomy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess progression-free and overall survival (progression free survival [PFS] and
      overall survival [OS], respectively) in patients receiving pembrolizumab after radiation
      therapy for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate biomarkers of interest, including cytokines, measurements of T-cell
      activation, and serum exosome micro ribonucleic acid (RNA)s with the delivery of
      pembrolizumab after radiation therapy for MPM.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT 1: Patients undergo hemithoracic radiation therapy.

      COHORT 2: Patients undergo palliative radiation therapy over 1-3 weeks to only the region of
      palliation (a region that does not include the entire side of the chest or thorax).

      After radiation therapy, both cohorts receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over about 30
      minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks for up to 2 years in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 6 weeks for
      48 weeks, then every 12 weeks for up to 5 years.
