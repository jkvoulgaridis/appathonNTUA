    <measure>Part I: Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 Response at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 (indicates no involvement) to 6 (90 percent [%] to 100% involvement), and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (severe). The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 (no visible skin involvement) to 72 (maximal skin involvement of the whole body). A higher score indicates more severe disease. A PASI 90 response represents participants who achieved at least a 90 % improvement from baseline in the PASI score.</description>

    <time_frame>At Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on participant's quality of life, can be used to assess 6 different aspects that may affect quality of life 1) symptoms and feelings, 2) daily activities, 3) leisure, 4) work or school performance, 5) personal relationships, and 6) treatment. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life. The DLQI produces a total numeric score that can range from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much): 0-1 = no effect at all on the participant's life; 2-6 = small effect on the participant's life; 7-12 = moderate effect on the participant's life; 13-18 = very large effect on the participant's life; 19-30 = extremely large effect on the participant's life.

    <description>The PSSD (7-day version) is a patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaire designed and validated to measure the severity of psoriasis symptoms and signs for the assessment of treatment benefit. It consisted of 11 items covering symptoms (itch, pain, stinging, burning, and skin tightness) and patient-observable signs (skin dryness, cracking, scaling, shedding or flaking, redness, and bleeding) using 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable) numerical rating scales for severity. Items were averaged on the daily symptom score and sign score when at least 3 items greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 50 percentage of 5 items on these scales are answered. The average value is converted into 0-100 scoring, such that Symptom [or Sign] score=average value*10, where, 0= least severe and 100=most severe and higher score indicates more severe disease.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 V2 is a generic 36-item questionnaire measuring health-related quality of life (HRQL) covering 2 summary measures: physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS). The SF-36 consists of 8 subscales (physical function, role limitations due to physical problems, pain, general health perception, vitality, social function, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health). Participants self-report on items in a subscale that have between 2-6 choices per item using Likert-type responses (e.g. none of the time, some of the time, etc.). Summations of item scores of the same subscale give the subscale scores, which are transformed into a range from 0 to 100; zero= worst HRQL, 100=best HRQL. Higher scores indicate better health status.</description>

The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 (indicates no involvement) to 6 (90 percent [%] to 100% involvement), and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (severe). The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 (no visible skin involvement) to 72 (maximal skin involvement of the whole body). A higher score indicates more severe disease.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 56) and Week 100</time_frame>
    <description>The PSSD (7-day version) is a patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaire designed and validated to measure the severity of psoriasis symptoms and signs for the assessment of treatment benefit. It consisted of 11 items covering symptoms (itch, pain, stinging, burning, and skin tightness) and patient-observable signs (skin dryness, cracking, scaling, shedding or flaking, redness, and bleeding) using 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable) numerical rating scales for severity. Items were averaged on the daily symptom score and sign score when at least 3 items greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 50 percentage of 5 items on these scales are answered. The average value is converted into 0-100 scoring, such that Symptom [or Sign] score=average value*10, where, 0= least severe and 100=most severe and higher score indicates more severe disease.</description>

    <description>SF-36 V2 is a generic 36-item questionnaire measuring health-related quality of life (HRQL) covering 2 summary measures: physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS). The SF-36 consists of 8 subscales (physical function, role limitations due to physical problems, pain, general health perception, vitality, social function, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health). Participants self-report on items in a subscale that have between 2-6 choices per item using Likert-type responses (e.g. none of the time, some of the time, etc.). Summations of item scores of the same subscale give the subscale scores, which are transformed into a range from 0 to 100; 0 = worst HRQL, 100=best HRQL. Higher scores indicate better health status.</description>

The individual FAE dose representing the optimal efficacy/tolerability ratio needs to be determined for each participant according to local prescription information. To this aim, FAE doses will be slowly increased beginning with increasing doses of Fumderm initial (containing 30 mg dimethylfumarate) over the first 3 weeks. Thereafter, participants will be switched to Fumaderm tablets (containing 120 mg dimethylfumarate) starting with 1 tablet per day. Fumaderm dose may be increased to a maximum of 3*2 tablets per day. The decision to maintain, increase or decrease the FAE dose depends on efficacy, safety and tolerability.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>Total of 119 participants were enrolled and randomized, 118 (GUS [60], FAE [58 participants]) were treated in this study. Out of them, 42 participants completed study in Part III.</pre_assignment_details>
      <group_list>
        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Guselkumab (GUS)</title>
          <description>Participants received guselkumab (GUS) 100 milligram (mg) administered as 100 mg per milliliter (mg/mL) solution subcutaneously (SC) at Weeks 0, 4, then every 8 weeks (at Week 12 and 20 - Part I). Participants who completed Part I continued to receive GUS 100 mg at Week 28 and 32 - Part IIa. At Week 32, PASI 75 response was evaluated. PASI 75 responders and non-responders of GUS arm continued to receive GUS 100 mg SC every 8 weeks (Weeks 36, 44 and 52). PASI 75 non-responders of FAE switched to 100 mg GUS SC at Week 32, continued at Week 36, 44 and 52 (Part IIb). Safety follow-up was done at Week 32 (Part I), Week 64 (Part II) and up to 12 weeks after discontinuing drug. Participants who received GUS in Part II (who started GUS at Week 0/ switched from FAE to GUS at Week 32), had no psoriatic arthritis at baseline and achieved PASI 90 response at end of Part II (Week 56), entered follow-up extension at Week 64 in Part III and followed-up until loss of response/ until Week 100.</description>

        <group group_id="P2">
          <title>Fumaric Acid Esters (FAE)</title>
          <description>Participants received FAE tablets by self-administration at Week 0. Doses were up-titrated and were taken every day with different daily doses depending on optimal individual benefit risk ratio (maximum 6*120 mg/day) as per local prescribing information up to Week 24 (Part I). Participants who completed Part I and consented for Part IIa continued to receive same treatment up to Week 32 (Part IIa). At Week 32, PASI 75 response was evaluated and PASI 75 responders of FAE arm continued to receive commercially available FAE tablets specifically labeled for study (Part IIb) up to Week 56. PASI 75 non-responders of FAE arm switched to 100 mg GUS at Week 32 and received 100 mg GUS SC at Week 36, 44 and Week 52 (Part IIb). For participants who discontinued study, safety follow-up was done at Week 32 (Part I) / Week 64 (Part II) or 12 weeks after last treatment (whatever came first). For all participants who continued study, safety was followed-up at every visit.</description>

          <description>At Week 32, PASI 75 response was evaluated and PASI 75 non-responders of FAE arm were switched to GUS and received GUS 100 mg SC at Weeks 32, 36, 44 and 52. Safety follow-up was done at Week 64 (Part II). Participants who discontinued at any timepoint were followed-up 12 weeks after last treatment dose. Participants who received GUS in Study Part II (participants who switched from FAE to GUS treatment at Week 32), had no psoriatic arthritis at baseline and achieved a PASI 90 response at end of Study Part II (Week 56) entered follow-up extension at Week 64 in Study Part III (GUS withdrawal phase) and were followed-up until loss of response or until Week 100.</description>

          <description>Participants received guselkumab (GUS) 100 milligram (mg) administered as 100 mg per milliliter (mg/mL) solution subcutaneously (SC) at Weeks 0, 4, then every 8 weeks (at Week 12 and 20 - Part I). Participants who completed Part I continued to receive GUS 100 mg at Week 28 and 32 - Part IIa. At Week 32, PASI 75 response was evaluated. PASI 75 responders and non-responders of GUS arm continued to receive GUS 100 mg SC every 8 weeks (Weeks 36, 44 and 52). PASI 75 non-responders of FAE switched to 100 mg GUS SC at Week 32, continued at Week 36, 44 and 52 (Part IIb). Safety follow-up was done at Week 32 (Part I), Week 64 (Part II) and up to 12 weeks after discontinuing drug. Participants who received GUS in Part II (who started GUS at Week 0/ switched from FAE to GUS at Week 32), had no psoriatic arthritis at baseline and achieved PASI 90 response at end of Part II (Week 56), entered follow-up extension at Week 64 in Part III and followed-up until loss of response/ until Week 100.</description>

          <description>Participants received FAE tablets by self-administration at Week 0. Doses were up-titrated and were taken every day with different daily doses depending on optimal individual benefit risk ratio (maximum 6*120 mg/day) as per local prescribing information up to Week 24 (Part I). Participants who completed Part I and consented for Part IIa continued to receive same treatment up to Week 32 (Part IIa). At Week 32, PASI 75 response was evaluated and PASI 75 responders of FAE arm continued to receive commercially available FAE tablets specifically labeled for study (Part IIb) up to Week 56. PASI 75 non-responders of FAE arm switched to 100 mg GUS at Week 32 and received 100 mg GUS SC at Week 36, 44 and Week 52 (Part IIb). For participants who discontinued study, safety follow-up was done at Week 32 (Part I) / Week 64 (Part II) or 12 weeks after last treatment (whatever came first). For all participants who continued study, safety was followed-up at every visit.</description>

        <title>Part I: Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 Response at Week 24</title>
        <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 (indicates no involvement) to 6 (90 percent [%] to 100% involvement), and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (severe). The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 (no visible skin involvement) to 72 (maximal skin involvement of the whole body). A higher score indicates more severe disease. A PASI 90 response represents participants who achieved at least a 90 % improvement from baseline in the PASI score.</description>

        <title>Part I: Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score of Less Than or Equal to (=&lt;) 1 at Week 24</title>
        <description>The DLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on participant's quality of life, can be used to assess 6 different aspects that may affect quality of life 1) symptoms and feelings, 2) daily activities, 3) leisure, 4) work or school performance, 5) personal relationships, and 6) treatment. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life. The DLQI produces a total numeric score that can range from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much): 0-1 = no effect at all on the participant's life; 2-6 = small effect on the participant's life; 7-12 = moderate effect on the participant's life; 13-18 = very large effect on the participant's life; 19-30 = extremely large effect on the participant's life. A higher score indicates a low quality of life due to more severe disease.</description>

          <description>The DLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on participant's quality of life, can be used to assess 6 different aspects that may affect quality of life 1) symptoms and feelings, 2) daily activities, 3) leisure, 4) work or school performance, 5) personal relationships, and 6) treatment. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life. The DLQI produces a total numeric score that can range from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much): 0-1 = no effect at all on the participant's life; 2-6 = small effect on the participant's life; 7-12 = moderate effect on the participant's life; 13-18 = very large effect on the participant's life; 19-30 = extremely large effect on the participant's life. A higher score indicates a low quality of life due to more severe disease.</description>

        <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 (indicates no involvement) to 6 (90 percent [%] to 100% involvement), and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (severe). The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 (no visible skin involvement) to 72 (maximal skin involvement of the whole body). A higher score indicates more severe disease. A PASI 100 response represents participants who achieved a 100% improvement from baseline in the PASI score.</description>

It consisted of 11 items covering symptoms (itch, pain, stinging, burning, and skin tightness) and patient-observable signs (skin dryness, cracking, scaling, shedding or flaking, redness, and bleeding) using 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable) numerical rating scales for severity. Items were averaged on the daily symptom score and sign score when at least 3 items greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 50 percentage of 5 items on these scales are answered. The average value is converted into 0-100 scoring, such that Symptom [or Sign] score=average value*10, where, 0= least severe and 100=most severe and higher score indicates more severe disease.</description>

Percentage of Participants who Achieved an absolute PASI score less than or equal to (=&lt;) 1 were assessed.</description>

        <description>SF-36 V2 is a generic 36-item questionnaire measuring health-related quality of life (HRQL) covering 2 summary measures: physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS). The SF-36 consists of 8 subscales (physical function, role limitations due to physical problems, pain, general health perception, vitality, social function, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health). Participants self-report on items in a subscale that have between 2-6 choices per item using Likert-type responses (e.g. none of the time, some of the time, etc.). Summations of item scores of the same subscale give the subscale scores, which are transformed into a range from 0 to 100; zero= worst HRQL, 100=best HRQL. Higher scores indicate better health status.</description>

        <title>Part IIb: Percentage of Participants With a PASI 75 Response at Week 32 Who Maintained Response at Week 56</title>
        <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 (indicates no involvement) to 6 (90 percent [%] to 100% involvement), and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (severe). The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 (no visible skin involvement) to 72 (maximal skin involvement of the whole body). A higher score indicates more severe disease. A PASI 75 response represents participants who achieved at least a 75 % improvement from baseline in the PASI score.</description>

        <title>Part IIb: Percentage of Participants With DLQI Score of 0 or 1 at Week 32 Who Maintained Response at Week 56</title>
        <description>The DLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on participant's quality of life, can be used to assess 6 different aspects that may affect quality of life 1) symptoms and feelings, 2) daily activities, 3) leisure, 4) work or school performance, 5) personal relationships, and 6) treatment. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life. The DLQI produces a total numeric score that can range from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much): 0-1 = no effect at all on the participant's life; 2-6 = small effect on the participant's life; 7-12 = moderate effect on the participant's life; 13-18 = very large effect on the participant's life; 19-30 = extremely large effect on the participant's life. A higher score indicates a low quality of life due to more severe disease.</description>

          <title>Part IIb: Percentage of Participants With a PASI 90 Response at Week 56</title>
          <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 (indicates no involvement) to 6 (90 percent [%] to 100% involvement), and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (severe). The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 (no visible skin involvement) to 72 (maximal skin involvement of the whole body). A higher score indicates more severe disease. A PASI 90 response represents participants who achieved at least a 90 % improvement from baseline in the PASI score.</description>

        <description>The DLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on participant's quality of life, can be used to assess 6 different aspects that may affect quality of life 1) symptoms and feelings, 2) daily activities, 3) leisure, 4) work or school performance, 5) personal relationships, and 6) treatment. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life. The DLQI produces a total numeric score that can range from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much): 0-1 = no effect at all on the participant's life; 2-6 = small effect on the participant's life; 7-12 = moderate effect on the participant's life; 13-18 = very large effect on the participant's life; 19-30 = extremely large effect on the participant's life.

        <title>Part I/IIa: Percentage of Participants Who Achieved PASI 100 Response at Week 32</title>
        <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 (indicates no involvement) to 6 (90 percent [%] to 100% involvement), and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (severe). The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 (no visible skin involvement) to 72 (maximal skin involvement of the whole body). A higher score indicates more severe disease. A PASI 100 response represents participants who achieved a 100% improvement from baseline in the PASI score. Data reported collectively for Part I and Part IIa (that is from Week 0 to Week 32) per planned analysis for this OM.</description>

        <description>DLQI is 10-item questionnaire that measures impact of skin disease on participant's quality of life, can be used to assess 6 different aspects that may affect quality of life 1) symptoms and feelings, 2) daily activities, 3) leisure, 4) work or school performance, 5) personal relationships, and 6) treatment. Each question was evaluated on 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life. DLQI produces total numeric score ranging from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much): 0-1=no effect at all on participant's life; 2-6 =small effect on participant's life; 7-12 = moderate effect on participant's life; 13-18 =very large effect on participant's life; 19-30 =extremely large effect on participant's life.

          <description>The time to PASI&gt;3 from Week 56 after guselkumab withdrawal at Week 100 was calculated as time from Week 56 to PASI response that is PASI &gt;3. The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 (indicates no involvement) to 6 (90 percent [%] to 100% involvement), and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (severe). The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 (no visible skin involvement) to 72 (maximal skin involvement of the whole body). A higher score indicates more severe disease.</description>

        <title>Part III: Percentage of Participants Who Achieved an Absolute PASI Score &lt;=1, &lt;=2, &lt;=3, &lt;=5 at Week 100</title>
        <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 (indicates no involvement) to 6 (90 percent [%] to 100% involvement), and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (severe). The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 (no visible skin involvement) to 72 (maximal skin involvement of the whole body). A higher score indicates more severe disease.</description>

        <title>Part III: Change From Baseline (Week 56) in Signs and Symptoms Aggregate Scores of the Psoriasis Symptom and Sign Diary (PSSD) Total Score at Week 100</title>
        <description>The PSSD (7-day version) is a patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaire designed and validated to measure the severity of psoriasis symptoms and signs for the assessment of treatment benefit. It consisted of 11 items covering symptoms (itch, pain, stinging, burning, and skin tightness) and patient-observable signs (skin dryness, cracking, scaling, shedding or flaking, redness, and bleeding) using 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable) numerical rating scales for severity. Items were averaged on the daily symptom score and sign score when at least 3 items greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 50 percentage of 5 items on these scales are answered. The average value is converted into 0-100 scoring, such that Symptom [or Sign] score=average value*10, where, 0= least severe and 100=most severe and higher score indicates more severe disease.</description>

        <title>Part III: Change From Baseline (Week 56) in Percent Body Surface Area (%BSA) Psoriatic Involvement at Week 100</title>
        <description>BSA as physical measure to define disease severity is to determine how much of the Body Surface Area (BSA) is affected by psoriasis. Involved BSA is calculated by using the palm of the participant's hand as equivalent to 1% of the BSA (rule of palm). Psoriasis affected BSA under 5% suggests mild psoriasis, a BSA of 5% to 10% is considered moderate, and an involved BSA of over 10% indicates severe psoriasis.</description>

        <description>The DLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on participant's quality of life, can be used to assess 6 different aspects that may affect quality of life 1) symptoms and feelings, 2) daily activities, 3) leisure, 4) work or school performance, 5) personal relationships, and 6) treatment. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life. The DLQI produces a total numeric score that can range from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much): 0-1 = no effect at all on the participant's life; 2-6 = small effect on the participant's life; 7-12 = moderate effect on the participant's life; 13-18 = very large effect on the participant's life; 19-30 = extremely large effect on the participant's life.

        <description>SF-36 V2 is a generic 36-item questionnaire measuring health-related quality of life (HRQL) covering 2 summary measures: physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS). The SF-36 consists of 8 subscales (physical function, role limitations due to physical problems, pain, general health perception, vitality, social function, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health). Participants self-report on items in a subscale that have between 2-6 choices per item using Likert-type responses (e.g. none of the time, some of the time, etc.). Summations of item scores of the same subscale give the subscale scores, which are transformed into a range from 0 to 100; 0 = worst HRQL, 100=best HRQL. Higher scores indicate better health status.</description>

        <title>Part I/IIa: Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) (up to Week 32) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were defined as AEs that occurred during active treatment period through Week 32 after the start of initial study drug administration or AEs that were present at Baseline but worsened in severity after the start of initial study drug administration. Safety reported collectively for Part I and Part IIa (that is from Week 0 to Week 32) per planned analysis.</description>
        <time_frame>Up to Week 32</time_frame>
        <population>Safety analysis set included all participants randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups (GUS or FAE) at Week 0 and received at least 1 dose of study drug as per actual treatment received during study irrespective of treatment assigned at randomization.

          <title>Part IIb: Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) (Week 32 to Week 64) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability</title>
          <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product. TEAEs were defined as those AEs that occurred during the active treatment period from Week 32 to Week 56 or the safety follow-up period from Week 56 through Week 64 or those AEs that were present before Week 32 but worsened in severity after Week 32.</description>
          <population>Study Part IIb analysis set included all participants who entered Study Part IIb and were treated with one of the two treatments (GUS or FAE) at least once during the treatment period from Week 32 to Week 56. Here, n (number of participants analyzed) signifies number of participants analyzed for this OM for specified category.</population>
