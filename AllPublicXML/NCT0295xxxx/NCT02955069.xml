    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, Quality of Life (QoL) Questionnaire. The EORTC QLQ-C30 contains 30 items and is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social functioning), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea and financial impact) and a global health status/QoL scale. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning; a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems</description>

    <description>EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises of 5 dimensions-mobility,self-care,usual activities,pain/discomfort &amp; anxiety/depression.Each dimension has 5 levels:not at all(level 1),mild(level 2),moderate(level 3),severe(level 4),extreme/leading to incapacity(level 5),with highest level corresponding to worst outcome.Subjects have to indicate their health state by choosing the appropriate level from each dimension.The 5 digit health states obtained for each dimension will be converted into a single mean index value using the EQ-5D-5L crosswalk index value calculator as recommended by EuroQol group.In the EQ-VAS,subjects have to record their health state on a scale ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state).A mean of this health state will be recorded.</description>

          -  Patients must have been pretreated for advanced disease - the number of prior systemic
             therapy/regimen depends on which origin for NET and for GEP-NEC

             analysis

          -  Radiological documentation of disease progression:

          -  Well-differentiated NET group: Disease progression while on/or after the last
             treatment, and this progression must have been observed within 6 months prior to start
             of study treatment (i.e. maximum of 24 weeks from documentation of progression until
             study entry). Disease must show evidence of radiological disease progression based on
             scans performed not more than 12 months apart.

          -  Poorly-differentiated GEP-NEC group: Disease progression while on or after prior
             treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Well-differentiated grade 3 neuroendocrine tumors; poorly-differentiated
             neuroendocrine carcinoma of any origin (other than GEP-NEC); including NEC of unknown

          -  PRRT administered within 6 months of the first dose.

          -  Systemic antineoplastic therapy

          -  Tyrosine kinase inhibitors within 14 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, before
             the first dose of study treatment.

          -  Prior PD-1- or PD-L1-directed therapy.

          -  Cryoablation, radiofrequency ablation, or trans-arterial embolization of hepatic
             metastases

          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other monoclonal antibodies which in
             the opinion of the investigator may pose an increased risk of a serious infusion
             reaction.
