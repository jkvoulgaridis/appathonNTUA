  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis:

      Stereotactic ablative body radiation (SAbR) prolongs progression-free survival for patients
      with oligometastatic kidney cancer (RCC) and delays the initiation of systemic therapy.

      Primary Objectives:

      • To evaluate the delay in time to start of systemic therapy (TTST) as a surrogate of
      progression free survival (PFS), defined as the time from the first day of SAbR to start of
      systemic therapy.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To evaluate the modified progression-free survival (mPFS) for patients with
           oligometastatic renal cell carcinoma who are treated with SAbR.

        -  To evaluate the overall survival (OS)

        -  To evaluate the cancer specific survival (CSS)

        -  To evaluate the local control rate of irradiated lesions.

        -  To measure the health-related quality of life (HRQOL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective single institution phase II single-arm open-label trial evaluating
      SAbR in patients with newly diagnosed oligometastatic RCC.

      Problem Statements:

        -  Can local therapy (SAbR) safely delay the start of systemic therapy?

        -  Safely delaying the start of systemic therapy can have significant quality of life
           benefits for patients since systemic therapy has significant side effects.

        -  Can SAbR be curative in truly oligometastatic RCC patients?

      Primary Endpoint:

      • Time to start of systemic therapy (TTST) defined as the time from the first day of SAbR to
      start of systemic therapy.

      Secondary Endpoint:

        -  Modified progression-free survival (mPFS) is defined as the survival interval without
           development of &gt;3 sites of new metastasis, new sites of metastases that are not amenable
           to SAbR treatment, a total of &gt;6 sites of metastasis that required SAbR, local failure
           at SAbR-treated site, or development of brain metastasis.

        -  Overall Survival

        -  Local control

        -  Toxicity

        -  HRQOL

      Sample Size: 23 Patients will be enrolled.

      Statistical Analysis: Time to event will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier approach along
      with the 95% confidence interval.

    <description>Severity or Toxicity will be assessed according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Dose adjustments should be made according to the system showing the greatest degree of toxicity. The consequences of toxicity should all be graded 1-5 according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0 occurring prior to 270 days from the start of protocol treatment. Other treatment related toxicity attributed to the therapy will be captured, recorded and the consequences of should all be graded 1-5 according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). CTCAE V4.0 along with grades 1-5 is provided in the link for reference (https://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06 14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf).</description>
