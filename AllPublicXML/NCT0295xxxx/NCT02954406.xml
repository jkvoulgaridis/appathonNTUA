    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TAK-659 when administered in combination with bendamustine,
      bendamustine + rituximab, gemcitabine, lenalidomide, or ibrutinib.

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-659. TAK-659 is being tested to treat
      people who have advanced non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This study will determine the MTD or RP2D for
      TAK-659 in combination with bendamustine, bendamustine + rituximab, gemcitabine,
      lenalidomide, and ibrutinib. The study will enroll approximately 96 participants.

      Participants will be assigned to one of the 5 combination cohorts:

        -  Dose Escalation Phase Cohort A: TAK-659 + Bendamustine

        -  Dose Escalation Phase Cohort B: TAK-659 + Bendamustine + Rituximab

        -  Dose Escalation Phase Cohort C: TAK-659 + Gemcitabine

        -  Dose Escalation Phase Cohort D: TAK-659 + Lenalidomide

        -  Dose Escalation Phase Cohort E: TAK-659 + Ibrutinib This study comprises 2 phases: a
           dose escalation phase and a safety expansion phase. Participants in all 5 cohorts
           (Cohorts A-E) will participate in the dose escalation phase of the study. Approximately
           12 additional participants with advanced FL or MZL will be added to Cohort B, in the
           safety expansion phase.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in North America and Europe. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 30 months. Participants will make multiple visits
      to the clinic and will be followed up for safety for 28 days after the last dose of study
      drug.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female participants aged 18 years or older.

          2. In the dose escalation phase, histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of
             advanced non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) of any histology (with the exception of
             participants with WaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia [WM] and chronic lymphocytic leukemia
             [CLL]). In the safety expansion phase for Cohort B, only participants with advanced FL
             or MZL will be included.

          3. Radiographically or clinically measurable disease with at least 1 target lesion per
             International Working Group (IWG) criteria for malignant lymphoma.

          4. In the dose escalation phase, participants who are refractory or relapsed after at
             least 1 prior line of therapy due to progression, intolerance, or physician/patient
             decision and for whom no effective standard therapy is available per the
             investigator's assessment. In the safety expansion phase for Cohort B in participants
             with FL or MZL, the prior line of therapy is limited to &lt;=1.

               -  Either treatment naive to, relapsed/refractory to, or experienced treatment
                  failure due to other reasons with ibrutinib, idelalisib, or any other
                  investigational B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway inhibitors not directly targeting
                  spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK).

               -  Pre induction salvage chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT)
                  should be considered 1 therapy.

               -  Any consolidation/maintenance therapy after a chemotherapy regimen (without
                  intervening relapse) should be considered 1 line of therapy with the preceding
                  combination therapy. Maintenance antibody therapy should not be considered a line
                  of therapy.

               -  For aggressive NHL (ie, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL]), single-agent
                  anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy should not be considered a line of therapy.
                  Antibody therapy in patients with indolent NHL (ie, FL) given as a single agent
                  after disease progression from a prior treatment should be considered a line of
                  therapy.

               -  For participants with DLBCL transformed from indolent lymphoma, any treatment
                  received for the indolent disease before the transformation to DLBCL will, in
                  general, not count toward the 2 to 3 prior lines of therapy required for DLBCL in
                  this study.

               -  Prior treatment with a regimen that includes the combination drug will not
                  necessarily exclude a participant from that cohort if the investigator views
                  treatment with that agent as appropriate. However, a participant who has a
                  contraindication for a particular combination agent or who has been discontinued
                  from prior therapy with a particular agent for toxicity will not be eligible for
                  inclusion in that particular cohort.

          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 or 1 and life
             expectancy of greater than 3 months.

          6. Participants must have adequate organ function, including the following:

                  (&gt;=50,000/mcL for participants with bone marrow involvement), and hemoglobin &gt;=8
                  gram per deciliter (g/dL) (red blood cell [RBC] and platelet transfusion allowed
                  &gt;=14 days before assessment).

               -  Hepatic: total bilirubin less than or equal to (&lt;=) 1.5*the upper limit of the
                  normal range (ULN); alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase
                  (AST) &lt;=2.5*ULN.

               -  Renal: serum creatinine &gt;=60 milliliter per minute (mL/min) as estimated by the
                  Cockcroft-Gault equation.

               -  others

                    -  Lipase &lt;=1.5ÃULN and amylase &lt;=1.5ÃULN with no clinical symptoms suggestive

                    -  Fasting serum glucose level shall be controlled to 130 milligrams per
                       deciliter (mg/dL) during the screening period.

          7. Female participants who:

               -  Are postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, or

               -  If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice 1 highly effective
                  method of contraception and 1 additional effective (barrier) method at the same

                  last dose of study drug, or

               -  Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and
                  usual lifestyle of the participant. (Periodic abstinence [example, calendar,
                  ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods] withdrawal, spermicides only,
                  and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female
                  and male condoms should not be used together.)

             Male participant, even if surgically sterilized (that is, status postvasectomy), who:

               -  Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study
                  treatment period and through 180 days after the last dose of study drug, or

          8. Both men and women in the rituximab combination arm (Cohort B) must practice
             contraception as described above from the time of signing of the informed consent form
             (ICF) through 12 months after the last dose of study drug.

                  study drugs. In general, the use of these agents is not permitted during the
                  study for this combination except in cases in which an AE must be managed. See a
                  list of nonexhaustive moderate CYP3A mechanism-based inhibitors or moderate CYP3A
