  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The increasing prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia causes new
      challenges to ensure that healthcare decisions are informed by research evidence and reflect
      what is important for seniors and their caregivers. Primary care providers point to a need
      for more training on communication with families of seniors living with dementia, and on the
      non-pharmacological health options that are often recommended before use of
      medications.Therefore, the investigators will design and evaluate an intervention to train
      primary healthcare providers on how to empower seniors with dementia and their caregivers in
      making health-related decisions based on research evidence and on their preferences and
      priorities. A distance professional training program on shared decision making will initially
      be designed, comprising evidence summaries to be shared with patients living with dementia
      and their caregivers who face difficult decisions. Patients with dementia, their caregivers
      and healthcare providers, will then provide feedback on the training program, which will then
      be improved following their suggestions. In a last step, the investigators will study the
      processes required to implement this training program and measure its effects on provider
      knowledge and intention to adopt shared decision making.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: The increasing prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia
      causes new challenges in primary care. Indeed, primary care providers point to a need for
      more training to care for this population, especially seniors presenting behavioural and
      psychological symptoms of dementia. They also find the inter-professional nature of care, and
      the need to communicate with community services and families, very challenging. Moreover,
      patients living with dementia and their caregivers consistently report their need for more
      information about dementia. Therefore, in a recent survey, the investigators sought five
      difficult decisions that patients living with dementia and their informal caregivers often
      face in primary care settings. In the current study, they propose to tailor and evaluate an
      e-learning professional training program on shared decision making, comprising evidence
      summaries on the health options to consider before making these five difficult decisions.
      This tailored training program is expected to improve shared decision making between
      clinicians and patients with dementia and their caregivers, and in turn improve patient and
      caregiver empowerment in relation to their own health care.

      Methods: In two phases, the aims of this study are to (1) design and tailor the intervention,
      and (2) implement and evaluate it. In the first phase, theory and user-centred design will be
      used to tailor a multifaceted intervention comprising a distance professional training
      program on shared decision making, and five shared decision-making tools dealing with
      difficult decisions often faced by seniors with dementia and their caregivers. Each tool will
      be designed in two versions, one for clinicians, and one for patients/caregivers. Forty-nine
      clinicians and 27 patients/caregivers will be invited to participate to three cycles of
      design-evaluation-feedback of each intervention components. Besides think-aloud and interview
      approaches, they will also complete questionnaires to identify the factors most likely to
      influence their adoption of shared decision making after exposure to the intervention.
      Thereafter, the intervention will be modified by adding/enhancing behaviour-change techniques
      targeting these factors. In the second phase, the effectiveness of this tailored intervention
      will be evaluated before/after implementation, in a two-armed, clustered randomized trial
      with a three-month follow-up. A convenience sample of primary care clinics and home care
      services will be enrolled in the province of Quebec (Canada), and health care providers who
      practice there will be recruited (mostly family physicians, nurses, and social workers). We
      will record participants' access to training component, and conduct telephone interviews with
      a purposeful sample of participants, half of whom completed training and the other half whom
      did not. The participants will also complete a survey before and after training, to assess
      their knowledge, and intention to adopt shared decision making. Three researchers will
      conduct a thematic qualitative analysis of the interviews, as per the theory of planned
      behaviour. We performed bivariate analyses with the survey data.

      Discussion: The results of this study will allow modifying the training program to improve
      participation rates and, ultimately, uptake of meaningful sjared decision making with
      patients living with dementia.

    <description>This outcome comprises: knowledge about shared decision making, knowledge about risk communication, perceived awareness of the options. It also comprises variables to assess clinical knowledge on deprescribing anti-psychotics, on the impacts of stopping driving, on the strategies to communicate about stopping driving, on the risk factors for caregiver burden, on the awareness of the information to provide patients to reflect upon the power of attorney, on the elements to check prior to recommending a treatment to a vulnerable senior.
Two questions were inspired by the Ottawa Decision Support Framework to assess participants' knowledge about SDM (https://decisionaid.ohri.ca/docs/develop/ODSF.pdf); and 10 questions included case-based scenarios,to assess clinical knowledge relative to the care of older adults living with NCD, and reflected the basic principles to develop constructed-response items [28].</description>
