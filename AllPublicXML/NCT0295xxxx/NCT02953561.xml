  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial studies the best dose and side effects of avelumab when given together
      with azacitidine and to see how well they work in treating patients with acute myeloid
      leukemia that is not responding to treatment or has come back. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      avelumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Azacitidine may
      stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Giving avelumab and azacitidine may work better in treating patients with acute myeloid
      leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of avelumab
      in combination with azacitidine (5-azacytidine) in patients with refractory/relapsed acute
      myeloid leukemia (AML). (Phase IB)

      II. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) defined as complete remission (CR)/complete
      remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp)/complete remission with incomplete count
      recovery (CRi)/partial remission (PR)/hematologic improvement (HI)/morphologic leukemia free
      state (MLFS) of avelumab in combination with 5-azacytidine in patients with
      refractory/relapsed AML. (Phase II

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the number of patients achieve &gt; 50% reduction in blasts on therapy with this
      combination.

      II. To determine the duration of response, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival
      (OS) of patients with refractory/relapsed AML treated with this combination

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study immunological and molecular features at baseline and at predefined time-points
      on-therapy with avelumab and azacytidine in the peripheral blood and bone marrow to include
      quantify immune ligand expression by the AML blasts and AML stromal components
      (myeloid-derived suppressor cells [MDSCs] and mesenchymal stem cells [MSCs]) including
      4-1BBL, ICOSL, PD-L1, PD-L2, OX-40L, CD137L.

      II. To study immunological and molecular features at baseline and at predefined time-points
      on-therapy with avelumab and azacytidine in the peripheral blood and bone marrow to determine
      the quantitative expression of positive and negative co-stimulatory molecules on individual
      T-lymphocyte subsets including 4-1BB, CTLA-4, ICOS, PD-1, OX40, LAG-3 and TIM-3.

      III. To study immunological and molecular features at baseline and at predefined time-points
      on-therapy with avelumab and azacytidine in the peripheral blood and bone marrow to identify
      the immunophenotype of tumor-infiltrating T-lymphocytes (TILs) pre- and post-therapy with the
      combination: CD8+, CD4+ effector, or CD4+ regulatory.

      IV. To develop a micro-array based gene expression profile (GEP) predictor of response to
      anti-PDL1 and epigenetic therapy in AML.

      V. To determine the correlation of responses to the combination with baseline cytogenetic and
      molecular abnormalities

      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study of avelumab followed by a phase II study

      Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) over 10-40 minutes on
      days 1-7 or on days 1-5 and 8-9. Patients also receive avelumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1
      and 14 for 4 courses (or until complete response) and on day 1 for subsequent courses.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for up to 5
      years.
