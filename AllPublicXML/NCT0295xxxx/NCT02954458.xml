    <textblock>
      This study will follow participants who completed the TED-C14-006 study. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of teduglutide in pediatric
      participants with Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS). This study will also offer teduglutide
      treatment to eligible participants, regardless of treatment received in TED-C14-006 or
      SHP633-301.
