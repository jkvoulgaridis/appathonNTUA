  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims of this study are to compare patient experience with and without a
      proparacaine drop after povidone iodine.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To ensure the extra drop does not interfere with antisepsis, conjunctival cultures will be
      obtained from patients undergoing intravitreal injection before and after the application of
      the extra eye drop. Patients will be randomized to undergo additional topical analgesia
      during intravitreal injection vs. the standard amount of topical analgesia. Cultures of the
      eyelid/conjunctiva will be taken to ensure that the additional topical analgesia does not
      interfere with antisepsis.

    <measure>Number of Study Participants With Positive Conjunctival Culture</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-injection</time_frame>
    <description>Conjunctival samples were collected after participants received either an additional drop of proparacaine or povidone iodine. Bacterial cultures were performed from conjunctival samples by the Mayo Clinic Microbiology laboratory. Bacterial species identification was performed on any and all bacteria that grew.</description>

    <measure>Pain at the Time of Injection</measure>
    <time_frame>post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were asked to complete a survey about their experience with intravitreal injections after the procedure was completed. The survey was scored on a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale (NRS) where 0 was a positive response and 10 was a negative response. The lower the score, the lesser the perceived pain, the higher the score, the higher the perceived pain.</description>

    <description>Subjects were asked to complete a survey about their experience with intravitreal injections after the procedure was completed. The survey consisted of 6 questions and was scored on a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale (NRS) where 0 was a positive response and 10 was a negative response. The lower the score, the more positive impression of the preparation process, the higher the score, the less positive impression of the preparation process..</description>

    <time_frame>post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were asked to complete a survey about their experience with intravitreal injections after the procedure was completed. The survey was scored on a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale (NRS) where 0 was a positive response and 10 was a negative response.

    <measure>Expectation Intravitreal Injection Will Have Negative Consequences on Subject Health</measure>
    <time_frame>post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were asked to complete a survey about their experience with intravitreal injections after the procedure was completed. The survey was scored on a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale (NRS) where 0 was a positive response and 10 was a negative response. A lower score indicated subjects did not expect the injection would negatively affect their overall health. Higher scores indicated subjects expected the injection would negatively affect their overall health.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Expectation the Injection Will Contribute to Curing/Improving Eye Condition</measure>
    <time_frame>post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were asked to rate their expectation on the extent to which the intravitreal injections would contribute to curing or improving their eye condition. The question was scored on a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale (NRS) where 0 was a negative response (not at all) and 10 was a positive response (to a large extent). A low score indicated the subject did not expect the injection would contribute to curing or improving the eye condition while a high score indicated the subject did expect the injection will help to cure or improve the eye condition.</description>

        <title>Impression of Pre-injection Preparations</title>
        <description>Subjects were asked to complete a survey about their experience with intravitreal injections after the procedure was completed. The survey consisted of 6 questions and was scored on a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale (NRS) where 0 was a positive response and 10 was a negative response. The lower the score, the more positive impression of the preparation process, the higher the score, the less positive impression of the preparation process..</description>
