    <measure>Number of Participants With Improvement, No Change, or Worsening in Performance in the Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months with the emPOWER ankle</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of patients with a clinically meaningful change (improvement, no change, worsening) in abulatory activities measured by the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale. Improvement in the ABC was defined as a minimum detectable change of 13% increase in score.
The ABC Scale is a self-administered questionnaire that asks the patient to rate his or her confidence in performing various ambulatory activities on a scale from 0% (no confidence) to 100% (complete confidence) without losing balance or becoming unsteady. Scores for each of the 16 items will be collected and an average percentage calculated, with scores &lt;67 indicating an increased risk of falling.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Improvement, No Change, or Worsening in Performance in the Falls Efficacy Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months with the emPOWER ankle</time_frame>
    <description>The Falls Efficacy Scale is a validated 10-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess confidence in the ability to perform 10 activities of daily living without falling as an indicator of how one's fear of falling impacts physical performance. Each item is rated from 1 (&quot;very confident&quot;) to 10 (&quot;not confident at all&quot;), and the per item ratings are added to generate a summary total score (10 to 100). Lower scores indicate more confidence and higher scores indicate lack of confidence and greater fear of falling. It has been validated for use in the elderly and persons with amputations. Scores â‰¥70 indicate an increased fear of falling. Improvement in the Falls Efficiacy Scale was defined as a minimum increase of 2 in the score.</description>

    <time_frame>3 months with the emPOWER ankle</time_frame>
    <description>The AMP is an instrument designed to measure ambulatory potential of lower-limb amputees. Subjects begin the test seated in a hard chair with arms and are tested for a total of 21 items assessing abilities of increasing level of difficulty. Abilities assessed include sitting balance, transfer from chair to chair, standing balance, gait quality, negotiating obstacles, and the use of assistive devices. The total score range for the AMP is 0 to 47 points. A minimal detectable change of 4 points was the definition of improvement.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Improvement, No Change, or Worsening in Performance in the Prosthetic Limb Users Survey of Mobility PLUS-M (12 Item Short Form)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months with the emPOWER ankle</time_frame>
    <description>The PLUS-M is a valid and reliable self-reported measure for the mobility of adults with lower limb amputations. PLUS-M asks about the patient's ability to perform simple and complex tasks. High PLUS-M scores correspond with greater mobility. Improvement in the Mobility PLUS-M (12 item Short Form) was defined by a minimum detectable change of an increase of 5 points in the total score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Improvement, No Change, or Worsening in Performance in the Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months with the emPOWER ankle</time_frame>
    <description>The PSFS is a self-report, goal-attainment measure aimed at identifying functional status limitations that are most relevant to individual patients. The PSFS is a reliable, valid, and efficient measure for detecting clinical change in persons with low back pain and knee dysfunction. Subjects were asked to identify three to five activities that they are having difficulty or are unable to perform because of their injury/condition. For the specified activities, patients were asked to rate their ability to perform each activity at that time (0-10 numerical scale) with '0' being unable to perform the activity, and '10' being able to perform the activity at the same level as they could prior to the injury/condition. The total score was calculated as the sum of the activity scores divided by the number of activities. Changes of &gt;2 in the total score compared to baseline were considered &quot;Improved.&quot;</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Improvement, No Change, or Worsening in Performance in the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months with the emPOWER ankle</time_frame>
    <description>The NPRS is a valid and reliable measure of pain that may be used across all musculoskeletal injuries/conditions and complements the PSFS. The patient was asked to rate the pain of their joints, foot, lower back, and if they are using an assistive device any additional affected limbs on average over the last 24 hours on a scale 1-10, with '1' being 'very mild' and '10' being the 'unimaginable unspeakable'. The scores on the NPRS instruments with the emPOWER Ankle were compared to the scores on the subject's passive prosthesis. An improvement was considered a positive change of 1 for at least one area without a corresponding decrease in another.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Improvement, No Change, or Worsening in Performance in Activity (Monitoring Using a Fitbit Over 2-week Periods)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months with the emPOWER ankle</time_frame>
    <description>A Fitbit activity monitor was worn to record the number of steps the Subject took with the prosthesis. The patient returned to the site with the activity monitor and the steps counted were downloaded from the device. In addition, the Subjects were sent home with a prepaid envelope and instructed to mail back the activity monitor if the next visit was more than 3 weeks later, to ensure that the data was not lost. The step counts were downloaded from the device the day the activity monitor was returned to the Investigator. The Investigator recorded the date the patient was affixed with the activity monitor, the date they received the returned activity monitor, and the date they synced the monitor. An improvement was defined as an increase in the average daily step count of 750 steps.</description>

        <description>The Falls Efficacy Scale is a validated 10-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess confidence in the ability to perform 10 activities of daily living without falling as an indicator of how one's fear of falling impacts physical performance. Each item is rated from 1 (&quot;very confident&quot;) to 10 (&quot;not confident at all&quot;), and the per item ratings are added to generate a summary total score (10 to 100). Lower scores indicate more confidence and higher scores indicate lack of confidence and greater fear of falling. It has been validated for use in the elderly and persons with amputations. Scores â‰¥70 indicate an increased fear of falling. Improvement in the Falls Efficiacy Scale was defined as a minimum increase of 2 in the score.</description>

        <description>The AMP is an instrument designed to measure ambulatory potential of lower-limb amputees. Subjects begin the test seated in a hard chair with arms and are tested for a total of 21 items assessing abilities of increasing level of difficulty. Abilities assessed include sitting balance, transfer from chair to chair, standing balance, gait quality, negotiating obstacles, and the use of assistive devices. The total score range for the AMP is 0 to 47 points. A minimal detectable change of 4 points was the definition of improvement.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Improvement, No Change, or Worsening in Performance in the Amputee Mobility Predictor (AMP) Assessment</title>
          <description>The AMP is an instrument designed to measure ambulatory potential of lower-limb amputees. Subjects begin the test seated in a hard chair with arms and are tested for a total of 21 items assessing abilities of increasing level of difficulty. Abilities assessed include sitting balance, transfer from chair to chair, standing balance, gait quality, negotiating obstacles, and the use of assistive devices. The total score range for the AMP is 0 to 47 points. A minimal detectable change of 4 points was the definition of improvement.</description>
          <population>The results from four subjects were available for analysis for the secondary effectiveness endpoint for improvement in AMP with the Empower at 3 months compared to the AMP with the subject's passive prosthesis as measured by the AMP Assessment.</population>

        <description>The PSFS is a self-report, goal-attainment measure aimed at identifying functional status limitations that are most relevant to individual patients. The PSFS is a reliable, valid, and efficient measure for detecting clinical change in persons with low back pain and knee dysfunction. Subjects were asked to identify three to five activities that they are having difficulty or are unable to perform because of their injury/condition. For the specified activities, patients were asked to rate their ability to perform each activity at that time (0-10 numerical scale) with '0' being unable to perform the activity, and '10' being able to perform the activity at the same level as they could prior to the injury/condition. The total score was calculated as the sum of the activity scores divided by the number of activities. Changes of &gt;2 in the total score compared to baseline were considered &quot;Improved.&quot;</description>
