  <brief_summary>

      Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA),
      total antioxidant status (TAS), 8-hydroxy-2´- deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in blood serum and
      saliva samples in female patients with chronic periodontitis (CP) and to compared healthy
      individuals.

      Materials and Methods: A total of 88 women were into four groups each which were consisted of
      twenty-two subjects. Groups were designed as periodontally and systemically healthy women
      (PCOS-CP-); periodontally healthy women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (PCOS+CP-),
      systemically healthy women with CP (PCOS-,CP+) and women with PCOS and CP (PCOS+CP+). Serum
      and salivary samples were obtained, clinical periodontal parameters were recorded. MDA, TAS,
      8-OHdG levels were measured as biochemically.

      RESULTS:

      Salivary 8-OHdG levels in the PCOSCP and CP groups were statistically higher than those in
      both the PCOSPH and the PH groups (P &lt; 0.05). There was no statistical difference between the
      PCOSCP, CP, and PCOSPH groups with regard to salivary MDA and TAS levels (P &gt; 0.05). Highest
      serum 8-OHdG and MDA levels and lowest serum TAS levels were seen in the PCOSCP group (P &lt;
      0.05). Serum 8-OHdG and MDA levels in the PCOSPH group were higher than those in both
      systemically healthy groups (PH and CP) (P &lt; 0.05). Salivary TAS levels were highest (P &lt;
      0.05) in the PH group. There was no statistical difference between the CP and PCOSPH groups,
      but serum TAS levels were lower than those in the PH group (P &lt; 0.05).

      CONCLUSIONS:

      CP, which led to an increase in serum and salivary 8-OHdG and MDA levels and a decrease in
      serum TAS levels in patients with PCOS, contributed to increased OS. This effect was more
      prominent in serum levels than in salivary levels.
