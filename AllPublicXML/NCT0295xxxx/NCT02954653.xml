    <textblock>
      Two part, dose escalation and dose expansion study. Open label, multi center, non randomized,
      multiple dose, safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of single agent PF-06747143
      in sequential dose levels of adult patients with refractory or relapsed AML in order to
      establish maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) or maximally
      permitted dose (MPD) following by a 3 arm dose expansion with PF-06747143 in combination with
      standard of care chemotherapy in adult patients with AML.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive intravenous (IV) PF-06747143 as a weekly infusion (QW) in 28 day cycles
      at escalating doses. The proposed dosing scheme includes 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg.
      Patients will be monitored for dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the dose escalation in order
      to define the MTD. Two of the three arms in the dose expansion will include PF-06747143 in
      combination with standard of care chemotherapy and will include a safety lead in. The third
      arm, pending clinical data, will be PF-06747143 as a single agent.

        <description>Objective Response was defined as morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS), complete remission (CR), cytogenetic CR (CRc), molecular CR (CRm), partial remission (PR), or CR or PR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi or PRi).
MLFS: Bone marrow (BM) blasts &lt;5%; absence of blasts with Auer rods and extramedullary disease (EMD).
CR: MLFS criteria; absolute neutrophil count (ANC)&gt;1000/ul and platelet &gt;100,000/ul; independence from red cell transfusions.
CRc: Reversion to a normal karyotype at the time of CR in cases with an abnormal karyotype at the time of diagnosis; based on the evaluation of 20 metaphase cells from BM.
CRm: Reversion to a molecular-negative phenotype at the time of CR. CRi: All CR criteria except for ANC &lt;1000/ul or platelet &lt;100,000/ul. PR: ANC &gt;1000/ul and platelet &gt;100,000/ul; BM blasts decreased to 5-25% and ≥50% decrease from pre-treatment levels.
PRi: ANC &lt;1000/ul or platelet &lt;100,000/ul; BM blasts decreased to 5-25% and ≥50% decrease from pre-treatment levels.</description>

PF-06747143 was planned to be administered as an intravenous infusion once weekly at 10 mg/kg in 28-day cycles in combination with standard intensive 7+3 chemotherapy with cytarabine (100-200 mg/m2 continuous infusion for 7 days) and daunorubicin (60-90 mg/m2 daily for 3 days) in Part 2.</description>

          <title>Objective Response Rate (ORR) - Percentage of Participants With Objective Response [Part 2]</title>
          <description>Objective Response was defined as morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS), complete remission (CR), cytogenetic CR (CRc), molecular CR (CRm), partial remission (PR), or CR or PR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi or PRi).
MLFS: Bone marrow (BM) blasts &lt;5%; absence of blasts with Auer rods and extramedullary disease (EMD).
CR: MLFS criteria; absolute neutrophil count (ANC)&gt;1000/ul and platelet &gt;100,000/ul; independence from red cell transfusions.
CRc: Reversion to a normal karyotype at the time of CR in cases with an abnormal karyotype at the time of diagnosis; based on the evaluation of 20 metaphase cells from BM.
CRm: Reversion to a molecular-negative phenotype at the time of CR. CRi: All CR criteria except for ANC &lt;1000/ul or platelet &lt;100,000/ul. PR: ANC &gt;1000/ul and platelet &gt;100,000/ul; BM blasts decreased to 5-25% and ≥50% decrease from pre-treatment levels.
PRi: ANC &lt;1000/ul or platelet &lt;100,000/ul; BM blasts decreased to 5-25% and ≥50% decrease from pre-treatment levels.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a product or medical device without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly/birth defect. Treatment-emergent AEs were those with initial onset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study treatment. AEs included non-serious AEs and SAEs. Causality to study treatment was determined by the investigator.</description>

        <title>Objective Response Rate (ORR) - Percentage of Participants With Objective Response [Part 1]</title>
        <description>Objective Response was defined as morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS), complete remission (CR), cytogenetic CR (CRc), molecular CR (CRm), partial remission (PR), or CR or PR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi or PRi).
MLFS: Bone marrow (BM) blasts &lt;5%; absence of blasts with Auer rods and extramedullary disease (EMD).
CR: MLFS criteria; absolute neutrophil count (ANC)&gt;1000/ul and platelet &gt;100,000/ul; independence from red cell transfusions.
CRc: Reversion to a normal karyotype at the time of CR in cases with an abnormal karyotype at the time of diagnosis; based on the evaluation of 20 metaphase cells from BM.
CRm: Reversion to a molecular-negative phenotype at the time of CR. CRi: All CR criteria except for ANC &lt;1000/ul or platelet &lt;100,000/ul. PR: ANC &gt;1000/ul and platelet &gt;100,000/ul; BM blasts decreased to 5-25% and ≥50% decrease from pre-treatment levels.
PRi: ANC &lt;1000/ul or platelet &lt;100,000/ul; BM blasts decreased to 5-25% and ≥50% decrease from pre-treatment levels.</description>

          <title>Objective Response Rate (ORR) - Percentage of Participants With Objective Response [Part 1]</title>
          <description>Objective Response was defined as morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS), complete remission (CR), cytogenetic CR (CRc), molecular CR (CRm), partial remission (PR), or CR or PR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi or PRi).
MLFS: Bone marrow (BM) blasts &lt;5%; absence of blasts with Auer rods and extramedullary disease (EMD).
CR: MLFS criteria; absolute neutrophil count (ANC)&gt;1000/ul and platelet &gt;100,000/ul; independence from red cell transfusions.
CRc: Reversion to a normal karyotype at the time of CR in cases with an abnormal karyotype at the time of diagnosis; based on the evaluation of 20 metaphase cells from BM.
CRm: Reversion to a molecular-negative phenotype at the time of CR. CRi: All CR criteria except for ANC &lt;1000/ul or platelet &lt;100,000/ul. PR: ANC &gt;1000/ul and platelet &gt;100,000/ul; BM blasts decreased to 5-25% and ≥50% decrease from pre-treatment levels.
PRi: ANC &lt;1000/ul or platelet &lt;100,000/ul; BM blasts decreased to 5-25% and ≥50% decrease from pre-treatment levels.</description>

        <description>Duration of ORR is the time from first documentation of MLFS, CR, CRc, CRm, PR, CRi or PRi to date of first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause.
MLFS: BM blasts &lt;5%; absence of blasts with Auer rods and EMD. CR: MLFS criteria; ANC&gt;1000/ul and platelet &gt;100,000/ul; independence from red cell transfusions.
CRc: Reversion to a normal karyotype at the time of CR in cases with an abnormal karyotype at the time of diagnosis; based on the evaluation of 20 metaphase cells from BM.

PRi: ANC &lt;1000/ul or platelet &lt;100,000/ul; BM blasts decreased to 5-25% and ≥50% decrease from pre-treatment levels.

        <description>Duration of ORR is the time from first documentation of MLFS, CR, CRc, CRm, PR, CRi or PRi to date of first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause.
MLFS: BM blasts &lt;5%; absence of blasts with Auer rods and EMD. CR: MLFS criteria; ANC&gt;1000/ul and platelet &gt;100,000/ul; independence from red cell transfusions.
CRc: Reversion to a normal karyotype at the time of CR in cases with an abnormal karyotype at the time of diagnosis; based on the evaluation of 20 metaphase cells from BM.
CRm: Reversion to a molecular-negative phenotype at the time of CR. CRi: All CR criteria except for ANC &lt;1000/ul or platelet &lt;100,000/ul. PR: ANC &gt;1000/ul and platelet &gt;100,000/ul; BM blasts decreased to 5-25% and ≥50% decrease from pre-treatment levels.
PRi: ANC &lt;1000/ul or platelet &lt;100,000/ul; BM blasts decreased to 5-25% and ≥50% decrease from pre-treatment levels.
Disease progression/relapse: BM blast ≥5%; or reappearance of blast in the blood; or development of EMD.</description>
