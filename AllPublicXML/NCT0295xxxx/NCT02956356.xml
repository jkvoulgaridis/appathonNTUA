  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SATIOSTAT is a composition comprising a specific dietary fibre component (a mixture of
      hydrocolloids with excellent safety profiles and a long history of use in humans) and a lipid
      component (long-chain fatty acids). The goal of this combination is to achieve long-acting
      delivery of long-chain fatty acids to the intestinal lining, triggering the sustained release
      of satiety-signals from intestinal cells, and consequently reducing appetite and lowering
      food intake in humans.

      Effects of acute ingestion of SATIOSTAT vs. a control will be examined. On a first and second
      study day, volunteers receive a preload of either SATIOSTAT or a control and then an oral
      glucose load of 75g enriched with C13 sodium acetate. Gastric emptying will be measured by
      means of a breath test, and insulin, glucose and satiation hormones will be assessed. On the
      third and fourth study day, volunteers receive a preload of either SATIOSTAT or a control and
      are then presented a test meal. Total calorie intake is measured as well as subjective
      feelings of satiation. In addition satiation hormones are measured.
