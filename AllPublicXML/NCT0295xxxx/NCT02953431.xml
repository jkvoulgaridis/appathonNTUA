  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an early phase clinical trial to test the efficacy of elevating lung volume with
      positive expiratory pressure (CPAP) as a controller therapy for asthma in patients with a BMI
      ≥ 30 kg/m2.

      There will be two phases to this trial.

      Phase I:

      In the first phase we will determine the optimal duration of CPAP that is effective as a
      controller therapy in asthma. Up to 9 participants will complete this this phase.

      Phase II:

      The 2nd phase will be a randomized double-blinded controlled trial of Sham CPAP versus CPAP
      10 (using the duration of CPAP determined in phase I) as a controller therapy for asthma, and
      also to determine the effect o airway reactivity in healthy people with a BMI 30 kg/m2 and
      above. Twenty people with asthma and twenty controls will complete this phase.

  <detailed_description>

      The effect of 10 versus 0 cmH2O CPAP on airways responsiveness to inhaled methacholine will
      be studied using an adaptive &quot;3+3&quot; phase I/II study design.

      Dose Titration Phase (phase I):

      The efficacy of 8 hours of CPAP on airway responsiveness will be tested in three subjects.

      Efficacy will be defined as a 25% improvement in the impedance response to methacholine in
      all three subjects. If this occurs in all subjects, shorter durations of CPAP will be studied
      (4 hours then one hour).

      Conversely, if &quot;dose escalation&quot; is required, 3 nights, then 7 nights of CPAP will be
      studied.

      Randomized-controlled study phase (phase II):

      Participants will be randomized to CPAP 10 or Sham 0. The duration of CPAP will be determined
      in the dose titration phase. The effect on response to inhaled methacholine, lung function
      and asthma control will be determined in patients with asthma and a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, and also
      in healthy controls without asthma
