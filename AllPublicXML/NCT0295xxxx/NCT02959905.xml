      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of TSA-CTL in the treatment of
      the advanced melanoma.

      The secondary purpose of this study is to evaluate preliminarily the effect of TSA-CTL in the

      This study is a Phase 1 clinical trial comprised of two parts. In part one, 9 subjects are
      assigned to group A,B,C. Dose escalation is used in In group A with no non-myeloablative
      chemotherapy, group B and group C will undergo a non-myeloablative chemotherapy before the
      cell infusion. Whether the part 2 of the trial continue is determined by the result of part
      1. If continues, 15 subjects will be enrolled into the trial and receive a regimen of immune
      cell infusion combined with non-myeloablative chemotherapy.

             this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune
             competence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible
             to its toxicities).

          4. The medical history of autoimmune disease.

          5. Active systemic infections, coagulation disorders or other active major medical
