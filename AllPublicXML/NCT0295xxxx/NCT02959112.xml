  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicentre randomised controlled trial included patients aged &gt;18 years with an
      indication for ERCP and naive major papilla. All patients received 100 mg of rectal
      indomethacin and 10 ml of either sterile water or a 1:10,000 epinephrine dilution. Patients
      were asked about PEP symptoms via telephone 24 hours and 7 days after the procedure.

    <textblock>
      This multicentre randomised placebo-controlled trial was conducted in two hospitals in
      Mexico: the National Institute of Medical Sciences and Nutrition &quot;Salvador Zubirán&quot; (INCMNSZ)
      in Mexico City, and Bernardette Hospital in Jalisco. The study was approved by both
      institutional review boards. All patients provided written informed consent.

      All patients were given a dose of rectal indomethacin (100 mg) at the beginning of the ERCP.
      Depending on the experimental group, either 10 ml of sterile water or 10 ml of a 1:10,000
      epinephrine dilution (0.1 mg/ml) was sprayed on the ampulla through a biliary balloon or a
      sphincterotome, avoiding any direct contact with the papilla during irrigation at the end of
      the procedure.

      After the procedure, patients were monitored in the recovery room for 2 hours and then
      discharged. Symptoms of acute pancreatitis or any other complication were interrogated at
      baseline while in the recovery room, and then by telephone 24 hours and 7 days after the
      procedure. Serum levels of pancreatic enzymes were determined only if the patient developed
      abdominal pain after ERCP.

  <why_stopped>
    Because previous studies had found no difference, and one recent study even reported a higher
    incidence of PEP in treatment arm
