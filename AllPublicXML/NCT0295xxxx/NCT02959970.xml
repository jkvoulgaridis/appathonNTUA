    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1) until Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as &quot;any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial participant (regardless of the administration of the study drug and its causal relationship to it). An AE could therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended medical occurrence during the participant's participation in the trial, including deterioration of a pre-existing medical condition, an abnormal clinically significant finding in a laboratory assessment, or an abnormal clinically significant finding in the physical examination or vital sign.</description>

    <measure>Local Dermal Tolerability: Number of Participants With Dryness, Scaling and Erythema as Assessed by Investigator</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Local dermal tolerability was evaluated by investigator in terms of presence and absence of dryness, scaling and erythema symptoms and its severity in the areas of body where medication was applied. These symptoms were assessed by using a 4 - point scale of 0 - 3, where 0 = none (no dryness, scaling and erythema) and 3 = severe (marked roughness, heavy scale production and intense redness). The higher score indicated severe symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Local dermal tolerability was evaluated by participants in terms of presence and absence of prickling pain sensation immediately after (within 5 minutes of dosing) and its severity in the areas of body where medication was applied (face). Stinging/burning symptoms were graded on a 4-point scale of 0 - 3 where 0 = none (no stinging/burning), 1 = mild (slight warm, tingling/stinging sensation; not really bothersome), 2 = moderate (definite warm, tingling/stinging sensation that is somewhat bothersome), 3 = severe (hot, tingling/stinging sensation that has caused definite discomfort).

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Inflammatory lesion counts were the sum of counts of the following lesion types (face only): Papule - a small, red, solid elevation less than (&lt;) 1.0 centimeter (cm) in diameter; Pustule - a small, circumscribed elevation of the skin that contains yellow-white exudate; Nodule - a circumscribed, elevated, solid lesion generally more than 1.0 cm in diameter with palpable depth; Cyst - a smooth, dome-shaped, elevated, freely moveable, skin-colored, round to ovoid lesion greater than 0.7 cm in diameter. Change from baseline was calculated by subtracting post-dose value from baseline value.</description>

        <title>Local Dermal Tolerability: Number of Participants With Dryness, Scaling and Erythema as Assessed by Investigator</title>
        <description>Local dermal tolerability was evaluated by investigator in terms of presence and absence of dryness, scaling and erythema symptoms and its severity in the areas of body where medication was applied. These symptoms were assessed by using a 4 - point scale of 0 - 3, where 0 = none (no dryness, scaling and erythema) and 3 = severe (marked roughness, heavy scale production and intense redness). The higher score indicated severe symptoms.</description>

        <title>Local Dermal Tolerability: Number of Participants With Stinging/Burning Symptoms as Assessed by Participants</title>
        <description>Local dermal tolerability was evaluated by participants in terms of presence and absence of prickling pain sensation immediately after (within 5 minutes of dosing) and its severity in the areas of body where medication was applied (face). Stinging/burning symptoms were graded on a 4-point scale of 0 - 3 where 0 = none (no stinging/burning), 1 = mild (slight warm, tingling/stinging sensation; not really bothersome), 2 = moderate (definite warm, tingling/stinging sensation that is somewhat bothersome), 3 = severe (hot, tingling/stinging sensation that has caused definite discomfort). The higher score indicated severe symptoms.</description>

        <title>Absolute Change From Baseline in Inflammatory Lesion Counts</title>
        <description>Inflammatory lesion counts were the sum of counts of the following lesion types (face only): Papule - a small, red, solid elevation less than (&lt;) 1.0 centimeter (cm) in diameter; Pustule - a small, circumscribed elevation of the skin that contains yellow-white exudate; Nodule - a circumscribed, elevated, solid lesion generally more than 1.0 cm in diameter with palpable depth; Cyst - a smooth, dome-shaped, elevated, freely moveable, skin-colored, round to ovoid lesion greater than 0.7 cm in diameter. Change from baseline was calculated by subtracting post-dose value from baseline value.</description>
