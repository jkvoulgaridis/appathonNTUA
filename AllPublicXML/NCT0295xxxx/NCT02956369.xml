  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SATIOSTAT is a composition comprising a specific dietary fibre component (a mixture of
      hydrocolloids with excellent safety profiles and a long history of use in humans) and a lipid
      component (long-chain fatty acids). The goal of this combination is to achieve long-acting
      delivery of long-chain fatty acids to the intestinal lining, triggering the sustained release
      of satiety-signals from intestinal cells, and consequently reducing appetite and lowering
      food intake in humans.

      Over a period of 6 weeks, volunteers will ingest SATIOSTAT as meal replacement at lunch and
      as first course at dinner. Once before and after these 6 weeks the investigators will carry
      out an oral glucose challenge, measure satiation hormones and examine faeces (gut
      microbiota). Volunteers will fill in a food diary and a questionnaire for gastrointestinal
      symptoms and quality of life. The whole study will take approximately 8-10 weeks.
