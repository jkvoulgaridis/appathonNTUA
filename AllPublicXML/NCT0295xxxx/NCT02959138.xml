    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of lanraplenib
      in participants with impaired renal function relative to matched healthy controls.
      Participants in this study will be enrolled using an adaptive design that includes up to 3
      enrolled cohorts. Based on safety and/or PK data in Cohort 1, participants will be enrolled
      in adaptive Cohorts 2 and/or 3.

    <measure>Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameter: AUClast of Lanraplenib Presented Based on Range of CLcr</measure>
    <time_frame>0 (predose), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 96 and 120 hours postdose on Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>AUClast is defined as the concentration of drug from time zero to the last observable concentration. CLcr was estimated using the CG equation for renal function as recommended by the FDA and international guidance documents. CG equation:
For men: CLcr (mL/min) = ([140-age in years] × [body weight in kg])/(72 × serum creatinine in mg/dL)
For women: CLcr (mL/min) = 0.85 × ([140-age in years] × [body weight in kg])/(72 × serum creatinine in mg/dL)
Participants were classified based on estimated CLcr as:
Moderate renal impairment: CLcr 30-59 mL/min
Severe renal impairment: CLcr 15-29 mL/min
Healthy control: CLcr ≥ 90 mL/min</description>

    <description>AUCinf is defined as the concentration of drug extrapolated to infinite time. CLcr was estimated using the CG equation for renal function as recommended by the FDA and international guidance documents. CG equation:
For men: CLcr (mL/min) = ([140-age in years] × [body weight in kg])/(72 × serum creatinine in mg/dL)
For women: CLcr (mL/min) = 0.85 × ([140-age in years] × [body weight in kg])/(72 × serum creatinine in mg/dL)
Participants were classified based on estimated CLcr as:
Moderate renal impairment: CLcr 30-59 mL/min
Severe renal impairment: CLcr 15-29 mL/min
Healthy control: CLcr ≥ 90 mL/min</description>

    <measure>PK Parameter: Cmax of Lanraplenib Presented Based on Range of CLcr</measure>
    <time_frame>0 (predose), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 96 and 120 hours postdose on Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Cmax is defined as the maximum concentration of drug. CLcr was estimated using the CG equation for renal function as recommended by the FDA and international guidance documents. CG equation:
For men: CLcr (mL/min) = ([140-age in years] × [body weight in kg])/(72 × serum creatinine in mg/dL)
For women: CLcr (mL/min) = 0.85 × ([140-age in years] × [body weight in kg])/(72 × serum creatinine in mg/dL)
Participants were classified based on estimated CLcr as:
Moderate renal impairment: CLcr 30-59 mL/min

    <time_frame>Day 1 up to Day 31</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities were defined as values that increase at least one toxicity grade from baseline. The most severe graded abnormality from all tests was counted for each participant. The criteria used for grading was Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 4.03.</description>

        <title>Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameter: AUClast of Lanraplenib Presented Based on Range of CLcr</title>
        <description>AUClast is defined as the concentration of drug from time zero to the last observable concentration. CLcr was estimated using the CG equation for renal function as recommended by the FDA and international guidance documents. CG equation:
For men: CLcr (mL/min) = ([140-age in years] × [body weight in kg])/(72 × serum creatinine in mg/dL)
For women: CLcr (mL/min) = 0.85 × ([140-age in years] × [body weight in kg])/(72 × serum creatinine in mg/dL)
Participants were classified based on estimated CLcr as:
Moderate renal impairment: CLcr 30-59 mL/min
Severe renal impairment: CLcr 15-29 mL/min
Healthy control: CLcr ≥ 90 mL/min</description>

        <population>PK Analysis Set included all enrolled participants who took study drug, had at least 1 nonmissing postdose concentration value reported by PK lab for corresponding analytes, based on CLcr.

        <title>PK Parameter: AUCinf of Lanraplenib Presented Based on Range of CLcr</title>
        <description>AUCinf is defined as the concentration of drug extrapolated to infinite time. CLcr was estimated using the CG equation for renal function as recommended by the FDA and international guidance documents. CG equation:
For men: CLcr (mL/min) = ([140-age in years] × [body weight in kg])/(72 × serum creatinine in mg/dL)
For women: CLcr (mL/min) = 0.85 × ([140-age in years] × [body weight in kg])/(72 × serum creatinine in mg/dL)
Participants were classified based on estimated CLcr as:
Moderate renal impairment: CLcr 30-59 mL/min
Severe renal impairment: CLcr 15-29 mL/min
Healthy control: CLcr ≥ 90 mL/min</description>
