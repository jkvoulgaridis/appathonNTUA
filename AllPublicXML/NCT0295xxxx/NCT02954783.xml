      Background and purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of exercise on
      intratumoral natural killer (NK)-cell variability in patients with localized prostate cancer
      undergoing radical prostatectomy.

      The primary hypothesis is that exercise induces epinephrine-mediated intratumoral natural
      killer (NK)-cell infiltration in patients with localized prostate cancer, and that the
      infiltration is greater in patients performing High Intensity Interval Training compared to
      usual care controls.

      Currently there is a lack of randomized controlled trials examining different types of
      exercise in patients with localized prostate cancer. Moreover there is a need for studies
      including biological measurements to allow a full assessment of the effect of exercise on
      diverse biomarkers and mechanistic pathways, which may influence cancer survival.

      Subjects: Patients with histologically verified prostate adenocarcinoma scheduled for radical
      prostatectomy at Urologic Department, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.

      Methods: In this randomized controlled pilot study 30 patients with localized prostate cancer
      undergoing radical prostatectomy will be included and randomized 2:1 to either High Intensity
      Interval Training (HIIT) exercise intervention or observational control receiving usual care
      from inclusion and until planned surgery (radical prostatectomy).

      All patients will undergo assessments at inclusion (baseline) and at follow-up after the
      exercise intervention period (maximum 8 weeks) 3-5 days prior to surgery.

      Assessments include: anthropometrics; blood pressure; resting hearth rate; cardiorespiratory
      fitness by cardiopulmonary exercise test (VO2 peak.); body composition by DXA scan; quality
      of life by self-report questionnaires; fasting blood sample measuring cholesterol,
      triglycerides, insulin, c-peptide, HbA1c, glucose, hormones and inflammatory markers.

      Biological tissue from tumor (primary prostate biopsies) will be retrieved from the
      respective local pathological departments and from the perioperative prostate specimen and
      sent to protocol analyses.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of exercise on the variability of
      intratumoral Natural Killer (NK)-cell infiltration in tumor biopsies taken before and after
      an exercise intervention in patients randomized 2:1 to one of two study arms: I) High
      Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) (N=20) or II) usual care, prior to radical prostatectomy.

      In addition to this the investigators wish to investigate the effect of HIIT exercise on the
      infiltration of other immune cells into the tumor, tumor vessel morphology, modulation of
      tumor-metabolism, -biology and signaling.

      Finally the aim is to explore the effect of pre-operative HIIT exercise on physiological
      (e.g. cardiovascular fitness, body composition, metabolic profile and metabolic inflammatory
      markers) and psycho-social (e.g. fatigue, emotional well-being, anxiety) endpoints relative
      to usual care.

    <description>Body weight and anthropometrics (height, waist and hip circumference) will be assessed using standard procedures. Resting heart rate and blood pressure (Microlife, BPA100) will be determined in a supine position. Body composition (fat mass, bone mass and fat-free mass) and bone mineral density are analyzed by whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan (Lunar, Lunar Corporation Madison, Wisconsin, USA). Transverse scans at 1 cm intervals are made from head to toe measuring the absorption of x-ray beams at two different energy levels as these are sent through the body. Since the different chemical compounds in the body absorb the intensity of the X-rays differently, the scan allows for a valid determination of bone mass, fat mass and fat-free/bone-free mass</description>
