  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In light of this new technology and preliminary findings of low toxicity of online, adaptive,
      magnetic resonance (M)-guided stereotactic radiation on a single arm prospective study, the
      investigators propose to compare this technique to online MR-guided stereotactic body
      radiation therapy (SBRT) without adaptation. Online plan adaptation increases treatment times
      for patients and comprises an increased burden on technical and clinical staff. Although
      preliminary trial results are encouraging, it remains unclear if the dosimetric benefits of
      online-adaptive planning studies will translate to measurable improvements in clinical
      outcomes that merit its routine use. In our preliminary study, plan adaptation was most often
      required when tumors were adjacent to the gastrointestinal tract (the esophagus to the
      sigmoid colon), as those structures were most commonly the dose-limiting structures and were
      noted to change in location on a day-to-day basis. For these reasons, abdominal disease sites
      have historically highlighted the limitations of SBRT. Specifically, the investigators will
      enroll patients with oligometastatic or unresectable primary disease of the non-liver abdomen
      to a randomized, prospective trial.

      Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment arms, in which they will receive either
      online-adaptive, MRI-guided SBRT or non-adaptive MRI-guided SBRT. Both patient groups will
      undergo MRI simulation and MRI treatment localization with online MR monitoring and/or
      gating. All patients will be treated in five fractions over one to two weeks. By adhering to
      strict normal tissue constraints, the investigators expect toxicity to be within the current
      standard of care for the non-adaptive arm, with reduction in toxicity in the arm of patients
      who undergo adaptation based on daily anatomic changes.

            <description>All patients will be initially planned for stereotactic body radiation therapy to a minimum dose of 50Gy in five fractions to the planning target volume (PTV)
Radiotherapy will consist of stereotactic body therapy, to be given over five fractions, delivered once daily or once every other day for a period of one to two weeks, for a total of five treatments
All patients will undergo both CT and MRI simulation in positioning appropriate for the specific treatment site
When patients present for their first SBRT treatment session, the treating physician will evaluate their individual anatomy to determine if adaptive planning is indicated. Patients randomized to the online-adaptive treatment planning arm will have all tumor volumes and critical structures within 3 axial slices of the PTV re-contoured on the MR-localization image of the day

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Please note that the Principal Investigator (PI) changed for the study after all patients were off follow-up and the protocol title page didn't change at that time. This is why the listed PI is different than the PI on the title page of protocol.</limitations_and_caveats>
