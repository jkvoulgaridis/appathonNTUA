    <textblock>
      This is single site, randomized, blinded comparison of the immunogenicity, of Imovax (RVi)
      and Rabavert (RVa) rabies vaccines when subjects are administered rabies immune globulin
      (RIG) or SYN023. Subjects will be randomized into one of four dose groups: RVi + SYN023,
      RVi+RIG, RVa+SYN023 and RVa+RIG. The initial dose of RVi and RVa will be co-administered with
      either RIG or SYN023). Rabies virus neutralizing activity (RVNA) and blood levels of SYN023
      will be measured for the remainder of the trial while the rest of the five RVi and RVa doses
      are given. The study will last 112 days. SYN023 concentrations and anti-SYN023 antibodies
      will also be measured.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Administered immunoglobulins directed against vaccine antigens have the potential to inhibit
      the immune response to a vaccine. Both vaccination and immune globulin are used together in
      the post exposure prophylaxis of rabies virus infection. SYN023 (a mixture of two monoclonal
      antibodies CTB011 and CTB012) may be used instead of human rabies immune globulin. Since
      there is a risk of antagonism of vaccine induced immunity by SYN023, as there is with rabies
      immune globulin, it is necessary to study possible interactions of these two agents that
      might be used concurrently. This is single site, randomized, blinded comparison of the
      immunogenicity, of Imovax (RVi) and Rabavert (RVa) rabies vaccines when administered
      concurrently with rabies immune globulin (RIG) or SYN023. Subjects will be randomized into
      one of four dose groups: RVi + SYN023, RVi + RIG, RVa+SYN023 and RVa + RIG. The initial dose
      of RVi and RVa will be co-administered with either RIG or SYN023). The remaining 4 doses of
      RVi and RVa will be administered intramuscularly as specified in the product labeling. Serum
      rabies virus neutralizing activity (RVNA) and serum concentrations of the components of of
      SYN023 will be measured for the remainder of the trial while the rest of the five RVi and RVa
      doses are given. Adverse events will be collected for the duration of the trial. The study
      will last 112 days. Anti-SYN023 antibodies will also be measured.

    <description>Inhibitory activity of serum in standard rabies virus inhibition test (RFFIT: Rapid Fluorescent Foci Inhibition Test) assessed as serum RVNA ≥ 0.5 IU/mL. RFFIT is a serum neutralization (inhibition) test, which means it measures the ability of rabies specific antibodies to neutralize rabies virus and prevent the virus from infecting cells. These antibodies are called rabies virus neutralizing antibodies (RVNA).</description>

    <description>Electrocardiograms are performed to monitor subject safety. Laboratory evaluations for subject safety (adverse events) are serum chemistry evaluations, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, bilirubin, alanine amino transferase, aspartate amino transferase, creatine phosphokinase, troponin, potassium, sodium, bicarbonate, calcium, complete blood count, platelet count, differential count, PT(prothrombin time, international normalized ratio) and PTT (partial prothrombin time and urinalyses for monitoring of safety. Additional laboratory tests may be required for evaluation of specific adverse events such as anaphylaxis and immune complex diseases. Adverse events and serious adverse events will be analyzed. A comparison of adverse event incidence between the four treatment groups will be performed.</description>

        <description>Electrocardiograms are performed to monitor subject safety. Laboratory evaluations for subject safety (adverse events) are serum chemistry evaluations, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, bilirubin, alanine amino transferase, aspartate amino transferase, creatine phosphokinase, troponin, potassium, sodium, bicarbonate, calcium, complete blood count, platelet count, differential count, PT(prothrombin time, international normalized ratio) and PTT (partial prothrombin time and urinalyses for monitoring of safety. Additional laboratory tests may be required for evaluation of specific adverse events such as anaphylaxis and immune complex diseases. Adverse events and serious adverse events will be analyzed. A comparison of adverse event incidence between the four treatment groups will be performed.</description>

          <description>Electrocardiograms are performed to monitor subject safety. Laboratory evaluations for subject safety (adverse events) are serum chemistry evaluations, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, bilirubin, alanine amino transferase, aspartate amino transferase, creatine phosphokinase, troponin, potassium, sodium, bicarbonate, calcium, complete blood count, platelet count, differential count, PT(prothrombin time, international normalized ratio) and PTT (partial prothrombin time and urinalyses for monitoring of safety. Additional laboratory tests may be required for evaluation of specific adverse events such as anaphylaxis and immune complex diseases. Adverse events and serious adverse events will be analyzed. A comparison of adverse event incidence between the four treatment groups will be performed.</description>
