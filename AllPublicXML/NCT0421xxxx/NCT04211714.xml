  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II, open label, single center study to assess the safety and tolerability
      of EXG34217 in bone marrow failure patients with telomere biology disorders.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II, open label study in up to 12 subjects with telomere biology disorders
      with bone marrow failure. The study is open to all participants regardless of gender or
      ethnicity. Subjects who are enrolled but not evaluable will be replaced.

      Subjects will sign a consent form prior to any study related procedure and will complete
      baseline screening assessments. Subjects for this study will not require any preparative
      regimen such as chemotherapy or radiation.

      The study will be conducted in three parts

        -  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) collection; mobilization and apheresis,

        -  Ex vivo cell processing

        -  Processed cell infusion and post-infusion safety monitoring,

        -  Follow-up (Week 2, 3,4,5, Months 1, 2,3,4,5,6,9 and 12)
