  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A phase II double-blind placebo-controlled parallel group clinical trial that will randomize
      90 subjects to investigate whether pregabalin (PGB) combined with Lofexidine (LFX) can reduce
      opioid withdrawal-related subjective effects, and investigate, whether the PGB/LFX
      combination can increase the proportion of patients with an opioid use disorder (OUD) who
      complete detoxification and transition to antagonist treatment with extended-release
      injectable naltrexone (XR-NTX).

      An inpatient detoxification study where pregabalin (PBG) will be given orally at a starting
      dose of up to 600 mg daily (group 1) tapered to 100 mg daily over 7 days; given with
      lofexidine (LFX) starting at 2.16 mg daily and declining to 0.72 mg over 7 days. On day 8,
      subjects are offered an injection of XR-NTX if they provide a urine sample that is negative
      for opioids and buprenorphine and pass a naloxone challenge. All subjects, regardless of
      whether or not they receive XR-NTX, will be given a referral and appointment for follow-up
      treatment when they leave the inpatient detoxification program.

    <intervention_model_description>for the primary comparison of longitudinal subjective withdrawal measures, comparing the groups on rate of decrease across detox days, using a linear group by time effect for the mixed effects models described above. We have one primary outcome, so use an alpha level of 0.05, and we use two-sided tests. 90 subjects, 30 from each of three sites, who will be randomized into two groups, with 30 assigned to Lofexidine plus Placebo, and 60 to Lofexidine plus a starting daily dose of 400 mg of pregabalin and increasing to 600mg Pregabalin on day 2.</intervention_model_description>
