  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal carcinoma with liver metastasis is one of the major problems bothering physicians
      worldwide. Bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy is the standard treatment recommended by
      several guidelines. Despite the high cost, a certain portion of patients couldn't benefit
      from this therapy. This study is aiming to find out the specific type of patients who would
      respond to bevacizumab by Radiomics approach, and evaluate the prediction value of this
      imaging model with clinical and genetic factors.
