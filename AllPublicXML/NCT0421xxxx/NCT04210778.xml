  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer survival rates have increased dramatically in recent years. However, many survivors
      report cognitive decline following treatment, which significantly impairs their quality of
      life. Online cognitive training programs have shown promise in improving cognitive functions
      in cancer survivors, but most studies report limited impact of training on everyday function.
      A complementary treatment approach is functional treatment delivered by occupational
      therapists, which directly targets daily function. Combining the two approaches has the
      potential to overcome the limitations of both approaches, enabling improved cognitive
      functions and transfer to daily function. Remotely-administrated interventions further make
      treatment accessible and cost-effective. The current study is aimed at testing the efficacy
      of a novel, combined, remotely-delivered treatment approach: Cognitive Retraining and
      Functional Treatment(CRAFT), using a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) design. 90 cancer
      survivors will be randomly assigned to receive 15 weeks of either the combined treatment,
      computerized training only, or treatment-as-usual. Outcomes will be assessed at completion,
      and following 3 months of no contact, to test immediate and enduring effects of treatment.
      Baseline predictors for treatment response will be further assessed.

      Positive results in the proposed study could potentially change the therapeutic landscape for
      rehabilitation of cancer-related cognitive decline, which currently impair the lives of
      millions worldwide.
