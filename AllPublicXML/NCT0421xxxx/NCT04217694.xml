  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies the feasibility of giving memantine for the reduction of
      cognitive impairment after radiation therapy in pediatric patients with central nervous
      system tumors. Memantine may reduce the effects of radiation therapy on memory and thinking.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the feasibility of twice daily memantine started before radiation therapy (RT)
      and one month after RT.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the feasibility of twice daily (BID) memantine started before RT and continued
      3 and 6 months after RT.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the change in neurocognitive function (NCF) as found by formal neurocognitive
      testing between baseline and 12 months post-RT.

      II. To compare the change in NCF between baseline and the end of RT, 3,and 6 months after RT
      using both neuropsychological testing and the CogState exam.

      III. To evaluate changes in quantitative volumetric brain imaging using Neuroquant software
      analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging before and 12 months after radiation.

      IV. To correlate cognitive changes detected by CogState composite score and formal
      neuropsychological testing.

      V. Disease-free (of primary tumor) and overall survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive memantine orally (PO) BID beginning at the time of study enrollment (no
      later than 1st day of RT) up to 6 months after completion of standard of care RT in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients also complete CogState cognitive testing at
      baseline, at completion of RT, and at 3, 6, and 12 months after completion of RT.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up periodically.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Receiving intracranial radiation for a primary central nervous system (CNS) malignancy

          -  Histological or radiologic confirmation of intracranial disease

          -  Able to use the computer for CogState assessment battery

          -  Normal serum creatinine per institutional normal limits (obtained =&lt; 35 days prior to
             study entry)

          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) OR direct bilirubin =&lt; ULN for
             patients with total bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 x ULN (obtained =&lt; 35 days prior to study
             entry)
