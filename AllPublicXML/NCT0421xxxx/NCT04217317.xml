  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if it is possible to give CPI-613 with the drug
      Bendamustine for 2 days every 28 days without causing severe side effects. In addition, this
      study will also test the safety of CPI-613 when given in combination with Bendamustine.

      Primary Objectives: A pilot Study to evaluate the feasibility, safety and tolerability of a
      two day course per cycle of Bendamustine plus CPI-613 in patients with relapsed and
      refractory T cell non-hodgkin lymphoma.

      Exploratory Objectives

      To evaluate:

        -  Overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) derived from the Lugano
           classification.

        -  Duration of response (DOR) derived from the Lugano classification.

        -  Progression-Free-Survival (PFS) derived from Lugano classification.

        -  Overall Survival (OS).

        -  Single cell transcriptomics from PMBCs pre- and post-treatment; for correlative analyses
           of blood PBMC (and possibly excess pre-treatment tumor biopsy) cell population diversity
           and functional states to reveal potential mechanisms of drug treatment with regard to
           patient response status.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants To Successfully Complete Therapy Regimen</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks after first dose</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility will be defined as 75% of patients being successfully able to complete 80% of their therapy regimens. Toxicity data will be collected on all patients who receive at least one dose of treatment on the study</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response rate is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a best overall response complete response or partial response during or following study treatment according to the Lugano Classification (Stage I - involvement in a single lymph node region to Stage IV diffuse or disseminated involvement of one or more extranodal organs or tissue).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Disease control rate defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a best overall response of complete response, partial response, or stable disease (SD). Best overall response of stable disease must have met the response stable disease criteria at least once ≥12 weeks after start of study treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of Response will be defined for responders (patients with a best overall response of complete response or partial response). It is the time from the date of the first documented complete response or partial response until the date of the first date of progressive disease, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. If a patient has not progressed or died by the analysis cutoff date, duration of response will be censored at the time of the last adequate tumor assessment on or before the cutoff date.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival defined as the time from the start of study treatment until the first date of progressive disease, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. If a patient has not progressed or died by the analysis cutoff date, progression free survival will be censored at the time of the last adequate tumor assessment on or before the cutoff date.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is measured from the start of study treatment until death due to any cause. If a patient is not known to have died at the date of the analysis cut-off, overall survival will be censored at the last date that: Patient is documented to be alive. At the time of single cell sequencing.</description>
