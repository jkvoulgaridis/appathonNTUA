  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study intends to evaluate the use and adherence of different types of
      primary care practices to the diabetes criteria-protocol (diabetes score), developed by the
      Swiss Society of Endocrinology and Diabetology. This diabetes score comprises visits to the
      doctor, lifestyle consultations, clinical measures such as blood pressure, cholesterol or
      blood sugar, as well as measures concerning the prevention of secondary complications like
      kidney, eye or feet issues. The participating primary care practices need to treat 80% of
      their diabetes patients (their &quot;diabetes population&quot;) in accordance to the score-criteria. In
      addition to the adherence to the eight score-criteria, the practices are required to also
      document statistically if their diabetes patients get the following medication: oral
      antidiabetics, insulin, blood pressure medication, statins and / flu vaccine. As this
      observational study is and before-and-after study, the primary care practices need to
      document for each of their diabetes patients the care they provided in the year before the
      introduction of the score-criteria and in the year following their introduction.
      Participating primary care practices ask their diabetes patients' consent to the
      documentation and anonymous transmittance of their data. Data evaluation is anonymous and on
      a population-based level (as opposed to individual-based). The hypothesis of the study is to
      prove that the implementation of evidence-based measures, such as a diabetes score can
      increase the treatment quality of diabetes patients in primary care practices and this
      increase is independent of the primary care practice structure in which it is applied.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Information of the primary care practices regarding the background and goal of the project by
      means of a letter and informative documentation.

      Recruitment of primary care practices, divided into three different practice organisations
      (individual practices and group practices run on a private basis and with financial autonomy,
      as well as forms of joint practices with employed physicians without financial autonomy).

      A signed contract between QualiCCare and participating primary care practices regulates the
      collaboration.

      Procedure:

      A baseline documentation takes place retrospectively from the training/workshop for the past
      12 months, and a second, prospective documentation of the treatment is done during the
      following 12 months.

      Training of the participating general practioners (GP) and practice coordinator on the
      project including evaluation software, data entry and background to the criteria.

      Documentation of the treatment quality of all patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 in a
      practice structure that meets the inclusion criteria according to the score criteria
      (baseline).

      After 12 months, the treatment quality of the included patients with diabetes type 2 is
      recorded again using the same score.

    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>The change is measured at baseline, before the introduction of the diabetes score criteria and one year after the introduction.
There are 8 score criteria for the good diabetes management in primary care (such as 1x/y lifestyle consultation, 1x/foot control, etc). Each criteria gets a certain number of points if 80% of the participating patients are treated in accordance to the given criteria. In total, a maximum of 100 points can be achieved. The objective is to achieved a minimum of 70% (= 70 points).</description>

    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>In order to test the feasibility of the use in different primary care practice types, the diabetes score criteria (as described above) are used in independent single practices and group practices. The above mentioned diabetes score consists of 8 score criteria concerning the diabetes management in primary care. The maximum amount of points are 100. it is desirable to achieve 70/100 points, whereas the points are attributed if 80% of the participating diabetes patients in the practice are treated according the the criteria.</description>
