  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Actinic cheilitis is a potentially malignant lesion on the lower lip, which can progress to
      more serious illnesses such as cancer if not treated. Usually treatment of this condition is
      only based on clinical appearance, but there is no established cure treatment. Topical
      imiquimod is a medicine indicated for the treatment of skin diseases, but it has not yet been
      proven to treat actinic cheilitis. In this research, the investigator's aim is to evaluate
      the response to actinic cheilitis treatment with the current standard treatment compared to
      high and low concentration imiquimod topical formulations.

      Three formulations are used in this research: imiquimod 5%, imiquimod 0.05% e imiquimod
      nanoencapsulated 0.05%. Nanoencapsulation is a process that concentrates the drug into a
      capsule not visible to the naked eye, allowing it to penetrate skin more easily and will only
      release the drug at the lesion site. The drug is presented in a free form inside the gel in
      the others formulations.

    <masking_description>A pharmacist, who will not have contact with the study subjects at any time, will prepare the hydrogels in transparent sealed syringes, which will be numerically coded and two spreadsheets with the codes will be generated and placed in sealed brown envelopes. One envelope will be held by the pharmacist and the other envelope will be placed in a safe place. Participants will not know which medication they received until the end of the experimental phase. The vehicle gel is identical in appearance to those containing imiquimod. If for any reason the information on which treatment has been allocated is required, the external assistant will take all possible measures to ensure that the masking is not broken. The examiners who will perform the treatment and clinical evaluation will be blinded to the experimental group. Primary outcome measure is based on clinical evaluation of lesions by photographs. The images will be coded in order to achieve blindness of outcome assessors.</masking_description>

    <measure>Clinical Response</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days after conclusion of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical analysis of lip photographs based on a classification. The lesions will be graded as:
AC Grade I. Dryness and desquamation on the vermilion of lips.
AC Grade II. Atrophy on the vermilion's border, presenting soft surfaces and pallid areas with eruptions. Blurred limit between the lip's vermilion border and the skin, or a dark line demarking that limit can be seen. This melanotic line should be different from ephelides or other pigmented lesions.
AC Grade III. Rough and squamous areas on the drier parts of the vermilion and hyperkeratotic areas, especially when they spread to the wet lip's mucosa (border between mucosa and semimucosa).
AC Grade IV. Ulceration present in one or more sites of the lip's vermillion or Leukoplakia, mainly in more traumatic places, due to the history of pipe or cigarettes consumption. These lesions could suggest that a malignization process would be in progress, especially when they are accompanied by endured areas on palpation.</description>

    <description>Upon confirmation of the diagnosis of actinic cheilitis, participants will undergo a noninvasive procedure called exfoliative cytology. With this examination it is possible to analyze morphological changes of the collected cells by light microscopy. The lip mucosa is scraped with cytobrush, which is then used to smear two glass slides. From one of the obtained smears, Papanicolaou stain will be performed. Papanicoloau staining allows assessing different cell types, which are quantified to evaluate epithelial differentiation.</description>
