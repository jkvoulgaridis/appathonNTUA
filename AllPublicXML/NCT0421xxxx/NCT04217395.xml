  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This mixed-methods prospective cohort study aims to evaluate a recently implemented
      reinforced support program named &quot;X-ailes program&quot;.

      The X-Ailes program is a face-to-face or telephone-based support program by health-system
      navigators/case-managers, funded by the French Ministry of Health (program for empowerment of
      care users). X-Ales is developed by an patients and public association to support overweight
      or obese care users facing difficulty to access to care or resources regarding the management
      of their health situation.

      The subjects of the present study are the overweight or obese care-users followed-up by the
      X-Ailes program.

      The aim of the study Eval-X-ailes is to assess the effect of the support program X-Ailes on
      quality of life, autonomy and literacy of overweight or obese care users at 12 months.

    <measure>Quality of life at 12 months, measured by the specific questionnaire Quality of life, Obesity and Dietetics (QOLOD, Ziegler et al. 2005)</measure>
    <time_frame>month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The QOLOD questionnaire is adapted to socio-cultural factors of obesity and dietary weight management in France, and it is validated with satisfactory reliability and reproducibility. It contains 36 items grouped into 5 dimensions: physical impact, psycho-social impact, sex-life impact, comfort with food and diet experience. Answers for each question are expressed on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 =enormously/all the time (true) and 5 = never/not at all (true). Score vary from 0 to 100. Global and dimension scores evolution will measure during the follow-up.</description>

    <description>The X-Ailes program is a face-to-face or telephone-based support program by health-system navigators and developed by a patients and public association to support overweight or obese care users.
The main objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of the X-ailes program on quality of life of overweight and obese people involved in the program.
Secondary objectives are to assess their overall health status, their health literacy level and their empowerment. The implementation study is guided by the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance; Glasgow, Vogt, &amp; Boles, 1999) theoretical framework to determine whether the intervention objectives are being met and to understand the mechanisms of action of the device.</description>
