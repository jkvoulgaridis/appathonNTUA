    <textblock>
      Women destined to develop gestational hypertensive complications often exhibit deviant
      hemodynamic adaptation patterns before overt clinical disease. Gestational hypertension and
      late onset preeclampsia are associated with an exaggerated rise in cardiac output on top of a
      higher prepregnant value, whereas a shallow rise in cardiac output and the lack of a
      peripheral resistance drop predisposes to the much less common early onset-preeclampsia along
      with impaired fetal growth. Early treatment of altered cardiac output and peripheral
      resistance adjustments might prevent development of gestational hypertensive complications.
      The investigators aim to evaluate early cardiovascular adjustments during pregnancy in a
      high-risk population, and to pharmaceutically adjust deviant cardiovascular adaptations with
      beta-blockade, centrally acting sympatholytic agents or vasodilating agents when appropriate
      to prevent adverse effects on neonatal birth weight.

      Healthy pregnancy is accompanied by major hemodynamic changes that benefit the uteroplacental
      circulation. A first-trimester drop in vascular resistance triggers several compensatory
      mechanisms, amongst an increase in blood volume and cardiac output, to maintain blood
      pressure. These adaptations continue and stand until delivery.

      Women destined to develop gestational hypertensive complications often exhibit deviant
      hemodynamic adaptation patterns before overt clinical disease. On the one hand, gestational
      hypertension and late onset preeclampsia are associated with an exaggerated rise in cardiac
      output on top of a higher prepregnant value, whereas a shallow rise in cardiac output and the
      lack of a peripheral resistance drop predisposes to the much less common early
      onset-preeclampsia along with impaired fetal growth.

      Antihypertensive therapy based on correction of the hemodynamic imbalance between cardiac
      output and peripheral resistance seems an effective strategy to improve blood pressure
      control in hypertensive pregnant women. Even more sophisticated, early treatment of altered
      cardiac output and peripheral resistance adjustments might prevent development of gestational
      hypertensive complications. One randomized controlled trial treated pregnant women with an
      augmented cardiac output with a selective beta-blocker, which resulted in a decreased
      prevalence of preeclampsia from 18% in the placebo group to 4% in the atenolol group (p =
      0.04), at a cost of 440gram birth weight.

      In line of this reasoning, the investigators aimed to evaluate early cardiovascular
      adjustments during pregnancy in a high-risk population (i.e. women with preeclampsia in their
      first pregnancy). In this health care traject, women with deviant adaptation to pregnancy
      were advised tailored medication, i.e. beta-blockade in women with an pronounced high cardiac
      output profile effectuated by a high heart rate, and a vasodilating agent in women with a
      high-resistance hemodynamic profile. Women with a mixed hemodynamic profile were advised a
      centrally acting sympatholytic agent. The investigators aimed to retrospectively compare
      outcome of women attending this health care project with women who received care as usual in
      their second pregnancy.

    <description>High-risk women admitted to a non-pregnant cardiovascular and cardiometabolic risk factor assessment are invited to participate in a follow-up program at four time-points during a subsequent pregnancy (i.e. at 12, 16, 20 and 30 weeks of gestational age). This program is additive to regular pregnancy check-ups, and all women are otherwise managed by their referring physicians. The aim of this program is to evaluate adaptation of maternal hemodynamic parameters in response to pregnancy, and to adjust deviant adaptation with tailored antihypertensive medication. Participation in this program is on voluntary basis, and not restricted to severity of complications in the first pregnancy.</description>

    <description>Tailored medication is advised in women with inadequate hemodynamic adaptation to pregnancy. Type of medication depends on total peripheral vascular resistance and heart rate. In short, women with a low peripheral vascular resistance in parallel with a high heart rate are advised a betablocker (labetalol), while a vasodilating agent (calcium channel blocker, nifedipine) was advised in women with a high total peripheral vascular resistance in combination with a low heart rate. Women with suboptimal adaptation to pregnancy without an extreme pronounced vascular profile are advised a centrally acting sympatholytic agent (methyldopa).</description>
