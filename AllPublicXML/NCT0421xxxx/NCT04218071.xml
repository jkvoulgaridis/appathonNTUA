  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      9-ING-41 has anti-cancer clinical activity while not causing myelosuppression, and has both
      pre-clinical anti-fibrotic activity and activity against myelofibrosis. This Phase 2 study
      will study its efficacy in patients with advanced myelofibrosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      9-ING-41 is a first-in-class, intravenously administered, maleimide-based, small molecule,
      potent selective GSK-3β inhibitor with significant pre-clinical and clinical anticancer
      activity. In the ongoing Actuate 1801 study in a cohort of over 90 patients with advanced
      refractory malignancies, 9-ING-41 has exhibited no significant toxicity, including no
      myelosuppression, and significant anti-tumor activity. 9-ING-41 also has significant
      pre-clinical ability to reverse pathologic fibrosis in multiple models of pulmonary and
      pleural fibrosis. Reversal of fibrosis by an anti-fibrotic agent in patients with advanced
      myelofibrosis (MF) has recently been demonstrated to be of clinical benefit. 9-ING-41 has the
      potential to act both as an anti-neoplastic agent (without causing myelosuppression) and an
      anti-fibrotic agent in patients with MF. The efficacy of Ruxolitinib is limited in many
      patients by the inability to tolerate adequate doses for an adequate duration with
      myelosuppression being a frequent dose limiting toxicity. 9-ING-41 may reduce the dose of
      Ruxolitinib needed for optimal therapeutic response and/or reverse myelosuppression so than
      an adequate dose of Ruxolitinib can be tolerated. Pre-clinical data show synergy in MF
      between 9-ING-41 and Ruxolitinib. This Phase 2 study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of
      9-ING-41, as a single agent or in combination with Ruxolitinib, in patients with advanced,
      poor prognosis MF.
