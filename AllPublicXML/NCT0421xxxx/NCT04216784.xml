  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A common complication of the progression of cirrhosis is fluid retention (ascites, edema, or
      pleural effusion). Loop diuretics are the treatment of choice for fluid retention in
      cirrhotic patients; however, many of these patients demonstrate diuretic resistance,
      requiring higher doses of the diuretics to achieve adequate diuresis. The cause of this
      diuretic resistance is hypothesized to be secondary to hypoalbuminemia which has led some
      providers to give human albumin in combination with loop diuretics to increase intravascular
      volume and facilitate diuresis. However, this practice remains controversial because minimal
      data exists to support its efficacy. The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of
      diuretics alone versus diuretics in combination with albumin in cirrhotic patients presenting
      with fluid retention.

      The purpose of this single center, prospective study is to compare the efficacy of two
      strategies for diuresis in patients with cirrhosis, the use of furosemide (Lasix®) alone
      versus the combination of furosemide (Lasix ®) and albumin (25%). The investigators will
      perform a single-center, prospective study with data collected as result of standard of care
      at Rush University Medical Center (RUMC). Patients who are 18 years of age and older, have
      diagnosed cirrhosis, and present to RUMC with fluid retention will be identified by the
      Hepatology and/or Surgery attending and be screened for inclusion in the study. Each patient
      will be randomized into one of the two cohorts and will have 50% chance of being placed into
      either cohort. Cohort 1 will receive furosemide (Lasix) 40 to 80 mg intravenous push (IVP)
      twice a day (BID) for at least 48 hours and cohort 2 will receive combination of furosemide
      (Lasix) 40 to 80 mg IVP BID and albumin (25%) 12.5 grams BID for at least 48 hours.
