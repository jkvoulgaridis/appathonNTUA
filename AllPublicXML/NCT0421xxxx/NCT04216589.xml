      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of semaglutide on intra-hepatic
      triglyceride (IHTG) content in people living with HIV (PLWH), central adiposity, insulin
      resistance or pre-diabetes, and hepatic steatosis.

      This study will evaluate the effects of semaglutide on intra-hepatic triglyceride (IHTG)
      content in people living with HIV (PLWH), central adiposity, insulin resistance or
      pre-diabetes, and hepatic steatosis.

      All participants will receive semaglutide subcutaneously once weekly for 24 weeks, followed
      by 24 weeks of observation off of the study drug. IHTG will be quantified by magnetic
      resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) evaluations at two time points
      during the study.

      Participants will attend several study visits through Week 48. Participants will complete
      food diaries, adherence and strength assessments, and report on hypoglycemia, vision changes,
      physical activity, diet, quality of life, and acceptability of study drug. Blood will be
      collected at all visits and stool samples at two visits.

      Participants must remain on their non-study-provided antiretroviral therapy (ART) throughout
      the study.

          -  HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or
             chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and
             confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than

               -  NOTE: The term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a US Food and Drug Administration
                  (FDA)-approved kit, which is required for all investigational new drug (IND)
                  studies, or for sites located in countries other than the United States, a kit
                  that has been certified or licensed by an oversight body within that country and
                  validated internally. Non-US sites are encouraged to use US FDA-approved methods
                  for IND studies.

               -  WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and
                  Prevention) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must
                  use a test that is different from the one used for the initial assessment. A
                  reactive initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid
                  assay or an E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or
                  different test principle (e.g., indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot
                  or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.

          -  Two separate reports of HIV-1 RNA measurements &lt;50 copies/mL, and no HIV-1 RNA
             measurement &gt;500 copies/mL, during the 48 weeks prior to entry. One of the HIV-1 RNA
             values must be the screening visit value, and the other value obtained between 24 and
             48 weeks prior to entry.

               -  NOTE: All values must have been reported from a US laboratory that has a Clinical

               -  NOTE B: Within-class substitutions are not permitted.

          -  No plan to change ART for the study duration.

             laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent, or at any network-approved

                  clinical monitoring, if available. If no additional monitoring is available in
                  the 3 months prior to entry, additional testing should be obtained within the
                  screening interval (2-4 weeks apart) to ensure stability.
