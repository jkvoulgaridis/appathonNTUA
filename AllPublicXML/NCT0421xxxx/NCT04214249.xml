      This phase II trial studies how well cytarabine and idarubicin or daunorubicin with or
      without pembrolizumab work in treating patients with newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cytarabine, idarubicin, and daunorubicin, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal
      antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and
      may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving induction
      chemotherapy with pembrolizumab may work better than induction chemotherapy alone in treating
      patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the percentage of patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) negative complete
      remission (CR) (MRD-CR) as measured by flow cytometry at the end of first cycle of
      consolidation therapy with chemotherapy + MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) and compare between the two
      study arms.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the rate of complete remission (CR)/complete remission with incomplete count
      recovery (CRi) as defined per European LeukemiaNet 2017 response criteria at time of count
      recovery after induction therapy with chemotherapy + MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) (Dohner et al.,
      2017).

      II. Rates of complete remission with partial recovery count (CRh) and hematologic improvement
      (HI) to red blood cells and platelets.

      III. Assess the rates of MRD negativity at day 14, MRD-negative CR at end of induction
      therapy and MRD negative CR after last consolidation cycle.

      IV. Assess event free survival (EFS), measured from randomization to failure to achieve
      CR/CRi, relapse or death from any cause, and relapse free survival (RFS), calculated as the
      time from first documentation of CR/CRi to either disease relapse or death from any cause.

      V. Assess the duration of response (DOR, defined as the time from first CR/CRi to the date of
      the first documented relapse or death, whichever occurs first) and overall survival (OS),
      defined as time from randomization to death from any cause.

      VI. Assess safety endpoints including proportion of patients who develop severe toxicity as
      defined in the protocol.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. MRD assessment by duplex sequencing (DS) and comparing DS and multiparameter flow
      cytometry for MRD detection as an exploratory biomarker.

      II. Assessment of immune-checkpoint expression and dynamic change of immune cell subsets in
      response to the combination of checkpoint-inhibition and backbone combination in acute
      myeloid leukemia (AML).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      INDUCTION PHASE:

      ARM I: Patients receive cytarabine via continuous intravenous (IV) infusion on days 1-7 and
      idarubicin hydrochloride IV over 15-30 minutes or daunorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15-30
      minutes on days 1-3 of a 28-35 day cycle. Patients who have evidence of residual leukemia
      receive cytarabine via continuous IV infusion over days 1-5 and idarubicin hydrochloride IV
      over 15-30 minutes or daunorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15-30 minutes on days 1-2 for an
      additional cycle in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning
      day 8, patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 25-40 minutes. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a CR or a
      CRi may undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) per physician discretion or
      continue to consolidation therapy.

      ARM II: Patients receive cytarabine via continuous IV infusion on days 1-7 and idarubicin
      hydrochloride IV over 15-30 minutes or daunorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15-30 minutes on
      days 1-3 of a 28-35 day cycle. Patients who have evidence of residual leukemia receive
      cytarabine via continuous IV infusion over days 1-5 and idarubicin hydrochloride IV over
      15-30 minutes or daunorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15-30 minutes on days 1-2 for an
      additional cycle in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who
      achieve a CR or a CRi may undergo HSCT per physician discretion or continue to consolidation
      therapy.

      CONSOLIDATION THERAPY:

      ARM I: Within 4 weeks of remission status documentation, patients receive high-dose
      cytarabine (HiDAC) IV over 1-3 hours every 12 hours on days 1, 3, and 5 for a total of 6
      doses and pembrolizumab IV over 25-40 minutes. Cycles with HiDAC repeat every 28-42 days and
      cycles with pembrolizumab repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients who remain in CR or CRi receive up to 3 additional cycles of
      HiDAC and pembrolizumab in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity and
      continue to maintenance therapy.

      ARM II: Within 4 weeks of remission status documentation, patients receive HiDAC IV over 1-3
      hours every 12 hours on days 1, 3, and 5 for a total of 6 doses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who remain in CR or CRi receive up to 3
      additional cycles of HiDAC in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY:

      ARM I: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 25-40 minutes. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks for
      up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6
      months for up to 5 years. Patients who undergo HSCT are also followed up at 100 days
      post-transplant.

    <description>Will perform high-throughput sequencing of the TCR V beta CDR3 regions on ﬂow cytometrically sorted T-cell subsets to assess the effect of immunotherapy on the diversity of the T-cell repertoire and assess for correlation to clinical outcomes. TCR diversity and clonality will be calculated using a software by Adaptive Technologies. T-cell repertoire diversity and clonality will be correlated with clinic-pathological parameters such as response to treatment, survival, and immune infiltrating profile, as well as genomic profiles (total mutation burden, non-synonymous mutation burden, predicted neoantigen burden, clonal mutation burden and clonal predicted neoantigen burden). TCR profile generated from treatment-refractory tumors at the time of disease progression will be compared to data from pre-treatment tumor samples to explore the TCR repertoire evolution of these tumors under therapeutic pressure.</description>

             cervical cancer. Prior treatment with the following are not allowed:

               -  Patient who have received anthracyclines for treatment of a prior, unrelated,
                  curatively-treated malignancy which would limit their ability to receive 7 + 3
                  chemotherapy treatment on study

             not returned to baseline or have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) with the exception of
             =&lt; grade 2 neuropathy and alopecia

               -  NOTE: Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not
                  require corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout

             abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator

          -  Patient with known active CNS disease and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Assessment of
             the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) is not required to enroll in the study unless there is
             clinical suspicion for CNS involvement. However, if CSF assessment is performed for
             any reason, there should be no evidence of active leukemia in the CSF. Subjects with
             previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without
             evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks prior to the first dose of
             protocol treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no

             vitiligo that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e., with use of
             disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement
             therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy
             for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic
             treatment

          -  Patients with a known history of non-infectious pneumonitis that required the use of
             steroids or current pneumonitis

             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) is
             humanized antibody with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab), breastfeeding
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab). These
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study

                  vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist)
                  are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed

          -  Active hemolytic anemia requiring immunosuppressive therapy or other pharmacologic
             treatment. Patients who have a positive Coombs test but no evidence of hemolysis are
             NOT excluded from participation

          -  Patients with clinically significant disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), as
             assessed by treating physician, will be excluded from study
