  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use online materials and strategies to recruit 3600 Black and Hispanic men
      who have sex with men (MSM) to participate in a study evaluating the effectiveness of the
      Know@Home mobile app compared to control condition with respect to linkage of participants to
      appropriate services, as well as cost-effectiveness outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness of mailing out rapid HIV home-testing kits and additional
      testing promotion components among African-American or black and Hispanic or Latino gay,
      bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM), the study &quot;Implementation of Rapid HIV
      Self-Testing among MSM Project&quot;, known as iSTAMP, is being conducted in 11 US states. This
      study is interested in the most cost-effective ways to recruit men at high risk for HIV
      infection. The researchers want to study a sample of 3600 sexually active adult men who have
      sex with men (MSM) who are not known to be living with HIV; 1800 black/African-American and
      1800 Hispanic/Latino men will be enrolled.

      All participants will be mailed two rapid HIV self-test kits upon randomization. All
      participants, regardless of study arm, will also complete a follow-up survey at the end of a
      4-month follow-up period. At the end of the 4-month follow-up period, participants will be
      mailed a dried blood spot (DBS) collection kit for research purposes, as well as another
      rapid HIV self-test kit for immediate testing. Participants in each of the arms will have
      access to videoconferencing-delivered prevention counseling, and all participants, regardless
      of assigned arm, will be contacted if they report seroconversion and/or a preliminary
      positive test during the study period for active linkage to care.

    <description>Men randomly assigned to the Know@Home arm will access the features of the Know@Home by downloading the app. The contents of the app were developed to serve as a comprehensive mobile HIV prevention app for MSM, with HIV prevention and care information and links to resources. This intervention arm provides an app-based toolkit that allows users to access information about prevention services as their needs change. Participants will have access to the app for the 4 month study period. The Know@Home arm will offer participants the opportunity to order free condoms and lubricant as well as an at-home sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing kit.</description>
