      In this project the investigator's plan to collect blood during a patient's routine angiogram
      procedure which they will have due to having suffered a heart attack. Data from the patients'
      routine procedures for this condition, including but not exclusively, ECG, Echocardiogram,
      MRI scans, will be collected. The aim of the research project is to analyse the blood samples
      and identify novel biomarkers and clinical parameters associated with acute coronary
      syndromes. The investigator's will particularly focus on markers of inflammation and
      micro-organism activity. The investigator's hope that this will help to gain more knowledge
      about what causes heart disease and how various conditions can be treated more efficiently.
      The investigator's will follow-up and collect further research data via a questionnaire at
      the routine 6 weeks and 6 months follow-up appointment after the angiogram procedure.
      Participants will also be telephoned at one-year post procedure, to update any events and
      medication status and data will thereafter be collected form data held by the hospital
      without having to contact the participant. Remaining blood samples will be stored securely
      for further analysis into blood and other markers.

    <textblock>
      Acute coronary syndromes (ACS), i.e. patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial
      infarction (STEMI), non ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (non-STEMI) or unstable
      angina, are still a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United Kingdom and beyond.
      In spite of the enormous progress made in the last decades, the in hospital mortality has
      plateaued recently, and the event rate after the infarction is still high with one in 8
      patients having a second event (i.e. death, myocardial infarction, heart failure,
      revascularization among others) within a year of follow-up.

      After the acute event, risk stratification is important and will be come even more
      sophisticated than it currently is with the advent of anatomic risk scores (SYNTAX II Score),
      novel biomarkers and novel drugs allowing for more precise characterization of the patients
      individual risk and more tailored secondary prevention strategies (Precision Medicine).

      Indeed, particularly the upcoming treatment strategies with bio-logicals (i.e. monoclonal
      antibodies, e.g. against PCSK9) and genetic tools (i.e. RNA interference, antisense
      technology) will require precise risk assessment for cost-effective use of these promising
      new tools.

      It is anticipated that this study will help the investigator's to describe the heart attack
      population in a robust manner with a wealth of clinical data as well as blood samples for
      bio-markers.
