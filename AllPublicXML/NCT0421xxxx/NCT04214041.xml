  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of autologous fat as a grafting
      material for soft tissue volume augmentation of localized horizontal ridge defects in humans.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 20 patients having 26 localized horizontal ridge defects were recruited for the
      study from the patient pool at the dental clinics of the faculty of dentistry, Alexandria
      University. Ridge defects were divided into two parallel groups:

      Test group: localized ridge defects were augmented using autologous fat grafting Control
      group: localized ridge defects were augmented using conventional subepithelial connective
      tissue graft.

    <intervention_model_description>This non-inferiority study was designed as a randomized controlled clinical trial including 26 localized horizontal ridge defects that were equally allocated (1:1) into one of two parallel groups.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Neither the operator nor the participants could be blinded to the treatment type as the intervention procedures were markedly different between test and control groups. To enable blinding during outcome assessment, the stereolithography (STL) files of digitized casts were given a code different from that of the allocation procedure and were kept confidential. The volumetric analysis was performed and the groupings were shared with the biostatistician as groups A and B. Only during the interpretation the codes and groups were translated into test and control groups</masking_description>

    <description>To evaluate the volumetric changes of soft tissues, all the stone models will be digitized using a lab-based optical scanner. The digital surface models will be imported as STL files into the image analysis software for volumetric analysis. Digital cast models representing the different time points during the follow up will be superimposed using tooth surfaces as references. The relevant area for the measurements of volume changes will be defined and volume changes will be calculated by the same examiner according to previous studies</description>
