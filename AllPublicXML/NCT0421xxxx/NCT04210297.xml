  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to develop and validate a new noninvasive method based on routine
      examination during clinical practice for predicting high risk esophageal varices in
      cirrhosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Portal hypertension is the main consequence of cirrhosis. Variceal bleeding is the principal
      and life-threatening complication of portal hypertension. Endoscopic screening is the golden
      standard to detect esophageal varices. However, endoscopy is limited by its invasiveness,
      cost and the discomfort it imposes on patients. With the goal of circumventing these
      disadvantages, we intend to develop an noninvasive method for predicting high risk esophageal
      varices.
