  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if continuous glucose monitoring can identify how often
      people who have pre-diabetes or medical obesity or well-controlled diabetes experience very
      high glucose values while receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.

    <description>A blinded continuous glucose monitor (specifically a Freestyle Libre Pro) will be worn for a 14 day period by patients during the first and third cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. At the end of that period (after completion of the first round of chemotherapy) readings will be downloaded from the sensor and the sensor will be removed. Readings will be evaluated by the treating endocrinologist as well as the study team and appropriate clinical interventions.</description>
