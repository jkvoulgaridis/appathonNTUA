      Data collection of Mexican subjects with a diagnosis of heart failure with moderate or severe
      depressed systolic function, their treatments and progress in a real world environment
      compared to the ACC/AHA/HRS 2017 Guidelines.

      *Determine the frequency of ICD/CRT-D implants according to the recommendation of the
      International Guidelines, Class I (ACC/AHA/HRS 2017) in subjects with heart failure with
      moderate or severe depressed systolic function.

      Identify the main epidemiological and clinical characteristics of subjects with heart failure
      with moderate or severe depressed systolic function, as well as the health care programs used
      in terms of subjects' health.

        -  Evaluate the prevalence of mortality and its classification in subjects with heart
           failure with moderate or severe depressed systolic function with or without the use of
           Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator and/or Resynchronization Therapy-Defibrillator.

        -  Estimate how many subjects with an indication for an ICD/CRT-D received an implant.

        -  Identify the reasons for not prescribing a device in those subjects with a Class I
           recommendation.

        -  Determine the population with 1.5 Primary Prevention criteria (subjects with heart
           failure in primary prevention who have one or more of the following risk factors:
           syncope or pre-syncope; left ventricular ejection fraction less than 25%; presence of
           non-sustained ventricular tachycardia; more than 10 ventricular extrasystoles per hour
           observed in a 24-hour Holter).

        -  Collect data on the use of resources associated with the follow-up of subjects diagnosed
           with heart failure with moderate or severe depressed systolic function; with or without
           an implantable Cardioverter-defibrillator and/or Resynchronization Therapy-Defibrillator
           for a period of 12 months to perform a secondary economic analysis.
