  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-time-in-human (FTIH), Phase 1 study to determine the safety, tolerability,
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      AZD0466 in patients with solid tumors, lymphoma and multiple myeloma at low risk for tumor
      lysis syndrome (TLS), as well as in patients at intermediate risk or high risk of TLS with
      hematologic malignancies for whom no standard therapy exists. Once an MTD/RP2D has been
      determined in the dose escalation portion, further disease-specific expansions (solid tumor
      and hematologic) will be undertaken. Combinations of AZD0466 with other standard of care
      treatments may be evaluated in the future.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a FTIH study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AZD0466 at
      increasing doses in patients with malignancies for whom no standard therapy exists, including
      advanced solid tumors, lymphoma and multiple myeloma with a low risk for TLS (Arm A), and
      relapsed, refractory hematological malignancies with an intermediate to high risk of TLS (Arm
      B). The study will also characterize the PK of AZD0466 and explore potential biological
      activity by assessing pharmacodynamics, exploratory biomarkers, and anti-tumor activity. Once
      an MTD/RP2D has been determined during escalation, further disease-specific expansions,
      possibly including, but not limited to small cell lung cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukemia,
      and acute myeloid leukemia will begin.
