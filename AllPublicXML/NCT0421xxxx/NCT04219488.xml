  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to determine the effects of neuromobilization techniques and conservative
      rehabilitation therapy on pain, grip strength, and functional status in patients with lateral
      epicondylitis (LE). A total of 40 patients (26 females and 14 males; age: 42.80 ± 8.91 years)
      with a history of LE participated in the study. The patients were randomly assigned to two
      groups: the neuromobilization group and the control group. The neuromobilization group
      completed a 6-week conservative rehabilitation and radial nerve mobilization program, whereas
      the control group received conservative rehabilitation therapy only. Both groups underwent a
      7-day weekly conservative home rehabilitation program. Pain severity, grip strength, pinch
      strength, joint mobility, and upper extremity functional level were assessed before
      treatment, at the third week, after treatment, and at the sixth week after treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lateral epicondylitis (LE) is a painful situation, which usually occurs due to the overuse of
      the wrist extensor muscles. The prevalence of LE is 1%-3% in both men and women, and it is
      highest in individuals aged &gt;40 years. Pain and tenderness over the lateral epicondyle of the
      humerus at the origin of the common extensor tendon are the main characteristics. Different
      conservative treatment methods have been used for treating LE; however, no standard protocol
      has been documented in the literature. Physiotherapy programs have focused on relieving pain,
      controlling inflammation, and increasing muscle strength and endurance. The use of eccentric
      strengthening programs has been supported by current research. Eccentric exercises have been
      demonstrated to reduce pain and increase function in patients with LE. Recently,
      neuromobilization techniques have been employed in treating musculoskeletal problems and
      various compression syndromes. These techniques aimed to provide nerve gliding via joint
      movements wherein a therapist extends the nerve length in one joint while shortening the same
      in the adjacent joint. This tensioning technique increases the distance between each end of
      the nerve, and this neural elongation ability significantly decreases in patients with LE.
      Neuromobilization techniques have been also proposed to modulate central sensitization and
      peripheral pain mechanisms in musculoskeletal disorders. Given that central sensitization
      plays an important role in the increased nociceptive reflex and hyperalgesia in LE, inducing
      hypoalgesia via neuromobilization techniques may provide pain relief in the long term.

    <description>Grip strength was measured using two different test methods: pain-free grip strength and maximum grip strength. Both tests were performed in the sitting position with the elbow flexed at 90° and in the standing position with the elbow extended at 0°. Both tests were performed using a calibrated hydraulic hand dynamometer® (Jamar, Bolingbrook IL).The measurements of both extremities were repeated 3 times with a resting interval of 30 s between each measurement. The average of the three trials was recorded in kilograms (kg).</description>
