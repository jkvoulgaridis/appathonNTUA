  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) experience distressing
      breathlessness and high health care utilisation. There is compelling evidence that pulmonary
      rehabilitation improves symptoms and reduces hospitalisation, but is delivered to &lt;10% of
      patients who would benefit. The investigators developed a low cost model of pulmonary
      rehabilitation that can be delivered entirely at home. The HomeBase model had equivalent
      outcomes to centre-based pulmonary rehabilitation in a phase II efficacy trial, with higher
      completion rates. The investigators hypothesise that a patient centred model offering a
      choice between home or centre-based pulmonary rehabilitation may increase program completion
      rates, with improved outcomes for patients and the health system.

      This is a cluster randomised implementation trial investigating whether offering a choice of
      home or centre-based pulmonary rehabilitation can reduce hospitalisation, improve pulmonary
      rehabilitation completion and enhance patient outcomes in people with COPD. 14 pulmonary
      rehabilitation programs located across Australia will each recruit 35 people with COPD.
      Intervention centres: People with COPD will be offered the choice of centre-based pulmonary
      rehabilitation or the HomeBase model. Comparison centres: Only the existing centre-based
      model will be offered. The primary outcome is all cause, non-elective hospitalisation at 12
      months. Other outcomes are symptoms, exercise capacity and quality of life at 8 weeks and 12
      months; and health care costs at 12 months for full economic evaluation.
