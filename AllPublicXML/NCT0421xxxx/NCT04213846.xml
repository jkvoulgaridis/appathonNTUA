  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will develop a smartphone/mobile app intervention that incorporates
      ecological momentary assessment (i.e., two brief surveys per day) and daily intervention
      messaging (2 messages per day) for three weeks to target high-risk alcohol use among young
      adult college students. The intervention mainly focuses on alcohol expectancies, alcohol use,
      and consequences and the daily associations between these and includes personalized
      intervention messages based on participants' own event-level expectations and experiences.
      Other psycho-educational alcohol-related content is also provided over the course of three
      week intervention. This mobile app intervention will be used in a randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) comparing young adult college students who receive the intervention with those who only
      receive assessments via the mobile app.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and test a smartphone app that can both collect daily
      data and deliver a personalized intervention (mAEC) using participants' own event-level,
      real-world experiences to challenge proximal alcohol expectancies and alter the associations
      between alcohol expectancies and drinking and consequences. The mobile app intervention will
      be used in a randomized controlled trial comparing young adult college students who receive
      the intervention with those who only receive assessments via the mobile app. Assessments
      include an eligibility survey, baseline assessment, and follow-up assessments occurring 1-,
      6-, and 12-months post-intervention.

      The goal of the intervention is to target college students' alcohol expectancies (what they
      believe or expect alcohol's effects to be) and the associations between alcohol expectancies
      and alcohol use and related consequences. Intervention content will utilize twice daily
      messages, one in the morning (AM Messages) and one in the late afternoon or early evening (PM
      Messages). Most PM Messages draw on information collected in the daily assessments
      (Personalized Messages). Intervention Messages in general will include feedback based on
      selected assessment items, weekly summaries generated from the daily assessments, general
      psycho-educational messages and videos about alcohol, and a toolbox with content that
      supplements information provided in the daily intervention messages.

The intervention messages also focus on intentions to drink and pharmacologically-delayed negative effects. Intervention Messages in general will include feedback based on selected assessment items, weekly summaries generated from the daily assessments, general psycho-educational messages and videos about alcohol, and a toolbox with supplemental information (e.g., personal BAC calculators, resources).</description>

Codebooks to assist with data analyses and interpretation will be created and can be shared. We plan to make the datasets available for sharing at the time that the main project findings are published or shortly thereafter. We will share data that do not compromise individuals' rights and privacy available in accordance with the University of Washington (UW) IRB policies. To facilitate replication in other studies, all measures we use are available in the public domain and are popular measures of alcohol use, alcohol-related consequences or alcohol expectancies. For any measure we modify or create for our purposes, we will described in detail (with added items listed) these changes in our published work.</ipd_description>
