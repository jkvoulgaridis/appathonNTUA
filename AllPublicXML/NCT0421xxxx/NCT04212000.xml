      This is a phase 1, randomized, open-label, single-dose, two-period, two-sequence crossover
      study in healthy male and female subjects to evaluate the relative oral bioavailability of
      levoketoconazole tablets (the test drug) and ketoconazole tablets (the reference drug
      product).

      This is a phase 1, randomized, open-label, single-dose, two-period, two-sequence crossover
      study in healthy male and female subjects to evaluate the relative oral bioavailability of
      levoketoconazole tablets (the test drug) and ketoconazole tablets (the reference drug
      product). Subjects will be randomized to receive a single oral dose of 150 mg
      levoketoconazole (Study Drug A) or a single oral dose of 200 mg ketoconazole (Study Drug B)
      in each period.
