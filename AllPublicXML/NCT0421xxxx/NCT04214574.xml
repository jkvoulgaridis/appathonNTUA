  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective randomized observational study, we aim to compare real time
      ultrasound-guided paramedian technique using parasagittal oblique view with real time
      ultrasound-guided paramedian technique using the paramedian transverse median view. Our aim
      is to find the most suitable real time ultrasound guided approach with regard to ease of
      performance defined as success rate at first attempt, number of puncture attempts, spinal
      procedure time, and patient satisfaction.

    <description>the probe will be placed in a parasagittal plane to identify the articular processes then the sacrum will be identified. The probe will be moved cephalad in the parasagittal axis until the identification of the target lumbar interspaces L2-L3, L3-L4 or L4-L5. Once the appropriate lumbar interspace is identified, the probe will be tilted 45 degree towards the midline into a parasagittal oblique view. The needle will be inserted in plane from the caudal end of the ultrasound transducer with its tip directed towards the interlaminar space under real-time in-plane US guidance.</description>

    <description>the transducer will be applied in the parasagittal plane, and after identification of the intervertebral level, the probe will be rotated 90 degrees into a transverse orientation and centered on the neuraxial midline in a way to align the beam with the interspinous and interlaminar space and thus to get a paramedian transverse interlaminar view. The needle will be inserted in plane from the lateral end of the ultrasound transducer with its tip directed towards the medial border of the articular process.</description>
