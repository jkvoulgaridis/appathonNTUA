  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypoperfusion, hypoxia and ischemia occurs in circulation as a result of anemia. All of these
      situations lead to oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in the organism. In this
      study, the investigators aimed to investigate the oxidant-antioxidant balance and asymmetric
      dimethylarginine (ADMA) levels in patients that have symptomatic anemia in need of
      erythrocyte suspension (ES) transfusion. To the best of the investigators knowledge, there
      have been few studies in the literature on anemia and total oxidant, total antioxidant and
      ADMA levels. We aimed to observe changes in oxidative - antioxidant ADMA levels before and
      after ES transfusion.

    <description>ES transfusion needs of the patients were determined according to clinical signs and symptoms. Vital signs were closely monitored and recorded before, during and after transfusion. Infusion was performed slowly for the first 15 minutes in terms of allergic reaction, and then the transfusion rate was adjusted according to the patient's clinic.</description>

    <description>Venous blood samples were obtained from patients who needed ES transfusion before transfusion. Control venous blood samples were obtained from the patients who did not develop any complications for 24 hours after starting of the transfusion and became hemodynamically stable.</description>
