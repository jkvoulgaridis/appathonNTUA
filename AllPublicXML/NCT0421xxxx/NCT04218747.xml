  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 2010 Child Nutrition Reauthorization provided funding to test innovative strategies to
      end childhood hunger and food insecurity. Demonstration projects were funded in Chickasaw
      Nation, Kentucky, Navajo Nation, Nevada, and Virginia. This study focuses on Virginia. A
      selection of schools were randomly assigned to either a treatment or control group. Children
      in treatment schools received: (1) three meals during the school day and food packages for
      weekends and school breaks; (2) $60 monthly Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) benefits during
      summer months if they were eligible for FRP meals; and (3) nutrition education for their
      parents. The control group operated under &quot;business as usual.&quot;

      Objective: To reduce hunger 365 days a year in households with schoolchildren by transforming
      schools into food hubs and providing nutrition education to parents.

      Target Population: Elementary (n=30), middle (n=6), and high schools (n=2) in rural and urban
      VA. All schools had low academic performance and at least 50 percent of children eligible for
      free and reduced-price (FRP) meals.

      Intervention: Schools were randomly assigned to either a treatment or control group. Children
      in treatment schools received: (1) three meals during the school day and food packages for
      weekends and school breaks; (2) $60 monthly Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) benefits during
      summer months if they were eligible for FRP meals; and (3) nutrition education for their
      parents. The control group operated under &quot;business as usual.&quot; Note that the $60 monthly
      benefit was not included in the evaluation of the demonstration.
