  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls in daily life are one of the most significant complications for people with stroke.
      Fall rates are particularly high soon after discharge from stroke rehabilitation. A new type
      of balance training, called reactive balance training (RBT), can reduce fall rates after
      discharge from stroke rehabilitation. In our previous study, RBT was implemented as part of
      routine care, and as a result, the dose of training was different for each participant;
      participants completed between one and twelve 30-minute sessions of RBT. Previous research in
      healthy older adults suggests that a single session of RBT is enough to lead to lasting
      changes in reactive balance control and reduce fall rates in daily life. It is not clear if
      the same is true for people with stroke, who have more severe impairments and might need a
      higher dose of training to achieve the same benefits.

      The overall goal of this work is to determine the optimal dose of reactive balance training
      for people with stroke who are attending rehabilitation. This pilot study will determine the
      feasibility of a clinical trial to address this larger goal. People with sub-acute stroke
      will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1 session, 3 sessions, or 6 sessions of
      RBT. Each session will be 45 minutes long, and will occur as part of participants' routine
      out-patient rehabilitation. We will use our experiences with this pilot study to help design
      a larger study. Specifically, we will use this pilot study to answer the following questions:
      1) what is the optimal sample size; 2) how long will it take to reach this sample size; 3)
      what outcome measures should be used; 4) how feasible is it to prescribe a specific dose of
      RBT to people with sub-acute stroke; and 5) what two intervention groups should be included
      in the larger trial?

    <description>Participants will be asked to report falls (&quot;an event that results in a person coming to rest unintentionally on the ground or other lower level&quot;) in the 6 months post-training. Participants will be provided with stamped, addressed postcards to mail to the research team every 2 weeks for 6 months post-training. Postcards will contain a calendar, on which participants will record falls. The research assistant will call participants who do not return the postcard to determine if any falls occurred. The research assistant will contact participants reporting a fall to complete a short questionnaire determining the cause and consequences of the fall.</description>

    <description>Participants will be outfitted with reflective markers, and will complete 8-10 walking trials on a movable platform. On one trial, the platform will move forward suddenly on heel strike to trigger a slip-like perturbation. On another trial, the platform will move backward suddenly on toe-off to trigger a trip-like perturbation. The platform will only move during these two trials, such that the perturbation will be unpredictable to participants. These perturbations differ from what will be used during training, and will measure transfer of training to novel and ecological loss of balance. Biomechanical stability when responding to the perturbation will be measured using an established method that considers the distance between the centre of mass and base of support; in general, a more posteriorly- (slip) or anteriorly-located (trip) centre of mass is considered less stable.</description>

    <description>A research physiotherapist will oversee reactive balance training (RBT) in collaboration with participants' regular physiotherapists to ensure consistent RBT delivery across participants. Training strategies will be individualized to each participant, based on their balance impairments and rehabilitation goals. The RBT program includes multi-directional 'internal' and 'external' balance perturbations. Internal perturbations are achieved by asking the participant to complete tasks that challenge balance control, such that they lose balance when attempting to perform the task (e.g., kicking a soccer ball). External perturbation are delivered manually using a push or pull from the physiotherapist. As participants improve their reactive balance control, difficulty will be increased by shifting task requirements along a continuum from stable to mobile, and from predictable to unpredictable, and by increasing perturbation magnitude or imposing sensory or environmental challenges.</description>
