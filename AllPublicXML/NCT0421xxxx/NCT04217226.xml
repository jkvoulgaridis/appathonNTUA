  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The perfusion index (PI) is a numerical value for the ratio between pulsatile and
      non-pulsatile blood flow measured by a special pulse oximeter. PI represents the baseline
      sympathetic tone which is assumed one of the factors contributing for hypotension. Patients
      with low PI were reported by Mahendale and Rajasekhar to show greater hypotension after
      induction of anesthesia. This was explained by the high sympathetic tone in these patients
      which is suddenly masked by propofol administration leading to profound hypotension.

      This study aims to evaluate the ability of preoperative plethysmographic variability index,
      perfusion index and the Dicrotic Plethysmography to predict post-induction hypotension.

      The perfusion index (PI) is a numerical value for the ratio between pulsatile and
      non-pulsatile blood flow measured by a special pulse oximeter. PI represents the baseline
      sympathetic tone which is assumed one of the factors contributing for hypotension. Patients

      induction of anesthesia. This was explained by the high sympathetic tone in these patients
      which is suddenly masked by propofol administration leading to profound hypotension.
      Moreover, The PI has been described as a reliable tool for vascular tone assessment and
      monitoring.

      Dicrotic Plethysmography (Dicpleth): is easily derived from the photoplethysmographic signal.
      It represents the relative height of the dicrotic wave compared with the maximum peak of the
      waveform, has been described as the amount of reflected wave, dependent on the vascular tone.
      M.Coutrot et al quantified Dicpleth variations to detect arterial hypotension and mentioned
      that Dicpleth and PI are both related to vascular tone and are easily derived from the
      photoplethysmographic signal. Moreover, Chowienczyk PJ et. al. demonstrated that the
      reduction in Dicpleth is related to the reduction of vascular tone caused by vasodilator
      drugs, such as salbutamol or glyceryl trinitrate

    <description>The PVI and PI will be recorded in the supine position by an anaesthesiologist who was not involved in the further intraoperative monitoring of the patient using Masimo SET (&quot;MightySat 9900, Masimo Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA). This device allows bluetooth radio for transfer of parameter data to a smart device. The device will be applied on the index finger of the dominant hand of each patient. It will be applied on the hand that neither contains the venous line nor the blood pressure cuff. Three measurements of PVI and PI on one minute interval will be recorded. We will use the average of these readings.
Dicpleth is defined as the ratio of the height of the dicrotic notch (from nadir point of the complex to the notch) to the height of the systolic peak (from the same nadir point of the complex to the peak), measured at end-expiratory time.</description>
