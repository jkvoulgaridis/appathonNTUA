    <textblock>
      Determine the efficacy, in terms of time to nausea (inclination to vomit), of DPI-386 Nasal
      Gel as compared to the current standard of care (TDS) and placebo nasal gel. • Describe the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of a multi-dose schedule of DPI-386 Nasal Gel (0.2 mg twice a day for
      six consecutive days) as compared to the current standard of care (TDS). Determine the safety
      of a multi-dose schedule of DPI-386 Nasal Gel with an emphasis on cognitive adverse events as
      compared to the current standard of care (TDS) and placebo nasal gel. Determine how alertness
      is affected by administration of DPI-386 Nasal Gel, as compared to the current standard of
      care (TDS) and placebo nasal gel.

      Each subject eligible for the study on Day 0 will be assigned a subject number (starting with
      101 for male subjects and 201 for female subjects) in consecutive order which will randomize
      the subject to one of the three study arms: double-blind DPI-386 Nasal Gel; double-blind
      placebo nasal gel; or Transderm Scop® (TDS). The subject number will link the nasal gel
      (active or placebo) treatment arms (double-blind) to a multi digit random number (study drug
      kit number) different from the subject number. The nasal gel vials, contained in the study
      drug kit, will be labelled with the same study drug kit number. Each 0.12 gram of the gel
      contains 0.2 mg of scopolamine HBr as the active ingredient along with the excipients sodium
      citrate, citric acid, sodium metabisulfite, glycerin, benzalkonium chloride, polyvinyl
      alcohol, and purified water.
