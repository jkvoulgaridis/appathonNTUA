      This study is a group controlled clinical trial. ParallelParallel study, patients aged 25-50
      years, with Migraine Chronicle. Twelve sessions will be held during four mindfulness practice
      with four recordings (one per week). As a brainwave biomarker, the Muse, a
      Electroencephalogram (EEG). The investigators will use the MIDAS questionnaire, the HIT-6
      Questionnaire and the FFMQ-BR. Based on the use of tDCS in patients with chronic pain, and in
      benefits of Mindfulness practice in these patients, the objective is to evaluate if the
      mindfulness-associated TCCA provides satisfactory results in the painful prophylaxis of
      patients with chronic migraine.

      Background: Chronic Migraine is a difficult to diagnose disease whose symptoms affect the
      quality of life of those affected. This study is a group controlled clinical trial.
      ParallelParallel study, patients aged 25-50 years, with Migraine Chronicle Methods / Design:
      Will be held at the Aging Studies Laboratory and Neuroscience of the Federal University of
      Paraíba. Twelve sessions will be held during four mindfulness practice with four recordings
      (one per week). As a brainwave biomarker, the Muse, a Electroencephalogram (EEG). The
      investigators will use the MIDAS questionnaire Migraine Disability), the HIT-6 Questionnaire
      (Headache Impact Test) and the FFMQ-BR (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire). The
      investigators will analyze the data through Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS)
      25.0 program for software and from data normality analysis will be applied parametric and /
      or nonparametric tests.

      Discussion: Based on the use of tDCS in patients with chronic pain, and in benefits of
      Mindfulness practice in these patients, the objective is to evaluate if the
      mindfulness-associated TCCA provides satisfactory results in the painful prophylaxis of
      patients with chronic migraine.

    <measure>Migraine disabIlity assessment questionnaire - MIDAS</measure>
    <time_frame>04 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Migraine Disability Assessment Questionnaire (MIDAS) will be used for this assessment. Its objective is to evaluate the inability of migraine patients to perform daily and professional tasks. This instrument contains five questions that must be completed with the number of days the patient failed to perform the specified activity because he or she was experiencing a migraine episode. This assessment is a useful tool for identifying the severity of this condition. Includes questions that score between 8 and 13 points, depending on the answer given. This questionnaire can be applied to people of different educational and social levels, as it is considered easy to answer (FRAGOSO, 2002).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Headache impact test - HIT-6</measure>
    <time_frame>04 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>HIT-6 is a highly reliable questionnaire validated in Portuguese. It evaluates the frequency of headache impact on the quality of life of patients with chronic and episodic migraine and discriminates the types of migraine presented by the patient (episodic, chronic or non-migratory types). It is simple and easy to apply (Yang et al, 2010). This questionnaire consists of six questions that evaluate these parameters through the following options: never, rarely, sometimes, very often and always. A predetermined value is associated with each of these frequency parameters (for example, the score is rarely 8 points and usually 13 points), which will be added to the final score to determine the score equivalent to the headache impact.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Five facets of mindfulness questionnaire (FFMQ-BR)</measure>
    <time_frame>04 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The FFMQ-BR is an instrument for assessing the characteristics of mindfulness validated in Brazil in 2014. Subdivided into five main evaluation factors (observation, description, non-judgment, non-reactivity and conscientious acting) assessed in the situations addressed in each item - For example, &quot;In difficult situations, I can pause without reacting immediately.&quot; This scenario is classified by the participant through a scale ranging from 1 to 5 points, where 1 represents &quot;never or almost never&quot; and 5 represents &quot;always or almost always&quot; (BARROS et al, 2014). The total score of the questionnaire will be calculated and this score will be compared before and after all intervention sessions are completed between the two groups to assess whether the participants' level of attention has increased.</description>

The twelve sessions will be performed in three sessions per week for four weeks, and mindfulness practice at home will be encouraged on days when the intervention is not administered.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients of both genders aged between twenty-five and fifty years who have been
             clinically diagnosed with chronic migraine according to the third edition of the
             International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3) will be selected.

          -  Only patients who are able to complete treatment in the twelve sessions of four
             preprogrammed consecutive weeks will be accepted, although up to three alternating
             absences or two excused absences are tolerated.

          -  Absent days will be replaced with follow-up on the next working day to minimize
             dropouts and promote adherence to treatment. Flextime will be provided to participants
             who receive the therapy, as well as direct contact by calling participants by phone to
             confirm the evaluation dates and reinforce adherence to treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria will be the presence of headache attributed to another neurological
             or associated neuropsychiatric pathology, the use of central nervous system
             (CNS)-modulating drugs, the diagnosis of a severe, distinct neurological or
             psychiatric disease, the use of another nondrug therapy for migraine or other CNS
             pathologies concurrent with or immediately before the intervention, the presence of
             metallic implants located in the cephalic region and the implantation of cardiac
             pacemakers.
