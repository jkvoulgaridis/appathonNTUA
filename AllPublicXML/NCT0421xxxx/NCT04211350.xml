    <textblock>
      Comparison of the NightBalance Sleep Position Trainer (SPT) to Positive Airway Pressure (PAP)
      for the Treatment of Positional Obstructive Sleep Apnea (POSA). Primary Objective: Efficacy
      and Adherence of the SPT over 3 months of use compared to PAP for the treatment of POSA. The
      study is run from centers in France, the UK and Germany.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants are randomly allocated to receive one of two treatments, either Automatic
      Positive Airway Pressure (APAP) or NightBalance Sleep Position Therapy for a three month
      period. Participants are sent home with instructions to use that device nightly at home for
      three months. After three months of using the first device, they return to the doctor for
      assessment of the efficacy of the device using a sleep test and the compliance read from the
      device. Upon conclusion of the first three month treatment period, patients receive the
      alternative treatment for a further three months. At the end of the second three month
      period, participants return to their doctor again to assess the efficacy of the last device
      and read the compliance. Before any treatment and after each treatment, patients undergo a
      sleep test and complete some questionnaires. During each treatment period, patients complete
      a healthcare utilization diary and report any problems.

    <measure>Daytime Sleepiness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline,3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Daytime sleepiness is measured using Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), has a minimum value 0, maximum value 24 with higher values indicate worsening daytime sleepiness.</description>

    <measure>Impact of sleepiness on activities of daily living</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline,3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Impact of sleepiness on activities of daily living is measured using Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ). The FOSQ is a sleep related quality of life is measured across five dimensions; activity level, vigilance, intimacy and sexual relationships, general productivity, social outcome. Each rate the difficulty of performing a given activity on a 4-point scale, min value 0, max value 4. Low scores indicate no difficulty, higher scores extreme difficulty.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline,3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Health related quality of life is measured using EQ-5D at baseline and at the end of each 3 month treatment arm. Health status is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has five response levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, unable to/extreme problems. Responses are coded as single-digit numbers. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined in a 5-digit code that describes the respondent's health state with lower scores indicting worsening health status and higher values improved health status.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline,3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue is measured using Pichot Fatigue Scale at baseline and at the end of each 3 month treatment arm. The Pichot Fatigue Scale is an 8 question survey in which is answered 0 to 4 with a maximum score of 32. A score above 22 reveals excessive fatigue, patients may suffer from inefficient sleep.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life utilizing SF-36</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline,3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life is measured using SF-36 at baseline and at the end of each 3 month treatment arm. The 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) is an indicator of overall health status. It has the following sections: Vitality, Physical functioning, Bodily pain, General health perceptions, Physical role functioning, Emotional role functioning, Social role functioning, Mental health.
The SF-36 has eight scaled scores; the scores are weighted sums of the questions in each section. Scores range from 0 - 100. The lower scores mean more disability, and higher scores mean less disability.</description>

    <measure>Mean Disease Alleviation</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Mean Disease Alleviation is calculated using the AHI and adherence data at the end of each 3-month treatment arm 8. Adverse events are recorded at the end of each 3-month treatment arm</description>
