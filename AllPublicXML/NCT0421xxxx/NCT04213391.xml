  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this proposed study, the investigators will evaluate the efficacy, safety and related
      mechanism of sulforaphane in treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study will recruit
      160 AD patients, and then these patients will be randomized to sulforaphane group or placebo
      group (80 patients per arm) for 24 weeks clinic trial. Clinical efficacy and safety
      assessment will be done at screen/baseline, 4 week, 12 week, and 24 week. The specific aims
      are to compare sulforaphane versus placebo on: clinical core symptoms; biological samples
      also will be collected, and stored to research related mechanisms. During the study period,
      safety index including blood and urine routine, liver and kidney function, coagulation index
      and clinical effect index about neuropsychological scales will be recorded.

      screen/baseline, 4 week, 12 week, 24 week. The specific aims are to compare sulforaphane
      versus placebo on: 1) clinical core symptoms; The investigators hypothesize that (1)
      sulforaphane is superior to placebo in the treatment of clinical symptoms in patients with
      AD, measured by the ADAS-cog, MMSE Scale, Moca; (2) Biological samples will be collected, and
      stored so that the hypothesis sulforaphane may alter oxidative stress indexes or inflammatory
      biomarkers, and influence histone deacetylase inhibitor mechanism or inflammatory mechanism
      et al that may be significantly correlated with clinical improvement. (3) Safety index
      including blood and urine routine, liver and kidney function, coagulation index and clinical
      effect index about neuropsychological scales will be recorded.
