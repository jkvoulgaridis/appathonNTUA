      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sodium Zirconium
      Cyclosilicate (SZC), as well as the appropriateness of the dosing mechanism, in Chinese
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on chronic haemodialysis.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to determine the safety and
      efficacy of SZC in ESRD subjects with hyperkalaemia and on stable haemodialysis. This study
      consists of a screening period, an 8-week randomized treatment period, and a follow-up
      period. Approximately 134 stable haemodialysis subjects with persistent pre-dialysis
      hyperkalaemia will be enrolled in the study across research sites in China.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             consent form.

          3. Subjects must have haemodialysis access consisting of an arteriovenous fistula, AV
             graft, or tunnelled (permanent) catheter which is expected to remain in place for the
             entire duration of the study.

          4. Receiving haemodialysis (or hemodiafiltration) 3 times a week for treatment of
             end-stage renal disease (ESRD) for at least 3 months before randomization.

          5. Pre-dialysis S-K &gt; 5.4 mmol/L after long inter-dialytic interval and &gt; 5.0 mmol/L
             after at least one short inter-dialytic interval during screening (as assessed by

             blood flow [Qb], dialysate flow rate [Qd] and bicarbonate concentration) expected to
             remain unchanged during study.

          8. Subjects must be receiving dietary counselling appropriate for ESRD subjects treated
             with haemodialysis / haemodiafiltration as per local guidelines, which includes
