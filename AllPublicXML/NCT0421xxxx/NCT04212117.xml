  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal in this line of inquiry is to test whether the Patient Activated Learning
      System (PALS) is effective in reducing disparities in access to reliable, easily understood
      health information, and whether this increased understanding has downstream consequences such
      as increases in trust in the medical system and self-management behaviors.

      Participants will view, in randomized order, PALS or WebMD content on hypertension and on
      high cholesterol. This study will test knowledge uptake across topics as well as attitudes
      toward and trust in the information and information providers.
