  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative ileus (POI) is defined as a transient reduction of bowel motility that prevents
      effective transit of bowel content and tolerance of oral intake following surgical
      interventions, especially after radical cystectomy. It remains a major factor associated with
      postoperative morbidity, length of hospital stay and medical costs.

      In order to optimize perioperative care for patients undergoing radical cystectomy in a
      context of an ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) program, we will evaluate the
      effectiveness of systemic pharmacologic opioid antagonist treatment.

    <textblock>
      Radical cystectomy (RC) with urinary diversion represents the gold standard treatment for
      muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Postoperative ileus (POI) is defined as a transient reduction
      of bowel motility that prevents effective transit of bowel content and tolerance of oral
      intake following surgical interventions, especially after RC. It remains a major factor
      associated with postoperative morbidity, length of hospital stay and medical costs.

      Faster gastrointestinal recovery and prevention of POI are at the heart of ERAS (Enhanced
      Recovery After Surgery) protocols. In order to optimize the post-operative consequences of
      patients operated on for a cystectomy within the framework of a RAAC program, several
      provisions aim to alleviate post-operative gastrointestinal dysfunctions.

      Naloxegol, peripherally acting µ-opioid receptor antagonist, is currently approved for
      opioid-induced constipation in Chronic Non-Cancer Pain, but its potential interest to prevent
      POI has never been assessed. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the
      administration of Naloxegol for a limited duration as part of ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After
      Surgery) program will be evaluated to reduce the time of hospital discharge (length of stay)
      and to reduce the rate of postoperative complications. Priamry and secondary objectives will
      be compared between naloxegol and placebo groups.
