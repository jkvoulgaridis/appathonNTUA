  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the possible effects Kinesio Tape may have on
      proprioception in individuals with patellar tendonitis. A supportive knee application, a
      facilitative hip application, and a combination of the two will be applied and compared.
      Within and between group comparisons will be drawn.

      Participants will report for two research sessions with 24-36 hours between. Prior to
      arrival, they will complete a digital Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment for Patellar
      Tendonitis (VISA-P) and email it to the researcher. Participants must score less than 80 (out
      of a possible 100) to be considered for this study. If the individual meets the inclusion
      criteria, he/she will be scheduled for the 1st session. Upon arrival to the first session,
      informed consent will be obtained, the VISA-P will be reviewed, and intance of patellar
      tendonitis will be confirmed through palpation. Participants will then completed a Tampa
      Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK) to measure fear of movement and a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) to
      measure overall pain. Height and weight measurments will be taken due to requirements of the
      Biodex Balance System (BBS), which will be used for balance measurements. Participants will
      take two, twenty-second practice tests, one with eyes open and one with eyes closed, followed
      by two minutes rest. Baseline testing will then be completed as follows: the participant will
      complete two tests with eyes open, and two tests with eyes closed on the injured leg, each
      with one minute rest between. The participant will then be taped with Kinesio Tape to either
      the hip, knee, or both the hip and knee according to the random group assignment. They will
      then rest for 15 minutes and complete a second round of balance testing with the same
      parameters as baseline testing. Participants will be scheduled for a second day no less that
      24 hours and no more than 36 hours for re-test purposes.

      On the second day of testing, participants will be given $10 for their participation on Day
      1. If they want to continue with testing procedures, they will participate in the same
      balance testing procedures as Day 1. The integrety of the tape application will be confirmed,
      and second TSK and VAS scale will be administered. A final round of balance testing will be
      completed, and the participant will receive an additional $10 if they choose to complete both
      days of testing.

      This research will allow us to compare results of the TSK, the VAS and the BBS testing both
      within subject and between group.
