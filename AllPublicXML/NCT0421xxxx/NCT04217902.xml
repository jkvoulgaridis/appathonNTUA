  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Population aging and the increase in incidence and prevalence of potentially disabling
      chronic conditions make health care more and more complex and costly. In this context,
      timelines are longer and adherence to care provision and health status are more variable -
      both within and between patients - and care is provided by different health care
      professionals, as well as services outside the health system, which may work at various
      levels of service integration. For diabetes, this is especially the case: patients at high
      risk for multimorbidity interact with multiple health care professionals, such as primary
      care physicians, diabetes specialists, nurses, nutritionists and therapeutic educators, with
      different perspectives to treatment. The patient is frequently the only link between the
      different health care professionals, and very often the main source of information regarding
      performed procedures, diagnoses and treatment decisions.

      A current challenge facing all health care stakeholders, including policy makers,
      practitioners, businesses, and patients, is to coordinate the available services and
      integrate care ensuring safety, effectiveness, and comprehensiveness in relation to the needs
      of individual users across the lifespan. Routine collected data can provide key information
      to completely assess a patient's health status and thus help evaluating and deciding adapted
      steps in treatment to stabilize or improve clinical outcomes.

      In France, the Dossier Medical Partag√© (Shared Medical Record) represents an effort to
      centralize and improve accessibility, to patients and professionals alike, of medical
      information. This system is yet little adopted and there is the need for added value
      initiatives to exploit the tool's potential. In other countries, like the UK, the
      governmental unit NHSX develops public policies and good practices for the digital
      transformation of the NHS. In the United States, working groups like the Health Information
      Technology Working Group, in the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
      Diseases, develop electronic care plans using Electronic Health Record data for chronic
      kidney disease patients. These initiatives, among others, show the necessity of simple,
      visual communication in order to build a comprehensive care delivery pathway to inform
      decision and further care planning, according to health goals set by shared decision-making.

      This study aims to describe individual experiences of chronic care delivery of people living
      with diabetes and also from healthcare professionals working in diabetes care from 3
      different domains: clinical (relevant clinical criteria necessary for the decision-making
      process, goal setting and planning), technological (tools used in routine practice and in
      patients' daily lives), and behavioural (behaviours and interactions that build the patient's
      pathway and strategies implemented by patients and professionals to help the decision-making
      process).

    <description>Socioeconomic status will be assessed, health literacy using the Brief Health Literacy Screening (BHLS), and a semi-directed interview will be undertaken with people living with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The latter aims t obtain a description of their experiences concerning how their care delivery pathways were built over time, how health-related decisions are made individually and what data they consider health care professionals they interact with should systematically have access to (considering the 3 domains previously described). Health care professionals will also be interviewed regarding their experiences and needs in diabetes care, in the shared decision-making process and in establishing care coordination.</description>
