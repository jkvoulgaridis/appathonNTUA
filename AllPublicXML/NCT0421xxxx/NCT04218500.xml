  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Occupational hand dermatitis (OHD) often occurs in intensive care unit (ICU) nurses,
      especially in individuals who are vulnerable due to irritant exposure e.g. hand rub alcohol
      and repeated hand washing activities. The use of moisturizer is one of the recommendations
      for skin care in OHD. Niacinamide which has anti-inflammatory effects and can improve the
      skin barrier function. Virgin coconut oil (VCO) is rich in lipids and lauric acid, and has an
      occlusive effect. Until now there are no guidelines and reference types of moisturizers for
      secondary prevention in DTAK.

      The aim of this study is identify the effectiveness and safety between moisturizing cream
      containing niacinamide 4% and VCO 30% for secondary prevention of occupational hand
      dermatitis in ICU nurses This study also measured HECSI , TEWL, and SCap before and after
      treatment

    <description>Skin Capasitance (SCap) is a score for skin hidration. SCap can be done with measuring the water level in corneal stratum using non-invasive electric method which measure the capacitance. SCap is measured in Arbitrary Unit (AU). SCap value before treatment was expected to be lower than after treatment. Outcome: change of SCap</description>
