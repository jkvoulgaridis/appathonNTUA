      Research question and objectives This pilot study will help us answer the following research
      question: Is it feasible to conduct a large cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an
      intervention that consists of routine screening for poverty and related social determinants
      and intervening in Canadian primary care clinics, and what is the sample size required?

      Our objectives include:

        1. to collect data on the feasibility of recruiting clinics for a large cluster randomized
           controlled trial (RCT)

        2. to collect data on the acceptability and feasibility of integrating a standardized
           socio-demographic data collection tool, including screening for poverty, within diverse
           primary care clinic workflows

        3. collect data on the acceptability and feasibility of &quot;modest&quot; and &quot;intensive&quot;
           interventions on poverty (discussed below)

        4. collect data on the recruitment rate of patients, to assist with calculating the sample
           size for a larger cluster RCT

        5. collect data on the intervention effect size of the &quot;modest&quot; and &quot;intensive&quot;
           interventions on income and health outcomes to assist with calculating the sample size
           for a larger cluster RCT .

      Rationale Research carried out by members of the study team has found that routine
      socio-demographic data collection in primary care has significant potential. Such data could
      be used to better tailor care to a patient's social context, improve diagnostic accuracy by
      incorporating social determinants as risk factors, identify inequities in the uptake of
      health services and in health outcomes, stimulate the development of new programs, and
      advance research. However, a standard set of questions has not yet been developed in Canada.
      Significant challenges remain to implementation of routine socio-demographic data collection,
      particularly around patient engagement, staff training, and support to make use of data
      collected, including adjustment for non-response bias. Existing work has also found that
      health providers and organizations lack evidence-based interventions to address social needs,
      particularly poverty. Work to date by the study team has found that a prototype financial
      benefit tool could be integrated into clinic workflow, particularly if the right staff person
      was administering it and following up with patients, and approximately 17% of patients had
      received a financial benefit after 1 month. No study to date has examined the longer-term
      impact of such a tool on income and health. It is not known whether a &quot;modest&quot; intervention,
      with the tool integrated into a clinic visit and brief follow-up, would be as effective as a
      more &quot;intensive&quot; intervention, with a dedicated visit to use the tool and multiple follow-up
      visits

Our intervention consists of two parts:
Routine screening for sociodemographics and social needs such as poverty
Intervening when poverty is identified through linkage to a trained staff member who uses a Benefits Screening Tool to identify benefits that the patient is entitled to, and then provides support</intervention_model_description>
