  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis is that camrelizumab in combination with pemetrexed/ carboplatin will
      present a better efficacy for treatment of first line metastatic non-squamous non-small cell
      lung cancer and minimize the risk of toxicity
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, phase Ⅱ studyto evaluate the efficacy and safetyof
      camrelizumab combined with pemetrexed/ carboplatin in participants with brain metastases
      ofnon-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.Paticipant was confirmed without EGFR activating
      mutation or ALK fusion, and received no prior systemic therapy.Patients would receive
      camrelizumab in combination with pemetrexed/ carboplatin for 4 cycles，followed by
      camrelizumab and pemetrexed as maitenance treatment until progression, camrelizumab will be
      administered no more than 24 months. PD-L1 expression assessed with 22C3 pharmDx assay will
      be used as a stratification factor.
