  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to evaluate the impact of a complete course of antenatal steroids treatment on
      mortality and main morbidities in a current population of preterm infants.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All infants admitted in the Neonatal Department born with less than 32 weeks of gestational
      age are included.

      Data are prospectively recorded. Perinatal variables (Gestational age, materna condition at
      admission, antenatal steroids treatment, gender and results of histological analysis of the
      placenta) are recorded as well as respiratory status during hospitalization and morbidities
      at discharge. Results of neurodevelopment test performed at 24 months of corrected age are
      also included.

    <description>Scale of Psychomotor Development of Children (the Brunet-Lézine Scale). This scale consists of 150 items that are grouped around the following four areas: Posture (postural control or general motor skills), Coordination (psychomotor coordination), Language (comprehension and expression) and Sociability (social relations). The score of the items is binary (1/0) depending on whether the acquisition evaluated is achieved or not. The development age (ED) is obtained from the sum of the items. The result of dividing the age of development by postmenstrual age is the development quotient (CD). This calculation is practiced both for the set of items on the scale (global development quotient) and for each of the areas (partial development quotients).
We have considered the value of the overall development quotient of less than 85 as the limit of normality, since it is a standard deviation below the expected development for its age.</description>
