      The purpose of this trial is to test a deescalated 3-fraction SBRT regimen to 45 Gy in 3
      fractions for centrally located thoracic tumors in a phase II trial. This will provide
      prospectively collected data on the safety and efficacy of a three-fraction regimen in the
      previously defined &quot;No Fly Zone&quot; for both primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and for
      lung metastases of any histology. This registration describes the design and eligibility
      criteria for the 60 NSLCsubjects the investigators plan to enroll. Local control,
      cancer-specific survival, and overall survival results from the NSCLC patients will be
      compared to both 3- and 5-fraction historical controls, specifically RTOG 0236 and 0813
      results.

      The outcomes of the metastatic patients will also be reported.

      There will also be a quality-of-life component to the study to assess the impact of a shorter
      overall treatment time and the clinical impact of radiation side effects.

    <description>QOL will be measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). Each item of this 30-item questionnaire is measured on a scale ranging from 1-4, with higher scores signaling lower quality of life. The total possible score is 120. Quality of life will be measured longitudinally, as one outcome. This outcome will be measured at baseline, on the last day of treatment and at 1, 4, 8, and 12 months post-treatment. Thereafter, quality of life will be measured every 6 months, up to 5 years.</description>
