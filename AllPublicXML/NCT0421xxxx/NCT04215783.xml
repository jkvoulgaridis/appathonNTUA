  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to study the relationship between childhood asthma,
      allergies, and early-life environmental factors that may cause childhood asthma and
      allergies. Previous birth cohort studies have found early-life environmental factors such as
      allergies, pollutants, viruses and bacteria have all contributed to the development of asthma
      and allergies. Investigators are doing this research because there continues to be a strong
      need to understand the root causes of asthma and allergies. The CANOE study is an
      observational cohort study, which means investigators are not asking participants or
      participant's child to change their medications and investigators will not be giving
      participants or participant's child a study drug.

      The CANOE study will provide an opportunity to collect novel longitudinal samples not
      available from the current CANOE birth cohorts, as well as enhanced and standardized
      environmental sampling in early life. One of the main goals of this study is to gather data
      and specimens, beginning in the prenatal periods, that will assess environmental exposures to
      toxins and microbes, and host characteristics including genetics, epigenetics, gene
      expression, the proteome and metabolome, microbial colonization and viral respiratory
      infections. The main study outcomes will be important interim conditions (e.g., recurrent
      wheeze, early multiple sensitization) that are highly associated with the development of
      asthma. Additional outcomes (perinatal outcomes, growth, neurocognitive development) will be
      collected as part of the collaborative Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes
      (ECHO)-wide Cohort Data Collection Protocol.

    <description>Number of children with AD will be reported. Atopic dermatitis, defined if at least 1 of the following is present:
Physician diagnosis of eczema/AD (either study physician or other physician by parental report) at any time,
Objective SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis) â‰¥ 8 at 1 or more study assessments. The range of the objective SCORAD lies between 0 and 83. Based on the objective SCORAD, the severity of AD can be classified into mild (&lt;15), moderate (between 15 and 40) and severe (greater than or equal to 40) AD.

      Cryopreserved samples of serum, plasma, urine, and nasal secretions or wash fluid, will be
      analyzed for proteins or metabolites that may serve as biomarkers for exposures or for study
      outcomes. A genetic sample (blood buffy coat or saliva) from the mother and child will be
      saved (if they agree) for use later to look at DNA, RNA or both.

        The study participants of CANOE will consist of four ethnically diverse cohorts from
        predominantly urban and suburban families at 4 sites. Previous studies have identified
        common themes in populations of children who differ by ethnicity and environmental
        exposures. These include inverse relationships between wheezing and/or atopy and exposure
        to specific microbes and allergens in early life. Obtaining prospective data from newly
        recruited participants during the prenatal period offers multiple opportunities to optimize
        sample collection for assessment of environmental exposures and enhance the scientific
        value of the CREW consortium. To enrich the cohort for the development of wheezing and
        allergic sensitization, we will enroll participants with a family history of asthma or
        allergies.

             parent or sibling (at least one shared biological parent) by parental report. The
             presence of paternal or sibling allergy or asthma will be ascertained by maternal
             report.

          3. Maternal age &gt; 18 years at the time of study enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Maternal HIV infection at time of delivery.

          2. Plans for the family to move out of the geographic area during the period of the
             study.

          3. Does not speak English.

          4. Maternal use of progesterone during pregnancy to prevent preterm birth.

          5. Past or current medical problems or findings from physical examination or laboratory
             testing which, in the opinion of the investigator or designee, may pose additional
             risks from participation in the study, may interfere with the participant's ability to
             comply with study requirements or that may impact the quality or interpretation of the
             data obtained from the study.
