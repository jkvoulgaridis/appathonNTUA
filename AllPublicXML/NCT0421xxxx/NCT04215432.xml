  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to perform the first clinical trial to evaluate the
      effectiveness of propolis extract, nanovitamin C and nanovitamin E gel as adjuvant to
      mechanical debridement in clinical and microbiological parameters of implants with
      peri-implant mucositis

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in bleeding on probing</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>It was present when it appeared bleeding at the gingival margin after recording probing depths at six sites in each implant. Modified bleeding index was also collected.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in probing depth</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>It was recorded at six sites of each implant with PM, using a probe with a force of 0.2N (PCV12; HuFriedy, Chicago, IL, EEUU).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in plaque index</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>It was recorded after using a disclosing dye, as the presence of dental plaque at the gingival margin at six sites in each implant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in microbilogical sample</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Microbiological samples were obtained at the deepest peri-implant pocket. Firstly, the area was isolated using cotton rolls and dried with a gentle air blow. Then, three sterile paper tips (#30, Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) were left for 10 seconds at the point with the greatest peri-implant pocket depth. Finally, the papers were introduced in a vial containing 1.5 ml of reduced transport fluid.
The vials were sent to the microbiology laboratory of the School of Dentistry, at Complutense University of Madrid for an anaerobic culture within 24 hours. Total counts and counts of target periodontal pathongens [Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, Parvimonas micra, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Capnocytophaga sp., Actinomyces odontolyticus] were determined after 7-14 days of anaerobic incubation. Then, those results were converted in colony-forming units per ml.</description>
