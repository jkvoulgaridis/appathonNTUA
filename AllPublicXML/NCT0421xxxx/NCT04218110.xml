             the 14-day washout conditioning period and during the test period

          3. Wear fabric softener, bug repellent or UV-treated clothing during the 14-day washout
             conditioning period and during the test period

          4. Receive an irritation score of 1 (any redness, swelling, rash, or dryness present at
             any treatment area) for any individual skin condition prior to the Treatment Day
             baseline sample collection

          5. Use of systemic or topical antibiotic medications, steroid medications (other than for
             hormonal contraception or post-menopausal reasons), or any other product known to
             affect the normal microbial flora of the skin during the 14-day washout conditioning
             period and during the test period

          6. Known allergies or sensitivities to vinyl, latex (rubber), alcohols, metals, inks, or
             tape adhesives, or to common antibacterial agents found in soaps, lotions, or
             ointments, particularly isopropyl alcohol or chlorhexidine gluconate

          7. A medical diagnosis of a physical condition, such as a current or recent severe
             illness, asthma, diabetes, hepatitis, an organ transplant, mitral valve prolapses,

          9. Any tattoos or scars within 2&quot; (5.08 cm) of the test sites

         10. Dermatoses, cuts, lesions, active skin rashes, or breaks or other skin disorders
             within 6&quot; on or around the test sites

         11. A currently active skin disease or inflammatory skin condition (for example, contact
             dermatitis) anywhere on the body that, in the opinion of the Consulting Physician or
             PI, would compromise subject safety or study integrity

         12. Showering, bathing, or swimming within the 72-hour period prior to sampling for
             Treatment Day, and throughout the test period

         13. Participation in another clinical study in the past 30 days or current participation
             in another clinical study at time of signing informed consent

         14. Any medical condition or use of any medications that, in the opinion of the PI, should
