    <measure>Number of Participants with Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgement, may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) are defined as any event that began or worsened in severity after the first dose of study drug.</description>
