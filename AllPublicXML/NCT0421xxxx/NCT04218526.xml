  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if DBS is a safe and effective therapy for
      severe freezing of gait in patients with Parkinson's Disease. Freezing of gait (FOG) is a
      particularly debilitating motor deficit seen in a subset of patients with Parkinson's Disease
      (PD).
