  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The occurrence of sepsis in trauma patients is a very serious complication. Identifying
      trauma patients at high risk of sepsis was not revealed in the latest surviving sepsis
      campaign in 2016. Several biomarkers have been proposed for early prediction of sepsis in
      trauma patients as leukocyte anti sedimentation rate (LAR) and the proinflammatory cytokine
      monocyte chemo attractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Sepsis prophylaxis before occurrence of
      multi-organ failure still represents a major challenge. Vitamin D and probiotics have
      antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and gut microbiota immune modulatory properties.Little is
      known about the effect of vitamin D and probiotics co-supplementation on the inflammatory
      response in trauma patients at high risk of sepsis.

      Another promising strategy is the use of vitamin C in addition to thiamine. Trauma is
      associated with increased oxidative stress and vitamin C deficiency. High dose vitamin C is
      required to restore oxidant-antioxidant balance. Vitamin C and thiamine have shown promising
      results in treatment of sepsis. Vitamin C possesses anti-inflammatory, endothelial protective
      and anti-microbial effects. Thiamine is the precursor of thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), a key
      enzyme in Krebs cycle.

      This study will investigate effect of vitamin D and probiotics versus Vitamin C and thiamine
      on inflammatory response (represented by change in MCP-1 level), Sequential Organ Failure
      Assessment (SOFA) Score and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) in
      trauma patients at high risk of sepsis. Secondary goal is to assess if the predictive ability
      of MCP-1 plus LAR to determine high risk of sepsis in major trauma intensive care patients
      and if there is correlation between LAR and MCP-1.
