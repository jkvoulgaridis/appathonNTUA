  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The zygomatic bone defines the anterior and lateral projection of the face and articulates
      with the frontal, sphenoid,temporal, and maxillary bones. The zygomatic complex is
      responsible for the protection of the orbital contents and the mid-facial contour. Fracture
      of the zygomatic complex is one of the most common facial injuries in maxillofacial trauma
      and predominately appears in young adult males. The etiology of zygomatic complex fractures
      primarily includes road traffic accidents, violent assaults, falls and sports injuries. The
      main clinical features of zygomatic complex fractures include diplopia, enophthalmos,
      subconjunctival ecchymosis, extraocular muscle entrapment, cosmetic deformity with depression
      of the malar eminence, malocclusion and neurosensory disturbances of the infraorbital nerve.
      Diagnosis of zygomatic complex fractures is usually clinical with confirmation by computed
      tomography (CT) scan. Zygomatic complex fractures with no or minimal displacement are often
      treated without surgical intervention, whereas fractures with functional or esthetic
      impairments often necessitate surgical intervention. Various surgical approaches and
      treatment strategies have been proposed to obtain successful treatment outcome, including the
      Gilles temporal approach, eyebrow, upper eyelid, transconjunctival, infraciliary lower
      eyelid, and intraoral vestibular approaches. The surgical approach for adequate reduction of
      zygomatic complex fractures must ensure a good functional and cosmetic result. Surgical
      reduction of zygomatic fractures by an intraoral surgical approach was first described in1909
      by Keen, and several studies have subsequently documented the treatment outcome after open
      reduction of zygomatic complex fractures by an intraoral surgical approach.

      This study is a prospective clinical intervention study where the admitted patients do lab
      investigation as CBC, coagulation profile ,Kidney function test and Imaging as CT
      maxillofacial with axial and coronal cuts. Patients will be assigned randomly into either one
      of the two groups under the study using concealed envelope. Under general anaesthesia with
      oral or naso-tracheal intubation, open reduction and internal fixation of tripod zygomatic
      fractures will be done using miniplates and screws at one point (zygomaticomaxillary area) or
      at two points (zygomaticomaxillary and frontozygomatic areas).
