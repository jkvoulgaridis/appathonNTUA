    <intervention_name>Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT)</intervention_name>
    <description>IMT is a breathing training technique customized to participant's breathing capacity. Using a handheld electronic manometer (Pro2Fit from Smithfield), a study personnel will initiate training at 40-60% maximal inspiratory pressure. Adjustments will be customized to where the participant reports a difficulty of training between 4-6 out of 10. Training sessions will be performed about 30 minutes a day for 28 consecutive days.</description>
