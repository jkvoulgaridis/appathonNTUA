  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The focus of the study is to identify children with word-finding difficulty and other speech
      and communication difficulties such as stuttering, a procedure referred to as screening.
      Ideally, investigators want to screen all children in the reception classes in the schools
      with which investigators work. The procedures were designed so that they work with children
      who speak English or those whose first language is not English. A second aim concerns what
      teachers can do when a child does not pass the screen. Investigators have developed a type of
      treatment designed for children who have either word-finding difficulty or fluency
      difficulty. This project concerns the intervention for children with word-finding difficulty.

      The treatment is conducted in a quiet room with pairs of children. The children with
      word-finding difficulty in each group are assessed individually for about 10 min before the
      treatment starts to establish a baseline for assessing improvement using a standardized task
      that tests for word-finding difficulty. A recording is taken, similar to that investigators
      obtained at the screening phase. The training takes place over three weeks (one session a
      week of 20-30 minutes' duration). Word-finding difficulty and fluency are reassessed at the
      end of the three-week period and at follow-up one week later.

      The focus of the study is to identify children with word-finding difficulty and other speech
      and communication difficulties such as stuttering, a procedure referred to as screening.
      Ideally, investigators want to screen all children in the reception classes in the schools
      with which investigators work. The procedures were designed so that they work with children
      who speak English or those whose first language is not English. A second aim concerns what
      teachers can do when a child does not pass the screen. Investigators have developed a type of
      treatment designed for children who have either word-finding difficulty or fluency
      difficulty. This project concerns the intervention for children with word-finding difficulty.

      The researcher will visit every participating child at school for approximately 10 minutes.
      Prior to that, the researcher will speak to the child's teacher to ensure that the sessions
      do not clash with any important class activities. Each child will be seen individually and
      will listen to a number of &quot;nonsense&quot; words one by one and will be asked to repeat the word.
      The child will be told that these are funny sounding made up word. The child will be
      audio-recorded while speaking to the researcher.

      Each audio recording is then analysed anonymously at UCL for signs of fluency or word finding
      difficulty. All children occasionally show these signs and they are not usually a cause of
      concern. Some parents are then invited to volunteer their child for the experimental
      word-finding training based on these results. This does not necessarily mean that they have
      word-finding problems (e.g. for children acting as controls). Separate information sheets
      indicating what this involves will be given to parents.

      Parents will also be given a link to a brief online questionnaire about the child's language
      history that they can fill out at their own time on their phone or computer. No identifiable
      information are collected and every parent will be assigned a number that matches the child's
      participation number. Only the researchers will have access to the questionnaire. There is no
      obligation on parents who have been contacted to have their children participate in the
      training.

    <description>This will be obtained to identify reception class children who have word finding difficulty (WFD) and fluency problems in schools. Samples of speech will be obtained to confirm children who have WFD or fluency difficulty.</description>

    <measure>Phonological Training</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The training procedure is delivered in a game form so that students can engage with and enjoy the test. All the following tests are conducted before and after training. Conversational speech samples are collected and analysed using a test for WFD (German, 1994) and one for fluency difficulty (Riley, 1994). Speech comprehension and letter sound knowledge tasks to assess educational impact.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Working Memory (WM) training</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This will involve three groups of children. For children with fluency difficulty, speech samples of about 10 minutes will be recorded before and at the end of WM training. Each speech sample will be assessed for %Stuttered Syllables (%SS) and Whole Word Repetition (%WWR) to obtain baseline measures and measurements following the intervention as well as in a follow up session. The intervention will be delivered to pairs of children. Two other groups of children who do not have fluency difficulty will take part either in a non-WM activity (group 1) using the same materials that will be used for the intervention group or the WM intervention (group 2).</description>
