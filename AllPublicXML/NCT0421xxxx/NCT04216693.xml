    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess if digoxin is safe and efficacious in treating
      patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) within the approved target range of 0.7 to
      1 ng/ml.

      This study is a phase II, open labeled, multi-center, prospective, randomized, placebo
      controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of digoxin in the treatment of
      nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The participants will take study drug digoxin, which is
      approved by FDA for the treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF), orally daily based on
      the body weight, titrated to the level of 0.7 to 1 ng/ml for total of 6 cycles (4
      weeks/cycle). A liver biopsy will be performed at the beginning of the study and 24 weeks
      after randomization to evaluate the efficacy of digoxin in the treatment of nonalcoholic
      steatohepatitis.

    <measure>Two point change in histological NAFLD activity score (NAS)</measure>

    <description>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease score (NAS) is a histological classification to assess the severity of liver steatosis, lobular inflammation and ballooning in the liver biopsy, which ranges from 0-8 with the increase in number representing a worse outcome. Therefore, the efficacy improvement was to be at least 2 points in lowering the score.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of subjects with at least a 30% change in % steatosis relative to screening</measure>

    <description>Liver steatosis is graded based on the percentage of fat within the hepatocytes: grade 0 (healthy, &lt;5%), grade 1 (mild, 5%-33%), grade 2 (moderate, 34%-66%), and grade 3 (severe, &gt;66%). the efficacy improvement was to be proportion of subjects with at least a 30% decrease in % steatosis relative to screening.</description>
