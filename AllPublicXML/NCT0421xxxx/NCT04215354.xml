  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The relationship between fatigue and balance was established. Fatigue was correlated with 8
      parameters of balance scales. Moreover, there was a strong correlation between the level of
      fatigue from one side and depression, quality of life and disease severity from the other
      side.Fatigue seems to be the main problem in patients with MS which may influence other signs
      and symptoms such as balance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Electromagnetic field significantly reduced fatigue level in patients with MS.This effect
      reflected significantly on other symptoms such as balance, depression, disease severity and
      the quality of life in those patients.

      Virtual reality program significantly improving balance and balance perception .Virtual
      reality program also improved quality of life by improving general health, physical function
      and decreasing physical limitation significantly. However, Virtual reality programs did not
      improve fatigue.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Fatigue Impact Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>It is a 21 items standardized questionnaire. Each item has five levels of response (range from 0 - 4). The total score ranges from 0 (no impact of fatigue) better condition to 84 (maximum impact of fatigue)worse condition.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Berg Balance Scale (BBS)range from 0(worse condition) to 56(better condition)</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>balance confidence</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Activities- specific Balance Confidence scale .it is 16 items ofvisual analogue scale from 0-100%.score from 0 minimum confidence (worse condition) to 1600 maximum score (better condition).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression (Beck depression inventory ii (BDI-II))</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>It is 21 questions with each item range from 0 (normal) to 3 (most severe) with a maximum score of 63 (worse condition).The total score of the scale was used to classify patients as follows: normal (1-10), mild mood disturbance (11-16), border line of depression (17-20), moderate depression (21-30), severe depression (31-40), extreme depression (over 40)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Static balance using posturography,</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>stability levels range from 1 to 10, with 10 being the most stable or least difficult to perform. Static balance was measured at three different levels of stability; high level 8, medium 5 and low level 2. These levels where chosen to test patient balance on varying degree of instability.Patient who was unable to do the test due to sever balance impairment was given a score of 5000 based on the manufacturer recommendations in the machine manual (maximum score can subject got) which mean sever imbalance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life measurement (Short Form 36 (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores as vitality (energy/fatigue), physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, and physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning and mental health.each item is scored from 0-100 for total 1800. The lower the score the more the disability. The higher the score the less disability.</description>

    <arm_group_label>HEALTHY SUBJECT</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>healthy subjects with age, gender and BMI matched with the patients with MS were recruited to participate in the study. This group was recruited to establish the normal balance and fatigue parameters. Subjects in this group sign the consent form of healthy subjects and all measurement was taken as balance, fatigue, depression, quality of life and urinary incontinence screening questionnaire.</description>
