  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) following cardiac surgery for congenital heart defects (CHD) in
      children affects up to 60% of high risk-patients and is a major cause of both short- and
      long-term morbidity and mortality. Despite effort, to date, no successful therapeutic agent
      has gained widespread success in preventing this postoperative decline in renal function.
      Nitric oxide is an intricate regulator of acute inflammation and coagulation and is a potent
      vasodilator. The investigators hypothesize that nitric oxide, administered during
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), may reduce the incidence of AKI.
