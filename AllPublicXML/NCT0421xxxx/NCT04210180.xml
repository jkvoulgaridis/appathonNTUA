  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label study will explore the impact of varenicline on the process of switching from
      combustible cigarettes (CC) to an e-cigarette. Varenicline is currently the most efficacious
      single pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation, and through its actions as an agonist or
      partial agonist at various nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes, serves to diminish the
      rewarding effects of cigarette smoking. Diminishing the rewarding effects of smoking might
      facilitate the transition from CC to e-cigarettes. On the other hand, varenicline might
      attenuate the rewarding effects of nicotine-containing e-cigarettes as well, which could
      hamper the transition. Thus, the study will provide important information about the actions
      of varenicline on CC as well as e-cigarettes. There is no therapeutic intent in that smokers'
      nicotine/tobacco dependence will not be treated; the goal is to switch from one form of
      nicotine/tobacco dependence (CC) to dependence on a different tobacco product (e-cigarettes).

    <description>Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) use to evaluate vascular changes when smokers change from cigarettes to e-cigarettes over a 13-week period. Measurements will be obtained using a manual sphygmomanometer and an 8- to 10- MHz doppler ultrasound probe. Subjects will undergo this testing at Visit 1 (baseline data) and at the end of study (Visit 7).</description>

    <description>Participants enrolled in the study will receive a G6 e-cigarette at V2 for ad libitum use. The FDA approved starter kit of varenicline will be provided to participants at V3 (0.5 mg nightly for days 1-3, then 0.5 mg twice daily for days 4-7) along with additional G6 cartomizers. After the first week of varenicline, participants will receive the FDA-approved standard dose of varenicline (1 mg twice daily) and will continue to receive enough G6 cartomizers for the next 11 weeks.</description>
