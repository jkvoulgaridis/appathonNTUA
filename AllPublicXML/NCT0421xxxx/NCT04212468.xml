      Hypertension is the most common chronic diseases and a most important risk factor for
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and also a substantial public health problem.
      Home blood pressure monitoring is simple, not only can find hypertension, but also can guide
      the treatment of patients with hypertension. The purpose of the study is to investigate the
      association between home blood pressure and adverse outcomes in community elderly population.

      Study population includes subjects who living in community, of any race or ethnicity, 65 or
      older years of age, and have provided written informed consent to provide home blood pressure
      monitoring at one or more study visits.

      Physical examination, questionnaire survey and biological sample collection will be conducted
      at baseline and the incidence of a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events will be
      investigated during follow-up.
