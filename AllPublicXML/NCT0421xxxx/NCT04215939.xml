  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI), causes loss of supra-spinal control of the sympathetic nervous
      system and in some cases loss of sensation. As a result, people with SCI have impaired
      thermoregulatory system and the consequence of this thermoregulatory dysfunction, is that
      they cannot respond to the environmental changes. All the above lead to dysregulation in
      vasomotor tone, skeletal muscle shivering and sweating dysfunction. It is well known that
      skin plays an important role in regulating body temperature and regulates interactions
      between the environment and human body. A previous study in people with incomplete SCI showed
      that there are no differences in core temperature between patients with different level of
      mobility and sensation and different level of lesion, but there are significant differences
      in skin temperature. As mentioned above people with SCI have an impaired thermoregulatory
      capacity due to sudomotor and vasomotor dysfunction and that leads to greater thermal strain
      during rest and exercise when they expose to hot conditions. A previous study that performed
      exercise in people with SCI, highlights the fact that because of the impaired evaporative
      heat loss during exercise in hot conditions, they are in great risk. Because of this risk
      they propose different cooling strategies that promote evaporation such as fans and water
      spraying. It is therefore important to observe the thermoregulatory function (vasomotion and
      sudomotor) in people with SCI when they are exposed to different environments (cold, neutral
      and warm).

      The participants will visit the laboratory three times. At each time the environmental
      chamber will simulate a different environment in a random order for each participant. The
      three different environments will be as follow:

        1. Cold environment 15-17°C and 40-50% relative humidity

        2. Thermoneutral environment 22-24°C and 40-50% relative humidity

        3. Warm environment 33-35°C and 40-50% relative humidity The participants will stay in a
           sited position for 20 minutes in order to collect baseline data and to allow to their
           blood flow and body temperature adapt to the exposing environmental condition each time.
           Immediately after the baseline period the participants will immerse their left hand and
           foot in warm water (34-36°C) for 5 minutes for a consistent starting (hand and foot)
           temperature. Following that participants will immerse their hand and foot in cold water
           (8°C) for 40 minutes. This procedure will be repeated in every measurement and it will
           only change the environment.

      Anthropometric data [self-reported age, self-reported body stature and body mass (DXA, Lunar,
      GE Healthcare Boston, Massachusetts, U.S)] will be collecting at the beginning of the first
      measurement. Medical history of all the participants will be recording. During the study,
      continuous heart rate (Polar Team2. Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland), core temperature
      (telemetric capsules BodyCap, Caen, France), mean skin temperature (wireless thermistors
      iButtons type DS1921H, Maxim/Dallas Semiconductor Corp., USA), finger temperature
      ((Smartreader 8 Plus, ACR, Vancouver, Canada), skin blood flow and sweat rate data (laser
      Doppler flow-meter PeriFlux System 5010, function unit; Perimed, Stockholm, Sweden and
      PeriFlux System 4002, master unit, satellite unit; Perimed, Stockholm, Sweden) will be
      collecting. Blood pressure will also be monitoring every 10 minutes with an automatic
      sphygmomanometer (Omron Healthcare M6 comfort, Japan). Skin temperature data will be
      collecting from four sites (chest, arm, thigh, and leg) and will be expressed as mean skin
      temperature according to the formula of Ramanathan (Tsk = [0.3(chest + arm) + 0.2(thigh +
      leg)]. Questionnaires (thermal sensation scale: -3 = cold; +3 = hot) will be used to assess
      participants' thermal comfort/sensation and pain.

    <description>Sweat rate will be measured using a 5.0-cm2 ventilated capsule placed over the forehead and the gastrocnemius. Anhydrous compressed air will be passing through the capsule and over the skin surface (Brooks 5850, mass flow controller, Emerson Electric, Hetfield, PA, USA). The vapor density of the effluent air will be calculating from the relative humidity and temperature measured using the Omega HX93 humidity and temperature sensor (Omega Engineering, Stanford, CT, USA). Sweat rate will be defined as the product of the difference in water content between effluent and influent air and the flow rate. The flow rate through the capsule is 1.13 L min-1. The sweat rate value will be adjusted for skin surface area under the capsule (expressed in mg min-1 cm-2).</description>
