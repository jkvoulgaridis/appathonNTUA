  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myopia is a common cause of vision loss, being particularly prevalent in children in East and
      Southeast Asia. The investigators will assess prevalence and incidence of myopia, identify
      digital biomarkers associated with myopia, and validate algorithms for the detection and/or
      predition of myopia and other ocular abnormalities in school-aged children in both urban and
      rural settings in Southern China.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myopia is a common cause of vision loss, being particularly prevalent in East and Southeast
      Asia. It is still not entirely clear whether and how visual experience in an urban
      environment with less outdoor exposure could have an impact on the development and
      progression of myopia. Zhaoqing has a relatively stable population of 4,084,600, which are
      representative of the Chinese population in term of demographic and socioeconomic
      characteristics.

      Therefore, the investigators will conduct a longitudinal cohort study in both urban and rural
      settings to examine prevalence and incidence of myopia, identify digital biomarkers
      associated with myopia, and validate algorithms for the detection and/or predition of
      incidence and progression of myopia and other ocular abnormalities in school-aged children in
      Zhaoqing.
