      This phase Ib/II trial studies the best dose of carboplatin when given together with M6620,
      gemcitabine and avelumab and to see how well it works in treating patients with stage IV
      squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer. M6620 may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Chemotherapy drugs, such as carboplatin
      and gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy
      with monoclonal antibodies, such as avelumab, may help the body's immune system attack the
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving M6620
      together with carboplatin, gemcitabine, and avelumab may work better in treating patients
      with squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer compared to carboplatin, gemcitabine, and
      avelumab alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of carboplatin in combination with
      berzosertib (M6620) and gemcitabine/avelumab, in patients with squamous cell non-small cell
      lung cancer (Sq-NSCLC). (Lead-in Phase 1B) II. To compare progression-free survival (PFS) of
      carboplatin/gemcitabine/avelumab with and without M6620 in patients with Sq-NSCLC, as
      measured by a hazard ratio in an intent-to-treat analysis. (Phase 2)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare progression-free survival (PFS) of carboplatin/gemcitabine/avelumab with and
      without M6620 in patients with Sq-NSCLC, as measured by a hazard ratio in an as-treated
      analysis.

      II. To compare PFS of carboplatin/gemcitabine/avelumab with and without M6620 in patients
      with ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-deficient Sq-NSCLC, as measured by a hazard ratio.

      III. To compare overall survival (OS) and overall response rate (ORR) of
      carboplatin/gemcitabine/avelumab with and without M6620, in patients with chemotherapy-naive
      Sq-NSCLC.

      IV. To determine the systemic drug exposure of M6620 and gemcitabine, as correlates of
      efficacy and toxicity.

      V. To determine the safety and tolerability of M6620 in combination with
      carboplatin/gemcitabine/avelumab.

      VI. To observe and record anti-tumor activity.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify molecular subpopulations of patients who have increased sensitivity to the
      M6620/carboplatin/gemcitabine/avelumab combination.

      II. To explore the prognostic and predictive qualities of the ATM immunohistochemistry (IHC)
      assay for clinical response and PFS.

      III. To explore inflammation-associated gene signatures and clinical response.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose de-escalation study of carboplatin followed by a phase II
      study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive avelumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and gemcitabine
      hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Patients also receive carboplatin IV over
      30 minutes on day 1 and berzosertib IV over 60 minutes on days 2 and 9. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients also receive avelumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 8 and berzosertib
      IV over 60 minutes on days 2 and 9. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 9 months in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive avelumab alone
      IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 8. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 1 more year in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive avelumab, gemcitabine hydrochloride, and carboplatin as in Arm A.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 months.

          -  Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of
             treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac
             function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be
             eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better

          -  Patients must be willing to comply with birth control requirements: The effects of the
             agents in this study (or similar agents) on the developing human fetus are either
             unknown, or known to be teratogenic, embryotoxic, and fetotoxic in mice and rabbits.
             For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 6 months after completing
             treatment administration. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her
             treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also
             agree to avoid donating sperm for during the study period, and to use adequate
             contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and for 6
             months after completion completing treatment administration

          -  Patients must have the ability to understand and willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document. Participants with impaired decision-making capacity who
             have a legally-authorized representative and/or family member available will also be
             eligible

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with severe intercurrent illness or comorbidity are not eligible

          -  Patients with contraindications to immunotherapy (e.g., solid organ transplant or
             active autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppressant therapy within 2 years of
             enrollment) are not eligible

          -  Patients with prior systemic chemotherapy for metastatic disease are not eligible

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents are not eligible

          -  Patients with a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar
             chemical or biologic composition to M6620, avelumab, gemcitabine, carboplatin, or
             other agents used in study are not eligible

          -  Patients with severe bone marrow depression or significant bleeding are not eligible

          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements are not eligible

          -  M6620 is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4; therefore, concomitant administration with
             strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, HCV and
             HIV protease inhibitors, nefazodone, posaconazole, telithromycin, voriconazole) or
             strong inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g. carbamazepine, rifampin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, St.
             John's wort) should be avoided. Because the lists of these agents are constantly
             changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference.
             As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled
             on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need
             to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or
             herbal product

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the agents in this study may have
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with the study agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is
             treated with the study agents M6620, avelumab, gemcitabine, or carboplatin

          -  M6620 should be used with caution in patients with clinical evidence of germline
             defects in their deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage repair pathway (for example,
             patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome or ataxia telangiectasia) due to a possible
             increase in the toxicity of DNA-damaging agents when paired with M6620

          -  Patients must not have received or be scheduled to receive radiation therapy within 7
             days or less from gemcitabine administration
