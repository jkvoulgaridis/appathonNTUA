    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to:

        1. Investigate a possible association between microalbuminuria and infection by H. pylori
           in type 2 diabetic patients.

        2. Investigate the effect of previous and active infection of H. pylori on microalbuminuria
           in type 2 diabetic patients.

      Helicobacter pylori, previously known as Campylobacter pylori, is a gram-negative,
      microaerophilic bacterium usually found in the stomach. It was identified in 1982 by
      Australian scientists Barry Marshall and Robin Warren, who found that it was present in a
      person with chronic gastritis, gastric ulcers and conditions not previously believed to have
      a microbial cause. It is also linked to the development of duodenal ulcers and stomach
      cancer. However, over 80% of individuals infected with the bacterium are asymptomatic, and it
      may play an important role in the natural stomach ecology. [1] More than 50% of the world's
      population have H. pylori in their upper gastrointestinal tract. [2] Infection is more common
      in developing countries than Western countries. [3] H. pylori's helical shape (from which the
      genus name derives) is thought to have evolved to penetrate the mucoid lining of the stomach.
      [4, 5] Microalbuminuria, which is defined as an increased urinary albumin to creatinine ratio
      (UACR) of 30-300 μg/mg .[15] Has been known to be a strong predictor of the development of
      diabetic nephropathy. [16] It has also been demonstrated that microalbuminuria is a risk
      factor for cardiovascular disease in the general and diabetic populations. [17-19] and the
      increased urinary leakage of albumin reflects vascular damage, i.e., endothelial dysfunction
      or low grade chronic inﬂammation. [20] In addition, some studies have reported a relationship
      between microalbuminuria and metabolic syndrome, suggesting that insulin resistance underlies
      the pathogenesis of microalbuminuria. [21-23]

    <description>ELISA Principle. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISAs) combine the specificity of antibodies with the sensitivity of simple enzyme assays, by using antibodies or antigens coupled to an easily-assayed enzyme. ELISAs can provide a useful measurement of antigen or antibody concentration.</description>
