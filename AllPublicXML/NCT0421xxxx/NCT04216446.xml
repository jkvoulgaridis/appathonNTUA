  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A parallel group randomized controlled trial that will evaluate the effectiveness of a mobile
      health (m-Health) application on influencing diet, supplement use and lifestyle during
      pregnancy. Pregnant women will be randomly assigned to the intervention and the control arm.
      Intervention arm will receive free of cost m-Health application that will screen on diet,
      supplement use and lifestyle at enrollment and at 4 follow-up, each 6 weeks apart and will
      provide recommendation based on an algorithm developed using World Health Organization's
      guidelines on nutrition during pregnancy. The control arm will receive standard counseling.
      The changes in diet of the both group will be assessed using Dietary Risk Score. The
      secondary outcomes include evaluation of compliance and usability of the m-Health
      application. Also, the effect of m-Health application on maternal, fetal and infant outcomes
      will be assessed. A subset of sample from the intervention and the control group will be
      offered free of cost biochemical tests to assess the objective nutritional status.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A parallel group randomized controlled trial will be implemented with pregnant women at the
      antenatal clinics of the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) Karachi. Pregnant women in their
      first trimester, registered or planning to register at AKUH with access to smartphones with
      internet connection will be considered eligible for the study. For pregnant women in the
      intervention arm, mobile health application will be provided in their smartphones that will
      screen on their socio-demographic characteristics, diet and supplement use and lifestyle
      habits. Based on the data gathered, recommendations and a dietary risk score will be
      generated upon completion of the screening questionnaire. The similar process will be
      repeated on 4 follow-ups, each 6 weeks apart after enrollment in the study. Also, push
      notifications will be sent to women maximum 3 times a week on dietary and lifestyle advice.
      The women in the control arm will be provided with standard counseling using the educational
      pamphlet of the Aga Khan University Hospital &quot;Diet during Pregnancy&quot;. The primary outcome of
      the study is improvement in the dietary and supplement use that will be assessed through
      Dietary Risk Score. The secondary outcomes include assessing the compliance and usability of
      m-Health application among the pregnant women enrolled in the intervention arm. Other
      secondary outcomes include evaluating the effect of m-Health coaching on maternal, fetal and
      infant outcomes among pregnant women and infant born to women in the intervention arm
      compared to women and infants born to women who received standard counseling respectively.

    <time_frame>10 months, from enrollment till last follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure will be change in dietary intake and supplement use between baseline and the follow-up visits. The information about diet, supplement use will be collected on the screening questionnaire. A Dietary Risk Score (DRS) will be developed to evaluate the diet of the participants. Dietary risk score (DRS) will be calculated based on consumption of food items from six main food groups (bread/wheat, fruits, vegetables, meat and fish, milk and dairy products and oil and fats). Each subject will get one point for every food group if consumed less than recommended amount. Hence, the dietary score will range from 0-6 and a score of 6 will indicate highly inadequate diet. The algorithm for scoring the diet has been developed using the standard guidelines of World Health Organization for Diet during Pregnancy.</description>

    <description>Eligible pregnant women would be randomized to intervention or the control arm after consenting to participate. Participant in the intervention arm will receive free subscription of web-based m-Health program for a six months. The program will provide individualized coaching on diet, supplement use and lifestyle. Participants would undergo dietary screening at five points i.e. at baseline and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks follow-up to monitor the improvement (if any) in diet. Women will receive advice in the form of recommendations after completion of the screening questionnaire. Also, individual coaching in the form of push messages containing tips and recommendations for diet and lifestyle would be delivered a maximum of three times a week. Furthermore, a subset of participants would undergo objective dietary assessment through biochemical testing of serum folate, serum ferritin, and serum calcium and serum vitamin D at baseline and at end line.</description>
