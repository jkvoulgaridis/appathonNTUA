  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of macitentan at steady state on the
      pharmacokinetic (PK) of a single dose of riociguat and sildenafil (Part A); and rosuvastatin
      and tadalafil (Part B) when co-administered to healthy male participants under fasted
      conditions.
