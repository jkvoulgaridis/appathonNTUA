      This is a Phase 1, first in human (FIH), randomised, active-controlled, double-blind study
      designed to assess the safety and tolerability and explore preliminary efficacy of the EG-HZ
      vaccine. Oversight will be provided by a Safety Review Committee (SRC).

      Subjects will undergo a Screening period beginning up to 28 days prior to randomisation, the
      first of two vaccinations administered 2 months apart, pre- and post-dose assessment,
      follow-up visits, and an end of study (EOS) or early termination (ET) visit (as applicable).

      Subjects will be randomised prior to vaccination on Day 1, to one (1) of five (5) treatment
      groups.

         24. Any person who is initially excluded from study participation based on one or more of
             the time-limited exclusion criteria (e.g., acute illness) may be considered for
