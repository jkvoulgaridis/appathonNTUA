  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are increased in children on conventional
      haemodialysis. Haemodiafiltration (HDF) is a newer type of dialysis which has two main types
      (post-dilution and predilution HDF). Post-dilution HDF is associated with better vascular
      health, blood pressure and growth in children. Furthermore, pre-dilution HDF is shown to
      remove a wider spectrum of uremic toxin compared to post-dilution HDF in adults. The
      investigators need more data to define the optimum dialysis modality for children.

      Hypothesis: In children with end stage kidney disease pre-dilution HDF (pre-HDF) achieves
      improved clearances across a wide molecular weight range compared to post-dilution HDF
      (post-HDF).

      Plan of Investigation: Prevalent patients on thrice weekly HD or HDF who have a single pool
      Kt/v&gt;1.2 will be randomized in to either study arm A (pre-HDF, post-HDF) or B (post-HDF,
      pre-HDF) after a conditioning period on post-HDF. Dialysis prescription will be kept constant
      during study periods including blood flow, dialysate flow, dialysate content, filter type and
      size. Pre-dialysis and post-dialysis bloods will be drawn at baseline and at the end of each
      treatment with either modality. Reduction ratios of small and middle molecular weight toxins
      and protein bound toxins as well as markers of inflammation and nutrition will be compared
      between two modalities. Assessment of blood pressure (ambulatory blood pressure monitoring)
      and patient wellbeing (questionnaire) will be performed at the end of each period.

      Children will be recruited from paediatric dialysis units in London, Istanbul Heidelberg and
      Lyon with extension to other centres to be confirmed.

      Outcomes: If the results of this study demonstrate better clearance with pre-dilution HDF
      compared to post-dilution HDF, this will inform a future long-term outcome study comparing
      different HDF modalities and will contribute to define optimum dialysis modality for
      children.
