  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn about different approaches to promoting
      healthy growth among infants, and understanding parents' likes and dislikes of an approach to
      reducing risk factors for obesity later in life. The study includes filling out some forms
      with questions about your baby and your thoughts about your baby's growth and health, and
      engaging in a pattern of changes in or prevention of risk factors in the first year of life.
      Parents will receive information about changes and some tools and materials to take home with
      them. Some parents may receive phone calls between visits as well. The study takes place from
      soon after birth through the infant's age of 9 months. The estimated total time of
      interaction between the study staff and parents during the study period is 4 hours.
