  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open label, single-site, dose-escalation study in up to 50
      participants with relapse/refractory B-ALL and NHL. This study aims to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of the treatment with Quikin CD19-CART.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Quikin CD19-CART is a kind of chimeric antigen T cell targeting CD19 with both CD19-CAR gene
      integration and also PD1 knockout by one-step gene-editing. After completion of study
      treatment, subject participation for this study will be followed up to 15 years after
      completion of study treatment.
