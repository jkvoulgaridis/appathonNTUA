  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound (US) image construction uses equations that contain the value of the propagation
      velocity of sound waves; this velocity is assumed conventionally to be constant and equal to
      1540 m/s in the human body. Since 1977, all manufacturers of US scanners have used this
      value, which was first established in 1950. In fatty tissue, however, the actual propagation
      velocity is only in the order of 1450 m/s. US velocity in fat tissue is slower than in other
      soft tissues (ie:1450 m/s vs 1540 m/s) therefore the intrinsic image quality in terms of
      sharpness and precision is improved when considering this parameter for image construction
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of ultrasound propagation velocity
      setting on completeness of ultrasound exams and images quality during the second and third
      trimester fetal ultrasound examination in obese patients.

      Obese pregnant women will be included before the second trimester fetal ultrasound
      examination.

      Women will be allocated to one intervention group or to the control group. In the
      intervention group, the ultrasonographer will be able to use several ultrasound propagation
      velocities to perform the exam.

      In the control group, exam will be performed using the conventional ultrasound velocity.

      An exam will be considered to be complete if all the images recommended by national guideline
      are acquired. If ultrasound images are missing, other ultrasound exams may be performed until
      completeness is reached.

      The protocol will be applied for the second and the third fetal ultrasound examination which
      are recommended by national guideline.

      All scans will be evaluated by two independent experts who do not have performed any of the
      exams. They will evaluate the completeness of each exam. Each scan will be quoted using the
      quality score proposed by Salomon et al.
