      Introduction: Femoral and acetabular replacement is characterized as total hip arthroplasty
      (THA). It has been used as treatment of various pathologies of this joint. In the
      postoperative period, some studies have shown that strength, function, range of motion and
      lower limb mechanics remains altered for more than One year after THA in relation to the
      non-operated side. However, studies that have correlated kinematics and hip muscle strength
      in individuals who underwent THA for long time, do not exist in literature. Objective: to
      evaluate lower limb muscle strength and 2D kinematics during stair ascending and descending
      in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. Methods: Third individuals who underwent total
      hip arthroplasty (THA) will be recruited at two, five and 10 year postoperative periods. They
      were allocated in three groups: Group 1 (10n), subjects submitted to THA for two years, Group
      2 (10n) subjects submitted to THA for five years, Group 3 (10n) subjects submitted to THA for
      10 years and Group 4 (10n) subjects without orthopaedic afections, all will be evaluated for
      dynamometric isometric muscle strength and kinematic analysis of stair ascending and
      descending by a &quot;blinded&quot; physical Therapist.
