  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational trial seeks to assess the feasibility of using non-invasive, portable,
      real-time body-worn sensors to continuously monitor, quantify, and interpret recovery during
      inpatient treatment of stroke

      OBJECTIVES:

      Aim 1: Assess the feasibility of continuous long-term monitoring of inpatients with stroke
      using wearable sensors.

      The investigators will obtain quantitative health data from research-grade, wireless,
      wearable sensors (including MC10 BioStampRC) on individuals with subacute and chronic stroke
      in the inpatient setting, as well as healthy controls.

      The investigators will specifically check for variability in device data, as well as
      consistency and periodicity of sensor readings across the clinical study period. The
      investigators will analyze test-retest reliability and inter-rater reliability of using the
      wearable sensor technology for clinical and monitoring applications. Furthermore, the
      investigators will determine whether the sensors can distinguish biometric and activity
      characteristics between healthy controls and individuals with stroke.

      Aim 2: Quantify upper and lower extremity movement impairments, mobility-related activities,
      speech and swallowing activities, and clinical parameters during stroke recovery.

      The investigators will obtain continuous biometric and movement-based sensor data for
      clinical symptoms (e.g., muscle activation, heart rate variability, talk time, and gait
      quality) during the performance of validated clinical tests and during general inpatient
      activities (e.g., therapy, eating, and sleeping).

      The investigators will compare device data with clinically validated measures of movement and
      language function, such as the Modified Ashworth Scale or Western Aphasia Battery. The
      investigators will describe variation of device data in subgroups of subjects defined by
      clinician assessed clinically validated measures (10-Meter Walk Test, Mini-Mental Status
      Exam, etc.). The investigators will also assess the ability of the sensors to capture
      response to treatment, such as movement therapy, speech therapy, medication, and Botox by
      comparing sensor data before and after treatment. The investigators will provide evidence
      about the degree to which the measured variables are intercorrelated. Lastly, the
      investigators will evaluate and compare the state of recovery between patients at time of
      discharge using sensor-based outcomes.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in 10-Meter Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>10-Meter Walk Test speed will be assessed at study admission (Day 1) and approximately at discharge from hospital (on average, Day 17), and the change in speeds will be recorded.</time_frame>
    <description>The 10-Meter Walk Test assesses subject walking speed in meters per second for 10 meters. Subjects will repeat the test three times and the average speed will be recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in 6 Minute Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Minute Walk Test distance will be assessed at study admission (Day 1) and approximately at discharge from hospital (on average, Day 17), and the change in distance will be recorded.</time_frame>
    <description>The 6 minute walk test is performed as an objective evaluation of functional exercise capacity. The test measures the distance that the patient can walk on a flat, hard surface, indoors, in a period of 6 minutes. The walk test is patient self-paced and assesses the level of functional capacity. Patients are allowed to stop and rest during the test, however, the timer does not stop. If the patient is unable to complete the time, the time stopped is noted and reason for stopping prematurely is recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Timed Up and Go</measure>
    <time_frame>Time Up and Go will be assessed at study admission (Day 1) and approximately at discharge from hospital (on average, Day 17), and the change in time will be recorded.</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed Up and Go is a timed test used to assess mobility, balance, and walking in people with balance impairments. The subject must stand up from a chair (which should not be leaned up against a wall), walk a distance of 3 meters, turn around, walk back to the chair and sit down - all performed as quickly and as safely as possible.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Berg Balance Test</measure>
    <time_frame>The Berg Balance Test score will be assessed at study admission (Day 1) and approximately at discharge from hospital (on average, Day 17), and the change in score will be recorded.</time_frame>
    <description>The Berg Balance Test is a standardized 14-item objective measure of postural stability and static balance; it is an established fall predictor in adults. Balance is measured during various tasks on a 5 point scale, ranging from 0-4. &quot;0&quot; indicates the lowest level of function and &quot;4&quot; the highest level of function, with a total possible score of 56. A score of 20 or less indicates a high fall risk.</description>
