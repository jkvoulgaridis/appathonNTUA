    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the association between a modified carbohydrate diet,
      quality of life and glycaemic control in Australian adults with T1DM. The first phase of the
      study will develop and validate a diabetes specific quality of life questionnaire for adults
      with T1DM. The second phase will undertake a modified carbohydrate diet intervention and
      examine its association with quality of life and glycaemic control, pre and post the dietary
      intervention. The novel outcomes will include a new validated Australian T1DM specific
      quality of life questionnaire and an investigation as to whether a modified carbohydrate diet
      mediates the relationship between quality of life and glycaemic control in Australian adults
      with T1DM.

      Phase 1:

      Aim: To develop a reliable and valid diabetes specific quality of life questionnaire for use
      in Australian adults living with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).

      Objectives:

        1. To develop a new Australian diabetes specific quality of life online questionnaire
           integrating participant feedback using a one to one interview method;

        2. Pilot the study developed online questionnaire with adults that have type 1 diabetes
           mellitus and

        3. Conduct factorial validation of the study developed online questionnaire using advanced
           statistical modelling techniques.

      Phase 2:

      Aim: The aim of this study is to examine the association between a modified carbohydrate
      diet, quality of life and glycaemic control in adults living with T1DM.

      Objectives:

        1. To examine the association between quality of life and glycaemic control in adults with
           T1DM;

        2. Implement a modified carbohydrate diet in a cohort of adults living with T1DM;

        3. Examine the association between a modified carbohydrate diet and glycaemic control in
           adults with T1DM: pre and post intervention;

        4. Examine the association between quality of life and a modified carbohydrate in adults
           with T1DM: pre and post intervention and

        5. Investigate whether a modified carbohydrate diet mediates the relationship between
           quality of life and glycaemic control in adults with T1DM.
