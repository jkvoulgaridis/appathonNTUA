  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to evaluate strategies to reduce unused opioids
      prescribed for pediatric acute post-surgical pain management.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prescription opioids are abused by an estimated 12.5 million Americans, and accidental opioid
      overdose is the leading cause of injury death in the US. Many of these drugs originate from
      leftover prescription opioids related to postoperative overprescribing, lack of proper
      disposal, and unsafe home storage. Governmental guidelines indicate that leftover
      prescription opioids should be preferentially returned to a drug take back site; however,
      many people do not utilize these programs due to travel distance, lack of transportation, or
      other factors.

      The aims are to quantify the amount of unused opioids in the home following painful pediatric
      surgical procedures, investigate the impact of formal interventions on disposal of residual
      opioids in the home following these surgeries, and to identify current behaviors of
      adolescents and their family members in the handling of unused prescribed opioids.

    <description>Assess average daily pain scores for patients undergoing painful surgeries in the perioperative period and following discharge from the hospital. This will be obtained through numerical report on study specific calendar. Numerical values are reported as a minimum of zero and a maximum of 10 on the Numerical Rating Scale. 0 corresponds with no pain, 1 with lower pain, and 10 corresponds with the most severe pain.</description>

    <description>Assess the frequency of daily oxycodone consumption and correlate consumption with self reported pain scores. This measure will ask for a self-reported numerical frequency of daily opioid medication use. When this medication is used, we ask patients to rate their pain on the Numerical rating Scale from 0 to 10. Zero corresponds with no pain, 10 corresponds with the most severe pain.</description>
