  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present project aims to investigate the effects of high-quality protein (whey protein)
      vs. low-quality protein (collagen) on muscle mass and function (e.g., strength and power)
      during a 10-wk resistance training program in young adults. It will be tested the hypothesis
      that leucine-matched collagen should promote similar gains on muscle function and mass
      compared to whey protein supplementation.

      The purpose of this study will be to investigate the effects of whey protein vs.
      leucine-matched collagen supplementation on muscle mass and function after a 10-wk resistance
      training program. Initially, all participants will be submitted for a 2-wk familiarization
      period, and then randomized into two groups (N = 11 / group): whey protein group and
      leucine-matched collagen group. The following variables will be assessed from pre-to
      post-training: anthropometric, muscle thickness from vastus lateralis and biceps brachii
      muscles using ultrasound, training load, mean power and peak torque for unilateral arm
      flexion exercise using a isokinetic dynamometer, countermovement vertical jump, nutritional
      intake, and testosterone-to-cortisol ratio . Shapiro-Wilk and Levine tests will be used to
      test the normality and homogeneity of the measurements, respectively. Two-way ANOVA (group x
      time) tests for repeated measures will be performed to assess changes over time and between
      groups for all dependent variables. Violation of sphericity will adjust using Greenhouse-
      Geyser correction. The Bonferroni post-hoc test will detect specific differences between
      groups. When appropriate, the percentage of change (∆%) will be reported according to the
      following equation: ∆% = [(pre-average post average) / pre-average mean] × 100. Values will
      be express as mean ± standard deviation. O significance level α will be 0.05.
