  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a small, pilot, pre/post evaluation study enrolling older Hispanic American adults
      with moderate knee arthritis to evaluate the feasibility of recruitment, retention and
      adherence after a multimodal 12-week, physical therapy intervention. The secondary aim is to
      evaluate preliminary estimates of change on physical performance and health related quality
      of life after the intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Hispanic Americans (HAs) experience more pain and mobility deficits associated
      with knee osteoarthritis (OA) compared to non-Hispanic whites (NHWs) and seek total knee
      arthroplasties at a reduced rate, thus conservative treatments are needed. Prevalence of knee
      OA among the older HA population is rising dramatically. There is moderate evidence that
      lower extremity strengthening, manual therapy and self-management training improve pain and
      physical performance in people with knee OA and little evidence in the HA population. We
      conducted a pilot prospective trial implementing a multimodal high intensity targeted
      strength training, manual therapy and self-management education intervention to evaluate
      feasibility of recruitment, retention and adherence and preliminary estimates of change on
      physical performance and health related quality of life (HrQOL) in HAs with moderate knee OA.
      If this trial is feasible and shows promise for efficacy, it may warrant further testing as a
      primary treatment for knee OA.

      Methods: Spanish speaking older adults will be recruited from Kaiser Permanente San Francisco
      through a medical record search. Participants will attended 10 physical thearpy clinic visits
      over 8 weeks, followed by 4 weekly phone calls to assess adherence to exercise via 1-week
      verbal recall. Participants will be instructed to exercise 3 days per week for the study
      duration combining both clinic and home exercise participation. The intervention is led in
      Spanish and will include progressive open and closed-chain quadriceps and gluteal
      strengthening, progressive cycling training with short power intervals, manual therapy and
      self-management training.

    <description>Timed up and go (TUG) is a physical performance measure and is measured in seconds, the time it takes for participants to rise from a chair, walk 10-meters at their 'normal' speed and return to a sitting position.

    <measure>Change in absolute isometric bilateral quadriceps strength physical performance measure from baseline to after the intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Absolute isometric quadriceps strength is a physical performance measure and is measured in pounds and normalized to body weight and expressed as a percentage. Quadriceps strength is measured in a sitting position, with participants knee bent to 90 degrees. The examiner stabilizes a hand-held dynamometer on a table leg with a gait-belt strap and aligns the hand held dynamometer 1 inch proximal to the distal fibula on the anterior aspect of the tibia underneath the gait belt. Participants are given 2 to 3 practice sessions on 1 minute rests. Participants are given verbal encouragement to push as hard as they can for 2 trials on 1 minute rests and the average peak force in pounds is recorded. Increased peak force normalized to body-weight percentage indicates improvement in quadriceps strength.</description>

    <description>The Western Ontario McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) is a self-administered questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life in people with lower extremity dysfunction. The WOMAC has 24 questions in total and aggregates constructs of pain (5 questions), stiffness (2 questions) and physical function (17 questions) yielding a maximum score of 96 points. Each question is scored 0 to 4 where 0 indicates 'none' and 4 indicates 'extreme'. Higher scores indicate worse pain, stiffness and physical function. Each construct can be scored separately to represent a single construct.</description>

    <description>The multimodal intervention is 75 minutes in duration and meets two days per week for two weeks, then once per week for six weeks, followed by weekly phone calls to determine adherence to home-exercise program (HEP) for four weeks. The total duration of the intervention is twelve weeks. The intervention will be led in a group format with a ratio of one physical therapist to two participants and groups never exceeding 4 participants. All verbal and written communications in the intervention will be conducted in Spanish. The multimodal intervention consists of progressive lower extremity strengthening training targeting the quadriceps and gluteal groups in both legs, progressive stationary bicycle exercise, self-management training and education, manual therapy and home exercise program (HEP) instruction. Participants are asked to do their strengthening exercises at least three days per week for the 12-week study duration including sessions in the clinic</description>
