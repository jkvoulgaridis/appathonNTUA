      Low back pain is one of the most common ailments that plagues patients, with nearly 80% of
      the population developing some form of back pain in their lifetime. Up regulated sodium
      channels in the nerve root or dorsal root ganglion are the basic cause for the
      mechano-sensitization and injecting the drug in the peripheral end of the nerve will block
      these sodium channels, since functionally both ends of the pseudo unipolar neuron are the
      same.

      Low back pain is one of the most common ailments that plague patients, with nearly 80% of the
      population developing some form of back pain in their lifetime. Of all the causes of low back
      pain, the most common is lumbar radicular pain which may result from irritation of the nerve
      fibers or dorsal root ganglia due to intervertebral disc prolapse, degenerative
      spondylolisthesis or spinal canal stenosis. [1] Up regulated sodium channels in the nerve
      root or dorsal root ganglion are the basic cause for the mechano-sensitization and injecting
      the drug in the peripheral end of the nerve will block these sodium channels, since
      functionally both ends of the pseudo unipolar neuron are the same. [2]There have yet been no
      studies done to prove the efficacy of peripheral nerve block as an alternative to lumbar
      epidurals. We would like to share our experience of peripheral nerve blocks with low dose
      local Anaesthetics as the treatment of acute lumbosacral radiculopathy.
