  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prebiotics and probiotics are thought to play a role in appetite control and body weight
      regulation; but little is known about this topic. This study was planned to examine the
      effects of inulin and Lactobacillus casei 431 on short and long term fasting, satiety,
      dietary intake, and serum hunger and satiety hormone levels. The study consisted of 2 phases.
      In the first phase, a double-blind, randomized, crossover study design was used, and it was
      performed with 16 healthy male participants aged 19-30 years. In this phase, the prebiotic
      (200mL milk+16g inulin), probiotic (200mL milk + Lactobacillus casei 431 [&gt;106 cfu/mL]+16g
      maltodextrin), synbiotic (200mL milk+16g inulin + Lactobacillus casei 431 [&gt;106 cfu/mL]) and
      control (200mL milk+16g maltodextrin) test drinks were consumed with a standard breakfast on
      four separate test days by one week intervals, and their effects on dietary intake, hunger,
      satiety and appetite were assessed. The second phase was performed with 21 healthy male
      participants aged 19-30 years, using a placebo-controlled double-blind, randomized study
      design. Participants consumed the control (200mL milk+16g maltodextrin) or synbiotic (200mL
      milk+16g inulin+ Lactobacillus casei [&gt;106 cfu/mL]) test drinks for 21 days with their
      habitual diet. At the beginning and end of the intervention, blood samples were collected at
      0., 30., 60. and 120. minutes following the test day protocol to analyse serum glucose,
      insulin, ghrelin, obestatin and PYY (peptide tyrosine tyrosine) levels. In addition, dietary
      intake, hunger, satiety and appetite of participants were compared.
