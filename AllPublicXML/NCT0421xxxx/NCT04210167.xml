      The aim of this study was to determine the effect of web-based training and telephone
      monitoring on symptom management and quality of life in patients with heart failure. Study
      was conducted with the participation of 32 intervention and 32 control patients who have
      heart failure, in Akdeniz University Hospital Cardiology Clinic, between April 2018 and July
      2019. Data were collected using the Patient Information Form, Left Ventricular Dysfunction
      Scale and Memorial Symptom Rating Scale-Heart Failure Scale, Website Analysis and Measurement
      Inventory. The patients in the intervention group received web-based training after
      discharge, and were followed up by telephone at the first, fourth, eighth and 12 weeks. The
      scale data were collected before the patient was discharged from hospital and at the third
      month of discharge.

    <description>Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale-Heart Failure: The Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale-Heart Failure was used to evaluate symptom prevalence, severity, and distress. For each of the 32 items, the patient indicated whether he/she had experienced the symptom by selecting &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no.&quot; If &quot;yes&quot; was selected, the severity of a symptom over the past 7 days was assessed using the response. The score range of each symptom is 0-4. Higher score indicates a higher symptom burden. Turkish version of the questionnaire was used.</description>

    <description>Left Ventricular Dysfunction Questionnaire: The questionnaire is a 36 item questionnaire for patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Responses are dichotomous (true or false). True responses are summed and the sum is expressed as a percentage. The score range of scale is 0-100. A higher score indicates a worse quality of life. Turkish version of the questionnaire was used.</description>

    <description>The heart failure patients in the intervention group were given web-based training for three months after discharge and followed up by telephone at the first, fourth, eighth and 12th weeks. At the same time, a text message was sent once a week. Scale data were collected before the patient was discharged from the hospital and at the third month of discharge.</description>
