  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anlotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) with high effective in inhibiting
      angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation by targeting VEGFR, PDGFR, FGFR and c-Kit. Previous
      phase I trial has shown the potency of anlotinib in treating patients with various cancer
      types who failed in standard treatment or lack proper treatment regimen. Here, a single
      center, single-arm, phase II study was conducted to further validate the efficacy and safety
      of anlotinib in these patients.
