  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate: 1) Evaluate the efficacy of a regimen commercially available versus brush alone
      on established plaque and gingivitis on adolescents. The Group 1 will use the following
      procedure: Colgate Ultrasoft toothbrush, Colgate Total 12 toothpaste and Plax Mouthwash, and
      the other Group will use Colgate Ultrasoft toothbrush and Colgate Cavity Protection
      toothpaste; 2) The level of halitosis. Two calibrated and blinded examiners (Cohen Kappa 85%)
      will evaluate the gingival condition using the visible plaque indices, a simplified oral
      hygiene index - IHOS and gingival bleeding index, with the aid of a WHO probe. For the
      evaluation of halitosis levels, all individuals will respond to a questionnaire regarding
      personal data, general and oral health, which includes hygiene habits and received previous
      guidelines for the procedures to be performed in the second moment. At the next consultation,
      subjects will be assessed clinically for halitosis using the portable BreathAlert™ sulfide
      monitor (Tanita Corporation, Japan), in addition to the evaluation of the tongue flap index
      (ISL), pH and salivary flow. The evaluations will be in the following periods: baseline, 1, 3
      and 6 months of brushing. Data will be submitted to descriptive statistical analysis to
      demonstrate the distributions frequency of biofilm indices and gingival bleeding. The
      differences in the criteria evaluated will be submitted to Fisher's exact test (α = 0.05) and
      their performance at different times will be evaluated by the Mann-Whitney test (α = 0.05).

    <description>The volunteers will be invited with their caregivers to a lecture administered with the aim of clarifying the importance of oral hygiene and motivating brushing among the volunteers. Written clarifications will also be given in the form of an illustrative pamphlet. The volunteers will be trained in the technique through supervised brushing in front of a mirror. Subjects from the Group 1 will use a regimen with Colgate Total 12 toothpaste + Plax mouthwash + Colgate Ultrasoft toothbrush. Subjects will be instructed to use only their assigned group during the study period. The treatment products will be re-supplied at regular intervals. Subjects will return with their assigned products to the study site before receiving new products.
There will be no restrictions regarding diet habits during the course of the study. Upon completion of the study, subjects will be instructed to return all used and used products.</description>
