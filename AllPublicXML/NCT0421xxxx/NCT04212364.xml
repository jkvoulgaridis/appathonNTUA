    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to pilot and implement a peer mentor intervention focused on
      overdose prevention and care.

      The intervention consists of 3 sessions. During the first and second session, each
      participant will meet individually with a trained staff member. In the 3rd session, the
      participant will invite a social network member to attend the session, and these 2
      participants will meet with a trained staff member.

      The specific aims of the study are:

        1. Conduct a pilot of an HIV/HCV/overdose prevention and care intervention for people who
           use opiates.

        2. Evaluate the feasibility of collecting donated drug preparation containers (i.e.,
           cookers) to assess the presence of fentanyl, HCV, and HIV.

        3. Conduct a randomized controlled trial to assess efficacy of the experimental Peer Mentor
           condition on (a) overdose prevention and care education to drug network members, (b)
           naloxone availability, and (c) drug treatment readiness and entry.

      There are two types of participants: Index participants and network participants. Both type
      of participant will currently used opiates. Participants will take part in a baseline visit
      and up to 3 follow-up visits. Index participants will be randomized into the intervention or
      control arm of the study.

    <description>During Session 1, participants will be trained in Peer Education and how to use Nasal Narcan. They will be given two Nasal Narcan kit that includes 2 doses. One kit if for their use and one kit is to give someone in their social network after they have trained them in how to use it.
A week after Session 1, participants will be scheduled for Session 2.
During session 1 and 2 participants, Index participants will be taught information and skills pertaining to overdose prevention and response and how to train network members in overdose prevention and response.
At the 2nd session, index participants will be given 1 coupon to give to 1 member from their social network to attend Session 3.
Session 3 will be a dyad session where Index participants will use their peer mentors' skills to train their network member in overdose prevention and response.
Index participants will also be invited to up to 3 Booster Session (monthly) after they complete Sessions 1-3.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to this condition will participate in one 1-hour session. This session will be an individual session where the participant will meet with a trained staff member in a private room at the Lighthouse.
This session will be standard overdose prevention and response information. Participants will also be trained in Narcan administration. Participants will be given 1 nasal Narcan kit.
At the end of this session, participants will be asked to refer a network member to the study for survey visits</description>
