  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investing in early childhood development is one of the best cost-effective investments a
      country can make to boost long term economic growth, promote peaceful and sustainable
      societies, contribute to tackle poverty traps and eradicate inequality. It is also necessary
      to uphold the right of every child to survive and thrive. The single most powerful context
      for nurturing care is the immediate home, often mainly provided by mothers.

      Although the Mexican government has implemented social programs in the past, some with
      nutrition and child development components, poor and isolated communities have not benefited
      as others easier to reach. This is particularly true for the State of Oaxaca given its
      orography, where higher levels of malnutrition and a higher risk of suboptimal
      neurodevelopment are present.

      Since 1989, Un Kilo de Ayuda A.C. (UKA), a nongovernmental organization, has been involved in
      preventing child undernutrition in contexts of high poverty. Currently, UKA has 9 Early
      Childhood Development Centers distributed in 5 States of Mexico, including Oaxaca. UKA has
      developed the Neurological and Psycho-affective Early Childhood Development Program
      (NPECDP-UKA) that seeks to contribute to timely stimulation in children under 5 years of age
      and promote perceptual parenting practices. As part of the NPECDP-UKA, UKA redesigned their
      interventions to promote healthy nurturing care practices and responsive caregiving through
      workshops provided to caregivers and pregnant women, and with reinforcement through home
      visits.

      It is in the interest of this study to evaluate the NPECDP-UKA through a variation of a
      stepped wedge cluster randomized trial. The study sample consists of participants from 80
      municipalities of Oaxaca (~50% with high or very high margination status), 20 municipalities
      were randomly assigned to each arm. Study arms differ by design on the time of exposure to
      the program (0,18,24 and 30 months at the final measurement). Subjects from all study groups
      share the characteristic to be enrolled in the NPECDP-UKA, the group with 0 months of
      exposure will serve as a comparison group. This distinctive characteristic of the study
      requires a progressive incorporation of study groups to be able to compare development
      measurements between study groups at the same ages and among subjects all enrolled in the
      program to avoid self-selection bias. The main study hypothesis states that children exposed
      to the Program will have better neurodevelopment outcomes than those not exposed.

      This study will provide evidence of the effect of an educational intervention for caregivers
      on the neurodevelopment of children under 5 years of age. Currently evidence of such
      interventions is very limited, especially for interventions performed by a nongovernmental
      organization. This is the first evaluation of this kind in Mexico.

    <intervention_model_description>A variation of the stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design was specified. Due to ethical and logistical considerations, the intervention in study groups under this design starts sequentially but measurements are performed at the same time period in all groups. The key difference between groups is thus the time of exposure to the intervention. Clusters were randomized into four study groups (30, 24, and 12 months of exposure, and a non-exposed group). The intervention consists of educational workshops for caregivers aimed at promoting healthy nurturing care practices and responsive caregiving. Assessment of intervention effects is performed as in a parallel design.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The CDE-II, or Evaluación del Desarrollo Infantil (EDI-II) in Spanish, was developed and validated in Mexico to screen populations for lag and for risk of delay in child development. The test has specific items for 14 age groups of children aged 1 to 60 months. Assessed developmental areas include gross motor skills, fine motor skills, language, social skills, and cognitive skills. The CDE-II is based on age-group specific items, score results are categorized into three levels: Green (normal development), Yellow (developmental lag) and Red (at risk of development delay)</description>
