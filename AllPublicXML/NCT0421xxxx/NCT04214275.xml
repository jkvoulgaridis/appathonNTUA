  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the effect of a pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program on the respiratory
      function and quality of life of patients undergoing CABG surgery with an open-heart technique
      is examined. A randomized controlled experimental design was used. The study was conducted
      with two groups: the intervention group (n=25) and control group (n=25). The control group
      received standard care after CABG. In contrast, the experimental group, in addition to
      standard care, participated in a PR program created by the researchers. After CABG, the
      respiratory functions of both groups (clinical care day 4) and quality of life (6th week)
      evaluated

    <description>A diagnostic criterion used to identify patients with or at risk of pulmonary dysfunction. The PFT assessment was performed using the NDD Easy on-PC spirometer. During this test, challenging expiratory volume (FEV1 % (&gt;80)), challenging vital capacity (FVC % (&gt;80)), FEV1/FVC ( %, &gt;80) ratio, and Peak Expiratory air pressure (PEF % (&gt;100)) were measured in the first second. The PFT was performed in the Chest Diseases Outpatient Clinic of the hospital preoperatively.</description>
