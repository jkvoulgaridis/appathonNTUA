  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies how well heated intra-peritoneal chemotherapy with
      doxorubicin and cisplatin work for the treatment of abdominal or pelvic tumors that can be
      removed by surgery (resectable), does not respond to treatment (refractory), or has come back
      (recurrent). Heated intra-peritoneal chemotherapy is a procedure performed in combination
      with abdominal surgery for cancer that has spread to the abdomen. It involves the infusion of
      a heated chemotherapy solution that circulates into the abdominal cavity. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them
      from spreading. Heating a chemotherapy solution and infusing it directly into the abdomen may
      kill more cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility of heated intra-peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) with doxorubicin
      (DOXO) and cisplatin (CDDP) after surgical resection of pediatric pelvic and abdominal
      tumors.

      II. To assess morbidity, hospital length of stay and peri-operative mortality outcomes for
      pediatric patients with intraperitoneal sarcoma undergoing hyperthermic intraperitoneal
      chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Evaluate disease recurrence patterns: locoregional versus distant.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo cytoreduction. Patients also undergo HIPEC over 60 minutes consisting of
      doxorubicin and cisplatin. Patients then receive sodium thiosulfate intravenously (IV) over
      12 hours.

      After completion of the study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years.

             primary tumor) identified at the time of exploratory surgery with or without primary
             tumor resection

          -  Peritoneal cancer index (PCI) =&lt; 20 and surgeons deem high likelihood of complete

             oncology team

             surgery)

          -  Alkaline phosphatase =&lt; 2 X normal (performed no later than 14 days before surgery)

          -  Neutrophil count &gt;= 750 (performed no later than 14 days before surgery)

          -  Patients must have adequate renal function defined as creatinine clearance (performed
             no later than 14 days before surgery) or radioisotope GFR (glomerular filtration rate)
             &gt;= 70 mL/min/1.73 m^2 or a serum creatinine based on age/gender less than the
             following values:

          -  A signed informed consent form (and assent form when appropriate) approved by the Mayo
             Clinic (Institutional Review Board [IRB]) will be required for patient enrollment into
             the study. Patients must be able to read and understand the informed consent document
             and must sign the informed consent indicating that they are aware of the
             investigational nature of this study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females who are pregnant or breast-feeding during the study period will be excluded

          -  Distant metastatic disease not limited to peritoneum:

               -  Solid organ metastases (liver, central nervous system, lung)

               -  Known bone marrow involvement

          -  No critical cumulative dose of previous chemotherapy (total anthracycline dose not &gt;=
             435 mg / m^2)

          -  Prior HIPEC within 3 months

          -  Patients with an active infection requiring treatment or having an unexplained febrile
             illness (Tmax &gt; 99.5 Fahrenheit [F]), patients with known immune deficiency disorder
             or known human immunodeficiency virus infection

          -  Patients must not have any systemic illness which precludes them from being an
             operative candidate as determined by anesthesia preoperative evaluation. This includes
             but is not limited to, sepsis, liver failure, renal failure, cardiovascular failure,
             pulmonary failure

          -  Subjects deemed unable to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures

          -  Subjects with a known hypersensitivity to protocol systemic chemotherapy that was
             life-threatening, required hospitalization or prolongation of existing
             hospitalization, or resulted in persistent or significant disability or incapacitation
