  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, observational study of a healthy adult population with
      normal coagulation function to determine the reference range intervals for the parameters
      reported by the Quantra System with the QStat Cartridge. The threshold for the Clot Stability
      to Lysis (CSL) parameter will be determined from the CSL reference range.

        Adult volunteers with normal coagulation function, approximately equal numbers of males and
        females across three age group categories (18-30, 31-50 and &gt;50 years). The racial and
        ethnic profiles will be representative of the populations at each site.
