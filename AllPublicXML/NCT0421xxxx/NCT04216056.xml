  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to compare the pre-post effect of a frailty intervention program with
      exercise, nutrition, cognitive and social components with a control group without such
      program on improving gait speed and frailty in community-dwelling Chinese adults aged 50 and
      above who are pre-frail or frail using the FRAIL scale, and to obtain their views towards the
      frailty intervention program. The investigators hypothesized that the frailty intervention
      program will result in improvements regarding frailty, mobility, weight status and other
      health outcomes.

      This study will be a non-randomized controlled study using a controlled before-and-after
      study design. Eligible subjects will be assigned to one of the two groups: frailty
      intervention program, or control group without any intervention, over 12 weeks. A total of
      152 subjects (76 per group) will be recruited. A sub-sample of 25 subjects from the
      intervention group will be invited to share their experience and opinion in focus groups.

      A 30-month trial, which will be divided into three phases, namely study preparation and
      subject recruitment (6 months), data collection (18 months), and data entry and analysis (6
      months), will be conducted.

      This study will be a non-randomized controlled study using a controlled before-and-after
      study design. Eligible subjects will receive a baseline assessment in the community
      facilities. After that, eligible subjects will be assigned to one of the two groups: frailty
      intervention program, or control group without any intervention, over 12 weeks. Subjects in
      the frailty intervention program will be invited to participate in the following components:
      exercise, game training and nutrition education; while subjects in the control group will be
      asked to maintain their usual diet and physical activity patterns. A total of 152 subjects
      (76 per group) will be recruited. Outcome measurements will be collected at two time points,
      namely baseline (T0), and 12 (T1) weeks.

      The primary outcome will be the improvement in gait speed over 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes
      will include the change in the following parameters over 12 weeks: frailty, handgrip
      strength, 5 chair stands, balance test, Frontal Assessment Battery, dietary intake,
      nutritional status, physical activity, self-rated health, life satisfaction and self-efficacy
      of chronic disease management. In a sub-sample of 25 subjects from the intervention group,
      their views towards the frailty intervention program will be obtained from the focus group
      study.

    <description>There will be 2 sessions per week for 12 weeks. Each session includes 1 hour exercise (including 5-10 minute warm-up and cool-down routine, 20-30 minute chair-based resistance exercises using Thera-Bands for muscle groups in both the upper and lower body, and 20-30 minutes aerobic exercises); and 1 hour game training using computer video games, board games and card games. Nutrition education will be given to the subjects based on their weight status. The 1st level of nutrition information (healthy eating tips for frailty prevention and management) will be given to all subjects on regular basis during the 12-week study period via short videos, text messages or Whatsapp reminders. On top of the 1st level nutrition information, 3 nutrition heath talks (1-1.5 hours per talk) about weight management will be given to those with BMI &gt;=25 kg/m2, and/or waist circumference &gt;=90 cm (male) or &gt;=80 cm (female) during the 12-week study period.</description>
