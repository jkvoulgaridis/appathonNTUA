      This study consists of a nonrandomized single-dose phase in children aged 3 months to less
      than 12 years with suspected or confirmed aerobic Gram-negative bacterial infections and a
      randomized multiple-dose, active-comparator (SOC) phase in children aged 3 months to less
      than 18 years with cUTI to assess the PK, safety, and tolerability of cefiderocol in
      hospitalized patients requiring systemic antibiotics for an expected 5 to 14 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject's parent(s) or legally authorized representative (LAR) provides written

             determined by institutional review board/independent ethics committee [IRBs/IECs] or
             be consistent with local legal requirements)

          3. Hospitalized subject is 3 months to &lt; 18 years of age at the time written informed
             consent/assent is obtained

             bloodstream infections [BSI]) that requires hospitalization for treatment with IV
             antibiotics Multiple-dose phase: Subject has a suspected or confirmed cUTI that
             requires hospitalization for treatment with IV antibiotics

             menarche or Tanner stage 3, subject agrees to use barrier contraception (including
             condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap) with spermicide or agrees to use a highly
             effective method of contraception (including contraceptive implant, injectable
             contraceptive, combination oral contraceptive, or an intrauterine [IUD] contraceptive
             device) from Screening up to 28 days after administration of the last dose of

             uneventful re-exposure is not a contraindication to enrollment)

          2. Multiple-dose only: Subject has an infection caused only by a confirmed Gram-positive
             pathogen

          3. Subject has a suspected or confirmed central nervous system (CNS) infection (eg,
             meningitis, brain abscess, shunt infection) or osteomyelitis (which would require
             prolonged antibiotic therapy)

          4. Subject has cystic fibrosis

          5. Single-dose phase: Subject has moderate or severe renal impairment based on estimated
             glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (based on modified bed-side Schwartz equation
             [2009]) of &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m² at Screening Multiple-dose phase: Subject has an eGFR
             (based on modified bed-side Schwartz equation [2009]) of &lt; 15 mL/min/1.73 m² at
             Screening

          6. Subject has end-stage renal disease (ESRD), is on hemodialysis (HD), or receiving
             continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH)

          7. Subject is in refractory septic shock defined as persistent hypotension despite
             adequate fluid resuscitation or vasopressive therapy at Screening

          8. Subject has severe neutropenia or is severely immunocompromised 9. Subject has
             multiorgan failure

        10. Subjects with a life expectancy of &lt; 30 days due to severity of a concurrent illness
        11. Subject is a female who has a positive pregnancy test at Screening 12. Subject is a
        female who is breastfeeding 13. Subject has received any other investigational medicinal
        product (IMP) within 30 days 14. Subject has any condition or circumstance that, in the
        opinion of the investigator, would compromise the safety of the subject or the quality of
