  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research has clearly shown that lacking sufficient calories, macro- and micro-nutrients may
      impair an athlete's training adaptations, while athletes who consume a balanced diet that
      meets energy needs can enhance physiological training adaptations. Maintaining an energy and
      nutrient deficient diet during training may lead to loss of muscle mass, strength, and bone
      mineral density, in addition to an increased susceptibility to illness and injuries,
      disturbances in immune, endocrine and reproductive function, and an increased prevalence of
      overreaching and/or overtraining. In children and adolescent athletes, an insufficient diet
      may additionally result in impaired physical growth. Incorporating good dietary practices as
      part of a training program is one way to help optimize training adaptations and prevent
      overtraining.

      Based on this, nutritional supplementation is an effective and safe approach for attaining
      the high nutritional requirements of adolescent athletes, to help them maintain healthy
      growth. Nutritional supplementation could also improve their body composition, sport
      performance and general health. The primary objective of the proposed study is to evaluate
      the effect of dietary supplement versus placebo on growth and physical activity performance
      in young athletes. A total of 50 young soccer players (25 in each group) will participate in
      this Double blind, randomized, placebo controlled study.
