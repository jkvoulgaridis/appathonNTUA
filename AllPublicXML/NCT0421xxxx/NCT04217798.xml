    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, prospective, multicenter, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of PARP inhibitor niraparib combined with oral etoposide chemotherapy in women with
      platinum resistant or refractory recurrent ovarian cancer. Subjects will receive niraparib
      and oral etoposide in 30-day treatment cycles. After 6-8 cycles, oral etoposide will be
      discontinued. Subjects will receive niraparib alone until disease progression, intolerable
      toxicity or withdrawal of informed consent. The primary endpoint is efficacy as defined
      overall response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1).
      Secondary endpoints include progression free survival, duration of response, disease control
      rate, CA125 response rate and safety.
