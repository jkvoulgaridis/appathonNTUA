  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Xuefu-Zhuyu capsule&quot; (XFZY) is made from a classic Fangji &quot;Xuefu-Zhuyu Decoction&quot; in an
      ancient Chinese medical book &quot;Yi Lin Gai Cuo&quot; by Chinese physician Wang Qingren, which is the
      most representative formula for the treatment of &quot;Qizhi-Xueyu Zheng&quot; (Qi Stagnation and Blood
      Stasis Syndrome). XFZY concludes 11 kinds of Chinese herbs: Danggui(Angelica sinensis),
      Honghua(Safflower Flower), Chishao(Paeoniae Radix Rubra), Shengdihuang(Radix Rehmanniae),
      Taoren(Peach Seed), Zhike(Fructus Aurantii), Jugeng(Platycodon grandiflorum),
      Chuanxiong(Rhizome of Chuanxiong), Chaihu(Radix Bupleuri), Chuanniuxi(Cyathula
      Officinalis),Gancao(liquorice).It is mainly used to treat &quot;Qizhi-Xueyu Zheng&quot;, which includes
      the symptoms such as different types of pain, irritability or depression, insomnia, chest
      tightness, dark skin, lumps or masses in vitro or in vivo, petechiae on the tongue, and dark
      purple tongue. The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of XFZY in
      treating &quot;Qizhi-Xueyu Zheng&quot;, and investigate the most suitable diseases of XFZY.

    <description>The Qizhi-Xueyu-Zheng PRO Scale is uesd to access the quality of life on the physical and mental health for the patients with Qizhi Xueyu Zheng. The higher score of this PRO scale indicates higher quality of life. Compared with the baseline, if the improvement of the PRO sacle is more than 30% after treatment, it indicates the effectiveness of the drug.

    <description>SF-36 Quality of Life Scale is used to assess the health-related quality of life of patients, which is a multi-purpose, short-form health survey with 36 items. It yields an 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being scores as well as psychometrically-based physical and mental health summary scores and a preference-based health utility index. The SF-36 consists of items: assessing physical functioning (PF-10 items),social functioning (SF-2 items), role limitation due to physical health (RP-4 items),bodily pain (BP-2 items),mental health (MH-5 items),role limitations due to emotional health (RE-3 items),vitality (VT-4 items);general health perceptions (GH-5 items);reported health transition (1 item).</description>
