  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open label, single-site, single-dose, phase 1/2 study in up to 12
      participants with β-thalassemia major.This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      the treatment with γ-globin reactivated autologous hematopoietic stem cells in subjects with
      β-thalassemia major.

      γ-globin reactivated autologous hematopoietic stem cells will be manufactured using
      Crispr/Cas9 gene editing system. Subject participation for this study will be 1 year.
      Subjects who enroll in this study will be asked to participate in a subsequent long-term
      follow up study that will monitor the safety and efficacy of the treatment they receive for
      up to 15 years post-transplant.
