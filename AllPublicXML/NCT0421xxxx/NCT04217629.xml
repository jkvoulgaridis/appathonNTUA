    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dosed tolerability, pharmacokinetic
      study of a single-dose/multiple-doses incremental intravenous injection of SY-005 in healthy
      subjects. Six sigle-dose group trials are planned: 0.75mg, 2.5mg, 5mg, 10mg, 15mg,and 20mg
      and three multiple-doses groups are planned: 5mg, 10mg and 20mg. Single-dose groups are
      planned to enroll 64 subjects and multiple-doses groups are planned to enroll 30 subjects.
