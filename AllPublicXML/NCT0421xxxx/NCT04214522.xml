  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was planned to investigate the validity and reliability of the Kinesthetic and
      Visual Imagery Questionnaire in patients with acute stroke.

      The objectives of the research are:

        1. To evaluate the validity of the Kinesthetic and Visual Imaginery Questionnaire in acute
           stroke patients aged 50-75 years

        2. To evaluate the test-retest reliability of the Kinesthetic and Visual Imaginery
           Questionnaire in acute stroke patients aged 50-75 years

      Motor imagery (MI) is the mental representation of movement without any real body movement.
      MI is a complex and cognitive process involving the use of sensory and perceptual memories
      related to motor movements.Various studies using brain imaging techniques have found that
      during motor imagery, brain areas similar to voluntary movement are activated or the motor
      cortex can be stimulated. These findings suggest that stroke patients who cannot physically
      move their limbs can stimulate brain regions responsible for motor movements using motor
      imagery. The Kinesthetic and Visual Imaginery Questionnaire (KVIQ) is a motor imagery
      questionnaire developed for people who need to be guided for different reasons and cannot
      perform complex movements. Evaluate both visual and kinesthetic dimensions of motor images.
      This study was planned because of the need for evaluation of motor imagery for stroke
      patients, who mostly have motor and sensory problems.

    <measure>Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire is a representative tool to assess motor imagery ability. The questionnaire can be used to assess healthy individuals, as well as those with physical disabilities. It allows easy evaluation of motor imagery ability in a sitting position with single joint motions. Furthermore, the questionnaire assesses both visual and kinesthetic dimensions of motor imagery. The questionnaire is not self-administered, rather it is administered by a trained assessor. It assesses the vividness of each dimension of motor imagery (clarity of the image/intensity of sensation) on a 5-point ordinal scale.The long version comprises 20 items (10 movements for each scale) and the short version includes 10 items (5 movements for each scale). Higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Barthel Index</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Barthel Scale/Index (BI) is an ordinal scale used to measure performance in activities of daily living (ADL). Ten variables describing ADL and mobility are scored, a higher number being a reflection of greater ability to function independently following hospital discharge.Time taken and physical assistance required to perform each item are used in determining the assigned value of each item. The Barthel Index measures the degree of assistance required by an individual on 10 items of mobility and self care ADL.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Motor Assessment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Motor Assessment Scale is a clinical assessment tool that evaluates eight areas of motor function in recovering stroke patients. The scale uses tasks related to activities of daily living to measure the full range of functional motor performance in stroke survivors. These include: Supine to side-lying, supine to sitting over side of bed, balanced sitting, sitting to standing, walking, upper arm function, hand movements, hand activities. Items are assessed using a 7-point scale (0-6). A score of 6 indicates optimal motor behavior item scores (with the exceptions of the general tonus item) are summed to provide an overall score (out of 48 points).Higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trail Making Test</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Trial Making Test (TMT) can provide information about visual search speed, scanning, speed of processing, mental flexibility, as well as executive functioning. The TMT consists of two parts, A and B. Part A&amp;B consists of one sample test and one task. The numbers are randomly printed on the sample worksheet. The subject is required to join consecutive numbers in order by drawing connecting lines. The worksheet consists of numbers 1 to 25. The time taken to join consecutive numbers is taken as the subject's score. Part B consists of a sample test as well as the main task. The numbers 1 to 13 and letters A to L are presented on the task worksheet. The participant is required to alternate between numbers and letters as s/he proceeds in an ascending sequence.</description>

    <measure>Trunk İmpairment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Trunk İmpairment Scale, developed by Fujiwara et al. In 2004, is another scale that evaluates post-stroke trunk impairment. The 7-parameter scale included vertical posture perception, trunk rotation muscle strength and reflexes on the affected and unaffected side, and trunk vertically and abdominal manual muscle test sub-parameters in the stroke impairment assessment set of Tsuji et al. [33]. Each parameter is evaluated over 4 points. The total score ranges from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 21 points. Higher score means better performance.</description>

    <measure>Mental Chronometry</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minute</time_frame>
    <description>Mental chronometry is an objective method used in the evaluation of motor imagery. It examines the time difference between actually making a movement and imagining the same movement.The modified box block test will be used to measure mental chronometry.The modified version has 15 cubes, and the individual's time to transfer all of these cubes is recorded. The individual is then asked to imagery this transfer. The imagery time is also recorded and the time difference are calculated.</description>
