    <textblock>
      DESIRIAL® is a CE-marketed hyaluronic acid gel intented to rehydrate vaginal and vestibular
      mucous membranes by mucosal injections. In this study, 121 postmenopausal women of minimum
      age 45 with symptoms associated with vulvovaginal atrophy, refusing estrogen therapies for
      treatment of symptoms or with contraindications for such therapies, with at least one
      moderate to severe vulvovaginal symptom among dryness sensation, dyspareunia, itching /
      irritation and pain, who have given her informed consent and met all the eligibility
      criteria, will be enrolled. Patients will randomly receive 1 injection of DESIRIAL® or
      placebo (ratio 2:1) in the vaginal mucosa at Day 0. If still eligible 12 weeks after,
      patients receiving placebo at Day 0 will be treated with DESIRIAL®. Patients will come to a
      total of 6 to 8 visits depending on the product injected at Day 0 over a period of 11 up to
      12 months. Phone interview will be performed between 3 and 5 days after injection. Variation
      of vulvovaginal symptomatology, sexual function, vaginal pH and safety will be assessed.

  <detailed_description>

      This is a prospective, international, multicenter study performed in 2 steps:

        -  From 0 to 12 weeks: randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study;

        -  From 12 to 52 weeks: open label, treatment only study.

      The study will assess the efficacy of DESIRIAL® in reducing the vulvovaginal symptomatology
      after a single injection. One hundred twenty one postmenopausal women of minimum age 45, with
      symptoms associated with vulvovaginal atrophy, refusing estrogen therapies for treatment of
      symptoms or with contraindications for such therapies, with at least one moderate to severe
      vulvovaginal symptom among dryness sensation, dyspareunia, itching / irritation and pain, who
      have given her informed consent and met all the eligibility criteria, will be enrolled.
      Patients will randomly (2:1 ratio) receive a 1mL-injection of DESIRIAL® (Desirial Only group,
      DO) or placebo (Placebo and Desirial group, PAD) in the vestibular and vaginal mucosa using
      the multi-puncture and/or retrolinear technique at D0. If still eligible 12 weeks after,
      patients from PAD group receiving placebo at Day 0 will be treated with DESIRIAL®. Group DO
      will be followed up at 4, 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks timepoints.Group PAD will be followed up at
      4, 12, 16, 24, 36 and 48 weeks timepoints. Phone interview will be performed between 3 and 5
      days after injection to check safety. Variation of vulvovaginal symptomatology, sexual
      function and vaginal pH will be measured using vulvovaginal symptomatology questionnaire,
      Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and vaginal pH indicator strip respectively. Safety will
      also be assessed through collection of adverse events.

FSFI consists in 19 questions with multiple-choice responses coded from 0.0 to 5.0. Each score has a specific meaning depending on the question. The scale has six sexual domains. The maximum score for each domain is 6.0, obtained by summing item responses and multiplying by a correction factor. The total composite sexual function score is a sum of domain scores and ranges from 2.0 (not sexually active and no desire) to 36.0.</description>
