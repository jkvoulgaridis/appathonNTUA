  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is mainly focusing on reducing the pain scores during IV cannulation in pediatric
      population in the preoperative period. Applying EMLA cream is a well-known fact world wide.
      we would like to study the effect of ultrasound waves in the penetration of the given drung
      into the skin so that we could achieve the effect of the drug quickly.

      To assess the intensity of pain in children in the perioperative area during IV cannulation
      using a combination of EMLA cream and low-frequency USG probe. To assess the intensity of
      pain in children in the perioperative area during IV cannulation using a combination of EMLA
      cream and high-frequency USG probe and final comparison between these groups will assess the
      effect of ultrasound in the penetration of the drug into the skin.
