    <textblock>
      The investigators design a phase II clinical study to explore the efficacy and safety of
      toripalimab plus lenvatinib as a second-line treatment in patients with advanced biliary
      tract cancers and to analyze potential biomarkers of therapeutic response.

    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is a single-arm, non-randomized and single-center clinical study.

      It is estimated that 44 patients who met the study criteria will be enrolled in 2 years and
      treated with toripalimab plus lenvatinib in PUMCH. The investigators will follow up and
      collect subjects' data each month to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment, including
      overall survival and time to progression, until disease progression or death. Interim
      analysis and final analysis will be conducted when collecting data from 20 and 44 subjects,
      respectively in this trial. Histopathology and multi-omics data analysis will be used to
      explore potential biomarkers of treatment response.

             removing the ovaries and/or uterus), then the patient has fertility. ii) Contraceptive
             methods with a contraceptive failure rate &lt;1% include bilateral tubal ligation, male
             sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing
             intrauterine devices and copper intrauterine devices. iii) The reliability of sexual
             desire should be evaluated relative to the duration of the clinical trial and
             lifestyle of patient. Periodic abstinence (eg. calendar days, ovulation, symptomatic
             body temperature or post-ovulation methods) and in vitro ejaculation are unacceptable

             least 6 months after the last dose of treatment, or use condoms and other
             contraceptive methods with contraceptive failure rate &lt;1%. At the same time, male
             patients must also agree not to donate sperm. ii) When a female partner is pregnant,
             the male patient must abstinence or using a condom during the treatment period and at
             least 6 months after the last dose of treatment to prevent the fetus from being
             affected by the study. iii) The reliability of sexual desire should be evaluated
             relative to the duration of the clinical trial and lifestyle of patient. Periodic
             abstinence (eg. calendar days, ovulation, symptomatic body temperature or
             post-ovulation methods) and in vitro ejaculation are unacceptable methods of
             contraception.
