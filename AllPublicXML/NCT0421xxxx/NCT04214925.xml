  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because of multiple system involvement, patients with Scleroderma have complaints such as
      fatigue, sleep disturbances, functional limitations, skin deformations, pain, swollen hands
      and joint pain. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of Tai Chi exercise
      program on trunk endurance, balance, sleep, fatigue, anxiety and depression in patients with
      scleroderma.

      In the study, which will be planned as a randomized controlled parallel group, the effects of
      Tai Chi in SS patients are compared with the home exercise group. Evaluations before and
      after the treatment will make by a physiotherapist. Training of Tai Chi will supervised by an
      experienced and certified physiotherapist.

      Lateral Bridge Test , Berg Balance Scale, Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index , Fatigue Severity
      Scale and Fatigue Impact Scale , Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale will be used
      evaluation before and after training.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>ten weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The scale has 19 items and measures 7 components of sleep quality: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction (each domain score ranges between 0 and 3). A global PSQI score corresponding to the total of the individual scores from the 7 components is calculated (range = 0-21). A result equal to 6 or above is considered indicative of poor sleep quality. The test has high diagnostic specificity for detecting clinical sleep impairment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue Severity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>ten weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue Severity Scale comprises nine statements, describing the severity and impact of fatigue, with a scale of possible responses ranging from 1 (&quot;strongly disagree&quot;) to 7 (&quot;strongly agree&quot;). FSS total scores are usually reported as the mean score over the nine items; a higher score indicates greater severity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue Impact Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>ten weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is a scale that evaluates the effects of fatigue on daily life activities and quality of life. It contains 40 questions in total. Consists of cognitive, physical and social subdivisions. The score ranges from 0 to 160 points and the high score indicates a negative impact.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>ten weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is a scale that evaluates the anxiety and depression levels of individuals in 14 questions. While the answers score between 0 and 3, the high score indicates high anxiety or depression.</description>

    <description>Tai Chi exercise program will create by selecting the first-basic 10 forms from 24 short forms of Yang style. The forms' name: Beginning, Parting the Horse's Mane, Stork Spreading Its Wings, Brushing Your Knees and Stepping, Playing The Pipes, Fending Off the Monkey, Grasping the Sparrow's Tail Left, Grasping the Sparrow's Tail Right, Simple Whip, Moving Hands Like Clouds-Conclusion. All forms will be completed at 10 weeks. Each session will take 1 hour (15 min for warming up exercises, 30 min of Tai Chi forms, and 15 min for cooling down exercises). The 14 patients of SS in this group will be divided into two groups of 7.</description>

    <description>The home exercise group will receive a one-hour home program, 2 days a week. The first and last 15 minutes of the exercise program will consist of warm-up and cooling- down exercises. After warm-up exercises, stretching for shoulder, hamstring and erector spinae muscles, strengthening exercises for abdominal and back muscles will be performed 10 times each for 30 minutes.</description>
