  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled comparative effectiveness study examines manipulation of a key
      component of an established and efficacious treatment for naming impairments in aphasia,
      along with cognitive and brain correlates of treatment success. Study participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions comparing two different versions of
      Semantic Feature Analysis treatment. Their performance on standardized and study-specific
      measures will be used to determine which version of the treatment provides superior outcomes,
      and measures of automatic language processing and functional brain imaging will also be used
      to identify the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms associated with positive treatment
      response.

    <textblock>
      This randomized comparative effectiveness trial examines whether active manipulation of a key
      component of semantic feature analysis (SFA) treatment for word-finding difficulty in aphasia
      improves outcomes. 40 study participants will be recruited and randomized to receive one of
      the two versions of the treatment. The total treatment time will be equated in the two
      conditions.

      Study participants will be housed locally at the Pittsburgh site at no cost and will be
      eligible to receive reimbursement for travel expenses. During the five-week treatment phase
      of the study, participants will receive 60 hours of SFA treatment with pre- and
      post-treatment assessment of their ability to name pictures of treated and untreated,
      semantically related nouns. Other secondary outcomes, including measures of connected speech
      and patient-reported communication ability will also be collected. In order to address
      unresolved questions about the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms of SFA,
      participants will also receive concurrent pre- and post-treatment assessment of automatic
      word processing ability using eye-tracking methods and functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI). Participants will also be asked to return to Pittsburgh for two days approximately
      2-3 months later for follow-up language, eye-tracking, and fMRI testing.

      The language testing results will be used to determine which version of SFA treatment
      optimizes outcomes. The eye-tracking results will be used to infer whether SFA's positive
      effects can be attributed to improved activation of lexical-semantic representations,
      improved ability to inhibit competing representations, or both. The fMRI results will be used
      to identify the brain networks and activation changes associated with changes in naming
      ability resulting from SFA. This study will provide theoretically and clinically relevant
      information about how aphasia treatment should be delivered and the neurocognitive mechanisms
      underlying its effects.

    <masking_description>Administration and scoring of all primary and secondary outcome measures will be carried out by a speech pathologist on study staff who (1) is not the treating clinician for the participant being assessed, and (2) is blind to the group assignment of the participant being assessed. Because SFA is a behavioral intervention, it will not be possible to blind the treating clinician to group assignment. It will also be impossible to definitively blind participants to their group assignment. However, we will not formally disclose to participants the group to which they have been assigned, and in the informed consent process, we will describe the conditions only in relative terms.</masking_description>

    <description>On each treatment trial, the clinician will show the participant with aphasia a pictured object and ask them to name it. The clinician will then guide the participant in verbally generating semantic features for the target, using a chart that specifies five kinds of features: group, use/action, properties, location, and personal associations. When the participant cannot generate a given feature, cueing or other assistance will be provided. After feature generation, the clinician will ask the participant to name the picture again and provide cueing if needed. The clinician will then review the generated features and ask the participant to name the item once more, with cueing if needed. Finally, the clinician will ask the participant to say a sentence containing the target word and provide cueing if needed. Treatment will then proceed to the next item. Participants will receive approximately 20 hours of treatment on each of three 10-item lists, for a total of 60 hours of treatment.</description>
