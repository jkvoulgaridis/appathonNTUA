      Method comparison study to compare the Affinity prototype device using a capillary blood
      sample against routine venous laboratory results, in patients undergoing systemic anti-cancer
      therapy (SACT). Tests will be performed by healthcare professionals (Cohort 1) and
      participants self-testing (Cohort 2)

      In this study the Investigators wish to compare 200 finger prick sample (capillary) blood
      results taken and analysed using the Affinity prototype device to standard of care venous
      blood samples, taken from the participant on the same day. The blood tests will analyse Full
      Blood Count (FBC)

      200 patients will be recruited in total. 100 will take part in Cohort 1, where a member of
      the clinical research team will take their blood sample using the Affinity prototype device.
      The other 100 will take part in Cohort 2, where the participant will self test and take the
      blood sample themselves. Participants will be asked to complete a short questionnaire after
      using the device to provide any feedback on its design and use.
