  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to establish if a novel high-speed yoga program which
      incorporates visual cues can make a positive change in the participant's ability to make
      decisions and move as measured by several cognitive, balance and functional tests. It has
      been shown that yoga can improve balance and movement in those diagnosed with Parkinson's
      disease.

      The purpose of this research study is to establish if a novel high-speed yoga program which
      incorporates visual cues can make a positive change in the participant's ability to make
      decisions and move as measured by several cognitive, balance and functional tests. It has
      been shown that yoga can improve balance and movement in those diagnosed with Parkinson's
      disease. Subjects will be randomly assigned to either the high-speed yoga group or an
      inactive control group. All subjects will be tested before and after the 16 week training
      period using tests of balance, cognition and functional movement. The high-speed yoga group
      will receive yoga sequences lead by a certified yoga instructor during each of the 32 visits
      to the yoga studio. Each session will last one hour and be conducted two times per week. The
      program will consist of several different balance poses and movements where participants are
      encouraged to move quickly. Participants will also be asked to move in different directions
      based on colored lines placed on the yoga mat. To ensure a safe environment, several
      assistants will be present to help participants move into each pose. In addition, several
      assistive devices such as chairs and yoga blocks will be available if participants chose to
      use them.

    <measure>Change in Cognitive Dysfunction</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 19</time_frame>
    <description>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a rapid screening instrument for mild cognitive dysfunction. A total possible score is 30 points with a range of 0-30. A score of 26 or above is considered normal.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Executive Function (EF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 20.</time_frame>
    <description>The Wisconsin Card Sort task evaluates executive function with correct scores and errors associated with previously used rules known as preservative errors. Scores (t-scores) on the Wisconsin Card Sort task (total error) at study endpoint adjusted for education are min=0 and max=100. Higher scores indicate better outcomes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Executive Function Measured by Inhibition of Cognitive Inference</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroop color word test evaluates the participant's ability to inhibit cognitive inference. This is a cognitive domain of executive function and involves the processing of a stimulus where one feature of a previous stimulus may affect the simultaneous processing of a new stimulus. The total score can range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better memory function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Dynamic Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 19</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini-BESTest measures dynamic balance deficits in persons with mild to moderate PD. The assessment has 14 items. Each item is rated on a 0-2 point scale, where a score of 0 indicates that the participant is unable to complete the task, and a score of 2 indicates normal performance. The score can range from 0 to 28. Higher score indicates better dynamic balance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Functional Agility</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 19</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed Up-and-Go measures a participant's ability to rise from a standard chair walk 3 meters, walk around a cone, walk back 3 meters and sit down in the chair. The measure is how long it takes to complete the task. The range of scores is 6.5 seconds to 20.3 seconds. A lower score indicates better agility.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Reactive Balance Distance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 19</time_frame>
    <description>Reactive balance testing measures the ability of the participant to maintain balance on a moving platform. The dynamic balance score can range from 1440 centimeters to 0 centimeters, with the lower score indicating better performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Reactive Balance Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 19</time_frame>
    <description>Reactive balance testing measures the ability of the participant to maintain balance on a moving platform. The time-on-test score can range from 0-120 seconds with the higher score indicating better performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Perceived Fall Risk</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 19</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Fall Efficacy Scale measures perceived balance ability and fall risk. The instrument consists of 14 self-report items which are scored on a 10-point Likert based scale. A score of 0 indicates not confident at all and a score of 10 indicates complete confidence. The test can range from 0 to 140.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 19</time_frame>
    <description>The Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) measures self-reported quality of life in Parkinson's patients. It has 39 items with an overall score range from 20 to 56 with the lower score indicating better quality of life.</description>

    <intervention_name>High-speed yoga multi-directional yoga</intervention_name>
    <description>The yoga training will be performed over a 4-month period where classes will be held two times per week. Each session will include a warm-up, speed and balance training section, and cooldown phase. The yoga program will include four separate progressions with the first four weeks serving as a familiarization phase, where the participants will be introduced to the poses and proper technique will be demonstrated. The second four-week phase will emphasize a speed component used to target improvements in aerobic capacity. The same poses previously learned will be used. The final two phases will increase in intensity maintaining the speed element and include skill-based training, where the participants will be asked to complete each pose moving as quickly as possible in response to visual and auditory cues.</description>
