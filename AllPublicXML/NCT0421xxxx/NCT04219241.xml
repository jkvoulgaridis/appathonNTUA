    <textblock>
      Cellavita-HD is a stem-cell therapy for Huntington's Disease. Open label, single treatment,
      extension study for long-term safety and efficacy evaluation of Cellavita-HD intravenous
      administration in Huntington's disease patients who participated of ADORE-DH trial.

      This extension study will include the subjects who participated the study phase II for
      dose-response evaluation of Cellavita-HD intravenous administration in Huntington's disease
      patients (maximum 35 subjects). Because it is a extension study, with an open scenario, the
      subjects will receive the maximum dose tested in the last clinical trial (ADORE-DH),
      corresponding to 6 x 10^6 cells/weight range for each treatment cycle planned. Throughout of
      24 months, the subjects will receive total dose planned divided into three administrations
      per cycle (2 x 10^6 cells/weight range), that each will occur every 30 days. The maintaining
      the effectiveness of intravenous administration of Cellavita-HD product over time on clinical
      progression Huntington's disease will be verified by comparing the UHDRS total score at the
      end of the 24th study month against baseline score. Secondary evidences of efficacy will be
      evaluated by through the data of functional state, total functional capacity, functional
      independence, psychiatric symptoms and cognition from UHDRS scale. Additionally, related data
      to clinical worsening, change of Body Mass Index (BMI), risk of suicide attempt and
      neurological image improvement will be evaluated. Safety evaluation will included the
      incidence and classification of the adverse events experienced by the subjects during the
      study.

    <description>The maintenance of treatment effectiveness will be verified by comparing the total UHDRS (Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale) score registered at the end of the 24th month of study in relation to the baseline score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical neurological worsening over the treatment by UHDRS</measure>
    <time_frame>Two years</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical neurological worsening over the treatment will be evaluated by specific Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale - UHDRS subscales (motor, behavior, functional capacity and cognitive domain). Each specific domain have 4 categories (from 0 to 4). For motor subscale, the score ranged from 0 to 124; Therefore,highest scores indicate more severe motor impairment. Cognitive operations are assessed by aplication of three tests: verbal fluency test, Symbol Digit modalities test and the Stroop Color Word test. For all cognitive tests, highest scores translate to better cognitive ability. Behavior assessment score is obtained by summing different items related to the severity of psychiatric symptoms. Highest scores indicate greater behavioral impairment. Functional assessment includes three scales: a functional checklist, an independence scale, and a total functional capacity assessment. The maximum score of 25 points represents greater functional capacity.</description>

    <description>The BMI (Body Mass Index) will be evaluated through the BMI profiles obtained during the treatment to evaluate the nutritional status.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Risk of suicidal ideation and/or behavior by C-SSRS</measure>
    <time_frame>Two years</time_frame>
    <description>Will be evaluated by Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) registered throughout the study in relation to the baseline score. The total score ranges from 2 to 25, with a higher number indicating more intense ideation and greater risk. Greater lethality or potential lethality of the behavior (endorsed on the Behavior subscale) indicates increased risk.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Risk of suicidal ideation and/or behavior by HDS</measure>
    <time_frame>Two years</time_frame>
    <description>Will be evaluated through Suicidal Domain from HDS (Hamilton Depression Scale) registered throughout the study in relation to the baseline score. Scores above 25 points characterize severely ill patients depressed; scores between 18 and 24 points, moderately depressed patients; and scores between 7 and 17 points, patients with mild depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CNS assessment by MRI (Magnetic Ressonance Imaging)</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>Huntington's patients normally present MRI structural abnormalities, including cortical atrophy and structural white matter changes. Alterations after product administration will be evaluated througout statistical comparison of the CNS assessment through magnetic resonance imaging at cortical thickness measurements, volumes of different brain structures, especially the basal ganglia, with special attention to caudate and metabolic changes identified in proton spectroscopy.</description>
