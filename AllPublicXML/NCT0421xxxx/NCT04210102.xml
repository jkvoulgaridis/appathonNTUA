  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) is a major problem in Emergency Department (ED). Diagnosis
      relies on combination of clinical symptoms and results of chest radiography (CR). Patients'
      management (treatment, support) depends on delay and quality of the diagnosis. However, signs
      and symptoms are highly aspecific and interpretation of CR is subject to frequent
      discrepancies. Then diagnosis of CAP may be uncertain; therefore, overdiagnosis is frequent
      and leads to over-use of antimicrobial therapy; missing diagnosis is also deleterious and
      delays adequate treatment including antibiotics. CT scan completes CR and helps clinician
      making properly diagnosis of CAP; obtaining CT in a 4-hour time-lapse allows better diagnosis
      and management as accurate as an independent expert adjudication committee does. However
      availability of CT as well as radiation interrogates on the benefit that Lung Ultrasounds
      (LUS) may have in diagnosis strategy of suspected CAP. LUS is a noninvasive easy-to-use
      device whose practice is widely endorsed worldwide by emergency medicine associations and
      societies. Additionally, previous studies advocate for the use of LUS for diagnosis of CAP in
      the ED. Therefore the Promotor developed a study to compare LUS and CR as a primary imaging
      for diagnosis of CAP at the ED.
