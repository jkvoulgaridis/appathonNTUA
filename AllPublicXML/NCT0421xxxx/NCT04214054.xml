  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was carried out to compare the outcome of sinus lift without grafting material,
      versus the use of moldable, self hardening calcium phosphate biomaterials with simultaneous
      implant placement.

    <textblock>
      This study was designed as a randomized controlled clinical trial, the study population
      consisted of 20 patients with missing maxillary posterior teeth and residual bone height
      5-7mm. The sample was selected conveniently according to a list of inclusion and exclusion
      criteria, the participants were allocated randomly into two equal groups. All patients had
      sinus lift using piezosurgery device with simultaneous implant placement. In group I, blood
      clot was the only filling material. In group II, moldable, self-hardening calcium phosphate
      was the filling material. Clinical and radiographic evaluations were done through 6 months
      postoperatively.

    <measure>Wound healing</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of alveolar osteitis (dry socket) will be determined clinically using BLUM'S criteria. Wound healing was assessed and recorded depending on the absence or presence of dehiscence, every opening along the incision will be recorded as dehiscence , dental tweezers will be used to identify it.</description>

    <measure>Radiographic Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) was done. The apparatus and the settings were kept the same during all the preoperative scans to evaluate the amount of vertical bone height gained, the change of bone density and the marginal bone loss postoperatively.</description>

    <measure>Implant stability</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Examining implant stability was done using Osstell (Osstell co. Swedan). It is a noninvasive and easy-to-use system to determine implant stability and to assess the process of osseointegration.</description>

    <description>Incision was performed in the canine area then a full thickness mucoperiosteal flap was elevated and exposure of the lateral aspect of the maxillary sinus. Osteotomy of the buccal window was performed using the piezosurgery device followed by meticulous dissection of the sinus membrane. Drilling the site were implants were to be placed, guided by the preformed surgical stent. Implants of appropriate size were torqued to engage the apical aspect of the implant recipient site. The sinus was augmented with moldable self-hardening biphasic calcium phosphate. Repositioning and suturing of the flap using 3-0 black silk suture material.</description>

    <description>A pyramidal full thickness mucoperiosteal flap was performed distal to the canine area with a crestal incision located palatally in the edentulous area and vertical extension of the incision to the buccal vestibule using Bard Parker blade number 15. The flap was reflected exposing the alveolar bone. Lateral window was performed and the sinus membrane was elevated using piezo surgery. Drilling at the sites where implants were to be placed was done using Neobiotech implant drilling Kit. Implants. Implants were placed in a self-tapping fashion using a torque wrench. Flaps were replaced back and sutured using 3-0 black silk suture material.</description>
