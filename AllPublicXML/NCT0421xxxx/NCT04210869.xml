  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impaired brain vascular function precedes the development of reduced cognitive performance,
      while brain insulin-resistance is also associated with cognitive decline. The Mediterranean
      diet, which is rich in nuts, may protect against the development of impaired cognitive
      performance. The hypothesis is that long-term mixed nut consumption increases brain
      insulin-sensitivity thereby improving brain vascular function and cognitive performance. The
      primary objective is to evaluate in elderly men and women the effect of 16-week mixed nut
      consumption on cerebral blood flow, as quantified by the non-invasive gold standard magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI)-perfusion method Arterial Spin Labelling (ASL). Cerebral blood flow
      is a robust and sensitive physiological marker of brain vascular function. Secondary
      objectives are to investigate effects on the cerebral blood flow response to intranasal
      insulin delivery - a marker of insulin-sensitivity in the human brain - as quantified by ASL,
      and cognitive functioning as assessed with a neuropsychological test battery.
