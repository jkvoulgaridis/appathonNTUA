  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      β-thalassemia disease is one of the most common congenital hemolytic anemia commonly found in
      the malarial belt areas including the Mediterranean, the Middle East, Africa, Southeast Asian
      countries, and China.

    <textblock>
      β-thalassemia represents a major public health problem in Egypt, it is estimated that there
      are 1000/1.5 million per year live births born with β-thalassemia. The average life
      expectancy of patients with β-thalassemia has improved over the last few years as compared to
      that of in the previous millennium. This has led to the discovery of new set of problems such
      as increased hypercoagulable state in β-thalassemia like micro infarcts in spleen and lung
      indicating an activated coagulation pathway. The, incidence of thromboembolism in patients
      with thalassemia disease is approximately 10 times higher than normal population, it accounts
      between 1.7 and 9.2%. On the other hand, a study conducted by Chaudhary and Ahmad, 2012
      showed decreased aggregation in majority of β-thalassemia patients. Another study conducted
      by Ibrahim, 1999 had noticed few patients to have bleeding manifestations in the form of
      epistaxis. Mussumeci et al., 1987 noted that both thrombophilic and anti-thrombophilic
      proteins were reduced as a consequence of liver damage. The net clinical outcome depends on
      the fine balance between the prothrombotic and antithrombotic pathways.
