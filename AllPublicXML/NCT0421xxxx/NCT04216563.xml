    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ABL001 works in treating patients with chronic myeloid
      leukemia who are on therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitor. ABL001 may stop the growth of
      cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving ABL001 and
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor together may work better than tyrosine kinase inhibitor alone in
      treating patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the clinical activity of the combination of asciminib (ABL001) and a tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor (TKI) in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in complete
      cytogenetic response (CCyR) but detectable BCR-ABL1 transcript.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of the combination of ABL001 and TKI on the rate of mismatch
      repair (MR)4, MR4.5, and sustained MR4.5.

      II. To investigate treatment-free remission after at least 2 years of sustained deep
      molecular remission.

      III. To determine the safety of the combination of asciminib and tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

      IV. To determine the event-free survival (EFS), survival free from transformation to
      accelerated and blast phase (TFS), and overall survival (OS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) clearance using droplet digital
      polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) detecting the BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript.

      II. To determine the effect of therapy on quiescent leukemic Philadelphia chromosome positive
      (Ph+) stem cells (CFSEmax/CD34+).

      III. To determine the effect of this combination on mutations in ABL1 and mutations in clonal
      hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP)-associated genes using molecular barcode
      sequencing.

      IV. To determine the effect of therapy on bone marrow progenitors in clonogenic assays.

      V. To describe immune effects of the combination of TKI and ABL001. VI. To describe patient
      reported outcomes (PRO) using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI)-CML instrument.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive asciminib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for up to 36 months while receiving
      standard of care dasatinib or nilotinib in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients may continue to receive asciminib after 36 months at the discretion of
      investigator.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4-8 weeks for 6 months
      and then every 3-6 months thereafter.

             with at least 3 values obtained during this period

          -  Patients must not have had a known continuous interruption of TKI therapy of greater
             than 14 days or for a total of 6 weeks in the 6 months prior to enrollment, unless the

          -  The effects of ABL001 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation. Women of child-bearing potential must agree to
             use highly effective methods of contraception during dosing and for 30 days after
             study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she
             or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating
             physician immediately. Allowable methods of birth control: Total abstinence (when this
             is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject). Periodic abstinence
             (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are
             not acceptable methods of contraception. Female sterilization (have had surgical
             bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal
             ligation at least six weeks before the start of study treatment. In case of
             oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed
             by follow up hormone level assessment. Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to
             screening). The vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that subject.
             Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement of
             an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of hormonal
             contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for example hormone
             vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception. Sexually active males must use a
             condom during intercourse while taking the drug and for 30 days after stopping
             treatment and should not father a child in this period. A condom is required to be
             used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal
             fluid
