  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biomaterial-based cell culture models have been gaining increasing attention as potential
      therapeutic strategies. The purpose of this project is to evaluate whether the cell
      detachment ratio on pH-responsive chitosan could be correlated with the overall survival in
      lung cancer patients. Through controllable cell-material interaction, this project has the
      intention to develop an alternative tool for both early diagnosis and accurate prognosis in
      cancer therapeutics.

    <description>The purpose of this project is to evaluate whether the cell detachment ratio on pH-responsive chitosan could be correlated with the overall survival in lung cancer patients, hence serve as a prognostic factor for therapeutic strategies. The patient's information required for meta-analysis will be retrieved from medical records, and the log-term follow-up will be conducted.</description>
