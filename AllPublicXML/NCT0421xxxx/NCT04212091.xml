      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      antiviral activity of the monoclonal antibody PGT121.414.LS administered alone and in
      combination with VRC07-523LS via intravenous or subcutaneous infusions in healthy,
      HIV-uninfected adult participants.

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity
      of the monoclonal antibody PGT121.414.LS administered alone and in combination with
      VRC07-523LS via intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) infusions in healthy, HIV-uninfected
      adult participants.

      The study will be conducted in two parts (Part A and B). Part A will include four groups
      (Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4) and Part B will include two groups (Groups 5 and 6).

      In Part A of the study, PGT121.414.LS will be administered via IV infusion at 3, 10, or 30
      mg/kg (Groups 1-3) or via SC infusion at 5 mg/kg (Group 4). Participants in Part B will
      receive consecutive administration of PGT121.414.LS followed by VRC07-523LS, at 20 mg/kg IV
      each per dose (Group 5) or 5 mg/kg SC each per dose (Group 6). Participants will be followed
      for 32 weeks after the last study product administration via IV infusion and 24 weeks after
      the last study product administration via SC infusion.

      Participants in Groups 1, 2, and 3 will attend 8 months of study visits. Participants in
      Group 4 will attend 6 months of study visits. Part B participants will attend 16 months of
      study visits. Study visits may include physical examinations, blood and urine collection, and
      questionnaires.

                  ≤90 mm Hg diastolic, with or without medication, with only isolated, brief
                  instances of higher readings, which must be ≤150 mm Hg systolic and ≤100 mm Hg
                  diastolic. For these volunteers, blood pressure must be ≤140 mm Hg systolic and
                  ≤90 mm Hg diastolic at enrollment.

               -  If a person has NOT been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension
