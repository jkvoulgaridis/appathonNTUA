    <textblock>
      Prospective non randomized study of the feasibility of the insertion of Rocamed urethral
      device by hand manipulation, i.e., without use of cystoscopy, sonography or fluoroscopy.
      Patients with an acute urinary retention treated by Foley catheterization in the Emergency
      department have a few days later a trial of Foley removal in the ambulatory unit of the
      Urology department. In case of failure of the Foley removal trial, i.e., recurrence of
      urinary retention, patients will be proposed either the insertion of a new Foley or insertion
      of the urethral device. After signature of an informed consent, insertion of the urethral
      device will be performed after instillation in the urethra of a local anesthetic gel. Device
      insertion success rate and complications will be studied. The device will be left in place
      for one month. Tolerance and complications during the month with the device in place will be
      studied. At one month the device will be removed: the ease of retrieval of the device and
      complications will be studied. Patient and doctor satisfaction with the urethral device will
      be compared to patient and doctor satisfaction with the Foley.

    <description>Insertion after instillation of a local lubricant anesthetic gel in the urethra like for Foley insertion. Calibration of the urethral meatus with a 22F Bougie. Insertion of the Bougie until abutment against the posterior wall of the bulbous urethra just below the striated sphincter. Note depth of abutment on the scale of the Bougie. Retrieve the Bougie and glide the device to the same depth until abutment against the posterior wall of the bulbous urethra. At this stage the stent is correctly positioned. Stent release: unlock the Luer connection between pusher tube and stylet . Retrieve pusher tube, stylet and flattener tube.
Control of correct positioning: ask patient to stand up to verify the absence of any urine leak. Ask patient to void immediately to control clear urine output.</description>
