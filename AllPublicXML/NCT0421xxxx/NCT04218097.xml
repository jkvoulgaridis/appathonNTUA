  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a chronic disease. Its prevalence, which is constantly increasing, as well as the
      morbidity and mortality caused, require the development of new treatments, particularly for
      associated eating disorders. Indeed, it has been shown that a participation of abnormalities
      of food addiction type behaviour was frequently found in patients hospitalized for obesity
      (25% of patients). These disorders require specific management if you want to achieve a good
      weight result. The aim of the study is to compare the weight evolution of patients with
      addiction-type disorder (addict) versus those without addiction (non-addict) as well as the
      management modalities.

    <description>Obese type 2 and 3 with food addict according to the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) questionnaire.
Cohort design: identification of patients treated in hospital for obesity assessment over the period 1 January 2017 to 1 January 2018 whose addictive or non-addictive status was characterised by the YFAS questionnaire. To talk about food addiction, the person must have at least 3 out of 7 positive criteria AND also meet the &quot;marked suffering&quot; criterion.</description>
