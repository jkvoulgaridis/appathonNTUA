  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ocular toxoplasmosis is the most common cause of infectious uveitis worldwide. The diagnosis
      of ocular toxoplasmosis is primarily clinical when it is a typical presentation .With an
      atypical presentation in the fundus, parasitological diagnosis is a decisive contribution, as
      well as multimodal imaging. We investigate on vitreal, retinal, and choroidal morphologic
      changes in active and scarred toxoplasmosis lesions using swept source optical coherence
      tomography.

      A retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with ocular toxoplasmosis was conducted. The
      patients were examined at ophthalmology service of Farhat Hached Hospital in Sousse Tunisia
      between January 2002 and December 2017. Complete ophthalmologic examination and OCT were done
      at the initial visit and during follow-up.

    <description>Swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) is the latest milestone in retinal and choroidal imaging. Because its wavelength of 1050 nm, which is superior to the 840 nm of spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), it is able to overcome ocular opacities such as cataracts and vitritis, wich allows retinal and choroidal visualization of eyes whose fundus is not clearly visible. Consequently , SS-OCT allows visualization of the retinal and choroidal vascular networks, even in eyes with medium opacity</description>

        Nine eyes of nine patients consecutively diagnosed with ocular toxoplasmosis were included
        in this retrospective study. The patients were examined at ophthalmology service of Farhat
        Hached Hospital in Sousse Tunisia between January 2002 and December 2017
