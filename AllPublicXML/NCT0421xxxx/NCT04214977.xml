    <textblock>
      Anorectal surgeries are of the commonest elective surgeries that are performed worldwide
      under different types of anaesthesia. The aim of this prospective interventional study was to
      compare the use of general anaesthesia (GA) using a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) with spinal
      anesthesia (SA) in anorectal surgeries.

    <textblock>
      Anorectal surgeries are of the most frequently performed procedures worldwide. These
      procedures are commonly performed in prone position as it offers sufficient exposure and
      provides enough surgical space. Choosing the suitable anesthetic technique will help in
      reducing perioperative complications in patients undergoing surgical procedures in prone
      position, by taking into consideration changes in cardiovascular and pulmonary physiology,
      airway management, and proper positioning for the prevention of direct and indirect pressure
      injuries. The aim of this prospective interventional controlled study was to compare the use
      of general anesthesia (GA) using a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) with spinal anesthesia (SA) in
      anorectal surgeries.

    <description>In this group (L) the investigators defined induction time (T1) as the time from completion of initial monitoring until the patient is positioned prone. Emergence time (T2) was defined as the time from the end of surgical dressing till the removal of LMA in the supine position and the patient is ready for transfer to PACU.

In this group the investigators defined induction time (T1) as the time from the end of initial monitoring till the patient is positioned in prone position, and (T2) as the time from the end of surgical dressing till the patient is turned to supine position on the bed and ready to be transferred to PACU.</description>

    <description>Spinal anesthesia in sitting position was done under complete aseptic technique through a standard midline approach. One and a half millilitres of 0.5% bupivacaine (7.5 mg) was injected through a 25 Gauge pencil-point needle into the subarachnoid space at L3-L4 or L4-L5 interspace. All patients were kept in a head-up position for 3 minutes. The patient was then asked to turn him- or herself into the prone position on the surgical table with the help of the surgical and anesthetic teams.</description>

    <description>General anesthesia was induced using fentanyl 2 mcg/kg and Propofol 2-3 mg/kg. Any stomach contents were then suctioned through an oro-gastric tube to reduce the risk of regurgitation. Proper (weight-based) classic laryngeal mask airway was then blindly inserted. laryngeal mask airway was then properly fixed to the face and anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane 1-2% in 50% Oxygen/air mixture.</description>
