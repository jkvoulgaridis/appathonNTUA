  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients with early stage MF-CTCL (stage IA-IB) will be eligible for this study. A
      total of 100 early stage MF-CTCL patients diagnosed in the past year will be enrolled.

      Treatment with CL gel will be applied once daily to all skin areas affected by MF-CTCL and,
      for 8 weeks, one selected skin area unaffected by MF-CTCL (0.5% body surface area) until
      treatment response (complete response), study treatment duration completed (56 weeks),
      progression, or another withdrawal criterion is met.

      Depending on the type of skin drug-related reaction (if any) occurring after application of
      CL gel, this study will categorize patients into three different groups corresponding to
      three different treatment patterns:

        -  Group A: Patients with no skin drug reaction with CL gel application

        -  Group B: Patients developing a skin drug reaction of any grade with CL gel application,
           not due to allergic reaction to CL gel, will continue treatment at reduced application
           frequency

        -  Group C: Patients from Group B unable to tolerate reduced CL gel application frequency
           will apply a potent topical steroid twice daily in addition to CL gel applied every
           other day
