  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are 1) to explore the variability of decisions between different
      heart teams in complex coronary artery disease; 2) to evaluate the reasons of the discrepancy
      in decision making.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart team has been recommended by guideline for optimizing the decision making for patients
      with complex coronary artery diseases (CAD). However, prior studies have demonstrated that
      heart team decision might have poor reproducibility, and the variability of heart team
      decision remains unknown.

      Thus, the investigators designed a single-center, retrospective, cross-sectional study to
      explore the decision variability of heart team in CAD patients. The investigators will
      retrospectively recruit patients with angiographically confirmed 3-vessel or left main
      disease from a coronary angiography database at Fuwai hospital. Patients' baseline
      information will be collected. And different heart teams will be established and made
      decisions for the enrolled patients. First, the investigators will assess the decision
      variability between different heart teams. Secondary, the investigators will evaluate the
      reason of discrepancy by qualitative and quantitative analysis.
