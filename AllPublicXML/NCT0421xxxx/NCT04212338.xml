  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to examine the effect of music intervention in the
      before-intravitreal injection (IVTI) and during-IVTI periods on patients' anxiety, the
      sensation of pain, physiological variables, satisfaction, and surgeon-patient cooperation.
      The study used a randomized controlled experimental design. The study was conducted with a
      total of three groups: two experimental (Before-IVTI (Group1) and During-IVTI music
      intervention group (Group 2)) and one control group. Each of the experimental and control
      groups consisted of 75 patients. The patients' anxiety was evaluated using the VAS anxiety
      scale, pain using the VAS pain scale; surgeon-patient cooperation using the Numeric Rating
      Scale; and patient satisfaction with a 5-point likert-type satisfaction scale.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale for Anxiety (VAS-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>VAS-A is a measurement tool, in which 0 represents feeling &quot;no anxiety&quot; while 10 represents &quot;I feel extremely anxious&quot;.29 An increase in score indicates an increase in the anxiety experienced by the patient. This indicates that VAS-A is a reliable and accurate measurement tool despite its brevity. The VAS-A scale was applied to patients before, immediately after, and 15 minutes after the injection.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale for Pain (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>VAS scale is a single-dimensional scale that is commonly used to evaluate pain severity. According to the VAS, pain severity is rated from 0 (no pain) to 10 (the greatest imaginable pain). Any score under 3 on the scale is considered &quot;mild pain&quot;, scores between 3 and 6 are &quot;moderate pain&quot; and any score above 6 is &quot;severe pain&quot;. The VAS was applied both immediately after the injection and 15 minutes afterwards in order to determine the severity of the pain that the patients felt during the injection.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Surgeon-patient cooperation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) was used. This scale allows for a score of between 0 and 10 points.A score of 0 indicates that the patient was totally noncompliant with the surgeon's instructions and a score of 10 indicates that the patient was totally compliant. The NRS was used by the surgeon for each patient immediately after the conclusion of the injection.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>In this study, on the basis of the review of the literature, satisfaction was evaluated using a 5-point Likert-type scale. The patients were asked to respond &quot;Very Unsatisfied&quot;, &quot;Unsatisfied&quot;, &quot;Neutral&quot;, &quot;Satisfied&quot;, or &quot;Very Satisfied&quot;. The patients' levels of satisfaction were evaluated 15 minutes after the injection.</description>
