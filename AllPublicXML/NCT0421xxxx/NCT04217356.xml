  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see how effective hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HCT) is compared to best available non-transplant therapies (BAT) in
      patients with high risk myelofibrosis. This will be done by asking participants to choose the
      treatment that they prefer to receive (HCT or BAT) and then comparing the outcomes of the
      participants in both treatment groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is currently little information regarding which treatments are best for patients with
      myelofibrosis. On one hand, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is potentially
      curative treatment but is associated with significant risk of complications related to graft
      failure (the new donor cells does not grow properly after the transplant), side effects such
      as graft versus host disease (the patient's cells attack the new donor cells), and risk of
      infections. Non-transplant therapies such as ruxolitinib provide effective symptom control
      for few months to few years, but are not curative in nature. As such, this study will compare
      the effectiveness of HCT versus best available non-transplant therapies (BAT) in patients
      with high risk myelofibrosis.

      This is an observational study, meaning that participants will be followed to assess the
      effects of their treatment, but no intervention (treatments) will be given as a part of this
      study.
