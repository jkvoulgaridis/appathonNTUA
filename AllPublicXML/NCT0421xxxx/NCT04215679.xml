  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Virtual reality applications in hemiplegia rehabilitation are gaining popularity. It is
      claimed that, apart from implementing a function, imagining that function can trigger
      synaptic connections.

  <detailed_description>

      Although the effects of non-three-dimensional virtual reality and motor imagination on the
      brain have been investigated in a study, such comparison has not been made between the
      three-dimensional virtual reality and motor imagery.

      Considering these situations, the aim of this study is to compare the effect of
      three-dimensional (immersive) virtual reality and motor imagery on upper extremity functional
      recovery after stroke.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Jebsen Hand Function Test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The test consists of 7 subtitles and is an objective and standardized test. The test consists of 7 subtitles: &quot;writing a standard sentence&quot;, &quot;flipping 5 cards&quot;, &quot;picking up small objects&quot;, &quot;feeding simulation&quot;, &quot;arranging backgammon checkers&quot;, &quot;carrying large light objects&quot; and &quot;carrying large heavy objects&quot;. The score of the test is the completion time of the test and is recorded in seconds</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Action Reach Arm Test (ARAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is scored between 0-57 points and consists of 4 headings: gross grip, fine grip, fingertip grip, and gross motion. Each part is calculated over 3 points. 3 points mean that the test is done in a normal way, 2 points show the difficulty and abnormally long time for doing it, 1 point means that individual can partially complete the test and 0 points can not complete the test. The higher the score, the better the level.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke impact scale (SIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Turkish validity was done by Hantal et al. in 2014. It is a 9-stage scale that is scored between 0-57 points, with a higher score indicating a better condition and a lower score indicating a higher severity of stroke. Scoring is done separately for each title</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kinesthetic and visual imagery questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It was developed in 2007 by Malouin et al. In this method, the participant is told about the desired movement and is asked to do so. Then the participant is asked to imagine as if he was watching the movement without making any movement. It is scored between 1-5 points. 1: no image, 5: as clear as the original. At the other stage, he is asked to imagine himself by feeling what he is doing and is scored between 1 and 5 points. 1 point: no sense, 5 points mean intense feeling as if he is making the move. The scale assesses both visual and kinesthetic imagery with each dimension being scored from 5 to 25 with higher scores indicating greater imagery clarity or intensity.</description>

    <description>In this group, individuals will be included in a game program that will last for 3 days a week for a total of 6 weeks and 45 minutes a day. Individuals will use the IVR to rehabilitate functions that are frequently used in daily life through task-oriented games. The IVR device will be placed on the head of the individual by closing the eyes of the individual and the Leap Motion device will be used to enable individuals to see their own hands in a virtual reality environment. In order to ensure the safety of individuals, practices shall be carried out with the individual sitting in the chair and leaning against the back. A total of 3 different games will be used for upper extremity function, each game will be 15 minutes and the total session time will be 45 minutes.</description>

    <description>Motor imagery will be performed with the eyes closed. In addition, for the safety of the individual, the individual will sit comfortably in a chair in a quiet environment and sit back. In the motor imagery group, individuals will be shown videos of the 3 games for 2 times in the IVR group and will be asked to imagine that they perform the same functions in the IVR games. The motor imagery will be 3 days a week for a total of 6 weeks and 45 minutes per day (including rest periods).</description>

    <description>Individuals in this group will be randomly recruited from hospitalized stroke volunteers. Since these individuals receive routine rehabilitation 5 days a week, they will be evaluated at the beginning and end of 18 sessions over a total period of 6 weeks. Conventional physiotherapy will include normal joint movements, muscle strengthening exercises, balance and mobility exercises, and exercises to improve daily life activity.</description>
