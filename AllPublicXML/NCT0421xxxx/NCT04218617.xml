  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spine radiosurgery (SRS) utilizes advanced treatment planning with focused x-rays to deliver
      one to four high dose treatments to the spine to help relieve pain and/or neurologic
      symptoms. Spine SRS uses special equipment to position the participant and guide the focused
      beams toward the area to be treated and away from normal tissue.

      One of the side effects of spine SRS is the development of vertebral compression fractures,
      many of which are not painful. The goal of this study is to compare the effects, good and/or
      bad, of spine SRS given in 1 or 2 treatments. Our main goal is to find out which approach
      will reduce the chances of developing vertebral compression fractures.

      The primary objective of this study is to establish the non-inferiority in vertebral
      compression fracture (VCF) incidence at 6 months between single-fraction and two-fraction
      sSRS.

      Other objectives are to to evaluate the 12-month impact of single- and two-fraction sSRS on
      local control (LC), pain control (PC), quality of life (QOL), and toxicity (specifically,
      pain flare, radiation esophagitis/laryngitis/pharyngitis, and radiation myelitis)

      This study is planned as a two-arm randomized phase II trial to establish non-inferiority of
      single fraction sSRS compared to two-fraction sSRS. Approximately 130 participants will be
      enrolled in this trial; 65 participants in each arm:

        -  Group 1: If you are assigned to this group, you will undergo spine radiosurgery in a
           single (1) session.

        -  Group 2: If you are assigned to this group, you will undergo spine radiosurgery in two
           (2) sessions.

    <description>PC at each treated vertebral level assessed by the BPI [9 item questionnaire (range: 0-10), higher scores = worse pain], then defined by RTOG 0631 as follows:
Complete relief (CR): Pain score of 0 at index site 3 mo post-treatment. CR is requisite of no increase in narcotic analgesics.
Partial relief (PR): Reduction in BPI of ≥ 3 points at index site, provided other treated lesions have increased in pain score and participant did not require increase in narcotic analgesics for site of interest. Participants needing increase in narcotics for site will not be scored as having PR. Those needing increase in narcotics for a distant site will remain eligible for CR/PR.
Stable response (SR): Post-treatment pain score same as or within 2 points of baseline score at index site with no increase in narcotic analgesics for site of interest.
Progressive pain: Post-treatment increase of at least 3 points from baseline pain score at index site or increase in narcotics for site of interest.</description>

The answers to the items on the scales refer to &quot;last week,&quot; except the patient's physical functioning scale whose time frame is the present.
