  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excessive oxygen administration is known to cause oxidative stress, and absorption
      atelectasis. Hyperoxia is very common in general anesthesia settings. Even though there are
      concerns in using excessive oxygen during general anesthesia, the optimal fraction of
      inspired oxygen (FiO2) for general anesthesia is not well studied.

      The oxygen reserve index (ORI) is a parameter which can evaluate partial pressure of oxygen
      (PaO2) rating from 0 to 1. There are growing evidences in ORI that it might be helpful to
      reduce hyperoxia in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit, as well as in general
      anesthesia.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate efficacy of oxygen reserve index to reduce hyperoxemia
      in major abdominal surgery.
