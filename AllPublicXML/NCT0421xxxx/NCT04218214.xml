  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an implementation project to develop a model to support implementation of LIFE-DM, an
      evidence-based practice (EBP) program that integrates depression management with microfinance
      services to address both poverty and depression among low-income women in Vietnam. This
      evaluation is a mixed methods study that will 1) describe the development of
      community-partnered implementation process, 2) study the effectiveness of the training and
      implementation support plan on provider and patient outcomes, and 3) identify factors that
      impact implementation success.

      Livelihood Integration for Effective Depression Management (LIFE-DM) aims to address the dual
      challenges of poverty and depression faced by women in Vietnam by integrating evidence-based
      treatment for depression management and microfinance services. With funding from NIMH, the
      investigators established initial evidence for the effectiveness of LIFE-DM in reducing
      depression and improving functioning, social support, self-efficacy, and income at six
      months. These treatment effects were maintained at twelve months, suggesting that the LIFE-DM
      program may be an effective strategy to break the cycle of depression and poverty in
      low-income women.

      For the Grand Challenges of Canada (GCC) Transition to Scale Grant, the investigators
      developed a model to scale up the program in the public health and social system across two
      provinces, Danang and Thua Thien Hue through 1) the training of local trainers from the
      psychiatric hospital to support local implementation, 2) development of a supervision model,
      and 3) use of a learning collaborative.

      To evaluate the success of the model, the investigators will conduct a mixed methods
      implementation study that will assess implementation and patient outcomes according to the
      RE-AIM framework, as well as identify barriers and facilitators to implementation.

    <description>Patients will be assessed for depression using self-reported depression measure (PHQ). The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day). Total scores are used and they range from 0 to 27, with PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively.</description>

    <description>Supervisor Rated LIFE-DM session adherence and quality. Supervision of groups involve observation of group facilitation by supervisors, who provide adherence and quality ratings of sessions. Each item is assessed on a 4 point scale - 0 (did not do), 1 (delivered but poor), 2 (average), and 3 (excellent). The items are averaged to provide a session specific score of adherence and quality. Session adherence / quality scores are used to compute provider level adherence and quality averages. Each supervisor was expected to provide ratings for a minimum of 3 assessments out of the 12 group sessions. These session ratings are used to compute the average adherence and quality score for each provider.</description>

    <description>Patient - SF-12 - Change in functioning from baseline to 6 months. The SF-12 Health Survey is a 12-item subset of the SF-36v2â„¢ that measures the same eight domains of health (Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional, Mental Health). It is a brief, reliable measure of overall health status. Scores are calibrated so that 50 is the average score or norm. This norm-based score allows comparison among the three surveys and across the more than 19,000 studies published in the past 20 years</description>

    <description>Patient - McMaster Family Functioning Scale - Change from baseline to 6 months. This is a 12 item scale (on a 4 point scale). the average score across items is used to determine the degree of problematic family functioning. A score of 2.00 or above indicates problematic family functioning. The higher the score, the more problematic the family member perceives the family's overall functioning.</description>

        Study participants are recruited from community health clinics that are implementing
        LIFE-DM and depression care services in the GCC funded transition to scale grant. These
        participants are 18-60 years old, have elevated depressive symptoms (PHQ 9 &gt; 9), have
        economic disadvantage, and are interested in participating in an integrated depression and
        livelihood program. Patients with severe mental illness, such as psychosis, mania,
        substance abuse, or high risk of suicide are also excluded and referred to psychiatric
        hospital for higher level of care. Those who have disabilities, significant cognitive
        impairments, and chronic illness that may interfere with their ability to participate in
        group therapy are also excluded and referred to other more individualized support.
