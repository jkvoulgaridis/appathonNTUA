  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, most analgesic regimens for painful bedside procedures rely on pharmacologic
      sedation or high doses of opioids (e.g.: nurse-administered IV opioids, anxiolytics, and
      sedatives; patient-controlled analgesia; anesthesiologist-administered sedation; and
      occasionally general anesthesia). Pharmacologic interventions are frequently associated with
      suboptimal analgesia, opioid-induced side effects, requirement for increased monitoring due
      to over sedation, and progressive acute tolerance to opioids over time, particularly with
      multiple/repeat procedures.

      Alternative, non-pharmacologic strategies may help reduce pain, side-effects and opioid
      tolerance associated with painful bedside procedures. These strategies have not been studied
      as extensively, but are becoming more important in view of the current national opioid
      crisis. In particular, with recent technologic advancements, virtual reality (VR) has emerged
      as a non-pharmacologic modality for analgesia and anxiolysis, which can have tremendous
      benefits in acute pain management.

      VR provides an immersive, realistic, often interactive experience for the user. It is
      frequently described as &quot;transporting&quot; the user to an alternate environment, with the use of
      high-fidelity head-mounted displays (HMD), noise-cancelling headsets, and a complete
      audio-visual experience. The user's sense of &quot;presence&quot; in the VR environment is crucial in
      providing patient engagement, and correlates with non-pharmacologic pain control.

      VR has been shown to provide non-pharmacologic analgesia in children and adults undergoing
      painful procedures such as bedside wound care, burn treatment, and physical therapy. The use
      of VR during painful bedside procedures is one specific setting which offers a good starting
      point to investigate this technology for acute pain management.

      Our study wishes to determine if VR plus standard therapy provides superior analgesia for
      painful bedside procedures (e.g. burn treatment, wound care) compared with standard therapy
      alone. Our primary outcome is a reduction in pain scores by 30%, as measured by a numerical
      analog scale (NAS) during painful bedside procedures. The investigators will use a
      randomized, cross-over study design in which hospitalized patients receiving repeated painful
      bedside procedures, will be randomized to 2 groups. Group A will have an initial painful
      bedside procedure under standard treatment only, and a repeat procedure under standard
      treatment + VR. Group B will have an initial procedure under standard treatment +VR, and a
      subsequent one under standard treatment. Questionnaires including pain scores and secondary
      outcomes will be administered to each patient before and after the bedside procedure. A
      convenience sample of patients will be recruited over 1 year (anticipated N~30).

    <description>Virtual reality (VR) will be used in addition to standard analgesic practices during painful bedside procedures. A head mounted display (HMD, Oculus Go Model #1KWPH812PN8354) and noise-cancelling headphones (Sony Model #MDRZ110B) will be provided to the patient during the procedure. This unit involves the patient wearing VR goggles, noise-cancelling headphones, and using a smartphone-based program with various applications the patient can choose from for analgesia/relaxation (eg: calming imagery/scenery of nature, activities involving mindfulness, interactive games or guided imagery, music and imagery, exercise imagery...etc). There are numerous, standard applications available for the patient to choose from, and the choice of most optimal application for analgesia, distraction, or anxiolysis will be left to the decision of the patient prior to their procedure.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients undergoing recurrent painful bedside procedures during hospitalization (at
             least 2 similar procedures during the course of hospital stay eg: wound dressing
             change)

          -  Anticipated duration of bedside procedure less than or equal to 2 hours

          -  Patients 18 years or older and able to provide informed consent

          -  Patients experiencing pain and/or anxiety from their bedside procedure (these patients
             are expected to benefit most from the analgesic/anxiolytic effects of VR).

          -  Patients who not wish to observe the painful bedside procedure (VR unit will provide
             sensory distraction and immersive experience, with HMD/goggles/headset, that allows
             patient not to witness procedure).

          -  Patients with adequate vision and hearing (with hearing aids if necessary) - patients
             with sensory limitations may not be able to benefit from the full effects of the VR
             sensory stimulation.

          -  Patients who are medically stable (should be free of acute conditions that could be
             dangerous when using VR)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active seizure disorder, recent stroke (within 3 months), elevated intracranial
             pressure (visual and/or auditory stimulation may cause concerns with worsening acute
             central nervous system conditions)

          -  High risk for or active substance withdrawal; active substance intoxication (VR
             stimulation may worsen symptoms associated with substance intoxication and withdrawal)

          -  Active delirium (may preclude safe and effective use of VR as intended for anxiolysis
             and analgesia)

          -  Poor vision and hearing (precludes VR stimuli from being effective if the patient has
             sensory impairments that prevent them from seeing/hearing the VR effects)

          -  Open head/neck wound or head/neck injuries precluding safe use or wearing of the VR
             unit (headset, HMD, headphones)

          -  Body parasites, active eye infection, or other infectious diseases requiring contact
             isolation, droplet isolation, or airborne isolation (this exclusion limits the
             possibility of transmitting infectious diseases between patients with the use of the
             VR unit)
