  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center prospective cross-sectional study to determine the burden of decline
      in intrinsic capacity and functional ability, and the prevalence of geriatric syndromes, such
      as frailty, and disability in adult people living with HIV (PLWH) in Asia.

      This research project is expected to have the following clinical impact

        1. To understand the impact of impaired functional status in PLWH in Asia would be
           important to determine the long-term health burden needs in this aging population in
           this part of the world.

        2. The identification of risk factors associated with impaired functional status would be
           important to guide clinical decisions in patient management, such as the choice of
           anti-retroviral regimen, and screening of and early intervention for modifiable risk
           factors. These are of paramount importance in the promotion of healthy aging in this
           population.

        3. This proposed cross-sectional study lays the foundation for the establishment of a
           longitudinal cohort for long-term follow up of people aging with HIV in Asia, with the
           objectives of evaluating the long-term impact of aging on clinical outcomes and
           functional status in PLWH in this region.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional disability</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Functional disability is defined as any difficulty in any of the six areas of functioning in daily life as assessed by WHO DAS II questionnaire</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Composite score for intrinsic capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The score is based on (i) self-reported questions assessing the subjects' eight health domains, including mobility, self-care, cognition, interpersonal activities, vision, pain and discomfort, sleep and energy, and affect, and (ii) measures of grip strength, short physical performance battery and cognitive function</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical performance</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Physical performance is measured by six-metre usual gait speed. Low physical performance is defined as usual gait speed â‰¤0.8 m/s</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive decline</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive decline is defined as presence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) according to &quot;Frascati Criteria&quot;. Asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI) involves impairment of cognitive functioning in at least two ability domains, in the absence of interference in everyday functioning. Mild neurocognitive disorder (MND) also involves impairment in at least two ability domains, with at least mild interference in daily functioning. HIV-associated dementia (HAD) requires marked impairment in cognitive functioning in at least two ability domains, in the presence of marked impairment in day-to-day functioning</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frailty</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Frailty is measured using the frailty index</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sarcopenia</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Sarcopenia is defined as height-adjusted skeletal muscle mass &lt;7.0 kg/m2 in men and 5.7 kg/m2 in women using BIA</description>
