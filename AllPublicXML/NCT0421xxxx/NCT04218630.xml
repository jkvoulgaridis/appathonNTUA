  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigated the effects of reformer pilates exercises in Fibromyalgia, which is a
      chronic musculoskeletal disease characterized by widespread pain in the body, on number of
      painful regions, disease activity, lower extremity muscle strength, functional mobility,
      balance, kinesophobia, fatigue, sleep quality, biopsychosocial status and quality of life and
      compared effects of clinical pilates-based home pilates which is performed on a mat.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, effects of reformer pilates were evaluated by comparing with home mat pilates
      method. A total of 28 volunteer women who were diagnosed with FM according to the American
      College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2016 criteria were included in the study. Reformer pilates
      group had 14 participants, home mat pilates group had 14 participants.

      All individuals were evaluated by same physiotherapist according to standardized test
      protocols and in the same conditions at baseline and at the end of 6th week. Number of
      painful regions with Pain Location Inventory (PLI), disease activity with Fibromyalgia Impact
      Questionnaire (FIQ), lower extremity muscle strength with Chair Test, functional mobility
      with The Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), balance with Single Leg Stance Test, kinesiophobia with
      Tampa Kinesiophobia Scale, fatigue with Fatigue Severity Scale, sleep quality with Pittsburgh
      Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), biopsychosocial status with Cognitive Exercise Therapy Approach-
      Biopsychosocial Questionnaire (BETY-BQ) and quality of life with Short Form-36 (SF-36) were
      evaluated.

      Pilates exercises were performed by a certified and experienced physiotherapist in this field
      as two different methods (reformer group and home mat group) in 2 times a week for 6 weeks.
      Before starting treatment program, 5 key elements of clinical pilates exercises, which are
      breathing, focus, and placement of the rib cage, shoulder, head and neck, were taught to all
      patients. Participants were encouraged to focus and maintain these 5 key elements during all
      exercises.

      Data were assessed using SPSS (Version 21.0). Continuous variables were stated as average,
      standard deviation and percentage. When parametric test assumptions were provided the
      Independent Samples Test was used, when parametric test assumptions were not provided
      Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the differences between the independent groups. When
      parametric test assumptions were provided, the Paired Simple T Test was used, when parametric
      test assumptions were not provided, Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the
      differences between the dependent groups. P value &lt;0.05 was considered as statistically
      significant.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>It is a questionnaire consisting of 10 questions which assess physical health, work status, depression, anxiety, sleep, pain, fatigue, stiffness and well-being in order to evaluate health status and physical functionality of individuals with fibromyalgia.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Location Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Participants mark the areas in which feel pain in last seven days from the 28 parts of the body. The score is between 0-28. Higher scores indicate having more number of painful body regions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Chair Test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>In this test, which evaluates lower extremity muscle strength, participants sit and stand up as fast as possible for 30 seconds in a standard chair which is an average height of 44 cm and without back support and arm support. The number of repetitions which are completed were recorded</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Timed Up and Go Test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>In this test, where functional mobility was evaluated, the evaluation was started while the participant was sitting in the chair. It recorded the time that a participant took to rise from a chair, walked three meters, turned around, walked back to the chair, and sat down</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Single Leg Stance Test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This test evaluate participant's balance. The participant must stand unassisted on one leg and is timed in seconds from the time one foot is flexed off the floor to the time when it touches the ground.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Tampa Kinesiophobia Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>It is a 17-item scale that assesses fear of movement/ repeat injury. The range of total score are from 17 to 68. High score indicates that the person has high kinesiophobia</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue Severity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>It was developed to evaluate the severity of fatigue in the last week. The range of total score are from 1 to 7. Higher scores indicate more severity of fatigue</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>It was developed to identify good and poor sleep and to evaluate sleep quality. Scoring of the answers is based on a 0 to 3 scale, whereby 3 reflects the negative extreme on the Likert Scale. A global sum of &quot;5&quot;or greater indicates a &quot;poor&quot; sleeper.</description>
