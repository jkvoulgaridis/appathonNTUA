      This phase II trial studies how well chemotherapy and radiation therapy alone works compared
      to chemotherapy and radiation therapy plus MEDI4736 (durvalumab) immunotherapy in treating
      bladder cancer which has spread to the lymph nodes. Drugs used in standard chemotherapy work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high-energy
      x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Immunotherapy with durvalumab may induce
      changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread. Giving chemotherapy and radiation therapy with the addition of durvalumab may work
      better in helping tumors respond to treatment compared to chemotherapy and radiation therapy
      alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To compare the clinical complete response rate (cCR) after chemoradiotherapy (chemoRT)
      with or without MEDI4736 (durvalumab) in node-positive bladder cancer patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the toxicity profile in both arms using the Common Terminology Criteria for
      Adverse Events (CTCAE).

      II. To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) in both arms. III. To estimate overall
      survival (OS) post randomization in both arms. IV. To estimate the bladder intact event free
      survival (BIEFS) in both arms. V. To estimate the metastasis free survival (MFS) in both
      arms. VI. To estimate bladder cancer specific survival in both arms. VII. To estimate the
      complete clinical response duration in both arms. VIII. To estimate salvage cystectomy rates
      in both arms.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Planned subgroup analyses for clinical outcome (clinical complete response [CR] rate post
      chemoRT+/- MEDI4736 [durvalumab], MFS, OS, PFS) based on stratification factors.

      TRANSLATIONAL OBJECTIVE:

      I. To collect specimens- urine, blood, stool and tissue, at pre- and post-treatment, at 6
      months and 12 months' time from completing chemoRT+/- MEDI4736 (durvalumab) to determine
      predictive or prognostic markers.

      OUTLINE:

      STEP 1 - REGISTRATION: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients registered after completion of &gt;= 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy proceed
      to Step 2 - Randomization.

      ARM B: Chemotherapy naive patients receive 1 of 4 chemotherapy regimens: gemcitabine
      hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 8 every 21 days for 3
      cycles; carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30-60 minutes
      on days 1 and 8 every 21 days for 3 cycles; gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30-60 minutes
      on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin IV 30-60 minutes on day 1 every 21 days for 3 cycles; or
      methotrexate IV over 3 minutes, vinblastine sulfate IV over 3 minutes, doxorubicin
      hydrochloride IV over 5 minutes, and cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1 every 14 days
      for 3 cycles. Cycles repeat in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      STEP 2 - RANDOMIZATION: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM C: Patients undergo radiation therapy for 6-8 weeks. Beginning 4 days before or after
      starting radiation therapy, patients receive durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Cycles
      repeat every 21 days for 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Beginning 4 days before or after starting radiation therapy, patients also receive
      gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30-60 minutes twice weekly for 6 weeks; cisplatin IV over
      30-60 minutes for 6 weeks; or mitomycin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of radiation and
      fluorouracil IV on days 1-5 and 16-20 of radiation in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM D: Patients undergo radiation therapy for 6-8 weeks. Beginning 4 days before or after
      starting radiation therapy, patients also receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30-60
      minutes twice weekly for 6 weeks; cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes for 6 weeks; or mitomycin
      IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of radiation and fluorouracil IV on days 1-5 and 16-20 of
      radiation in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      STEP 3 - REGISTRATION (POST CONCURRENT CHEMORT +/- DURVALUMAB): Patients are assigned to 1 of
      2 arms.

      ARM E: Patients previously randomized to Arm C (chemoradiation and durvalumab) who achieve
      clinical CR or clinical benefit receive durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat
      every 28 days for 9 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM F: Patients previously randomized to Arm D who achieve clinical CR or clinical benefit,
      or patients previously randomized to Arm C with no clinical CR or clinical benefit undergo
      observation.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 1 year,
      every 6 months for 1 years, annually for 1 year, and then every 3 months for 3 years.

             The patient cannot start radiation treatment prior to successful completion of this
             pre-treatment review. Therefore, careful planning is necessary to meet the deadline of
             starting radiation with approximately 3 weeks of randomization and within 12 weeks of
             the end of induction chemotherapy. We anticipate that the radiation oncologist should
             get at least 3 weeks of time between CT simulation and start of chemoRT

          -  Chemoradiotherapy should be planned to start up to 12 weeks after the end of induction
             chemotherapy, but after imaging and cystoscopic restaging, randomization, and any
             pretreatment radiation quality assurance (QA) that is required

          -  Women must not be pregnant or breast-feeding due to the potential harm to an unborn

                  a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 3) has not been naturally
                  postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out
                  childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses
                  at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months)

          -  Women of childbearing potential and sexually active males must not expect to conceive
             or father children by using accepted and effective method(s) of contraception or by

               -  Computed tomography (CT) chest, abdomen, or pelvis. Magnetic resonance imaging
                  (MRI) pelvis can be used instead of CT per treating physician discretion. The
                  imaging must be done within 4 weeks prior to randomization

               -  Cystoscopic evaluation and attempt to perform maximal transurethral resection of
                  bladder tumor (TURBT) performed by the participating urologist ideally within 8
                  weeks but up to 10 weeks is allowed prior to randomization. If maximal TURBT is
                  not possible for medical reasons, the enrollment must be discussed and approved
                  with the study chair. Documentation of correspondences with the study chair must
                  be kept of file

          -  Autoimmune conditions: Patient must not have a history of active or prior documented
             autoimmune disease within the past 2 years

               -  NOTE: Patient with vitiligo, Grave's disease, eczema or psoriasis (not requiring
                  systemic treatment within the past 2 years) are not excluded. Patients with
                  history of completely resolved childhood asthma or atopy are not excluded.
                  Patients with asthma not requiring more than 10mg/d or equivalent of prednisone
                  are not excluded. Patient with well-controlled hypothyroidism on thyroxine
                  replacement will be eligible as well. Patients with
