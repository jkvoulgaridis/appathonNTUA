      This study is a multicenter RCT to compare 2-year progression free survival(PFS) rate, PFS,
      overall survival(OS) and life quality of endonasal endoscopic surgery versus IMRT.

      Local and regional recurrence is a common cause of failure after primary radiotherapy for
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Radiotherapy and surgery are the treatments of choice for recurrent
      NPC. This study aims to compare 2 year PFS rate of surgery versus IMRT.A stratified-block
      randomized approach will be used to randomly assign patients into two treatment groups after
      stratification according to T staging (rT1-2 vs rT3-4). 78 patients with rNPC will be
      recruited and randomized into two groups in 1:1 ratio. The primary outcomes will be 2 year
      progression free survival rate(PFS),the secondary outcome measures will be progression free
      survival time(PFS), overall survival(OS) and life quality.Assessment will be performed at
      baseline and 2 years post-randomization.
