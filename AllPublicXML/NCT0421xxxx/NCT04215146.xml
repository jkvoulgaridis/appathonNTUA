  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out the possible anti-cancer effect of pelareorep in
      combination with chemotherapy [paclitaxel] and avelumab in treating a type of breast cancer
      called Hormone Receptor positive (HR+)/Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2
      negative(HER2-) breast cancer, which is either locally advanced or has metastasized (cancer
      that has spread in your body). The study will investigate if pelareorep in combination with
      paclitaxel and avelumab is more effective than paclitaxel alone, or pelareorep and
      paclitaxel. The safety of the combination treatments will also be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label randomized Phase 2, 3-cohort study to evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of pelareorep, paclitaxel and avelumab in Hormone Receptor+ (HR+)/Human Epidermal Growth
      Factor Receptor 2 negative (HER2-) with endocrine-refractory metastatic breast cancer.

      Patients will be randomized to one of three treatment cohorts: paclitaxel alone, pelareorep +
      paclitaxel, or pelareorep + paclitazel + avelumab. A three patient safety run-in will be
      conducted in the cohort for pelareorep + paclitazel + avelumab prior to beginning
      randomization into all three cohorts.

      Patients will give mandatory blood samples and optional tumor biopsies, which will be
      analyzed for biomarkers to determine the immunological changes within the tumor
      microenvironment and peripheral blood in patients treated with paclitaxel alone, in
      combination with pelareorep, and in combination with pelareorep and avelumab.
