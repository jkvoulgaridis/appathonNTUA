  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect on hematological markers of nutritional
      intervention on nutritionally deficient patients following total joint replacement surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Numerous pre-operative modifiable variables have been extensively investigated for their
      effect on outcomes in TJA. These include metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus,
      obesity, and smoking status (11-13). However, nutritional status has not been as thoroughly
      investigated; to date, no prospective randomized control study has assessed the effect of
      oral nutritional supplementation for malnourished patients. This study will be a novel
      investigation into the role for routine serum screening for malnutrition as well as oral
      nutritional supplementation in TJA patients. This study could serve as a stepping stone
      towards creating a new pathway to highlight at-risk patients and pre-operatively optimizing
      their outcomes after TJA.

    <description>Biological specimen collection and laboratory evaluations- all included patients' hematologic markers of malnutrition (albumin, pre-albumin, and transferrin) will be recorded at 2 weeks prior to surgery, the day of surgery, and 6 weeks. These blood tests can all be performed from one sample of blood at each visit. The results will then be accessed via the EMR</description>

    <description>Ensure Max Protein Shake is an over the counter available drinkable nutritional supplement. Per serving, it contains:
160 Calories, 20 from fat
2g Total fat
0.5g Saturated fat
20mg Cholesterol
135mg Sodium
170mg Potassium
19g Total carbohydrate
&lt;1g Fiber

Participants will receive Ensure High Protein for 2 weeks pre- and 4 weeks post-operatively. These patients will be instructed to consume 1 serving (16fl oz) of Ensure High Protein daily. They will be provided with this product at a pre-operative clinical visit or have it mailed to their home. Hematologic nutritional values will be measured as specified previously.
Descriptive statistics will be used to report baseline characteristics and primary study objectives. Hematologic outcomes will be compared between the control (&quot;NO ENSURE&quot;) and oral supplementation (&quot;ENSURE&quot;) arms for the aforementioned baseline and perioperative variables</description>
