  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain health and cognitive functioning can be affected by aging. Exercise is a potentially
      effective method for promoting &quot;successful brain aging&quot; by improving cardiovascular fitness,
      brain function and possibly sleep quality. This project will measure the effects of exercise
      on brain health and attempt to develop a better way to track brain health, by measuring brain
      activity during sleep.

    <textblock>
      There exists a critical need to develop biomarkers of brain age and for scientifically proven
      interventions to improve brain health. Previously, a machine learning algorithm, the Brain
      Age Index (BAI), was developed to predict brain age (BA) based on 510 features derived from
      an overnight sleep EEG. The algorithm reports how old an individual's sleeping brain activity
      &quot;looks&quot;, called the &quot;brain age&quot; (BA), and compares this with the chronological age (CA). The
      difference is the BAI: BAI = BA-CA. Prior work suggests that patients with significant
      neurological or psychiatric disease or hypertension and diabetes exhibit a mean excess brain
      age, or &quot;brain age index&quot; (BAI), of 4 and 3.5 years relative to healthy controls. Moreover,
      it has been shown that high BAI is an independent predictor of mortality. Each extra year of
      BAI yields a 3.3% relative increase in the risk of death. Work from other groups suggest that
      exercise is potentially effective for promoting &quot;successful brain aging&quot;.

      Studies of exercise effects on cognition include a metanalysis of 18 prior studies that
      analyzed the results of exercise on cognitive function in older adults. It was found that
      aerobic fitness training improved performance across several cognitive domains, including
      executive function, cognitive control, spatial processing, and processing speed, with an
      average improvement across studies and across all domains of 0.5 standard deviations relative
      to controls. Improvement was greatest for executive and control processes. The degree of
      improvement was also related to the length of the ﬁtness-training intervention, duration of
      training sessions, and gender (females appeared to benefit more). Studies of exercise effects
      on brain structure include a prior study that enrolled 35 older adults (14 with Mild
      Cognitive Impairment, 16 healthy controls) to participate in a 12-week moderate-intensity
      walking program. Subjects' VO2max increased by an average of 8.49%. The degree to which
      cardiorespiratory fitness (V̇O2peak) improved due to the intervention was strongly positively
      correlated with widespread changes in cortical thickness. Taken together, these and other
      studies suggest that aerobic exercise may be an effective intervention to counteract cortical
      atrophy due to aging and disease and might provide protection against future cognitive
      decline in at-risk older adults.

      This study hypothesizes that cognitive performance will increase after 12 weeks of regular
      exercise (1a), EEG-based BAI will be lower after 12 weeks of regular exercise (1b), and
      improvements of cognitive measures are predictable from changes in BAI (1c). Additionally, it
      is hypothesized that an excess BAI will correlate with poor sleep quality, higher
      pre-existing comorbidities, poor diet, and small social network (2). Sedentary subjects who
      undergo the 12-week exercise training program are anticipated to show measurable improvements
      in EEG-based brain age and cognitive function, and that the degree of improvement will be
      related to the degree of improvement in aerobic fitness. This study will provide preliminary
      data to support a larger and longer longitudinal study designed to 1) Clinically validate
      novel, low-cost, and patient-friendly EEG-based biomarkers of brain health; and 2) Assess the
      effectiveness of interventions aimed at preserving and improving brain health and ultimately
      extending healthspan.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Brain Age Index (BAI) algorithm reports how old an individual's sleeping brain activity &quot;looks&quot;, called the &quot;brain age&quot; (BA), and compares this with the chronological age (CA). The difference is the Brain Age Index (BAI), which is calculated by subtracting the Chronological Age (CA) from the calculated Brain Age (BA): BAI = BA-CA.
A higher BAI can reflect worse clinical outcomes (e.g. increase mortality risk) while a lower BAI can reflect better clinical outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in cognitive performance (as measured via the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox Cognition battery) after a 12-week aerobic exercise program.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The NIH Toolbox Cognition battery is a composite of 7 tests [Picture Vocabulary (PV), Reading Test (RT), Flanker, Dimensional Change Card Sort (DCCS), Picture Sequence Memory (PSM), List Sorting (LS), Pattern Comparison (PC)] assessing language, receptive vocabulary, executive function, attention, working/short-term/episodic memory, cognitive flexibility, processing speed, prior education, verbal intelligence. Uncorrected, Age-corrected, and Fully-Corrected scores (mean =100,100,50 and StdDev=15,15,10 respectively) are calculated for each test. Composite scores are given for Fluid, Crystallized, and overall Cognitive Function. The Fluid Composite Score is derived by averaging the std. scores of the Flanker, DCCS, PSM, LS and PC tests. The Crystallized Composite Score is derived by averaging the std. scores of the PV &amp; RT. The Cognitive Function Composite Score is derived by averaging the Fluid &amp; Crystallized std. scores. Higher scores indicate higher levels of cognitive functioning.</description>

    <measure>Association between brain age index (BAI) and pre-existing co-morbidity (as measured via the Charlson Co-morbidity Index).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Charlson Co-morbidity Index (CCI) assesses 17 categories that together evaluates a patient's ten-year survival. Each co-morbidity category has an associated weight (from 1 to 6), based on the adjusted risk of mortality or resource use, and the sum of all the weights result in a single co-morbidity score for a patient. A score of zero indicates that no co-morbidities were found. The higher the score, the more likely the predicted outcome will result in mortality or higher resource use.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The 14-item Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) is a brief questionnaire assessing adherence to the Mediterranean diet. It consists of a total of 14 questions that characterize key food groups commonly consumed as part of a traditional Mediterranean diet (12 questions about frequency of food consumption; two questions about food intake habits). Answers are summed to a total Mediterranean diet score ranging from 0 to 14, with higher scores indicating greater adherence.</description>

    <measure>Association between brain age index (BAI) and social network (as measured via the Social Network Index).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Cohen's Social Network Index (SNI) assesses the size, diversity, and complexity of a respondent's current social network across 12 types of social relationships. Social network size measures the total number of people with whom the patient has regular contact (at least once every 2 weeks) and is computed by summing across the 12 roles. Social network diversity measures the number of social roles in which the patient has regular with at least 1 person (range 0-12). Social network complexity measures the number of different network domains in which a patient is active (range 0-8). Higher scores represent a larger, more diverse and complex social network.</description>

Raw scores range from 8 to 66, with higher scores reflecting higher socioeconomic status.</description>
