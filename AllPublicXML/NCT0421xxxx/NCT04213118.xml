    <textblock>
      A single-arm, open-label clinical trial to assess the effects and safety of anlotinib
      hydrochloride combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in hepatocellular
      carcinoma(HCC) patients at high risk of post surgery recurrence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world with high
      incidence and mortality. Recurrence of HCC is still a great challenge and threat to the
      patients after resection surgery. Anlotinib is a new, orally administered tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor that targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), fibroblast growth
      factor receptor (FGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR), and c-kit.

      HCC patients who meet the eligibility criteria of this clinical trial will adopt
      postoperative TACE combined with anlotinib hydrochloride. At Day4 of TACE,anlotinib 12mg QD
      PO d1-14, 21 days per cycle until disease progresses or intolerant.

      Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Disease free survival (DFS);Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: 1-year
      DFS Rate and Time to recurrence (TTR)(According to RECIST Version 1.1).Safety will be
      evaluated by incidence, severity and outcomes of AEs and categorized by severity in
      accordance with the NCI CTC AE Version 4.0.
