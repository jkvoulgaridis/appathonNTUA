    <textblock>
      Pain in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP) is a significant health challenge
      that so far has received too little attention. We lack knowledge on how pain is experienced,
      its consequences and of perceived support in managing pain. The overarching aim of the
      CPPain-program is to reduce pain experience, pain interference (e.g. pain burden) in children
      and adolescents living with CP. CPPain has a prospective cohort comparative design and will
      include before- and after measurements and process evaluation of a nested intervention.

      This protocol concerns qualitative and quantitative data collection for the baseline of the
      CPPain program. The aim of the baseline data collection is to contribute in-depth knowledge
      of the pain burden in children and adolescents with CP. This knowledge is required to develop
      targeted pain-diminishing interventions in this vulnerable group of children with a high
      burden of challenges related to their chronic disease. In the next step, nested intervention
      will be co-created with children and adolescents with CP, their parents as well as health
      care professionals, and other professional caregivers involved in or responsible for
      management of pain based on existing research and baseline findings.

  <detailed_description>

      Background and aim. Children and adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP) are at high risk for
      pain and their pain is frequently underestimated and undermanaged. They often experience a
      substantial pain burden from the pain itself and its influence on all aspects of their life,
      for example ability to perform daily activities, participate socially, sleep, or on overall
      quality of life. The overarching aim of the CPPain-program is to reduce the pain burden in
      children and adolescents living with CP.

      Study design. The CPPain has a prospective cohort comparative design and will include before-
      and after measurements and process evaluation of a nested intervention. This registration
      concerns the CPPain baseline and includes a multinational survey (the CPPain survey) and
      qualitative interviews with children and adolescents with CP, their parents/caregivers and
      health care professionals. The nested intervention will later be developed based on findings
      from the baseline.

      Qualitative data collection (the CPPain survey). The study population for the CPPain survey
      will include children younger than 18 years with a CP diagnosis and their siblings (12-17
      years) as controls. Parents of all participants will provide proxy report. Children with CP &gt;
      8 years of age and cognitively able (approx. 50%) and siblings (12-17 years) will provide
      self-report. The survey will include a set of previously published and validated measures
      that assess aspects of pain (experience, interference and management), performance of daily
      activities, mental health, Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), and participation. These
      measures include modified versions of Dalhousie Pain Interview (DPI) and Brief Pain Inventory
      (BPI), Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), The Caregiver Priorities and Child Health Index of
      Life with Disabilities (CPCHILD), Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS-25),
      KidScreen, and Child and Adolescent Scale of Participation (CASP). We will have three
      versions of the survey: Parent proxy, Self-report - full (12-18), and self-report -
      abbreviated (8-12 and older children with cognitive limitations). In addition to self- and/or
      proxy-reported survey data, demographic and disability-related data already registered in
      either national registers or electronic medical charts will be collected. Survey data will
      primarily be collected using an electronic survey. The Clinical Data Management System (CDMS)
      used for the eCRF in this study is Viedoc. The setup of the study specific eCRF in Viedoc
      will be performed by Research Support Services CTU, Oslo University Hospital (OUS).

      Qualitative data collection. Potential participants for the child and parent interviews will
      be identified from the CPPain survey. Inclusion criteria are school-aged children and
      adolescents (6-18 years) with cerebral palsy who have pain, determined from their or their
      parents' responses to the modified Dalhousie Pain Interview. If the child is unable to
      self-report or do not wish to participate only the parent/caregiver will be included.A
      purposeful sampling strategy (33) will be used to ensure a diverse sample concerning child
      and parent age and gender, as well as the child's level of physical and cognitive disability
      and severity of pain burden. We estimate that we will include 15-20 child/parent dyads and
      15-20 parents of children unable to self-report, but the final number will depend upon the
      richness of the material and data saturation.Both individual semi-structured interviews and
      focus groups will be used to answer the research objectives. Interview guides cover
      experiences with pain and its impact on life and living for children and parents
      respectively, parents' perception of their child's pain burden and its impact, as well as how
      pain is managed, including a detailed mapping of both the current and ideal help network.
      From the existing help network, identified by interview participants, health care
      professionals will be identified and recruited for a second round of interviews.

      Data analysis. Quantitative questionnaire and register data will be analyzed using
      appropriate statistical methods for comparing groups and analyzing time trends in close
      cooperation with the study's statistician. Stratification will be used to investigate sub
      groups. Analysis will be adjusted for appropriate sociodemographic variables. SPSS will be
      the main tool for statistical analysis, while some of the more complex analysis will require
      the use of R. Other specialized software will be applied as needed. Qualitative data from
      interviews and from unstructured responses to survey questions will be analyzed using
      appropriate qualitative methods; primarily content, thematic and/or network analysis. NVivo
      will be the main qualitative analysis tool. Qualitative and quantitative data will be
      combined and analyzed from either a quantitative or qualitative perspective to provide a more
      comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon.
