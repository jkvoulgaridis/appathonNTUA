  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many amputees suffer from Phantom Limb Pain (PLP), a condition where painful perceptions
      arise from the missing limb. Leg amputees wear prostheses that do not provide any sensory
      feedback, apart from the stump-socket interaction. Increased physical effort associated with
      prosthesis use as well as discomfort often lead to rejection of artificial limbs.
      Additionally, the perception of the missing limb and its brain representation, do not
      match-up with what amputees see (the prosthesis) and this is made worse by the absence of
      sensory feedback. Therefore, re-establishing the sensory flow of information between the
      subject's brain and the prosthetic device is extremely important to avoid this mismatch,
      which creates inadequate embodiment. This study focuses on improving functional abilities and
      decreasing PLP in amputees thanks to the use of a system able to generate a sensory feedback
      (SF), which will be provided with a non-invasive electrical stimulation (ES). First, the
      possibility of enhancing the performance in different functional tasks thanks to the use of
      SF will be explored. Furthermore, it will be evaluated if SF enhances the prosthesis
      embodiment and helps restoring a multisensory integration (visuo-tactile), potentially
      providing also a pain relief. Once tested this system on amputees, also people with
      peripheral neuropathy and sensory loss will be recruited. Diabetic patients can suffer from
      symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSPN), which is a common complication caused by prolonged glucose
      unbalanced levels that lead to nerve damage. Non-invasive ES has been proposed and used as a
      therapy to treat the chronic pain conditions. In particular, TENS (transcutaneous electrical
      nerve stimulation) is a type of non-invasive ES, which is able to activate large diameter
      afferent fibers. The gate control theory of pain states that these large diameter fibers
      inhibit central nociceptive transmission with a resultant decrease in pain perception.
      Therefore, also these patients will be recruited to see whether adding a non-invasive SF can
      enhance their functional motor abilities while diminishing their pain.

      The subjects will perform a pool of the following tasks, depending on their residual
      abilities: motor tasks (walking on ground level and on stairs), cognitive tasks (dual tasks),
      subjective evaluation of prosthesis weight and description of sensations from ES.

      Some tasks will be performed in Virtual Reality environments with and without an active
      stimulation.
