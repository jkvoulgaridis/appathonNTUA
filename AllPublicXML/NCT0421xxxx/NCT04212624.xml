      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of human retinal pigment epithelial (HuRPE) cell
      injection subretinal transplantation for atrophy of high myopia macular area, and to explore
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

      This study is a perspective, single-arm and open-labeled investigation of the safety and
      preliminary efficacy of unilateral subretinal transplantation of HuRPE cells in subjects with
      Macular degeneration caused by high myopia. The investigators will recruit and enroll 9
      patients based on specific inclusive/exclusive criteria. Experimental and self-controlled eye
      will be determined based on best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). The eye with BCVA between 5
      and 60 ETDRS letters will be determined as experimental eye, which will be divided into 3
      groups and undergo subretinal injection of 3 different dosages of HuRPE cells (300.000,
      500,000 or 1,000,000) respectively, while the other one as control eye, will not receive the
      surgery.

      HuRPE cells will be obtained from Eyecure Therapeutics, Inc.(Jiangsu) located in WuXi,
      Jiangsu Province. The obtained HuRPE cells will meet its quality standards and conform to
      Good manufacturing practices (GMP). HuRPE cells will be transplanted by a board-certified
      vitreoretinal surgeon, which will be administered into the subretinal space of experimental
      eye through a standard surgical approach.

      Immunosuppressive agents will be administered orally to all subjects after transplantation.
      Dosage and time duration of immunosuppressive agents will be regulated strictly relying on
      the condition of immune rejection. Subjects will be monitored with ophthalmologic and
      systemic examinations frequently at regular post-transplant intervals after HuRPE cells
      transplantation.

    <description>National eye institute 25-item visual function questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) is a condition-specific measure which was designed to capture the specific impact of vision loss on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The calculation for NEI VFQ-25 sub-scale scores and total score was performed according to the &quot;NEI VFQ-25 Scoring Algorithm - August 2000&quot;. The NEI VFQ-25 consists of a base set of 25 vision-targeted questions representing 11 vision-related constructs, plus an additional single-item general health rating question. All items are scored so that a high score represents better functioning. Each item is then converted to a 0 to 100 scale so that the lowest and highest possible scores are set at 0 and 100 points, respectively. In this format scores represent the achieved percentage of the total possible score, e.g. a score of 50 represents 50% of the highest possible score.</description>

    <description>The 25G or 23G conjunctival seamless vitrectomy was performed on the anterior eye to remove the anterior-posterior direction and tangential direction of the rupture hole. The area outside the macular foveal lesion was selected, but 100 μl of HuRPE cell injection was injected within about 2 PD. In combination with the Medone syringe and the combined 35G or 37G needle, the silicone oil injection module is used for injection, and the injection is performed in an amount of 100 μl (depending on the cell concentration). The doses of the three dose groups from low to high were 300,000 cells, 500,000 cells, and 1 million cells, respectively, in a single injection.</description>
