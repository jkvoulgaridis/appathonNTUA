  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single arm, multi-center, phase II clinical trial to observe the
      efficacy and safety of R-CHOP (Rituximab-Cyclophosphamide, Epirubicin, Vincristine and
      Prednisone) combined with lenalidomide in the first-line treatment for patients with medium
      to high risk/high risk diffuse large B cell lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
      (NHL). Currently, R-CHOP is world-widely used in the first-line treatment for DLBCL. There
      are about one second of patients suffering relapse and drug resistance. Lenalidomide is an
      analog of thalidomide, the mechanism of anti-tumor action has not been fully elucidated.
      Lenalidomide has been proved to inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells in certain
      hematopoietic systems. At present, it has been approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma
      with good efficacy and safety. The goal of our trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of
      R-CHOP combined with lenalidomide in the first-line treatment for patients with medium to
      high risk/high risk diffuse large B cell lymphoma.
