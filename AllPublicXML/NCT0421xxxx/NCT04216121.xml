  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether in patients with EGFR mutated advanced NSCLC and osimertinib as
      first-line treatment, the (repeated) use of LAT to ≤ 3 OP lesions and continuation of
      first-line osimertinib, improves the median progression-free survival by more than 3 months
      (i.e. PFS2-PFS1 = &gt;3 months).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The (repeated) use of LAT to ≤ 3 OP lesions with continuation of first-line osimertinib, is
      endorsed by international guidelines (NCCN, ESMO).

      In this phase IIb prospective non-randomized observational trial, we want to document the
      benefit of LAT in this patient cohort.

        Established histological diagnosis of advanced NSCLC, not suitable for radical treatment,
        with an EGFR actionable mutation receiving first-line targeted TKI therapy with
        osimertinib. Confirmed oligoprogressive disease defined as ≤ 3 intra- and extracranial
        sites of progressive disease

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, ≥ 18 years of age

          2. Established histological diagnosis of advanced NSCLC, not suitable for radical
             treatment, with an EGFR actionable mutation receiving first-line targeted TKI therapy
             with osimertinib

          3. Initial radiologically confirmed response (at least stable disease) to osimertinib
             assessed 3 months post commencing osimertinib according to RECIST criteria v1.1.

          4. Confirmed OPD defined as ≤ 3 intra- and extracranial sites of progressive disease. OP
             may be defined as progression of an individual metastasis according to RECIST or on 2
             consecutive imaging studies at least 2 months apart with a minimum of 5mm increase in
             size from baseline or an unambiguous development of a new metastatic lesion with a
             grand total of 3 lesions. All sites must be visible, imaging defined targets, not
             previously treated with radiation or radiofrequency and suitable for treatment with
             LAT as determined by the local multi-disciplinary team (MDT).

          5. Adequate baseline organ function to allow LAT to all the OP targets.

          6. Predicted life expectancy ≥ 6 months

          7. Karnofsky Index ≥ 60% and ECOG 0-2

          8. Provision of written informed consent

          9. Female participants must be surgically sterile or postmenopausal if SBRT is planned to
             the abdominal area or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of
             therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. &gt; 3 sites of progressive disease

          2. Oligoprogressive metastases not amenable to LAT

          3. Radiotherapy or radiofrequency ablation near the OP lesion prior to the inclusion in
             the LAT-FLOSI study

          4. Co-morbidities considered clinically precluding the safe use of LAT

          5. Any psychological, sociological or geographical issue potentially hampering compliance
             with the study

          6. Pregnancy
