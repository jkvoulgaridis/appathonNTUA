    <textblock>
      This retrospective study evaluates 52 cases of avascular necrosis of femoral head (AVN)
      treated by core decompression, bone chips allograft, fibrin platelet rich-plasma (PRF) and
      concentrated autologous mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs).

    <textblock>
      We report 52 cases of avascular necrosis of the hip (AVN), operated by decompression of the
      necrotic area with bone chips allograft, adjuvanted by concentrated autologous mesenchymal
      stromal cells (MSCs) and fibrin platelet rich-plasma (PRP).

      The patients were followed-up at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and then
      every year. Each time a clinical evaluation by Harris Hip Score (HHS) was carried out by the
      same orthopedic surgeon. Radiological controls (pelvis and hip affected) were performed at 6
      weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and then every year.

      The primary outcome evaluated was the avoiding or delaying of total hip replacement (THR),
      while the secondary outcomes were the assessment of any change in clinical performance as
      measured by Harris Hip Score

    <description>The collection of functional outcomes score HHS at 6 weeks. The HHS is a measure of dysfunction so the higher the score, the better the outcome for the individual. The maximum score possible is 100. Results can be interpreted with the following: &lt;70 as poor result; 70-80 as fair, 80-90 as good, and 90-100 as excellent results.</description>
