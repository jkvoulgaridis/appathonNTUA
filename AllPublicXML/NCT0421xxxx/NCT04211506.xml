  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess neurobehavioral performance, as well as genetic and other
      physiological changes associated with variations in timing and quantity of sleep.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During a 1.5 week inpatient laboratory protocol, subjects will undergo one of four parallel
      sleep conditions. Subjects will be randomly assigned to each condition group. During their
      time in the laboratory, biological samples (e.g., blood) will be collected for genetic and
      other analyses, and sleep quantity and quality will be monitored. Additionally responses on
      neurobehavioral tests and surveys will be monitored for differences among the groups.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gene expression changes associated with different sleep patterns.</measure>
    <time_frame>Samples for gene expression will be collected at frequent intervals over 10 days in a sleep laboratory. Subjects will be in a time-free environment, and not told sampling frequency.</time_frame>
    <description>Levels of expression of all genes will be compared across time and among study arms with different sleep patterns using RNA-Seq and differential expression analysis with generalized linear models.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neurobehavioral performance changes associated with different sleep patterns.</measure>
    <time_frame>Neurobehavioral assays will be conducted at frequent intervals over 10 days in a sleep laboratory. Subjects will be in a time-free environment, and not told assay frequency.</time_frame>
    <description>Neurobehavioral performance will be compared across time and among study arms with different sleep patterns. Specifically, differences will be examined in subjective and objective neurobehavioral assays (Karolinska sleepiness scale, Performance effort and evaluation rating scale, Digit symbol substitution test, Stroop performance, Raven matrix task, Comparative visual search, Face-name task, Psychomotor vigilance test, Visual analog scale, Track test, and the Balloon analog risk task).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>DNA genetic variants associated with sleep and/or neurobehavioral performance.</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately two oral samples will be taken for DNA analyses during the 10 days in a sleep laboratory.</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis of genetic variants will be used to assess inherited genetic differences among subjects and potential relevance to sleep, circadian rhythms, and/or neurobehavioral performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Microbiome metrics associated with sleep and/or neurobehavioral performance.</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately three fecal samples will be collected over the 10 days in a sleep laboratory for potential future microbiome analyses.</time_frame>
    <description>Fecal samples will be collected and may be analysed in the future for microbiome differences among subjects, over time, and/or with respect to study conditions and metrics (e.g., differences in microbiome associated with sleep and/or neurobehavioral performance).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Metabolite and protein metrics associated with sleep and/or neurobehavioral performance.</measure>
    <time_frame>A series of blood samples will be collected over the 10 days in a sleep laboratory for potential future analyses.</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples will be collected and may be analysed in the future for metabolite, protein, or other molecular differences among subjects, over time, and/or with respect to study conditions and metrics (e.g., differences associated with sleep and/or neurobehavioral performance).</description>

    <measure>Additional urine and saliva</measure>
    <time_frame>Saliva and urine samples will be collected frequently during wake over the 10 days in a sleep laboratory for potential future analyses</time_frame>
