  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence that human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs)
      can differentiate into oligodendrocytes and neurons, and improve the recovery of nerve
      function, which strongly suggests the feasibility and effectiveness of hUCB-MSCs as an
      intervention treatment for spinal cord injury. At present, there are only a few clinical
      centers in which hUCB-MSCs transplantation for treatment of chronic spinal cord injury has
      been performed and a certain degree of efficacy has been achieved. However, this has not been
      supported by systematic standardized randomized controlled trials. Therefore, the
      investigators design a prospective, randomized, open-label, parallel, controlled trial to
      evaluate the efficacy of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells
      (hUC-MSCs)/hUCB-MSCs to treat spinal cord injury. The primary objective of this study was to
      investigate whether hUC-MSCs)/hUCB-MSCs transplantation can improve the locomotor function of
      patients with spinal cord injury. The secondary objectives were to investigate whether
      hUC-MSCs)/hUCB-MSCs transplantation can improve the muscle tension of patients with spinal
      cord injury and investigate the complications and safety of hUC-MSCs)/hUCB-MSCs
      transplantation.

      Patient recruitment will be performed via information dissemination on bulletin boards to
      advertise the study among patients at the clinics and wards of the First Affiliated Hospital
      of Dalian Medical University, China. Patients interested in participation in this study or
      their legal guardians contact the project manager via telephone. Patients will be screened
      according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria after providing signed informed consent.
      Eligible patients with chronic spinal cord injury will receive intravenous, lumbar, and local
      administration of hUC-MSCs/hUCB-MSCs (provided by Cell Bank of Stem Cell Clinical Research
      Institute, The First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University). The primary outcome
      measure of this study is neurologic function scores, including ASIA (American Spinal Injury
      Association) motor score, ASIA sensory score, ASIA impairment scale (ASIA classification),
      and acupuncture score. These scores will be used to evaluate the recovery of nerve function
      after spinal cord injury and determine the therapeutic efficacy and persistence. The
      secondary outcome measures of this study include Walking Index of Spinal Cord Injury (WISCI),
      Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM), Kunming Locomotion Scale (KLS), Modified Ashworth
      Scale (MAS), and Visual Analogous Scale (VAS) scores and the incidence of adverse reactions.
      At 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment, patients will be followed up to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of hUC-MSCs)/hUCB-MSCs transplantation in the treatment of spinal cord
      injury.
