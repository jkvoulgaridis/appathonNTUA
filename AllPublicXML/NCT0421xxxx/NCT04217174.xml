  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to determine the efficacy of &quot;My Personal Health Guide,&quot; a
      theory-based innovative talking relational human Avatar mobile phone application to engage
      HIV-positive AAMSM in adherence and retention in care. Providing an empathetic talking Avatar
      source of HIV-related information, motivation, and behavioral skills that is as private and
      convenient as their own mobile phone might produce a high impact by overcoming barriers to
      HIV adherence and retention in care such as stigma and health literacy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This proposal focuses on an innovative theory-driven intervention aimed at helping to improve
      outcomes for AAMSM targeting 3 stages of the HIV Care Continuum, (1) retention, (2) adherence
      to antiretroviral medication, and (3) viral suppression. My Personal Health Guide is an
      innovative talking relational human Avatar mobile phone application to engage HIV-positive
      AAMSM in adherence and retention in care. Development of this app was informed by the
      Information Motivation Behavioral Skills Model that focuses on feedback between information
      and motivation that affect one's behavioral skills, behaviors, and desired health outcomes.
      In the privacy of the user's home or anywhere they have their phone, the Avatar can encourage
      healthy behavior, acknowledge stigma and speak with empathy, audibly teach persons with low
      literacy, employ credible culturally appropriate phrasing, and invite the user to hear advice
      and motivational stories of other HIV-positive people and their caregivers. As part of a
      collaboration between UIC, Emory University, and the University of Mississippi Medical
      Center, the investigators propose to test the efficacy of the My Personal Health Guide Avatar
      application for young HIV-positive AAMSM. In this study, 250 HIV-positive AAMSM between the
      ages of 18-34 years with detectable viral load at baseline will be randomized to the My
      Personal Health Guide Avatar application or a food safety Avatar application control
      intervention for a 6-month period. Wirelessly monitored ART adherence will be collected for
      1-month at baseline and then wirelessly monitored ART adherence, viral load, and clinic
      appointment data will be collected throughout the 6-month follow-up period. The investigators
      hypothesize that participants in the My Personal Health Guide intervention will demonstrate
      significant improvements in ART adherence, viral load, and retention in care during the
      follow-up period compared to control participants. The investigators will also identify
      mobile phone application functions that are associated with improvement in adherence in order
      to inform refinement of the application. The investigators hypothesize that more frequent use
      of Avatar information functions that included motivational messages will be associated with
      improved ART adherence.

    <description>The investigators will review medical records for HIV viral load measurements including the detectable measurement at study entry and all measurements that occur during the 6 months of follow-up and 2 months after. To ensure a high proportion of subjects have a follow-up viral load for comparison to their study entry viral load, the investigators will collect a fingerprick dried blood spot for viral load at the follow-up interview.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months before enrollment through two months after study conclusion (15 months).</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use the Wisepill real-time electronic monitoring adherence device. The device obtains daily adherence information that can be analyzed as 7 monthly adherence measurements (1 month baseline and 6 months follow-up) calculated as proportion of doses taken out of days in the month. To supplement this measure, in the follow-up questionnaire the investigators will also collect the number of missed doses during the past month by self-report.</description>

    <description>The control app is a mobile phone app that features a realistic talking human avatar who primarily promotes food safety and also offers knowledge of sugar content in food. This app is expected to have no effect on ART adherence and retention in care, however, it has never been tested to determine if it may have any effect so it has been categorized as Other (arm type) rather than as placebo.</description>

    <intervention_name>My Personal Health Guide</intervention_name>
    <description>My Personal Health Guide is a theory-based mobile phone app that uses an Avatar as a personal health guide to increase patient knowledge of HIV disease and its complications and rationale for healthy behavior, increase self-efficacy and motivate participants to improve retention in care and medication adherence, and explain and illustrate behavioral skills related to retention in care, and adherence, with a result of improved behavior that leads to personal and population benefits through viral suppression and decreased risk of transmission, respectively. The relational aspect of the Avatar may be a powerful supplement to clinical care. The Avatar can encourage healthy behavior, acknowledge stigma and speak with empathy, audibly teach persons with low literacy, employ credible culturally appropriate phrasing, and invite the user to hear advice and motivational stories of other HIV-positive people and caregivers.</description>
