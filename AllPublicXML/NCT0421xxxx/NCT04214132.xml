  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Alice Lee Centre for Nursing Studies under the National University of Singapore offers a
      three-years (four years for honors students), full-time Bachelor of Science (Nursing) program
      that is accredited by the Singapore Nursing Board. The course covers core modules such as,
      anatomy, physiology and physical assessment, pathophysiology, pharmacology and nursing
      practice, communication and cultural diversity, and includes clinical practicums at tertiary
      hospitals that range from two weeks to three months.

      This project will be carried out with nursing undergraduates of National University of
      Singapore who had completed the core module NUR1110 (Effective Communication for Health
      Professionals) in their year 1 of nursing courses. The 2-year study will follow these
      students in year 2 and year 3 consecutively by introducing Virtual Patients (VP) depicting
      real-life case scenarios at gradual difficulty levels before their end-of-semester clinical
      posting. Four VP case scenarios were developed for each semester on the following topics: 1)
      interview a pregnant woman with pain to solicit holistic history taking (year 2 semester 1);
      2) history taking from a depressed patient (year 2 semester 2); 3) use of a standardized
      approach such as Situation, Background, Assessment, and Recommendation (SBAR) to hand off
      interdisciplinary communications (year 3 semester 1); and 4) showing empathy to the fellow
      nursing student (year 3 semester 2).

      Overall, the aim of this project is to develop and evaluate the use of VPs in better
      preparing nursing undergraduates in communicating with real-life patients, family members,
      and other healthcare professionals during their clinical posting. The specific research
      questions the investigators plan to answer in this project are as follows:

        1. What is the effect of using VPs in enhancing nursing undergraduates' self-efficacy and
           attitude toward learning communication skills?

        2. Do the students receiving additional training using VPs perform better in their
           communication skills during the clinical posting compared with students receiving
           standard training?

        3. What are the levels of outcomes of students' self-efficacy and attitude toward learning
           communication skills at pretest (semester 1, year 2 before receiving the VP training),
           posttest 1 (last day of clinical posting year 2 semester 1), posttest 2 (last day of
           clinical posting year 2 semester 2), posttest 3 (last day of clinical posting year 3
           semester 1), and posttest 4 (last day of clinical posting year 3 semester 2)?

        4. What are the changes in self-efficacy and attitude toward communication skills scores
           over time (pretest, posttests 1-4)?

        5. What are the students' experiences in receiving additional training using VPs before
           their clinical posting? The aim of this paper is therefore to provide a detailed
           breakdown on the development process of the Virtual Counseling Application using
           Artificial Intelligence (VCAAI) for communication skills training in nursing education
           and to highlight challenges faced and recommended resolutions to inform future research.

    <description>Intervention comprises of four Virtual Patients scenarios that aimed to improve nursing undergraduates communication skills in a clinical setting. These scenarios are based on authentic clinical cases (adapted from the real-life clinical case studies) focusing mainly on the communication aspects. Scenarios included 1) a middle-aged pregnant woman in her third trimester experiencing pain, 2) a middle-aged lorry driver who self-admitted to the hospital due to relapse of depressive symptoms, 3) changing a bloody dressing of a middle-aged male patient who had an operation 3 days ago, and 4) communicating with a fellow stressed student during their final preregistration clinical posting period.</description>
