  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigator general objective is therefore to study and compare the benefit of several
      methods of management of cognitive difficulties reported by patients during treatment for
      breast cancer, among several treatments, offered independently in patients' homes and
      supervised from a distance: adapted physical activity only, cognitive stimulation only, and
      adapted physical activity coupled with cognitive stimulation (during separate sessions). The
      study will therefore be the first to include a group benefiting from these two management
      methods, which will make it possible to assess the individual benefit of cognitive
      stimulation sessions and adapted physical activity but also the benefit of combined
      sessions.As this type of combined management has never been the subject of a study, and
      previous studies relating to a single type of management having raised patient adhesion
      difficulties, it does not seem certain that this type of care is feasible in practice. Before
      studying its effectiveness, it is therefore essential to check the feasibility and
      acceptability of such a program combining sessions of adapted physical activity and cognitive
      stimulation sessions.Investigator will therefore first carry out a feasibility study,
      longitudinal and monocentric, which will assess the adherence of patients treated for breast
      cancer to the performance of cognitive stimulation sessions coupled with sessions of adapted
      physical activity.This feasibility study is a key stage of the Cog-Stim protocol because its
      results will probably highlight the obstacles to the intervention program, which will allow
      the investigator to propose adjustments to improve the study design for the following stages
      of the protocol. (design optimization).
