  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-celiac gluten/wheat sensitivity (NCGS/NCWS) is a syndrome characterized by both
      intestinal (irritable bowel syndrome [IBS]-like presentation) and extraintestinal symptoms
      (headache, migraine, &quot;foggy mind&quot;, depression, anxiety, fibromyalgia, joint and muscle pain,
      leg or arm numbness, eczema or skin rash), which occur after the ingestion of gluten/wheat in
      subjects in which celiac disease (CD) and wheat allergy diagnosis has been previously
      excluded. NCGS/NCWS symptoms generally occur after the ingestion of gluten/wheat, disappear
      within a few days of a gluten-free diet (GFD) and quickly reappear when gluten/wheat is
      reintroduced. A new assay, recently available on the Italian market, allows to ascertain the
      presence of immunogenic peptides of gluten (Gluten Immunogenic Peptides, GIP) in the urine
      and stool. The test might allow to ascertain if the NCGS/NCWS patients, on GFD, eat, even
      accidentally, gluten. Of the 2 available assays, the urinary one allows the patient himself
      to test the presence of GIP in relation to symptoms/signs appearing and/or social activities
      (e.g. meal in a restaurant). The aims of the present study are: 1) to test, in patients with
      NCGS/NCWS on GFD, the adherence to the elimination diet; 2) to evaluate the correlation
      between the symptoms' reappearance and the presence of GIP in the urine.

      Non-celiac gluten/wheat sensitivity (NCGS/NCWS) is a syndrome characterized by both
      intestinal (irritable bowel syndrome [IBS]-like presentation) and extraintestinal symptoms
      (headache, migraine, &quot;foggy mind&quot;, depression, anxiety, fibromyalgia, joint and muscle pain,
      leg or arm numbness, eczema or skin rash), which occur after the ingestion of gluten/wheat in
      subjects in which celiac disease (CD) and wheat allergy diagnosis has been previously
      excluded. Recent data suggest that NCGS affect up to 3-6% of the general population, a higher
      prevalence than that reported for CD. NCGS/NCWS symptoms generally occur after the ingestion
      of gluten/wheat, disappear within a few days of a gluten-free diet (GFD) and quickly reappear
      when gluten/wheat is reintroduced. GDF is very difficult and onerous from a social (presence
      of gluten in many industrial food products and &quot;contamination&quot;, both domestic and
      extra-domestic), psychological (e.g. for adolescents, exclusion from the &quot;peer group&quot;, with
      difficulty in accepting the diagnosis) and economic point of view. A new assay, recently
      available on the Italian market, allows to ascertain the presence of immunogenic peptides of
      gluten (gluten immunogenic peptides, GIP) in the urine and stool. The test might allow to
      ascertain if the NCGS/NCWS patients, on GFD, eat even accidentally gluten. Of the 2 available
      assays, the urinary one allows the patient himself to test the presence of GIP in relation to
      symptoms/signs appearing and/or social activities (e.g. meal in a restaurant). The other one
      involves collecting a stool sample and allows to identify the gluten taken in the previous
      week, but it requires a laboratory, specifically equipped. To date, there are no
      observational studies that indicate the performance of the test in patients with NCGS/NCWS.
      The aims of the present study are: 1) to test, in patients with NCGS/NCWS on GFD, the
      adherence to the elimination diet; 2) to evaluate the correlation between the symptoms'
      reappearance and the presence of GIP in the urine.

    <intervention_model_description>The researchers will evaluate the urine samples of patients affected with NCGS/NCWS, diagnosed by double-blind placebo-controlled wheat challenge, on GFD. The patients will be recruited among those diagnosed in two centers: &quot;Ambulatorio di Celiachia ed Intolleranze Alimentari&quot; (Prof. Pasquale Mansueto) of the Geriatric Division (Director Prof. Mario Barbagallo) of the &quot;Azienda Ospedaliera-Universitaria Paolo Giaccone'&quot;, and the &quot;Internal Medicine Unit&quot; (Director Prof. Antonio Carroccio) of the &quot;Cervello-Villa Sofia&quot; Hospital, both in Palermo, Italy. The researchers will deliver to each patient 10 kits for the analysis of the GIP and we will ask them to use them two times per week, for 5 weeks. Furthermore, the patients will test urine GIP in the event of symptoms/signs that they attribute to the accidental intake of gluten, within the same 5 weeks.</intervention_model_description>
