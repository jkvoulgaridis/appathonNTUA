  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain concernes one in four adults in Belgium. Because of the psychological and social
      repercussions, a biopsychosocial approach is necessary in order to improve the quality of
      life chronic pain patients. Non-pharmacological techniques such as hypnosis, self-care
      learning, music-therapy and psycho-education are gaining more and more interest in the
      scientific field. However, a major problem in clinical research is patient dropout. To our
      knowledge, no study has investigated dropout rates in hypnosis clinical research. The aim of
      this study is, therefore, to better understand the predictors of dropout in several
      non-pharmacological treatments in chronic pain management.

    <description>It is a 7-months 2 hours-session (1 session per month) of self-hypnosis/self-care learning. Participants are given strategies to learn self-care (knowing their needs, self-respect, communication etc.), each strategy is discussed for participant to understand them and thus apply them correctly in daily life. An hypnosis exercice is conducted at the end of each session. A CD with the audiotaped hypnosis exercice is given to each patient so that they can practice also every day.</description>
