      This phase 2, open-label, multi-center trial to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and
      preliminary clinical efficacy of intradermally-delivered SNS-301 delivered using the 3M®
      hollow microstructured transdermal system (hMTS) device in patients with ASPH+ high risk
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). The trial

                  bone marrow blasts and/or presence of Auer rods).

          5. Be willing to provide a fresh bone marrow aspirate sample at pre-treatment and
             demonstrate ASPH expression by flow cytometry.

          6. Patient who has relapsed or is refractory / intolerant of hypomethylating agents
             (HMAs) or not responding to 4 treatment cycles of decitabine or 6 treatment cycles of
             azacytidine or progressing at any point after initiation of an HMA.

             heterosexual intercourse) or use two highly effective contraceptive methods during the
             treatment period and for at least 180 days after the last dose of study treatment. For
             male patients: Agree that during the period specified above, men will not father a

             qualitative RNA detected); testing recommended per investigator's clinical suspicion.

          8. Severe infections within 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

          9. Received therapeutic oral or IV antibiotics within 2 weeks prior to Day 0.

         10. History or current evidence of any condition, therapy or laboratory abnormality that
             in the opinion of the treating investigator might confound the results of the trial.

         11. Known previous or ongoing, active psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would
             interfere with the requirements of the trial.

         12. Treatment with systemic immunomodulating agents (including but not limited to IFNs,
             IL-2) within 6 weeks or five half-lives of the drug, whichever is shorter, prior to
             first dose.

         13. Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medication within 2 weeks prior to
             initiation of study treatment, or anticipation of need for systemic immunosuppressive
             medication during the course of the study.
