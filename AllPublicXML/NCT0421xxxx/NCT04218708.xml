  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to understand and determine the effectiveness of electronic
      cigarettes versus nicotine replacement therapy in adults who smoke and also live with
      HIV/AIDS in effort to reduce cigarette smoking.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) are known to have exceptionally higher rate of cigarette
      smoking and very low quit rates compared to the general population. Although a primary
      rationale for conducting this study is reducing health disparities among PLWHA, there is a
      potential benefit of the proposed work from a prevention perspective given that combustible
      cigarette smoking is an independent risk factor for non-adherence to ART and may decrease the
      effectiveness of HAART. Smoking-related illnesses are leading causes of non-HIV/AIDS-related
      deaths among People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Electronic cigarettes (E-cigarettes) could
      help people reduce the harm of combustible cigarette (CC) through reductions in number of
      Cigarettes per Day (CPD) or quitting CC completely by addressing both nicotine and behavioral
      dependence. Unlike CC, EC are not associated with coronary heart disease or myocardial
      infarction. The purpose is to identify barriers and facilitators, as well as assess
      preliminary effectiveness of e-cigarettes as a harm reduction strategy among PLWHA.

    <description>In the e-cigarette arm, participants will be encouraged to substitute SREC (15 mg/ml nicotine in tobacco flavor) for CC in order to reduce nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Smoking reduction will be measured by a combination of self-report, text message data and changes in CO and saliva cotinine between baseline and end of treatment.</description>

    <description>Will assess withdrawal symptoms of nicotine using the Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale (MNWS). The 9 item scale which assess withdrawal symptoms will be rated on a 5 point scale &quot;not present&quot;, &quot; slight&quot;, &quot;mild&quot;, &quot;moderate&quot; and &quot;severe&quot; .</description>

    <description>Will assess withdrawal symptoms of E-cigarette dependency using potential side effects of NRT/SREC using the E-cigarette Dependence Index (SREC arm). 9 questions assess the experience with Electronic cigarettes to gauge how depend the subjects are on e-cigarettes (0 - 3 = not dependent, 4 - 8 low dependence, 9 - 12 medium dependence, 13+ = high dependence)</description>

The 12 item questionnaire assess how people refrain form smoking in certain situations using a 5 point Likert scale (1=not at all sure, 2=not very sure, 3=more or less, 4=fairly sure, 5= absolutely sure).</description>

    <description>A research assistant (RA) trained in motivational interviewing and qualitative methods will support the PI to deliver counseling sessions and conduct interviews. Briefly, during each visit, with help of the RA, participants will provide exhaled CO and saliva cotinine test, and complete surveys in REDCAP using a tablet, allowing programmed logic checks and skip patterns to minimize burden. The RA will also deliver brief motivational counseling tailored to the participant's readiness to quit and arm in the study (NRT). Participants will also receive their NRT to last them to the following visit based on their baseline smoking.</description>
