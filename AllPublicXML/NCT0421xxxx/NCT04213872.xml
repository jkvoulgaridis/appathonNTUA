      Study Title: Gene Expression, Meditative Movement and Emotional Distress (GME)

      Background and Objectives:

      Breast cancer survivors (BCS) often report decrements in cognitive functioning. Cognitive
      impairment (CI) is generally understood as resulting from chemotherapy or radiation, but may
      also result from chronic emotional distress experienced by breast cancer patients and
      survivors. Meditation and exercise are both known to reduce stress, with growing evidence for
      the potential of each to also improve cognitive functioning in cancer patients and survivors.
      A Meditative Movement (MM) program (Qigong/Tai Chi Easy) offers the potential of combining
      both benefits of meditation and exercise for breast cancer survivors. This is a pilot study,
      testing the MM program to effect changes in cognitive functioning and associated
      symptoms/conditions such as anxiety, depression, sleep quality and using gene expression
      factors as biomarkers to potentially measure the molecular signature of these changes. Forty
      BCS will be consented and assigned to an intensive eight week MM program. Cognitive
      functioning and associated symptoms/conditions will be assessed before and after the 8-week
      MM program to examine the participants' behaviors and symptoms. Peripheral blood samples will
      be collected before and after the 8-week MM program and will be analyzed for gene expression
      changes. If successful, this study may provide preliminary data for a full powered randomized
      control trial if results show promise in the psycho-behavioral outcomes and genomic
      expression results.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-group pilot study on the effects of 8 weeks of MM practice on changes in
      cognitive function, anxiety, sleep quality, depression, and selected gene expression factors.
      Forty BCS will be consented and assigned to an intensive eight-week MM program. The forty BCS
      will be nonrandomly assigned to the eight-week MM program with no control group. The forty
      BCS will be organized in cohorts of 10 for the 8-week MM program. Cognitive functioning and
      associated symptoms/conditions data will be collected before and after the 8-week MM program
      to assess cognitive functioning, anxiety, depression, and sleep-quality. This data will be
      analyzed using the IBM SPSS Statistics program. Peripheral blood samples will be collected
      before and after the 8-week MM program. The gene expression data will be processed and
      analyzed by the bioinformatics team at the Single-Cell, Sequencing, and CyTOF Core (SC2),
      Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA), Los Angeles.

      Endpoints:

      Endpoint 1: The Meditative Movement (MM) program will affect cognitive impairment.

      Endpoint 2: The Meditative Movement (MM) program will affect anxiety, depression, and sleep
      quality.

      Endpoint 3: The MM program will affect gene expression associated with cognitive impairment
      and associated symptoms.

    <time_frame>The research participants will complete the FACT-COG pre- and post-8 week intervention within two weeks prior to and subsequent to the 8-week intervention. The PI will administer WAIS-III measures within two weeks before and after 8-week intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive function self-report will be assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function (FACT-COG), 33 items, validated, including 3 subscales including perceived cognitive impairment (PCI), perceptions of effects of cognitive function on quality of life (PCQOL), and perceived cognitive abilities (CA) Two brief measures of attention/working memory from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition (WAIS-III) assess CP: Digit Span and Letter-Number Sequencing, with reliability ratings of .90 and .82 respectively.</description>

    <time_frame>Blood samples will be collected within two weeks before and after 8 week intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>RNA sequencing: Sequencing libraries will be prepared from previously purified RNA using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing will be performed on a NextSeq 500 platform using 2×75bp chemistry. Data analysis: Quality control and adapter trimming will be performed using trim galore (v0.4.2) with default parameters. Reads will be aligned to the GRCh38 reference genome and transcriptome using HISAT2 (v2.1.0), and transcript quantification will be performed using featureCounts (v1.5.1). Differential expression analysis will be performed using the 'DESeq2' R package (v1.16.1), and a rank score calculated as -log10(q-val)*sign (log2 FoldChange) will be used as input to the GSEA Preranked tool for pathway analysis.</description>

    <description>Profile of Mood States Short Form (POMS-SF): 37 items, adjectives scored on a 5-point Likert scale. The POMS is one of the most frequently used and validated scales in studies of psychosocial interventions with BCSs. POMS consists of the Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) dimensions (tension-anxiety; depression-dejection; anger-hostility; confusion-bewilderment. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI): 19 items assess sleep, including subscales for subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep disturbance, habitual sleep efficiency, daytime dysfunction and use of sleep medications.</description>
