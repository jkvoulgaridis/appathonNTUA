  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior studies have shown that patient trust in their physician is associated with better
      health outcomes and lower levels of emotional distress. Patients who have low levels of trust
      in their physician are less satisfied and less likely to adhere to their physician
      recommendations. As such, there is a need to better understand factors related to patient
      trust in their physician.

      Purpose: To understand whether patient awareness of a surgeon's personal background improves
      patient trust in their surgeon.

    <time_frame>Immediately after the clinic visit, patients are given the survey to complete.</time_frame>
    <description>Before the clinic visit, the research assistant will give patients a sheet that gives them info on their surgeon. Control group will receive an information sheet with only their surgeon's educational background. Experimental group will receive an information sheet with their surgeon's educational and personal background. Immediately after the clinic visit, the research assistant will ask patients to complete Wake Forest Trust in physician survey.

Control group will receive an information sheet with only their surgeon's educational background. Experimental group will receive an information sheet with their surgeon's educational and personal background. Immediately after the clinic visit, the research assistant will ask patients to complete the Jefferson Scale of Patient Perceptions of Physician Empathy.
