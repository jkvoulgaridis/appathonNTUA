  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines safety and feasibility of a study protocol using a combination of
      functional electrical legcycling with voluntary armwork (hybrid training) as either
      skiergometer or armcycling in high intensity intervals for persons with spinal cord injury
      paraplegia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is one of the most common causes of early death in people with spinal
      cord injury. Physical activity at high intensity is known to reduce the risk of
      cardiovascular disease in other patient groups.

      During aerobic training, combining functional electrical stimulation (FES) with voluntary
      arm-work induces a higher oxygen uptake than FES cycling alone and high intensity interval
      training induces higher oxygen uptake than training at continuous intensity. The hypothesis
      is that combining hybrid training with high-intensity induces even higher oxygen uptake
      thereby reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. This training modality has not been
      tested before, so before conducting a randomized controlled trial testing the effect of this
      training modality on oxygen uptake, the aim was to asses safety and feasibility of this
      protocol.

    <measure>Shoulder pain</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using Wheelchair Shoulder Pain Index (WUSPI), a 15 item questionnaire measuring shoulder pain during daily activities. Each item is scored on a 10 mm visual analog scale with anchors no pain to worst pain ever. Total index score range from 0 - 100. Within each item there is a not applicable option. The score used is performance corrected WUSPI score, dividing total index score by number of item responses and multiplied by 15. Higher score indicate higher level of shoulder pain.</description>

    <measure>intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed as mean intensity of the 4 x 4 min. intervals as proportion of peak watt measured at baseline test. Peakwatt for FES-cycling was defined as an average of the three highest watt values within 30 sec. For skiergometer peak watt was defined as the highest average of one min. splits.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak oxygen uptake</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed measuring pulmonary gas exchange. Peak oxygen uptake is defined as respiratory exchange ratio of 1.05 or higher, concentration of blood lactate of 7 mmol/l or more and subjective rating of perceived exertion on the Borg 6-20 scale of min. 16.</description>

    <measure>leisure time physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>leisure time physical activity measured with leisure time physical activity questionnaire - SCI (LTPAQ-SCI), asking number of min. spent performing low-, moderate and high intensity leisure time physical activity pr. day, scored by multiplying number of min by number of days yielding number of minutes of leisure time physical activity per week.</description>

    <measure>health related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>health related quality of life measured with Short Form 36 (SF-36), categorically based on a three to six categories Likert scale. An algorithm transforms the scores into a 0-100 scoring system, with higher scores indicating better quality of life</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed with the Multi Dimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20) covering 5 dimensions of fatigue which are scored using a five level scale. Sub scale scores range 4-20 are calculated as the sum of item ratings and total fatigue score range 20-100 is calculated as the sum of sub scale scores with higher scores indicating lower level of fatigue.</description>
