        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Unilateral or bilateral cataracts for which phacoemulsification extraction and
             posterior chamber IOL implantation have been planned;

          2. Preoperative corneal astigmatism of one diopter or more in the operative eye;

          3. Potential for postoperative best corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) of 20/30
             Snellen or better;

          4. Clear intraocular media other than cataract in each eye;

          5. Ability to understand, read and write English in order to consent to study
             participation;

          6. Availability, willingness, sufficient cognitive awareness to comply with examination
             procedures;

          7. Signed Informed Consent Document (ICD) and Health Insurance Portability and
             Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Recurrent severe anterior or posterior segment inflammation or uveitis;

          2. Compromised eye due to previous trauma or developmental defects in which appropriate
             support of the IOL is not possible;

          3. Circumstances that would result in damage to the endothelium during implantation;

          4. Suspected ocular microbial infection;

          5. Subjects with conditions associated with increased risk of zonular rupture, including
             capsular or zonular abnormalities that may lead to IOL decentration, including
             pseudoexfoliation, trauma, or posterior capsule defects;

          6. Known ocular disease or pathology that, in the opinion of the investigator, may affect
             visual acuity or require surgical intervention during the course of the study,
             [macular degeneration, cystoid macular edema, proliferative diabetic retinopathy
             (severe), uncontrolled glaucoma, irregular corneal astigmatism, choroidal hemorrhage,
             concomitant severe eye disease, extremely shallow anterior chamber, microphthalmos,
             non-age related cataract, severe corneal dystrophy, severe optic nerve atrophy, etc.];

          7. Planned monovision correction;

          8. Concurrent participation or participation within 30 days prior to the preoperative
             visit in any other clinical study.
