  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dysfunctional breathing in children primarily affects the ability to participate in sport or
      exercise but can also stop children doing other activities such as playing musical
      instruments. Clinical experience has shown that physiotherapy (through the use of breathing
      retraining and other associated techniques) can stop the symptoms of dysfunctional breathing,
      allowing children to return to normal activities and reduce or stop inhaled medications.

      Whilst there is some evidence in adults with this condition to support the use of
      physiotherapy, there have been no studies carried out in children investigating whether
      physiotherapy is beneficial for children with dysfunctional breathing.

      This study therefore aims to investigate the feasibility of a future large scale multicentre
      clinical trial designed to investigate whether physiotherapy improves outcomes for children
      with dysfunctional breathing. The improved management of this common but under recognised
      condition would lead to significant improvements in the quality of life of children coupled
      with the reduction in potentially harmful medications.
