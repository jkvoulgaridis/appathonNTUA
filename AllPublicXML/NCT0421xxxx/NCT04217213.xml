  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project intends to investigate the effects of intercostal nerve block with ropivacaine
      combined with mecobalamin on chronic post-surgical pain (CPSP) in thoracic postoperative
      patients. Related clinical characteristics of postoperative chronic pain. The results of the
      study provide clinicians with a simple and inexpensive new method of preventing CPSP, in
      order to prevent the occurrence of CPSP and reduce the incidence of CPSP, thereby reducing
      CPSP to patients and their families, hospitals. And public resources.

    <time_frame>At the 3rd month after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of chronic pain after chest surgery was measured by NRS(numeric rating scales) at the 3rd month after surgery.For pain evaluation,we used the 11 point numeric rating scale(NRS),where an NRS scores of 0 represented &quot;no pain&quot; and a score of 10 represented &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;.</description>

    <description>An NRS score was performed 24 to 72 hours after surgery to determine the incidence of acute pain after thoracic surgery.For pain evaluation,we used the 11 point numeric rating scale(NRS),where an NRS scores of 0 represented &quot;no pain&quot; and a score of 10 represented &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of postoperative neuropathic pain</measure>
    <time_frame>At the 3rd month after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of neuropathic pain was measured by DN4 scale at the 3rd month after surgery.Douleur Neuropathique 4 (DN4) is a screening questionnaire to help identify neuropathic pain (NP) in clinical practice and research,where a DN4 scores greater than or equal to 4 represented the patients had &quot;postoperative neuropathic pain&quot;.</description>
