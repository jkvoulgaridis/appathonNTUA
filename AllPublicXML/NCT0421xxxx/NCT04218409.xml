  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some research suggests that administration of oxytocin with oxycodone may reduce its abuse
      liability and improve its ability to reduce pain. In a 4-session laboratory study, the
      investigators will be evaluating the effects of oxycodone and oxytocin (combined and
      separately, across sessions) on experimentally-induced pain, subjective effects,
      decision-making, and activation of different neural substrates.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall project goals are to determine oxytocin effects on oxycodone's subject-rated
      abuse liability, experimental pain, and to describe the neurobehavioral mechanisms underlying
      interindividual differences in these effects. Generally healthy individuals (determined via
      medical history review and a screening session) will, after informed consent, self-administer
      intranasal oxytocin (or placebo, containing the same ingredients but no oxytocin) shortly
      after oral oxycodone or placebo in a non-residential, double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, within-subjects laboratory study. Prescreening will assure MRI
      eligibility and drug application safety and, using a validated, comprehensive pain history
      interview, determine previous or existing chronic pain conditions, including current pain
      medication use.
