      The aim of the study is to compare the analgesic effect of fascia iliaca compartment block
      (FIC) block and pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block in hip fracture pain control. The
      participants, caregivers, and assessors will be blinded to the type of block the participants
      receive. Patients aged 20 years or older with hip fracture scheduled for surgical treatment
      will be assessed for eligibility to participate the study. One hundred eligible patients will
      be included in the study after informed consents are obtained, and then randomly allocated
      into either FIC block or PENG block, with 50 patients in each group. Both blocks will
      performed under ultrasound guidance.

      The followings will be assessed: the numerical rating pain scale (NRS 0-10, 0: no pain, 10:
      worst pain imaginable) at before and after nerve block at different time points during rest
      and passive internal rotation of the fractured lower limb to neutral position from its
      typical external rotation deformity 30 mins after block (primary outcome). The degree of
      patient's satisfaction regarding nerve blocks and anesthesiologist's satisfaction regarding
      patient position during spinal anesthesia will also be assessed. The pain and use of rescue
      analgesics in the first 24 hours after operation will be recorded.

      The aim of this study is to compare the analgesic effect of fascia iliaca compartment block
      (FIC) block and pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block in hip fracture pain control before
      operation.

      Methods This will be a randomized, assessor and participant-blinded study. After the patients
      give his /her informed consents, his/her baseline demographic data (gender, age, height, and
      body weight) and types of hip fracture will be recorded. Participants will be randomly
      allocated into either FIC block or PENG block by using the website RESEARCH RANDOMIZER
      (https://www.randomizer.org). One of the two anesthesiologists experienced in performed the
      FIC and PENG blocks will perform the nerve blocks. Only the anesthesiologist performing the
      nerve block and his assistant will be aware of which nerve block the participant receives
      immediately before performing nerve block by opening a sealed envelope. The assessors,
      in-charge anesthesiologists and nurse anesthetists, operation room personnel, surgeons and
      study participants will be all blinded to the randomization.

      On arrival of the operating theater, all participants will be sent to the nerve block area,
      where continuous electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, and non-invasive intermittent blood
      pressure monitoring will be applied and an intravenous line will be established. Before any
      intervention, pain at rest and during the fractured lower limb being passively internal
      rotated in extension to neutral position from its usual externally rotated deformity by
      assessors will assessed using NRS. If the participant cannot tolerate passive internal
      rotation of his/her fractured limb due to pain, impossibility to perform the test will be
      recorded as well as the worst NRS score during these attempts. The same assessment will be
      performed every 10 mins for until 30 mins after completion of the nerve block. Then the
      patient will be sent to the operation room, where spinal anesthesia will be performed for the
      surgery.

    <description>A linear ultrasound transducer is placed in a sagittal plane to identify the anterior superior iliac spine. By sliding the transducer medially, the fascia iliaca and abdominal internal oblique, sartorius, and iliopsoas muscles are identified. After identifying the &quot;bow-tie sign&quot;, a 23-gauge needle (7mm, Nipro, Japan) is inserted in plane from caudal to cephalad until the needle tip penetrate the fascia iliaca. After negative aspiration, 0.35% ropivacaine 30mL with 1:400,000 epinephrine will be injected to separate the fascia iliaca and the iliacus muscle.</description>

In this view, the iliopubic eminence, iliapsoas muscle and tendon, pectineus muscle, femoral artery and vein will be identified. A 23-gauge needle (7mm, Nipro, Japan) is inserted in plane from lateral to medial until the needle tip in the musculofascial plane between the psoas tendon anteriorly and the pubic ramus posteriorly. After negative aspiration, 0.35% ropivacaine 20mL with 1:400,000 epinephrine will be injected.</description>
