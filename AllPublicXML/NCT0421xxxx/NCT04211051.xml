  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the detection of small pulmonary nodules continuously grows, the intraoperative
      localization of small pulmonary nodules is in great demand. The intraoperative localization
      nowadays is usually done under local anesthesia before surgery. There is a certain rate of
      failure and complication. The result of our early animal experiments show that the pulmonary
      surgery marker system can deliver the intraoperative localization safely and precisely under
      anesthesia, and the average distance between the localization and the simulated lesion is
      less than 5mm during surgery. Therefore, the safety and feasibility of the system require
      further evaluation in patients

      This is a prospective, single-center clinical trial initiated by the investigator. LungBrella
      marker can be accurately implanted into a predetermined position in the lung assisted by
      JediVision software and successfully marked the pulmonary nodules which needs to undergo
      Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. The study is expected to enroll 10 patients. Finally,
      the effectiveness and safety of the method will be evaluated. This method not only can
      complete pulmonary nodule localization in the operating room without occupying the resources
      of radiology department, but also can let patients receive pulmonary nodule location after
      anesthesia. Thereby the risks during transportation are avoided and the suffering of patients
      is reduced.
