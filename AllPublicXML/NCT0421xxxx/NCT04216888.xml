  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to identify predictors of response to intranasal ketamine treatment in
      patients with treatment-resistant depression. Participants will give a sample of blood and
      undergo magnetic resonance imaging before and after a single intranasal ketamine treatment.
      Participants will subsequently receive a second intranasal ketamine treatment.

          2. Able to read, understand, and provide written, dated informed consent prior to
             screening. Participants will be deemed likely to comply with study protocol and
             communicate with study personnel about adverse events and other clinically important
             information.

          3. Ability to participate in MRI (no history of claustrophobia, no presence of metallic
             foreign bodies incompatible with MRI, as assessed with MRI checklist and clinical
             interview).

          4. Diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorders (MDD), single or recurrent, and currently
             experiencing a major depressive episode (MDE) of at least eight weeks in duration,
             prior to screening, according to the criteria defined in the Diagnosis and Statistical
             Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). The diagnosis of MDD will be made
             by a site psychiatrist and supported by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5
             (SCID-5).

          5. Has a history of treatment-resistant depression (TRD), as assessed by the investigator
             using the Mass General Hospital Antidepressant Treatment History Questionnaire (MGH
             ATRQ). TRD is defined as failure to achieve a satisfactory response (e.g., less than
             50% improvement of depression symptoms), as perceived by the participant, to at least
             1 &quot;treatment course&quot; of a therapeutic dose of an antidepressant therapy of at least 8
             weeks duration (including the current antidepressant treatment). The adequacy of dose
             and duration of the antidepressant therapy will be determined as per the MGH ATRQ
             criteria.

          6. Depression is of at least &quot;moderate&quot; severity, as determined by a Clinical Global
             Impression-Severity scale (CGI-S) score greater than or equal to 4).

          7. In good general health, as ascertained by medical history, physical examination

             injectable or patch hormonal contraception, oral contraceptives, IUD, double-barrier
             contraception, sexual abstinence. The form of birth control will be documented at
