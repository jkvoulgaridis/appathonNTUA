  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Refractory glaucoma is a difficult subject as many glaucoma devices attempt to reduce IOP.
      Baerveldt implant is considered as a large implant, and, on the contrary, Ahmed implant is
      considered a small implant as many comparisons have showed. Investigators have previously
      used two models S2 and FP7 Ahmed implant. Currently, investigators use Baerveldt implant in
      refractory glaucoma cases in order to compare it with the Ahmed implant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eighty-one participants with glaucoma after ocular surgery or secondary glaucoma with
      persistent and uncontrolled IOP &gt; 21 mmHg were randomized for placement of Baerveldt implant
      or Ahmed implant models using a standardized surgical technique.

      The primary outcome was failure, which was defined as IOP &gt;16 mmHg with glaucoma medication
      on 2 consecutive study visits. Secondary outcomes were IOP, medication use, visual acuity,
      complications, and interventions.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants were randomized to BGI model 101-350 placement (BGI group) or an AGV model FP7or S2 placement (AGV group). Follow-up visits were scheduled 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year postoperatively. The primary outcome measure was failure that defined as IOP &gt;16 mmHg or less than a 20% reduction below baseline on 2 consecutive study visits.The IOP, the use of glaucoma medications, visual acuity (VA), visual fields, bleb morphology and rates of surgical complications were secondary outcome measures.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>A 350 mm2 Baerveldt glaucoma implant was placed in the superotemporal quadrant in 25 patients randomized to BGI group. A limbus-based conjunctival flap was dissected, and the implant was sutured to sclera 10 mm posterior to the limbus. A scleral graft was used to cover the limbal portion of the tube, and the conjunctiva was closed.</description>

    <description>A 184 mm2 Ahmed glaucoma implant was placed in the superotemporal quadrant in 56 patients randomized to AGV group. A fornix-based conjunctival flap was dissected, and the implant was sutured to sclera 10 mm posterior to the limbus. The Ahmed tube left patent and viscoelastic substance injected into anterior chamber. A scleral graft was used to cover the limbal portion of the tube, and the conjunctiva was closed.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1 - patients with glaucoma who underwent a previous failed trabeculectomy or other
        intraocular surgery.

        2- patients who had secondary glaucoma and are known to have a high failure rate with
        trabeculectomy such as neovascular, uveitis, or iridocorneal endothelial
        syndrome-associated glaucoma, were included in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1 - patients lacked light perception, unwilling or unable to give informed consent, were
        expected to be unavailable for follow-up visits.

        supero-temporal drainage device implantation.

        3- presence of silicone oil, vitreous in the anterior chamber sufficient to require a
