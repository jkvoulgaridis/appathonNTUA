    <textblock>
      The goal of the LIBERATE-D clinical trial is to improve outcomes for patients recovering from
      dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury (AKI-D). The impact of a conservative dialysis
      strategy compared to standard clinical practice of thrice-weekly dialysis will be examined to
      help generate knowledge for how to guide delivery of dialysis to facilitate renal recovery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury (AKI-D) is a devastating complication among
      hospitalized patients for which there are no treatments other than supportive care. Recovery
      of sufficient renal function to stop dialysis is an unequivocally important clinical and
      patient-oriented outcome. Shortening dialysis duration and increasing the number of AKI-D
      patients who recover would have a major clinical, public health and cost-saving impact.
      However, there is currently no evidence to guide the delivery of dialysis to facilitate
      recovery. The investigators hypothesize that in patients who have AKI-D and who are
      hemodynamically stable, a conservative dialysis strategy--in which hemodialysis is not
      continued unless specific metabolic or clinical indications for renal replacement therapy
      (RRT) are present--will improve the likelihood of renal recovery compared with the current
      standard clinical practice of thrice-weekly intermittent dialysis. The investigators have
      conducted a pilot clinical trial to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. The
      investigators propose here a 2-center randomized controlled trial to test a conservative
      dialysis strategy in a larger AKI-D population (N = 220).
