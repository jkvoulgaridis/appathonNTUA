      This is a non-inferiority, open label, randomized trial of women on buprenorphine Medication
      Assisted Therapy for opioid use disorder in pregnancy.Patients will be randomized to either
      the long acting monthly subcutaneous SublocadeTM or to short acting sublingual Suboxone®.

    <textblock>
      Opioid use disorder increased among pregnant women in recent years, despite an overall
      decrease in the general population in the same time frame. Given the increased use of
      buprenorphine for opioid use disorder, it has now become the most commonly misused
      prescription opioid subtype. Untreated opioid use disorder is associated with worse maternal,
      fetal, and neonatal outcomes. To improve compliance with medication assisted therapy,
      decrease relapse and neonatal abstinence syndrome, we propose a randomized control trial of
      long acting subcutaneous buprenorphine compared to short acting sublingual
      buprenorphine/naloxone administration in pregnant and lactating women.

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a randomized, non-blinded single center clinical trial conducted at Ohio State University (OSU) Wexner Medical Center of 139 women with diagnosed Opioid Use Disorder. These women will be randomized between 14 and 27 weeks to one of two groups:
Sublingual Suboxone® 8mg twice daily
Subcutaneous SublocadeTM of 300mg monthly</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Evaluating the compliance with prescribed medication is not inferior in women assigned to SublocadeTM compared with those to Suboxone®.</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Compliance will be assessed by urine drug screens during pregnancy and postpartum visits that are positive for buprenorphine, with assessment of the number of drug screens which are negative for illicit drugs out of the total collected during the study period, with a minimum of three drug screens collected.</description>

    <measure>Evaluating concentration of buprenorphine and metabolites in maternal plasma</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment through four weeks postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>o A weekly blood draw will be collected, with evaluation of drug concentrations at approximate trough and peak levels before and after drug administration. The blood draw around the time of delivery will evaluate the association between drug concentration and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome outcomes.</description>
