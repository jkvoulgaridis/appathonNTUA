  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cleft palate repair is a common surgery in children.. As such children with cleft palate tend
      to have a compromised airway due to associated congenital anomalies like Pierre Robin
      syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome etc. After surgical correction of cleft palate, they are
      more prone to develop post-operative respiratory difficulty due to narrowed airway, increased
      secretion, pain and sedation caused by opioids.

      Hence, regional block, using local anesthetics, becomes a good option in this surgery.

      The supremacy of bilateral infraorital block using levo bupivacaine over intravenous fentanyl
      as well as over peri-incisional infiltration in has been shown .Levobupivacaine was developed
      after Ropivaciane was noted to be associated with less no of adverse events.. Ropivacaine has
      been used for peripheral block in children for surgical pain.

      Though the use of Levobupivacaine in regional blocks in facial surgeries has been well
      established, studies are still needed to establish its supremacy over Ropivacaine in cleft
      palate surgeries

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When compared with ropivacaine, levobupivacaine is a newer, safer, longer acting local
      anesthetic with rapid onset and prolonged duration of analgesia and similar or more
      pronounced nerve blocking effects, depending on the concentration. Hence the present study is
      aimed to compare the effectiveness of 0.375% levobupivacaine and 0..375% ropivacaine in infra
      orbital block for cleft palate surgery.
