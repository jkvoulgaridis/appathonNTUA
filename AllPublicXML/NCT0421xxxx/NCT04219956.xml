    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate if a polyamine deficient diet started 7 days prior to a
      major abdominal surgery (eventration cure and digestive continuity) and followed 7 days
      post-surgery reduces the area under the curve of the numerical pain rating scale in the 72
      hours post-surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Morphine derivatives are known to be a major cause of postoperative ileus and also operative
      hyperalgesia. Operative hyperalgesia corresponds to an increase in morphine needs
      postoperatively which is proportional to the morphine dose necessary during the surgery. This
      effect is due to two mechanisms: opioids tolerance and induced hypersensitivity.

      N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (R-NMDA) play a key role in this induced hypersensitivity.
      Polyamines, organic compounds with several amines functions, are known R-NMDA agonists. They
      increase the phosphorylation of the tyrosine group within the NR2B subunit responsible for
      the inflammatory hyperalgesia.

      Limiting the binding of polyamines to the R-NMDA seems an easy, safe and efficient way to
      limit the hypersensitivity induced post-operatively.

      Most of the polyamines in the human body come from food. One study listed food regarding
      their polyamines content and allowed to check the safety of a polyamine deficient diet. Such
      a well-followed diet would allow to reduce by 20 the polyamines quantity present in the body.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate whether a deficient polyamine diet introduced 7 days
      before and continued up to 7 days after an abdominal surgery requiring the use of morphine
      post-operatively reduces the post-operative pain, the consumption of analgesics (morphine)
      post-operatively and improve the recovery ability. Abdominals surgeries concerned will be the
      eventration cure and digestive continuity.

      The medico-economic impact will be observed during this study.
