  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether administration of FCX-007 in addition to
      standard of care improves wound healing as compared to standard of care alone (control) in
      children, adolescents, and adults with Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa.

    <textblock>
      DEFI-RDEB is a multi-center, intra-patient randomized, controlled, open-label, Phase 3 study
      of FCX-007 for the treatment of persistent non-healing wounds in approximately 20 RDEB
      subjects. Each subject will serve as his/her own control. Each subject's target wounds will
      be paired then randomized to receive FCX-007 (treatment wound) or remain untreated (control
      wound). Up to three target wound pairs will be identified for each subject. FCX-007 will be
      administered to one, two or three treatment wounds, as applicable; the corresponding paired
      control wounds will not be treated. Subjects who receive at least one FCX-007 administration
      will participate in a separate 15-year long-term safety follow-up study.
