  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Attentional Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (testing session 1) to week 5 (testing session 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Attentional Performance as measured by the Sustained Attention Response Task (SART).This task uses a continuous performance paradigm involving button presses to frequently presented non-targets (numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) but requires the participants to withhold their motor response to the infrequent target (number 3). Withholding responses only to infrequent targets encourages a pre-potent response and mind wandering. Real-time subjective experience of mind wandering during SART is assessed through experience-sampling probes randomly presented throughout the task.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Working Memory Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (testing session 1) to week 5 (testing session 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Working Memory Performance as measured by the Working memory task with Affective Distracters. In this task, participants are presented with a memory array that they are to encode and hold in memory during a delay interval. During the delay, emotionally negative or neutral scene images are presented.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Resilience</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (testing session 1) to week 5 (testing session 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Resilience as measured by the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, which is a 25-item measure of psychological resilience. It consists of a list of items that are rated on a scale from 0 to 4 (0 = not true at all, 4 = true nearly all the time), according to how participants feel the items are true of themselves.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cohesion</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (testing session 1) to week 5 (testing session 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Cohesion as measured by 3 items adapted from a questionnaire developed by Podsakoff and MacKenzie. Scale items are rated on a scale from 1 to 5 (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree), according to how much participants agree with each item.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Team Situation Monitoring</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (testing session 1) to week 5 (testing session 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Team Situation Monitoring is measured by 7-item subscale of the Teamwork Perception Questionnaire, which assesses individuals' shared perceptions of group-level team skills and behavior. The scale consists of a list of items that are rated on a scale from 1 to 5 (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree), according to how much participants agree with each item.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Workgroup Emotional Intelligence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (testing session 1) to week 5 (testing session 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Workgroup Emotional Intelligence as measured by the Workgroup Emotional Intelligence Profile, which is a 16-item measure of emotional intelligence abilities that manifest as behaviors in work teams. The scale consists of a list of items that are rated on a scale from 1 to 7 (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree), according to how much participants agree with each item. This measure reflects an individual's judgment of their ability to monitor and manage their own emotions and the emotions of the members of their squad.</description>

    <description>The MBAT-Team program is a 10-hour program. This course builds on the basic 4-week, 8-hour MBAT-Soldier program. In addition to the basic program, MBAT-Team includes exercises promoting the cultivation of attention and emotion regulation in the service of effective team interactions (e.g., mindful communication and listening; monitoring and attention to the activities and emotional states of others, and additional practices to promote collective mindfulness).</description>

    <description>The MBAT-Individual program is a 10-hour program based on the basic 4-week, 8-hour MBAT curriculum. It includes an additional 2 hours to match the duration of the 10-hour MBAT-Team program. These additional two hours allow for an extension of practice duration and discussion.</description>
