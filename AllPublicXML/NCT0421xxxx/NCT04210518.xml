      This study was a single-blinded randomized controlled trial with two intervention groups
      consisted in multimodal balance training, multimodal balance training in addition to
      stroboscopic glasses and control group who received no intervention.

    <masking>Triple (Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>An independent assessor blinded to the data collection was responsible for the allocation process. A list of the computer-generated number was employed to assign participants to balance training group, balance training with stroboscopic glasses group or control group.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ankle range of motion</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to six weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Ankle dorsiflexion range of motion was assessed by the weight-bearing lunge test. The patient is positioned in a standing position facing a wall with the involved foot parallel with a tape measure which has been attached to the floor and the opposite leg placed behind in a tandem stance. A forward lunge is performed until the anterior knee tries to make contact with the wall with the heel firmly planted on the ground.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dynamic balance</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to six weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Dynamic balance has been measured by a simplified version of the Star Excursion Balance Test where the anterior, posteromedial and posterolateral reach directions were collected for statistical analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported instability and function</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to six weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the severity of ankle instability the Cumberland ankle instability tool. This questionnaire is a nine items questionnaire ranged from 0 to 30 (0 related with severe impairment and 30 no subjective instability feeling) and has been reported to be a valid tool with high internal consistency and reliability.</description>

    <description>This intervention consisted of a supervised multimodal exercise protocol addressing different aspects of balance including static and dynamic tasks on the injured ankle. The training program comprised 6 exercises that were progressively adapted depending on the patient's execution controlled by an expert physiotherapist</description>
