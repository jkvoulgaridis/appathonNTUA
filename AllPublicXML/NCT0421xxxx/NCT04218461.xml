  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In intensive care unit (ICU) patients, the ability to predict delirium may help reduce its
      incidence, duration, and severity. The PREdiction of DELIRium in ICU (PRE-DELIRIC) model was
      recently developed for this purpose. Our aim was to test the PRE-DELIRIC model in the medical
      ICU.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delirium, a disturbance of consciousness with an acute onset and a variable course of
      impaired cognitive functioning, is common in patients admitted to the ICU. Several tools are
      available for assessing delirium in ICU patients, of which the confusion assessment
      method—intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) has the highest sensitivity and specificity.

      Although several predictive models for non-intensive care patients exist, as well as one for
      older medical intensive care patients, no evidence based prediction model for general
      intensive care patients is available. Also the tools are not involved the metabolic
      parameters which cause delirium. Because of that the tool need to have biochemical
      parameters.

      In the light of these information our aim is to validate the PRE-DELIRIC model in medical ICU
      in Turkish people.

    <description>CAM-ICU will be used for defining the delirium risk. We define delirium as a minimum of one positive CAM-ICU screening during each patient's intensive care stay developed and validated for ICU patients, assesses 10 risk factors for delirium that are readily observable within the first 24 hours following ICU admission. CAM-ICU scale includes of four items. The items are about level of consciousness, assessment of attention, state of thought organization and following a simple command. In order to be diagnosed with delirium, the first two items and one of the third or fourth item must be in favor of delirium.</description>

    <description>The PRE-DELIRIC model will be used for defining the delirium risk. The PRE-DELIRIC model developed and validated for ICU patients, assesses 10 risk factors for delirium that are readily observable within the first 24 hours following ICU admission. The model consists of biochemical parameters, used drugs, infection status.</description>

    <description>The investigator will assess the CAM-ICU and PRE-DELIRIC in the first 24 hours after the patient comes to the ICU. The PRE-DELIRIC model and CAM-ICU will use for defining the deliirum risk. The investigators will do validity and reliability of PRE-DELIRIC model in medical ICU patients.</description>
