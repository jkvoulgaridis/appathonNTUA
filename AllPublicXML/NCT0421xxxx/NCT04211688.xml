  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background and Objectives: Schema therapy has been shown to be of benefit in treating
      borderline personality disorder. However, it is still unclear what the most suitable
      treatment implementation format is and to what extent therapeutic gains may be generalizable
      to regular healthcare settings with limited resources.

      Methods: A pragmatic randomized controlled trial was conducted ona representative Spanish
      sample of outpatients with a DSM-5 main diagnosis of borderline personality disorder.
      Patients were allocated either to a combined (group plus individual) schema therapy format
      (n=40) or to a group-only schema therapy format (n=40). Borderline personality disorder
      severity was the primary outcome, with other clinical variables considered as secondary
      outcomes (e.g., early maladaptive schemas, functioning). The assessment protocol included
      baseline, post-treatment (after 12months of treatment), and six-month follow-up evaluations.
      Data was analyzed through a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. Limitations were a limited
      follow-up assessment and the absence of multi-center data that detracted from the long-term
      stability and generalizability of the findings.
