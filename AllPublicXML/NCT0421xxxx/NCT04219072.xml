  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women worldwide according to International
      Agency for Research on Cancer. Unfortunately, cancer survivors often face long-term symptoms
      that occur or persist after completion of treatment. In addition to fatigue, pain is the most
      common persistent symptom after cancer and cancer treatment. The diagnosis and treatment of
      pain in cancer survivors is not clear for many physicians. A mechanism-based classification
      of pain in cancer survivors might be a critical step for clinical reasoning, especially for
      discrimination of different pain types. The primary aim of this study is to determine the
      prevalence of the predominant type of pain in Turkish breast cancer survivors using a recent
      published clinical algorithm.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Numeric Pain Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minute</time_frame>
    <description>The NPRS was used to assess the participants' pain levels. In the NPRS, patients are asked to verbally rate the severity of their pain on a scale. The scale is composed of 0 (no pain at all) to 10 (worst imaginable pain).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Margolis Pain Diagram</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minute</time_frame>
    <description>The Margolis Pain Diagram, consists of a dorsal and a ventral drawing body, is used to assess the location and distribution of the pain. Participants will ask to point out the place where they experience pain during the preceding 4 weeks for at least 24 hours</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Central Sensitization Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minute</time_frame>
    <description>The Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI) aims to evaluate symptoms thought to be associated with nociplastic pain. The CSI consists 25 items exploring emotional and somatic disorders associated with CS. Each response is scored from 0 to 4, yielding a total score of 0 to 100. A score of 40 or higher on the CSI means the presence of nociplastic pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form 36</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minute</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form-36 (SF-36) is widely used to measurement of health related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaire. SF-36 is a 36-item generic self-administered instrument consisting of 8 subscales related to various aspects of HRQoL: physical functioning, physical role, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional role, and mental health. The 8 subscales are scored from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health status.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quantitative sensory test</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minute</time_frame>
    <description>Quantitative sensory testing (QST) is a psychophysical method used to quantify somatosensory function in patients. In QST will be used various stimuli static thermal (thermotest), static mechanical ( a painter brush), pinprick (a calibrated pin) and vibration ( a tuning folk). QST will interrogate whether each stimulus is considered a sensory loss (negative sign) or sensory gain (positive sign or hyperalgesia).</description>

        The convenience sampling will implement for this cross-sectional study. Breast cancer
        survivors experiencing chronic pain who presented at the Department of Oncology of Kutahya
        Health Sciences University Evliya Celebi Hospital will screen for eligibility by their
        physician and were subsequently requested to participate in this study.
