  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer is a kind of disease with high incidence and mortality. Definitive
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy is an important treatment for locally advanced esophageal
      squamous cell carcinoma. Due to the epidemiological and pathological differences between
      eastern and western world, it is not clear how to select the optimal radiotherapy dose for
      locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Currently, low dose radiotherapy (50.4Gy
      in 28 fractions) based on western study is recommended internationally.

      In this study, After a low-dose treatment, pet-ct was used to evaluate the residual lesions
      of the primary tum or, and the boost radiotherapy was given to the residual lesions to a
      higher dose of 61.2Gy in 34 fractions. It was hoped that the functional imaging guided
      radiotherapy mode could further improve the efficacy without increasing the toxicities.

    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer is a kind of disease with high incidence and mortality. According to the
      latest epidemiological research in 2018, there were 16,980 new cases of esophageal cancer and
      15,690 deaths in the United States every year. Compared with western countries, the diagnosis
      and treatment of esophageal cancer was more aggressive in China. According to study in 2015,
      esophageal cancer ranked the fourth malignant tumor in China, with 477,900 new cases and
      375,000 deaths per year, far higher than western countries.

      In addition to epidemiological difference, there were also significant pathological
      discrepancy between eastern and western world. In Europe and the United States, more than 75
      percent of esophageal cancers are adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus or the
      gastroesophageal junction, and the proportion of squamous cell carcinoma is less than 25
      percent. In East countries, especially China, more than 75 percent of esophageal cancers are
      primary squamous cell cancers located in the middle and upper thoracic segments, whereas
      adenocarcinoma accounted for less than 20 percent.

      Unlike other malignancies, more than half of esophageal cancer were diagnosed as locally
      advanced at the time of diagnosis. According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network
      (NCCN) guideline, platinum-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy is one of the standard
      treatments for locally advanced esophageal cancer who could not be achieved surgical
      treatment. This recommendation was based on studies of RTOG8501 and RTOG9405. In RTOG8501,
      investigators found that concurrent chemoradiotherapy at the radiation dose of 50Gy/25F could
      significantly improve the 5-year survival rate and median survival time (5-years overall
      survival (OS), 27% vs. 0; Median OS, 14m vs. 9m). On those basis, the RTOG9405 study further
      explored the optimal radiotherapy dose of esophageal cancer. It found that the high dose of
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy (64.8Gy /36F) did not significantly improve the prognosis of the
      patients accepted the low dose therapies (50.4Gy /28F), with a two-year survival rate of 31%
      vs. 40%, and a median survival of 13 months and 18.1 months, respectively. This low
      radiotherapy dose of 50-50.4Gy / 25-28f is currently the recommended dose for the locally
      advanced esophageal cancer.

      However, in clinical practice, some scholars questioned the above conclusions. The two
      prospective studies was based on western population, with more than 75 percent enrolled
      patients diagnosed as adenocarcinoma. Therefore, they believed that low-dose radiotherapy of
      50-50.4Gy / 25-28f would not be suitable for all patients, especially for East Asian
      patients.

      A retrospective study from South Korea attempted to answer these questions. This study mainly
      included patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (squamous cell
      carcinoma inclusion ratio &gt;90%), and directly compared the outcomes of high dose (63Gy) and
      low dose (54Gy) treatments. The results showed that high-dose radiotherapy significantly
      increased patients' regional control rate (2y-lrc, 69% vs. 32%, P&lt;0.01) and 2-year
      progression-free survival rate (47% vs. 20%, P=0.01). High-dose radiotherapy also increased
      the median overall survival (28 months vs. 18 months, P=0.26). Surprisingly, another
      retrospective analysis based on western population also found the similar results, suggesting
      that increased radiation dose tended to improve outcomes (3y-lc, 36% vs. 19%, P=0.011), local
      relapse-free survival (3y-dfs, 25% vs. 10%, P=0.004), and overall survival (3y-os, 13% vs.
      3%, P=0.054). Meanwhile, some researchers believe that under the conditions of modern
      radiotherapy technology, high dose radiotherapy &gt;60Gy might be the optimal dose for
      esophageal cancer by increasing the accuracy of treatment. At present, high dose radiotherapy
      was common used in many centers of China.

      The radiotherapy sensitivity of esophageal cancer has great heterogeneity. For the
      radiotherapy sensitive patients, even a low radiotherapy dose (&lt;45Gy/25F), approximately
      30-40% of patients could achieve pathological complete response, and more than 50% of
      patients would be good responses. Moreover, there were different radiosensitive regions in
      the same individual. Therefore, if the investigators could identify the radiotherapy
      sensitive regions or patients and delivered an individualized therapy dose would build the
      optimal treatment mode.

      In this study, after a low-dose concurrent chemoradiotherapy (50.4Gy/28F), a scheduled pet-ct
      was used to evaluate the chemoradiotherapy response of the first course treatment. An
      additional dose was only boosted to the residual lesions identified by pet-ct. The
      investigators hoped the new functional image based radiotherapy could change the traditional
      radiotherapy model.
