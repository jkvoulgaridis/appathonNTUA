    <textblock>
      This study consists of two parts: Phase I is a dose escalation study to determine the
      Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of MGD013 monotherapy and that of MGD013 when in combination
      with Brivanib Alaninate (ZL-2301) in subjects with advanced liver cancer (including
      hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma). Phase II is a dose expansion
      study and consists of two parts: Part 1 is to assess the safety and efficacy of MGD013
      monotherapy and MGD013 in combination with ZL-2301 in subjects with advanced hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC); in Part 2, a therapeutic method (MGD013 monotherapy or MGD013 in combination
      with ZL-2301, determined by the sponsor according to the obtained data) will be selected for
      dose expansion study in HCC subjects who have previously failed immune checkpoint inhibitor
      treatment, to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of the study treatments in the
      specific group of subjects.
