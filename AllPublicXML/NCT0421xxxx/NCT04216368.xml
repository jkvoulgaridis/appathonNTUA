  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resistance training and aerobic exercise have been recommended for sarcopenic patients.
      However, whether balance training would further benefit for sarcopenic patients on the basis
      of resistance training and aerobic exercise remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to
      explore the effect of balance training on improving the mobility of elderly patients with
      sarcopenia. Balance training involves doing exercises that strengthen the muscles that help
      keep the aged upright, including the legs and core. These kinds of exercises can improve
      stability and help prevent falls.
