  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The onset and offset of the neural inspiratory time are fundamentally important measurements
      in studies of patientventilator interaction, where the level of assistance delivered by the
      ventilator is controlled by the patient's demand. The onset of neural inspiratory time can be
      determined in esophageal pressure, transdiaphragmatic pressure, and EMG signals. The
      investigator compare the onset measured by EMG, esophageal and transdiaphragmatic pressure,
      and consider that the correlation between them is well in different conditions.

      The onset and offset of the neural inspiratory time are fundamentally important measurements
      in studies of patien-tventilator interaction, where the level of assistance delivered by the
      ventilator is controlled by the patient's demand. Patient-ventilator asynchrony evaluated
      using the time lag between onset of the neural inspiratory time and the onset of a mechanical
      ventilation signal. The onset of neural inspiratory time can be determined in esophageal
      pressure, transdiaphragmatic pressure, and EMG signals. The investigator compare the onset
      measured by EMG, esophageal and transdiaphragmatic pressure, and consider that the
      correlation between them is well in three different conditions.

    <description>Before experiment ,every subject use a flanged mouthpiece attached to a manually operated occlusion valve in order to measure maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP)at functional residual capacity .
And then, the healthy subjects will be increased the neural respiratory drive by increasing the pressure in a water-sealed inspiratory threshold loading device. At last, all subjects will do Incremental cycle ergometry test with the assisstance of NPPV.</description>
