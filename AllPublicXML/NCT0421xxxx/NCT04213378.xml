  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past two decades, stents implantation has developed as a standard treatment for
      coronary stenosis lesions. However, int-stent restenosis (ISR) was one of the main factors
      affecting the long-term efficacy of coronary artery interventional therapy, with the
      incidence of ISR after percutaneous coronary intervention ranging from 5% to 35%. At present,
      there are three main means for ISR: (1) simple balloon dilation; 2) intravascular
      radiotherapy; and (3) drug elution stent. But the results are still not ideal. Drug coated
      balloon (DCB) is a new method that may be used to treat ISR in recent years. In the PEPCAD II
      study, when dealing with ISR, the paclitaxel eluting balloon (PEB) SeQuent® Please
      significantly reduced the major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) compared to the
      paclitaxel eluting stent (PES) TAXUS Liberte. In ISR-I and ISR-II trial, it was found that
      compared with uncoated PTCA balloons, PEB could significantly inhibit endothelial hyperplasia
      and significantly reduce MACEs treating ISR. The purpose of this study was to assess the
      efficacy and safety of a Chinese-developed PEB in treatment of coronary ISR compared to
      SeQuent® Please PEB.
