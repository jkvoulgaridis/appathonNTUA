  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical difference (mean IOP, success rate, and complications) on using S2 and FP7
      models of Ahmed Glaucoma Valve that had similar dimensions and different materials used for
      their construction in one year follow up was evaluated.

    <textblock>
      Refractory glaucoma is a difficult subject; many glaucoma devices are tried to reduce IOP.
      Glaucoma devices is now an integral part of glaucoma surgery. AGV is commonly used. The
      investigators need to compare the efficiency and failure rate of two models of AGV. The point
      that is the biological reaction around capsule can affect the efficiency.

    <description>polypropylene plate of Ahmed Glaucoma Valve procedures were performed under local anesthesia except for children, general anesthesia was used. The polypropylene plate was primed and placed in the superotemporal quadrant after making fornix-based conjunctival flap. The valve plate was secured to sclera with 10-0 nylon sutures 10 mm posterior to the limbus. Before implantation, applying sponges soaked with Mitomycin- c 0.3 cc for three minutes on bare sclera at this quadrant. The tube was placed in the anterior chamber through a 23-gauge needle tract at the limbus. The tube left patent and viscoelastic substance injected into anterior chamber. A donor scleral graft was secured with interrupted 10-0 nylon sutures over the exposed portion of the tube. Conjunctiva was sutured with 10-0 nylon sutures.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. primary glaucoma patients with repeated failed trabeculectomy or other intraocular
             surgery.

          2. patients had secondary glaucoma known to have a high failure rate with trabeculectomy
             such as neovascular, uveitis, post keratoplasty glaucoma or iridocorneal endothelial
             syndrome-associated glaucoma.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. patients lacked light perception, unwilling or unable to give informed consent, lived
             out of the area and were expected to be unavailable for follow-up visits,

          2. patients had previous aqueous shunt implanted in the same eye, other external
             impediment to supero-temporal drainage device implantation.

          3. patients had silicone oil, vitreous in the anterior chamber sufficient to require a
             vitrectomy.

          4. patients had uveitis associated with a systemic condition like juvenile rheumatoid
             arthritis.

          5. patients had nanophthalmos, Sturge-Weber syndrome or other conditions associated with
             elevated episcleral venous pressure.
