  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is for patients with an advanced cancer that carries a mutation in a gene
      called KRAS. Genes are parts of our DNA which carry instructions for a cell (the smallest
      component of an body part). In many cancers, the KRAS gene contains errors (mutations) which
      allows the tumors to grow. The purpose of this study is to determine if combination treatment
      with atezolizumab, cobimetinib, and hydroxychloroquine is safe, and if it will decrease the
      size of the tumor and prolong life in patients whose tumors contain this mutation.
      Cobimetinib and atezolizumab are both approved by the FDA for use in other cancers, but not
      in some cancer types being studied in this trial. Hydroxychloroquine is FDA approved to treat
      malaria and other conditions, but has also not been approved for these cancer types.
      Preliminary results have shown that this combination of drugs is effective at killing cancer
      cells and shrinking tumors in several KRAS-mutated cancers in animals.

      The overall objective of this study is to investigate the safety and preliminary efficacy of
      combination therapy with cobimetinib and hydroxychloroquine, with or without atezolizumab in
      patients with KRAS-mutated advanced malignancies. Given that the pre-clinical and clinical
      benefit from this combination is from within poorly differentiated endocrine carcinoma (PDAC)
      animal models and human subjects with PDAC and duodenal cancer, we will include at least 12
      of the 18 evaluable subjects from PDAC and/or colorectal malignancies. The phase 2 portion of
      the study will be amended after preliminary safety and efficacy results from phase 1 and
      other ongoing clinical trials have been analyzed and a summary incorporated within the
      protocol as an amendment including a rationale of the cohorts to be tested.
