  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to identify and systematically characterize Parkinson's patients with
      mutations in the LRRK2 gene. In about 90% of Parkinson's patients the cause of the disease is
      unclear. Based on current knowledge, it can be assumed that there are several causes and that
      the causes may be differ between patients; this makes research into the pathogenesis and
      possible therapies very difficult. In the case of monogenic Parkinson's diseases, which are
      due to changes in one gene (e.g. LRRK2), the function of the gene and possible disease
      mechanisms can be investigated. LRRK2-associated Parkinson's syndrome is clinically
      indistinguishable from idiopathic Parkinson's disease. It is inherited autosomal dominant,
      that means if one of the two gene copies is altered, the disease occurs. However, the disease
      does not occur in every mutation carrier, the penetrance is reduced and the mechanisms for
      that are still unclear. Ideally, knowledge of what influences penetrance could make it
      possible to exert targeted influence and prevent the disease. The comprehensive investigation
      of mechanisms of reduced penetrance but also of the effects of the mutation itself requires
      systematic investigations of as many affected persons as possible. We therefore aim to
      identify 4,000 people internationally, of them 1,500 with LRRK2-associated Parkinson's
      syndrome, 500 with LRRK2-mutations but without Parkinson's symptoms, 500 without mutations
      and without Parkinson's symptoms, 500 Parkinson patients with mutations in other genes than
      LRRK2 and 1,000 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease from the same populations. The
      participants will undergo a comprehensive survey on Parkinson's symptoms, concomitant
      diseases, environmental factors and medication and there is the possibility of more detailed
      genetic examinations. Participants will be asked to donate samples of blood, urine and
      household dust.

      Blood and urine samples will be biochemically analysed to determine factors leading to
      incomplete penetrance in LRRK2 positive carriers and biomarkers of Parkinson's disease.

      In blood samples DNA and DNA methylation, RNA and proteins will be analysed. Urine samples
      will be analysed using NGS-based sequencing of the mitochondrial genome and search for
      mitochondrial DNA deletions.

      Dust will be analysed toxicologically.
