  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an increase in prescriptions for analgesics opioids and overdose mortality in
      France.

      In the United States, the consumption of opioid analgesics is associated with excess
      mortality, especially suicide. In France, the investigator team showed retrospectively a link
      between history of suicide attempt (SA) and use of analgesics in general elderly population.

      It is important to determine if there is a link between the prescription of opioid analgesics
      and suicide attempts, in a longitudinal study in general population.

      The originality of the project lies in:

        -  the absence of a French epidemiological study on the link between opioid analgesics and
           suicide attempt / mortality despite the context of &quot;opioid crisis&quot;,

        -  taking into account the terms of consumption of care

      Main objective:

      To estimate the relative risk (Odds ratio) of SA associated with exposure to opioid
      analgesics in a case-crossover design study

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To Compare the profile of subjects who attempted suicide versus subjects who had an
           accidental drug intoxication with opioids vs subjects who did not attempt suicide or did
           not have an accidental overdose with opioid analgesics (case-control design)

        2. To Evaluate the dose-effect of opioid analgesics on the risk of SA (case-control and
           case-crossover design).

        3. To Identify changes in care consumption (medical consultations, co-prescriptions,
           changes in analgesic doses) in the 3 months preceding a SA in patients who received at
           least one prescription for opioid analgesics in the same period.

      The Database is retrospective (2012-2017) Two methods will be used

      -case crossover study (reference period of 3 months preceding the SA versus 3 control periods
      of 3 months without SA.- Case control study (Age and gender matching) Case 1 = occurrence of
      a SA according to PMSI codes &quot;X60 to X84&quot; between the date of the first delivery of opioid
      analgesics recorded in the SNIIRAM database since 2012 and December 2017; Case 2 = subjects
      who had accidental drug intoxication with opioid analgesics according to PMSI code &quot;T40&quot;;
      Controls = absence of SA and accidental opioid overdose
