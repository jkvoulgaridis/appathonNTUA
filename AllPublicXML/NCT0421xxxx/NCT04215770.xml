      To compare intravenous Co-amoxiclav versus Benzyl penicillin in children with severe
      streptococcal tonsillitis in terms of efficacy, safety and cost effectiveness.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Efficacy was measured through improvement (decrease in fever, settling lymphadenopathy and
      disappearance of tonsillar exudate) in Centor Criteria score on daily basis. Improvement i.e
      reduction in Centor Criteria score was recorded for all children till full recovery.

      Safety was measured by frequency of hypersensitivity reactions or severe side effects of
      antibiotics necessitating stoppage of the drug. All the children in both Groups were given
      test dose of the antibiotic before giving full dose of antibiotic prescribed.

      Cost effectiveness was compared in terms of total cost of injections (Co-amoxiclav versus
      Benzyl penicillin) which were administered to children in both groups.
