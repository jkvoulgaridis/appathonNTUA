  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the cross-sectional relationship between sleep duration
      (as measured by 14 days of actigraphy) and glycemic control in an adolescent Type 2 Diabetes
      (T2DM) cohort (age 12-20y, n=67). A secondary objective is to determine if a loss-framed
      incentive for achieving sleep goals can increase sleep duration in 15 adolescent patients
      diagnosed with T2DM with insufficient sleep. Another secondary objective is to test if
      increasing sleep duration leads to improved glycemic control in 15 adolescents with T2DM
      identified in Aim 1 as having &lt;8 hr sleep/evening.

      Aim 1 will be a cross-sectional study design utilizing actigraphy watch devices to estimate
      sleep duration. Participants will be recruited either before or after a routine outpatient
      clinic visit and asked to complete intake questionnaires. They will then be provided an
      actigraphy watch device which will be worn for 14 days to estimate sleep duration, and Libre
      continuous glucose monitor (CGM) to estimate glycemic control. After their visit, clinical
      data will be extracted from the electronic medical record.

      Aim 2 will be an interventional study design utilizing Fitbit to perform a loss-framed
      incentive intervention designed to motivate participants to increase their sleep duration.
      Glycemic control will be measured via laboratory testing of hemoglobin A1c and Libre
      continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for 2 weeks pre- and post-intervention.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects age 12-20

          2. Diagnosed with T2DM by standard laboratory criteria without pancreatic autoimmunity

          3. Low probability of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) assessed via validated sleep survey

          4. Subjects will be included if they are taking T2DM treatments (i.e., diet modification,
             Metformin and/or insulin) 5 Average sleep duration &lt; 8 hours per night as determined
             by actigraphy in Aim 1

        6. HbA1c â‰¤ 10% as HbA1c &gt;10 correlates to poor adherence 7. Adherence &gt; 80%

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Non-English speaking subject (as questionnaires used are validated in English)

          2. Institutionalized patients as sleep duration will not be of their own accord, and
             therefore is not generalizable to the rest of the adolescent T2DM population.

          3. Patients with other forms of Diabetes Mellitus (e.g. Type 2 Diabetes)

          4. Behavioral disorders that may affect data collection (e.g. autism spectrum disorder)
             will be determined on a case-by-case basis. These include patients that are unable to
             answer questionnaires on their own, participate in a sleep diary, wear devices and/or
             understand incentives.

          5. Oral or IV steroid treatment within the past month

          6. Females with known pregnancies as these patients will not be generalizable to the rest
             of the adolescent T2DM population and pregnancy may alter sleep duration.

          7. Subjects with known hyperthyroidism, pain syndrome, or serious medical condition that
             can affect sleep.

          8. Subjects with hemoglobinopathies that affect hemoglobin A1c measurement.

          9. Patients with other forms of Diabetes Mellitus (e.g. Type 1 Diabetes)

         10. Unable to obtain point-of-care hemoglobin A1c in clinic on date of recruitment

         11. Do not own a smart phone or tablet device
