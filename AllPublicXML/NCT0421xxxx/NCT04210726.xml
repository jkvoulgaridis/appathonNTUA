      This Study evaluates the effectiveness of Hypertonic Saline Bath in reducing the Cancer
      nodules' size, number and SUVmax.

      Many previous studies have shown that the Cancer cells are over-hydrated, and that
      Hyponatraemia exists in many cases of Cancer. The Cancer cell's viability depends on
      Angiogenesis and formation of blood vessels that carry water and nutrient to the
      rapidly-dividing Cancer cells. This study tests the hypothesis that disrupting the water
      content of blood could lead to increasing its Tonicity and hence withdrawing water from the
      Cancer cells by Osmosis, which can result in disrupting the growth of the Cancer cell itself.
      This disruption of Blood Water content can be achieved using Osmotic Pressure differential
      via immersing the whole body in Hypertonic Saline Solution for a certain amount of time, thus
      making the Blood more Hypertonic relative to the cells of the body and of the cancer, leading
      to water withdrawal from the cells of the body and of the cancer. While body's cells can
      sustain temporary dehydration, Cancer cells could be negatively affected.

    <intervention_model_description>A pilot randomized blinded controlled study, whereas a number of patients with clinically-diagnosed Cancer (any type, any location and any stage), and who were poorly responsive to at least one cycle of conventional and standard therapy (Chemotherapy or Radiation therapy), are equally divided into 2 groups, Active and Control groups. The Active group patients will separately have an immersion bath in 25% Sea Salt in Water solution at a temperature comfortable to every patient, whereas the bath solution is in direct contact with the skin, for 30 minutes once daily for 7 consecutive days, in addition to their standard treatments they receive from their health care providers. The Control group's patients will separately have a bath in 0.9% Sea Salt in Water at a comfortable temperature whereas the bath solution is in direct contact with the skin, for 30 minutes once daily for 7 consecutive days, in addition to their standard treatments they receive from their health care providers.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Participants will not know which Group (Active/Control) they are assigned to, only the Investigator will know. The amount of Salt added to each bath (and hence the concentration of each bath) will not be known by Participants. Assignment will be random using a simple computer program.</masking_description>
