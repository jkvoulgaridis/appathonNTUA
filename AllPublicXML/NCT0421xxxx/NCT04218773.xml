  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open label, prospective, single center, pilot trial to assess feasibility and tolerability
      of short term blood pressure augmentation to minimize infarct progression in acute LVO stroke
      patients undergoing endovascular therapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is planned to include 40 subjects with acute LVO stroke who meet the eligibility
      criteria. In stage 1 of the study, the investigators will monitor beat-to-beat blood pressure
      and other hemodynamic parameters in 20 patients receiving standard of care therapy. For the
      second stage, the investigators will enroll an additional 20 patients who will receive blood
      pressure augmentation therapy using intravenous fluids and phenylephrine or norepinephrine
      infusion. The investigators will increase baseline systolic blood pressure by 20% to at least
      160 mmHg until blood vessel recanalization is achieved or the thrombectomy procedure is
      completed. The study will assess how quickly a target blood pressure can be reached in the
      acute stroke setting, and furthermore the ability to successfully maintain these blood
      pressure targets throughout the intervention and avoid hypotension during conscious sedation
      or general anesthesia. The primary research hypothesis of the trial is that treatment failure
      defined as an inability to achieve and maintain blood pressure targets despite the use of
      maximum tolerable doses of vasopressors (phenylephrine or norepinephrine) occurs in less than
      20% of cases. In addition, the study will evaluate the recruitment feasibility and
      preliminary safety of blood pressure augmentation.

    <description>Number of treatment-related SAEs including but not limited to myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure and death during the first 24 hours from enrollment. Any SAE judged probably or definitely related to the study treatment is counted as a treatment-related SAE. The timeframe for SAE is based on the rapid onset and short half-life of phenylephrine and norepinephrine. Late SAEs are not expected to be related to treatment; however, these SAEs also are ascertained.</description>

    <description>The scientists will investigate the potential consequences of increasing baseline systolic blood pressure with intravenous fluids and phenylephrine by 20% to at least 160 mmHg until blood vessel recanalization is achieved or the thrombectomy procedure is completed. The maximum allowed SBP is 220 mmHg or 180 mmHg, if intravenous TPA was administered.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive intravenous phenylephrine at a rate of 60 µg/min. The infusion rate will be adjusted at 30 µg/min increments (maximum 180 µg/min) at 3-minute intervals to maintain an increase in SBP to the target SBP of 160 - 220 mmHg or a 20% increase above baseline SBP values.</description>

    <description>As an alternative to intravenous phenylephrine, intravenous norepinephrine can be used with an initial infusion rate of 3 mcg/min. The initial infusion rate of norepinephrine will be adjusted at 1 mcg/min increments at 3-minute intervals to achieve and maintain the target blood pressure. Maximum dose is 25 mcg/min. Combination therapy with both agents (phenylephrine and norepinephrine) to achieve and maintain blood pressure targets is not permitted.</description>
