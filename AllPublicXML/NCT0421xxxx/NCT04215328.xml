  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to develop therapy for obesity and diabetes that is as effective as
      gastric bypass surgery but without the cost and safety concerns.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric bypass leads to rapid, sustained diabetes remission in the majority of patients who
      undergo this procedure and is also highly effective therapy for obesity. However, currently
      &lt;1% of medically-eligible patients undergo this or other bariatric operations due to cost and
      safety concerns. The approach is based on data suggesting that the benefit of gastric bypass
      is largely due to anatomical rearrangement of the intestine which leads to accelerated
      delivery of nutrients to the jejunum. This rerouting of nutrients stimulates the release of
      multiple neural, hormonal and enterokine responses that are associated with appetite
      suppression and improved glucose control. In this pilot proposal the question under
      investigation is whether repeated rapid delivery of a mixed meal directly to the jejunum can
      promote weight loss and glucose control.
