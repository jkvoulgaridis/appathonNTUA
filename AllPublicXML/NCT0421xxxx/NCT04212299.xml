  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this pilot research project is to evaluate the effect of prosthetic socket
      design on amputated limb hip muscle strength and endurance in Service members, Veterans, and
      civilians who use above-the-knee prostheses. Traditional above-the-knee socket designs
      provide pelvic support that interferes with hip motion. They may also reduce the effort
      required from amputated limb hip muscles to stabilize the hip and amputated limb, risking
      further loss of muscle mass and strength beyond that due to amputation. Long-standing use of
      above-the-knee sockets with pelvic support may therefore intensify amputated limb muscle loss
      and weakness, leading to challenges with walking and balance, increasing the effort required
      to walk, and contributing to degenerative changes in the hips and knees. Alternative socket
      designs that lessen the loss of muscle mass and strength are therefore required.

      The investigators have developed a new socket without pelvic support for above-the-knee
      prosthesis users called the Northwestern University Flexible Sub-Ischial Suction (NU-FlexSIS)
      Socket. This new socket design increases user comfort and is often preferred by users over
      sockets with pelvic support. This new socket does not lessen the mechanical function of the
      socket, or walking and balance performance. Our recent research suggests that walking with
      this new socket may also increase amputated limb hip muscle size. However, more research is
      needed to demonstrate that this new socket design improves amputated limb hip muscle strength
      and endurance, leading to better function.

      A socket design that increases amputated limb hip muscle strength and endurance would provide
      a simple way to restore amputated limb hip muscle weakness in above-the-knee prosthesis
      users. Despite a considerable decrease in hip muscle size and strength due to amputation
      surgery, amputated limb hip muscles are expected to compensate for the loss of knee and ankle
      function by providing stability and propulsion during walking. Walking in the new socket
      design without pelvic support is expected to increase amputated limb hip muscle strength and
      endurance, providing an appealing alternative to traditional resistance training in order to
      retain hip muscle strength. Unlike traditional resistance training, using this new socket
      design would not require additional time or equipment, and may be effective just by walking
      in the home, community, or workplace. Due to existing infrastructure (e.g., ongoing clinical
      adoption of the NU-FlexSIS Socket, existing instructional materials and courses for
      fabrication and fitting of the NU-FlexSIS Socket, as well as a continuing partnership with
      Chicago's largest provider of prosthetic clinical care), the investigators anticipate being
      able to translate our research results to clinical practice by the end of the project period.

      The investigators expect the results of the proposed pilot research project to directly and
      positively benefit the health and well-being of Service members, Veterans, and civilians who
      are above-the-knee prosthesis users. Benefits of increasing amputated limb hip muscle
      strength and endurance may include: i) improved control over the prosthesis, ii) better
      balance, iii) reduced effort to walk, and iv) protection against joint degeneration. For
      Service members these benefits could improve their performance on challenging and/or uneven
      ground, and increase the distance and speed they can walk or run. For Veterans, these
      benefits could lead to greater independence during activities of daily living, and fewer
      falls, reducing the physical and emotional burden on family members and caregivers.

    <description>The sub-ischial socket includes a firm, compressive, preferably cylindrical, fabric-covered silicone liner, a flexible inner socket, and a shorter rigid outer socket. The socket has proximal trim lines that do not impinge on the pelvis; they terminate distal to the ischial tuberosity and greater trochanter. For the NU-FlexSIS Socket, passive suction suspension is achieved using a one way valve and a liner with an internal seal.
Since the prosthetic socket is a custom-made device, it is considered Class I exempt by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</description>
