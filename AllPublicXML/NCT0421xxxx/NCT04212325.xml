    <textblock>
      Patients who underwent surgery for diabetic foot were divided into three groups: sciatic
      nerve block (Group B), continuous nerve catheter (Group C) . Group B patients underwent
      preoperative popliteal ultrasound guided peripheral nerve blockage. 20 ml of 0.25%
      bupivacaine was administered. In Group C patients, 20% bupivacaine 20 ml was applied to the
      sciatic nerve with a peripheral nerve catheter and continuous infusion was started with
      patient controlled analgesia device.

      Ethics committee approval was received on 12 December 2019, numbered 19/344. The study was
      planned to include 90 adult patients undergoing diabetic foot surgery at Gülhane Training and
      Research Hospital between 12 December 2019 and February 2020. These patients were divided
      into three groups: sciatic nerve block (Group B), continuous nerve catheter (Group C). Group
      B patients underwent preoperative popliteal ultrasound guided peripheral nerve blockage. 20
      ml of 0.25% bupivacaine was administered. In Group C patients, 20% bupivacaine 20 ml was
      applied to the sciatic nerve with a peripheral nerve catheter and continuous infusion was
      started with patient controlled analgesia device. Preoperative and postoperative blood flow
      of the popliteal and tibialis posterior arteries, pain scores of patients were evaluated with
      numeric rating scale and wound healing was monitored and recorded. The differences between
      the groups were compared statistically.
