  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypospadias, seen in every 200-300 births, is one of the most common congenital anomalies of
      the penis and is defined as the urethral meatus being located in the ventral part of the
      penis instead of its normal place. The surgery of this anomaly is very painful in the
      postoperative period and requires long-term analgesia. Regional anesthesia methods combined
      with general anesthesia play an important role in providing effective and long-term
      postoperative pain control in pediatric penile surgery. These methods also reduce
      postoperative morbidity, enable early mobilization and significantly decrease the need for
      narcotic analgesics.

      The investigator's hypothesis is peripheral nerve blocks are superior to neuraxial blocks as
      the blocks provide longer-term analgesia and have fewer side effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The surgery of hypospadias is very painful in the postoperative period and requires long-term
      analgesia. A dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) and caudal epidural block (CEB) are commonly
      used regional anesthesia techniques for postoperative pain control.

      Aims: The primary aim of the current study was to use the duration until the first
      postoperative analgesic requirement after two different block techniques to compare the
      analgesic effect. The secondary aims were to compare the two methods for postoperative
      Children's Hospital Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS) scores, complications and parental
      satisfaction scores.

    <description>It was assessed six times after the operation with Children's Hospital Eastern Ontario Pain Scale. The lowest scale score is 4 points and the highest 13 points. Significant pain behavior for Children's Hospital Eastern Ontario Pain Scale has been identified as 7 points or more. Following transfer from the recovery unit to the ward, the 1st, 2nd, 6th, 12th and 24th hour pain levels were evaluated by the ward nurse. Paracetamol was administered IV at a dose of 10 mg/kg if the scale score was 7 or higher.</description>

    <description>Ultrasound (US) guided dorsal penile nerve block with in plane technique was done.
Half of the total 0.2 ml/kg dose of 0.25% bupivacaine was administered while observing its distribution with US. The same procedure was then repeated on the other side of the penis.</description>

    <description>A 22 G needle was inserted through the sacral hiatus. The loss of resistance method was used to pass through the sacrococcygeal membrane and enter the caudal epidural space. Negative aspiration was then performed 0.25% bupivacaine at a dose of 0.2 ml/kg was administered.</description>
