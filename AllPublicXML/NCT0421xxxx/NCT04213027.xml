  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of two native tissue repair
      procedure with conventional surgical instruments in Chinese apical prolapse female patients
      (POP-Q II-IV) and compare the outcome in prolapse women randomized to Sacrospinous ligament
      fixation (SSLF) and Ischial spinous fascia fixation (ISFF).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The population will include Chinese female patients with advanced apical prolapse (stage
      II-III) and who are undergoing Sacrospinous Ligament Fixation (SSLF) and Ischial spinous
      fascia fixation (ISFF) procedure using conventional surgical instruments without special
      instrument. After enrollment, standardized baseline data including demographics, POPQ
      evaluation, series of validated questionaires via interviews( PFDI-20, PFIQ-7, PISQ-12) will
      be collected by study personnel at the baseline visit. Eligible consenting patients will
      proceed to randomizations with equal probability of assignment to SSLF or ISFF. Randomization
      to either SSLF or ISFF will take place preoperatively by each clinical site using a random
      permutated block design. After index surgical intervention, scheduled follow-up will occur at
      3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months after the index surgery. At the follow-up visits, POPQ examination
      will be performed and an update of current medications, an assessment of new or continuing
      pelvic floor disorders, adverse events that occurred since the previous evaluation, and an
      assessment of health care costs. A series of validated instruments will be administered via
      interviews to including PFDI-20, PFIQ-7, PISQ-12, PGI-C.

    <description>definition for surgical success is symptomatic prolapse below grade II occurred at 3 months after operation, and the severest indication point in POP-Q evaluation was taken as the criterion. No vaginal swelling sensation, that is answer &quot;no&quot; for PFDI-20 Questionnaire Question 3, &quot;Do you often see or feel vaginal tumors come out?&quot;.
The patient's self-perception symptoms is improved or improved significantly, that is answer 1 or 2 for the PGI-C questionnaire.
There is no need of further treatment for prolapse, such as reoperation or pessary.</description>

Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a self-report measure consisting simply of a 10 centimeter line with a statement at each end representing one extreme of the dimension being measured (most often intensity of pain). VAS result will be reported ranging from 0 to 10, with 0 representing no pain, and 10 representing unbearable severe pain</description>
