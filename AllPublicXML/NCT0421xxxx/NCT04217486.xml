  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this prospective, randomized study is to compare the outcomes of patients
      undergoing primary TKA after photographing final knee range of motion immediately
      post-operatively and sharing these photographs with patients at their first follow-up
      appointment versus a group that does not see a photograph.

      The goal of this prospective, randomized study is to compare the outcomes of patients
      undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) after photographing final knee range of
      motion immediately postoperatively and sharing these photographs with patients at their first
      follow-up appointment versus a group that does not see a photograph. The knee will be
      photographed in maximum flexion and extension. The primary objectives will be to compare the
      range of motion of the operative knee at 2 weeks and 6 weeks postoperatively. In the
      investigator's institution, patients who have failed to achieve 90 degrees of flexion at a
      postoperative period of 6 weeks undergo manipulation of the knee under anesthesia (MUA). The
      investigators will also measure how many patients require MUA in the photograph group and
      non-photograph group. MUA will be performed if patients fail to achieve 90 degrees of flexion
      at 6 weeks post-op.
