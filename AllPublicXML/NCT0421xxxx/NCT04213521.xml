  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of multisensory balance training on the
      levels of visual dependence and sensory organization capacity in community-dwelling older
      adults. Participants in the experimental group received multisensory balance training while
      those in the control group received conventional balance training without sensory
      manipulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older people often find it difficult to maintain balance with their eyes closed, which
      emphasizes the importance of vision. The greater influence of vision on orientation and
      balance has been observed by manipulating static and dynamic visual cues—for instance,
      tilting the frame of reference or moving visual scenes. Older people—particularly those prone
      to falls—have been reported to make significantly greater errors in subjective visual
      verticality and exhibit greater sway and continued center of gravity oscillation during and
      following visual disturbances. They also adopted hip strategies to restore balance in
      response to visual perturbation, indicating that they were unstable in the event of visual
      disturbance. These results indicate that older people may have higher levels of visual
      dependence than younger adults.

      The underlying mechanism of visual dependence remains unclear. Visual dependence is
      considered a form of sensory reweighting deficit. In a situation of sensory conflict, the
      central nervous system must first recognize the discrepancy and reduce the weighting
      (suppress) of the inaccurate input while increasing the weighting of the input from the
      sensory systems that are deemed to provide more reliable information. This complex process of
      sensory organization is termed multiple-sensory reweighting and is vital in maintaining
      balance and orientation in a continuously changing and complex environment.

      Studies have suggested that visual dependence could benefit from promoting desensitization
      and increased visual motion tolerance through visual adaptation and habituation exercises in
      vestibular rehabilitation. This may be because the majority of visually dependent adults have
      the comorbid symptom of visual vertigo. However, according to the National Audit Survey in
      the United States, one-third of patients with vestibular disorders and visual dependence lack
      signs and symptoms of dizziness or vertigo. Recent evidence has demonstrated that healthy
      older adults with greater levels of visual dependence did not have dizziness; therefore, it
      is unclear whether visual adaptation exercises can effectively reduce the degree of visual
      dependence in such people. However, visual dependence can be considered as a sensory
      reweighting deficit; therefore, multisensory balance training with manipulation of the
      visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive inputs could be an alternative for decreasing visual
      dependence through improving the integration and reweighting of sensory systems. In fact,
      multiple studies have documented that multisensory balance training improves mobility and
      balance in older adults with instability or a history of falls; however, few have
      investigated its effectiveness on visual dependence and in healthy elderly people. Therefore,
      the aim of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of multisensory balance training on
      the levels of visual dependence and sensory organization capacity in older adults.

    <description>It is used to objectively determine a patient's ability to safely balance during a series of predetermined tasks. It is a 14 item list with each item consisting of a five-point ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 4, with 0 indicating the lowest level of function and 4 the highest level of function. A total score of 56 indicates functional balance and but less than 45 indicates individuals may be at greater risk of falling.</description>

    <description>It measures functional mobility. It uses the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down. Normal healthy elderly usually complete the task in 10 seconds or less. Very frail or weak elderly with poor mobility may take 2 minutes or more. A score of more than or equal to 14 seconds has been shown to indicate high risk of falls.</description>

    <description>The participants in the multisensory balance training group were provided with multiple-sensory balance exercises using visual, proprioceptive, and vestibular manipulations. The exercises involved movements of the eye, head, and body to stimulate the vestibular system—postural control exercises in different positions (feet together, tandem stance, and one leg stance), use of a soft surface to reduce the proprioceptive inputs, and exercises with closed eyes to deprive them of visual cues.</description>
