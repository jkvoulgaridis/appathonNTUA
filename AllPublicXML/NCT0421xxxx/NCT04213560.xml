  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purposes: 1) To determine the effects of weighted waist-hooping on balance in healthy
      individuals and 2) to observe whether these effects are attributed to neuromuscular
      conditioning or core strength gains.

      Methods: 27 females (ages 20-45) were included, 15 in the intervention group, and 12 in the
      control. The intervention consisted of six weeks of weighted waist-hooping four times a week
      for 10 minutes each session. Balance was assessed pre and post intervention using the BESS,
      SEBT, and Neurocom SOT. Core strength was assessed using hold duration of a bilateral and
      unilateral plank.

    <measure>Balance Error Scoring System (BESS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were instructed to maintain each of the 6 positions for as long as possible and to continue to try until the 20 seconds were complete even if balance was lost, which was counted as an error along with the specific error criteria for this assessment. Total number of errors were recorded for each position according and the summated to provide a total error score. A higher score indicates greater occurrence of error and thus poorer balance.</description>

    <measure>Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>SEBT was conducted for both the right and left leg reaching. Position on the start was used to indicate where to reach. Reaching across the body with the right foot to the left side and reaching across the body with the left foot to the right side were both defined as a medial reach for the purpose of this study.</description>

    <measure>equilibrium scores (EQ scores) of the Sensory Organization Test (SOT) on the NeuroCom</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The SOT parses out contributions and functionality of the visual, somatosensory, and vestibular systems provide information regarding the effects of each system on postural control.8 The EQ score is a composite score calculated by the NeuroCom by weighting each of the 6 conditions of typical and altered stimuli. A score closer to 100 indicates less postural sway and a score closer to 0 indicates more postural sway and increased likelihood of fall.8 An increase in EQ score indicates an improvement in postural control and potentially sensory selection since the purpose of the SOT is to determine if patients are able to appropriately reweight their senses in response to the six different conditions in an effort to maintain postural control.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>hold a standard bilateral plank position to assess core strength. The duration of time the participant was able to hold each position was recorded. If the participant was unable to attain proper form or unable to complete the task the duration of hold was recorded as 0 seconds.

    <description>Participants weighted waist-hooping on their own for ten minutes a day, four days a week, for six weeks resulting in a total of 40 minutes of weighted waist-hooping each week. Participants weighted waist-hooped with a three-pound weighted hula hoop at the waist for ten minutes. Half time hooping to the left and the other half hooping to the right. If discomfort while hooping occurred participants were instructed to take breaks, change directions more frequently, or where thicker clothing to lessen the impact of the hoop around their waists. The investigators would check in on the participants weekly to provide feedback on technique and answer all questions throughout the six-week intervention.</description>
