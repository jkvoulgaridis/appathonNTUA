  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>

      Joint Stabilization System to intra-articular sacroiliac joint steroid injection in patients
      with refractory sacroiliac joint dysfunction.

    <textblock>
      Randomized, multicenter, open-label, randomized design to compare CornerLoc Allograft-based
      Sacroiliac Joint Stabilization System to Intra-articular Sacroiliac Joint Steroid Injection.
      Within the initial phase, referred to as the Randomized Phase, the primary determination of
      efficacy and safety will be 6-months following the study procedure. The analysis will be
      based on the randomization assignment. In the second phase of the study, referred to as the
      Cross-over Phase, patients who fail to respond to the randomized treatment assignment will be
      permitted to receive the non-randomized treatment. The basis of the sample size and
      hypothesis testing for this clinical investigation will be based on the Randomization Phase.

    <measure>Efficacy of sacroiliac joint stabilization using the CornerLoc procedure in the treatment of sacroiliac joint pain by evaluating the efficacy responder rate versus an intra-articular steroid injection.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy responder rate is defined as the percentage of subjects who experience at least a 50% improvement in overall pain, as measured by the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for Pain, from Baseline to the 6-Month Visit. The scale is composed of 0 (no pain at all) to 10 (worst imaginable pain).</description>

    <description>PROMIS-29; Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) instruments contain a fixed number of items from seven PROMIS domains: depression; anxiety; physical function; pain interference; fatigue; sleep disturbance; and ability to participate in social roles and activities. The seven domains cover the most relevant areas of self-reported health for the greatest majority of people with chronic illness.
The PROMIS-29, a generic health-related quality of life survey, assesses each of the 7 PROMIS domains with 4 questions. The questions are ranked on a 5-point Likert Scale. There is also one 11-point rating scale for pain intensity.</description>

    <description>Numeric Rating Scale for Pain: The Numeric Rating Scale for Pain is a measure in which individuals rate their pain on an eleven point numerical scale. The scale is composed of 0 (no pain at all) to 10 (worst imaginable pain). The patient will be asked to point to the number on the Numeric Rating Scale that best represents intensity of pain.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Oswestry Disability Index (ODI): The Oswestry Disability Index (also known as the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire) is a tool for evaluators used to measure a patient's permanent functional disability. Each question is scored on a scale of 0-5 with the first statement being zero and indicating the least amount of disability and the last statement is scored 5 indicating most severe disability. The scores for all questions answered are summed, then multiplied by two to obtain the index (range 0 to 100). A higher score on the ODI indicates a more severe disability caused by lower back pain.</description>

    <description>Timed Up and Go&quot; (TUG) Test: This test measures the time for a subject to get up from a chair walk 3 meters, turn around and return to the chair and sit. Time is measured in minutes and seconds. An average of two tests is used. The shorter average time indicates clinical improvement.</description>

    <description>Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQps); The Zurich Claudication Questionnaire quantifies severity of symptoms, physical function characteristics, and patient's satisfaction after treatment. The scale relates to symptoms over the past month. There are 12 questions for all patients, and a further 6 questions to measure treatment outcome. Decreasing scores indicates clinical improvement</description>

    <description>Patient will receive the CornerLoc minimally invasive SI Joint Stabilization procedure. This procedure will be performed in an outpatient surgery center under local sedation or general anesthesia, and normally takes around 45 minutes. During the procedure, the physician will make two small incisions in the patient's lower back to access the SI joint, and place four small cadaveric bone grafts into the SI joint to help stabilize the SI joint.</description>

    <description>Patient will receive an injection of steroid medication directly into their SI joint. The area around the SI joint will be numbed with an injection of local anesthetic and then ultrasound guidance will be used to guide the needle of steroid medication directly into the SI joint. This procedure will be performed in the physician's office or an outpatient surgery center, and normally takes around 30 minutes.</description>
