      An observational cohort study will be conducted to non-invasively investigate central blood
      pressure and pulse wave velocity in children with kidney disease and controls. Using an
      oscillometric monitor, the investigators aim to non-invasively obtain the central blood
      pressure and pulse wave velocity (PWV), or arterial stiffness, of children with kidney
      disease. The investigators will also enroll age- and race-matched healthy controls and
      measure the same parameters for comparison. In addition, the investigators will measure PWV
      by standard arterial tonometry method in a subset of patients.

      The specific aims of the study are as follows:

        1. Using an oscillometric blood pressure monitor, the investigators aim to non-invasively
           obtain the central blood pressure and pulse wave velocity (PWV), or arterial stiffness,
           of children with kidney disease.

        2. Measure oscillometric central blood pressure and PWV in age and race matched healthy
           children.

        3. Measure PWV by standard arterial tonometry method in a subset of patients, and compare
           these measurements to the PWV measured using the oscillometric device.

        4. Measure body composition of patients and controls (Body Mass Index, Waist-to-Height
           ratio, %body fat, and mid-arm muscle circumference) to see how this relates to central
           blood pressure and PWV.
