        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Males and females between 18 and 70 years of age at screening.

          -  Body weight is ≥45 kg at screening.

          -  Diagnosed with oHCM per the following criteria:

               -  Has left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy with non-dilated LV chamber in the absence
                  of other cardiac disease.

               -  Has minimal wall thickness ≥15 mm at time of initial diagnosis (minimal wall
                  thickness ≥13 mm is acceptable with a positive family history of HCM or with a
                  known disease-causing gene mutation).

          -  Adequate acoustic windows for echocardiography.

          -  Has LVOT-G during screening as follows:

               -  Resting gradient ≥50 mmHg OR

               -  Resting gradient ≥30 mmHg and &lt;50 mmHg with post-Valsalva LVOT-G ≥50 mmHg

          -  LVEF ≥60% at screening.

          -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II or III at screening.

          -  Patients on beta-blockers, verapamil, diltiazem, or ranolazine should have been on
             stable doses for &gt;4 weeks prior to randomization and anticipate remaining on the same
             medication regimen during the study.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Aortic stenosis or fixed subaortic obstruction.

          -  Known infiltrative or storage disorder causing cardiac hypertrophy that mimics oHCM
             (eg, Noonan syndrome, Fabry disease, amyloidosis).

          -  History of LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF &lt;45%) at any time during their clinical
             course.

          -  Documented history of current obstructive coronary artery disease (&gt;70% stenosis in
             one or more epicardial coronary arteries) or documented history of myocardial
             infarction.

          -  Has been treated with septal reduction therapy (surgical myectomy or percutaneous
             alcohol septal ablation) or has plans for either treatment during the study period.

          -  Has been treated with disopyramide or antiarrhythmic drugs that have negative
             inotropic activity within 4 weeks prior to screening.

          -  Documented atrial fibrillation during the screening period.

          -  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or flutter requiring treatment (eg, anti-coagulation or
             antiarrhythmic therapy including disopyramide) documented within the 6 months prior to
             screening.

          -  History of syncope or sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia with exercise within 6
             months prior to screening.

          -  Has received prior treatment with CK-3773274 or is currently receiving mavacamten.

          -  Is a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer
