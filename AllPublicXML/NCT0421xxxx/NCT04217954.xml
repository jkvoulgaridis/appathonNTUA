  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biliary tract cancer includes gallbladder carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. Recently, the
      incidence of the biliary cancer is increasing, especially in China.

      The prognosis of biliary tract cancer is poor. Only 20% patients are candidate to be
      performed surgery, and the median overall survival of the advanced biliary tract cancer is
      less than 6 months. Gemcitabine plus cisplatin were consider as the first-line chemotherapy
      regimen for advanced biliary tract cancer for many years. The objective response rate (ORR)
      after it is 26.1% and the median overall survival is less than 1 year.

      Two years ago, a phase II study of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy with oxaliplatin
      and 5-fluorouracil for advanced perihilar cholangiocarcinoma finished in Peking University
      Cancer Hospital. The ORR in the study achieved 67.6% and the median overall survival achieved
      20.5 months. In 2019, a retrospective study in Peking University Cancer Hospital showed that
      hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy with oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and bevacizumab for
      patients with unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma has a ORR of 63.5% and the median
      overall survival achieved 14.5 months.

      Programmed death-1 (PD-1) checkpoint inhibitor, like Toripalimab, can block the bind of PD-1
      and PD-L1/PD-L2, then influence the immune response and recover the function of cytotoxic T
      lymphocytes. There are some studies indicate that the targeted agent of anti-angiogenesis,
      like bevacizumab, can adjust the immune microenvironment of the tumor to enhance the efficacy
      of the immunotherapy.

      Likewise, the agents of chemotherapy can enhance the antigenicity of the tumor, and increase
      the ratio of CD8+ T cells in tumor microenvironment by the pattern of damage-associated
      molecular pattern (DAMP) so that have synergistic effect with PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor.

      Recently, 9 patients with advanced biliary tract cancer received hepatic arterial infusion
      chemotherapy with oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and bevacizumab plus intravenous Toripalimab in
      our center, and 3 of them lost to follow-up. Among the other 6 patients, the ORR and disease
      control rate achieved 83.3% and 100%, respectively.

      In this study, investigators want to research the efficacy and safety of hepatic arterial
      infusion chemotherapy with oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and bevacizumab plus intravenous
      Toripalimab for advance biliary tract cancer.
