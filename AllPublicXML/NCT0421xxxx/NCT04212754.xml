      Primary aim:

      The primary aim of the study is to compare survival to discharge (or survival to 14 days
      post-operatively, whichever comes first) following emergency surgery for traumatic brain
      injury (TBI) across Human Development Index settings.

      Primary outcome measure:

      The primary outcome measure will be survival to discharge (or survival to 14 days
      post-operatively, whichever comes first)

      Primary comparison:

      Between country groups defined by human development index.

      Centre eligibility:

      Any hospital or clinic worldwide performing emergency surgery for traumatic brain injury is
      eligible to participate.

      Patient eligibility:

      All adult and paediatric patients admitted to the participating institution with a traumatic
      brain injury for which they receive emergency surgery during the selected 30-day inclusion
      period are eligible for inclusion in the study.

      Team:

      Individual hospital teams with up to four people, collecting data for 30 days.

      Time period:

      Local study teams may select any 30-day period from the 1st of November 2018 and the 31st of
      December 2019 to start their study. Patients operated on who meet the inclusion criteria
      between 00:01 on day 0 and 23:59 on day 30 of the selected study period will be included.

      Validation:

      We will employ a method of data validation in every centre that will give us a quantitative
      estimate of case ascertainment that is feasible even in low-resource centres.

        Centre Inclusion Criteria:

        Any hospital or clinic worldwide performing emergency surgery for traumatic brain injury is
        eligible to participate. In the majority of institutions, emergency surgery for TBI is
        provided by neurosurgeons - however, centres in which emergency surgery for TBI is provided
        general surgeons, trauma surgeons, general medical doctors or even non-physician clinicians
        are also eligible to participate.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - All adult and paediatric patients admitted to the participating institution with a
        traumatic brain injury for which they receive emergency surgery during the selected 30-day
        inclusion period are eligible for inclusion in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who only have an external ventricular drain or intraparenchymal wire (or
             other monitoring device) inserted for the diagnosis and/or management of intracranial
             hypertension.

          -  Patients who undergo procedures for chronic subdural haematoma(s), including burr
             holes or mini-craniotomies.

          -  Elective (planned admission) or semi-elective (where patient initially admitted as an
             emergency, then discharged from hospital, and re-admitted at later time for surgery)
             procedures.

          -  Patients who have previously had emergency cranial surgery for traumatic brain injury
             rendering them eligible for inclusion in this study (regardless of whether they were
             included)
