  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, double blind sham controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of
      vestibular nerve stimulation (VeNS) compared to a sham control a as a means of improving
      sleep as measured by ISI scores and EEG recordings

      The purpose of this investigation device study is to collect data that will be used to design
      appropriate pivotal studies that can be used for regulatory submissions, primarily in the
      United States of America (USA), but it may also be used to support submissions in other
      regions, including the European Union (EU).

    <description>The VeSTAL device will be placed on the head in a manner analogous to headphones and will deliver a small electrical current to the skin behind the ears, over the mastoid processes. Participants will be advised to use the device at home for 1 hour per day in the period immediately prior to sleep onset.</description>

    <description>The sham device looks identical to the active device and interacts with the app in a similar manner to the active device. However, it does not deliver vestibular stimulation to users. device will be placed on the head in a manner analogous to headphones and will deliver a small electrical current to the skin behind the ears, over the mastoid processes. Participants will be advised to use the device at home for 1 hour per day in the period immediately prior to sleep onset.</description>

    <ipd_description>Data will be transferred in an encrypted PDF format. Trial staff will be given direction on how to share the trial data and given access to one specific section of a controlled cloud service which is controlled via role based access. Once they have authenticated with the service and the service verifies that they have the correct role to access the system they will be directed to a single webpage within the application where they will be able to upload the encrypted PDF. This PDF is generated on the fly and is therefore not stored in another location that could become compromised. Generating the PDF on the fly means that the source data is extracted from the database, processed and delivered in the context of a single request. These data will be transferred for each subject when they complete participation in the study.</ipd_description>
