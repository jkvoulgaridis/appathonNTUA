      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Vaporous Hyperoxia Therapy
      (VHT) for the treatment of Diabetic Foot Ulcers. VHT treatments will be provided as an
      adjunct to standard wound care. Subjects will receive VHT treatments until wound closure, or
      for the treatment period of 20 weeks.
