  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This quasi-experimental, quality improvement study will be conducted across the Houston
      Methodist system, including all hospital-based and freestanding emergency departments (ED).
      Previous research identified opportunities to improve patient selection and delivery of
      rabies immune globulin (IG) as recommended by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
      (CDC) guideline recommendations for rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). The purpose of
      this study is to develop, implement, and measure the impact of a quality improvement bundle
      that consists of (1) rabies PEP electronic health records (EHR) enhancements, (2) education
      to ED staff, and (3) education to patients. Adherence to quality indicators, which are based
      on CDC guideline recommendations, for patient selection and delivery of rabies IG for 12
      months following implementation (post-implementation group) will be compared with a
      historical control group.

      BACKGROUND: Rabies infection can occur in humans when key elements of the rabies PEP regimens
      are omitted or incorrectly administered. The CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
      (ACIP) recommends that patients who are exposed to rabies virus should receive prompt and
      thorough wound cleansing followed by administration of human rabies IG and rabies vaccine.
      Previous research identified three opportunities to improve adherence to CDC guideline
      recommendations for rabies PEP: (1) infiltration of rabies IG into and around the wounds, if
      anatomically feasible, (2) administration of rabies IG at an anatomical site distant from
      rabies vaccine administration, and (3) avoiding administration of rabies IG into the buttock.

      STUDY DESIGN: This quasi-experimental, quality improvement study evaluates adherence to 6
      quality indicators, which are based on CDC guideline recommendations, for patient selection
      and delivery of rabies IG before and after implementation of the rabies PEP quality
      improvement bundle. The quality improvement bundle includes EHR enhancements, ED staff
      education, and patient education. Patients who receive at least one dose of rabies IG or
      rabies vaccine at a study site during the study period will be included in this study. The
      historical control group includes patients treated prior to bundle implementation. The
      post-implementation group includes patients treated within 12 months following bundle
      implementation. The primary outcome is full adherence to all 6 quality indicators for rabies
      IG selection and delivery.

    <intervention_model_description>The study consists of 2 groups: (1) the historical control group and (2) the post-implementation group. The historical control group includes patients who received rabies PEP from January 2015 to June 2018. The quality improvement bundle will be implemented across the Houston Methodist health system in December 2019. The post-implementation group includes patients who receive rabies PEP within 12 months following bundle implementation. An estimated sample size of 70 patients in the post-implementation group and 249 patients in the historical control group will provide 80% power to detect an absolute increase of 20% in the primary endpoint using a two-sided alpha of 0.05.</intervention_model_description>
