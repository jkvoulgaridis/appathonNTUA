  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator propose a prospective study using blood samples (liquid biopsy) of estrogen
      receptor (ER)-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients to understand the prevalence
      of estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) mutation variants and the correlation with hormonal therapy
      (HT)-based treatment resistance in Asian ER-positive/human epidermal growth receptor-2
      (HER2)-negative MBC population.

      The investigator will use next-generation targeted sequencing covering the entire ESR1
      ligand-binding domain (LBD) region to understand 1. the spectrum and prevalence of specific
      ESR1 mutation variants in Asian women, and 2. the preliminary correlation of Asian-specific
      prevalent ESR1 LBD mutation variants such as Y537C with treatment efficacy. For the second
      purpose, the investigator will specifically focus on patients with ESR1 Y537C mutation, while
      the results from patients with wild type ESR1 and patients with D538G or Y537S mutant will be
      severed as control for preliminary comparison.

      Approximately 8 ml plasma sample will be prepared from 20 ml whole blood to be used for
      circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) extraction using the QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit
      (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany, Cat. No. 55114). DNA concentration will be determined by the Qubit
      fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA) and DNA integrity will be
      analyzed using the capillary electrophoresis (AATI Fragment analyzer).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  (1) Female patients who are ≥ 20 years old at the time of informed consent.

          -  (2) Have histologically confirmed ER positive (defined as ≥1%) and/ or progesterone
             receptor (PR) positive (defined as ≥1%) breast cancer.

          -  (3) Have histologically confirmed HER2-negative breast cancer as defined by
             immuno-histochemistry (IHC) ≤ 2+, and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
             negative.

          -  (4) Patients who fits either one of the following two criteria are eligible: I. Have
             radiological or objective evidence of inoperable locally advanced or metastatic breast
             cancer and are planned to be given HT single agent, HT plus other targeted therapy, HT
             plus everolimus (reimbursed by National Health Insurance), HT plus metronomic oral
             chemotherapy or oral chemotherapy only by the treating physician. II. Locally advanced
             but operable patients before the resection of the primary tumor.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  (1) Patients not suitable for oral anti-cancer treatment as determined by the
             investigator.
