      Deep brain stimulation for treatment resistant deep brain stimulation
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive bilateral deep brain stimulation to the ventral capsule/ventral
      striatum. They will receive standard follow-up and device programming over the span of 52
      weeks. After that, they will enter a 5 week double blinded crossover phase consisting of 2
      weeks of ON or OFF stimulation, separated by 1 week of 'washout', during which stimulation
      will be OFF.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Female or Male patients between age 18-70

          2. DSM-V diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), at least 5-year illness
             history with a minimum score of 24 on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale
             (Y-BOCS).

          4. Medication-refractoriness as determined by an adequate dose and duration of
             psychiatric treatments (including psychotherapy and/or pharmacology) as determined by
             two psychiatrists associated with the study. Including specifically:

               1. Failed adequate trial of two or more medications accepted as first line in the
                  treatment of OCD

               2. Attempted augmentation, if tolerated, by at least 1 medications known to be first
                  line treatments for OCD

          5. An adequate trial of cognitive behavioural therapy

          6. Ability to provide informed consent and comply with all testing, follow-ups and study
             appointments and protocols

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any past or current evidence of psychosis or mania (patients with co-morbid depression
             will not be excluded from the study)

          2. Active neurologic disease, such as epilepsy

          3. Alcohol or substance dependence or abuse in the last 6 months, excluding caffeine and
             nicotine

          6. No contraindication for DBS surgery

          7. Presence of significant cognitive impairment

          8. Likely to relocate or move out of the country during the study's duration

          9. Presence of clinical and/or neurological conditions that may significantly increase
             the risk of the surgical procedure.

         10. Currently pregnant (as determined by history and serum HCG) or lactating; for females
             of reproductive potential: use of highly effective contraception for at least 1 month
             prior to screening and agreement to use such a method during study participation
