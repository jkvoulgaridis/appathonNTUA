  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a progressive multisystem disorder characterized by abnormalities in
      the transport of chloride ions in human airway epithelial cells, leading to frequent lung
      infections, decreased pulmonary function, inability to properly digest food and absorb
      essential nutrients, and complications with many organs.

      Patients with CF spend hours daily, in treatments required to manage their disease, including
      hours of physiotherapy and inhalation and treatment with many daily pills. CF treatment load
      heavy burden on patients and families and the inevitable consequence of these treatment
      demands is widespread non-adherence to therapy.

      CFTR modulators (trade name Kalydeco, Orkambi, Simdeco) is a highly efficient drug approved
      to treat CF in patients with certain mutations. It is the first drug that treats the
      underlying cause rather than the symptoms of the disease. It is also one of the most
      expensive drugs, costing over $300,000 per patient per year. Despite of its proven efficacy
      and approved reimbursement for certain patients, non-adherence is common among CF patients,
      resulting from the heavy burden of daily treatment required to manage CF disease.

      ReX is a hand-held, mobile device intended to provide solid oral medication on patient's
      demand according to a pre-programmed treatment protocol. ReX addresses poor patient
      adherence, tracks patient's response to treatment and enhances patient engagement to therapy.
      The system comprises a reusable drug dispensing unit (Dispenser), a disposable Cassette
      containing the prescribed medication, a cellphone app, and the ReX cloud. The Dispenser
      manages pill administration. It includes a touch screen which guides the user and presents
      patient-specific clinical surveys and therapy information. The Dispenser contains a
      chargeable battery and indicators demonstrating device and battery status; a pill window
      enabling pills to be viewed; operational sensors; and communication to an app on cellphones.
      The patient receives the Cassette from the pharmacy, pre-filled with his/her specific
      medication. The Cassette is inserted into the Dispenser where it is locked in place. All
      therapy and patient survey data are transferred to a patient-specific domain on DosentRx'
      proprietary web-based cloud, named ReX cloud.
