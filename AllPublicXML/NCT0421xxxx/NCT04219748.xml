  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use and its consequences represent an important public health problem. As well as
      alcohol dependence, hazardous drinking also contributes to a high burden in terms of
      morbidity and mortality. To improve these patients' prognosis and decrease associated social
      and health care costs, it is necessary to increase early detection, intervention and
      treatment for these problems. Alcohol consumption is associated with a decrease in primary
      care services utilization, thus Emergency Departments (EDs) are a primary gateway to
      healthcare services in this group.

      Depending on the investigative method and the mixture of the target population, an estimated
      0.6-40% of all ED visits are due to alcohol-related problems. Given this, EDs offer a unique
      window of opportunity to address alcohol problems.

      The threshold most commonly used to define frequent use of EDs is more than 4 visits per
      year. Frequent users comprise 0.3% to 10% of all ED patients and account for 3.5% to 28% of
      ED visits in developed countries. Addictive and other psychiatric disorders, and also social
      vulnerability are more common in frequent ED users than in non-frequent users. Although case
      management interventions seem promising to reduce ED attendance among frequent users,
      currently there is mixed evidence on the effects of such interventions on ED use.

      Considering all this, a broader understanding of interventions to reduce frequent visits is
      needed, specially focusing on local frequent ED populations and identified highly vulnerable
      subgroups, such as hazardous drinkers.

      The investigators aim to evaluate the effectiveness of a Case Management programme for ED
      Frequent Users presenting risky alcohol use in the ED of a tertiary hospital.

      Methods:

      Randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a Case Management programme for
      ED Frequent Users presenting risky alcohol use in the ED of a tertiary hospital in Barcelona.
      All patients between 18 and 65 years old that frequently attended Hospital Clínic of
      Barcelona emergency department during the previous year that reattend the ED during the
      recruitment period will be eligible to follow-up. Those of them presenting risky alcohol use
      according to AUDIT-C score will be randomized to either case management intervention or
      treatment as usual. Main outcomes will be the number of visits to the ED and proportion of
      risky drinkers measured by AUDIT-C at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months follow-up.

      Case management (CM) can be defined as a collaborative process of assessment, planning,
      facilitation, and advocacy for options and services to meet an individual's health needs
      through communication and available resources to promote quality cost-effective outcomes.
      Case managers identify appropriate providers and services for individual patients while
      simultaneously ensuring that available resources are being used in a timely and
      cost-effective manner. It is a model of continuous, integrated medical and psychosocial care,
      which is markedly different from the episodic and often fragmented care that occurs in the ED
      setting. Close partnerships with healthcare providers and community services resources are
      key factors of CM interventions, that should target patients with the greatest needs.

    <description>Participants will receive an intensive Case Management (CM) intervention conducted by a multidisciplinary team (Psychiatry, Social Work, Nursing) during 2 months. The intervention will encompass attending weekly or biweekly appointments with the CM team, the interviews will last approximately 30 minutes.
This CM intervention will include referral to Hospital Clínic de Barcelona Addiction Outpatient Clinic and a personalised assessment of the medical, psychiatric and social situation of each individual by the CM team. An individualised care plan will be established and periodically reviewed by the multidisciplinary team in response to a better understanding of patient needs or to a change in patient health condition.
The intervention will offer motivational interviewing psychotherapy to enhance motivation to reduce or to quit alcohol use, in crisis intervention, coordination of care, patient education and self-management support, and assistance to navigate in the healthcare system.</description>
