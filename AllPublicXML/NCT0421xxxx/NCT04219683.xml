  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Segmental mandibulectomy, often employed for resection of a tumour, and occasionally for
      trauma, osteoradionecrosis, or osteomyelitis, adversely affects patient's quality of life
      (QoL) to a varying degree. It inflicts a significant defect in the head and neck region,
      impacting on facial appearance, and the functions of speech, malocclusion, mastication,
      swallowing, and health-related QoL. Mandible resection thus creates a significant impact on a
      patient's life, both aesthetically as well as functionally.

      Restoration of the defects following resection of any part of the mandible presents a
      challenging problem for reconstructive surgeons. Since the introduction of fibula free flap
      (FFF) by Taylor in 1975, it has become the most popular choice for mandible reconstruction.
      Hidalgo popularized the FFF, and reported on its versatility with satisfactory outcomes. The
      utility and techniques of free flap mandible reconstruction have advanced in the past 2
      decades, with success rate up from 82.6% to 100%. As the longest bone segment available for
      reconstructive purpose, FFF is known for its wide variety of applications, following mandible
      resection, including angle-to-angle reconstruction.

      The fibula-free flap is currently considered the most popular, 'the gold standard and the
      workhorse flap' for mandibular reconstruction.

      However, because of the limited diameter of the fibula flap compared with the height of the
      mandible, vertical distance between the reconstructed segment and the occlusal plane can be
      substantial. This is a particular problem in the dentate mandible, especially when
      rehabilitation with dental implants or an implant-borne denture is contemplated. Insufficient
      bone height leads to overloading of osteointegrated implants and endangers the longevity of
      the prosthetic restoration. Insufficient bone height and poor soft tissue overlying the bone
      flap also create an unfavourable environment for the tissue-borne prosthesis.

      Such issues are particularly acute in patients with intact alveolar bone and dentition at
      healthy sites. The double-barrel technique, distraction osteogenesis, non-vascularized bone
      grafts, and guided-bone regeneration have all been used to resolve this. The double-barrel
      technique is a good method, but drawbacks include excess height of the neomandible and the
      considerable time required to contour and adapt the upper barrel. Distraction osteogenesis is
      a valuable and predictable treatment option; however, its wide application is limited by
      complexity of the surgery and the need for additional secondary surgery.

      To Overcome these challenges the investigators design a technique for mandibular
      reconstruction where free vascularized fibula flap is splitted and non-vascularized fibula
      graft is harvest from same leg and is placed between two splitted parts of free fibula flap
      to increase vertical height of fibula.
