    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well a lifestyle intervention works in reducing prostate cancer
      disparities among African American prostate cancer patients and their spouses or romantic
      partners. A lifestyle intervention may help researchers learn if social support can help
      African American prostate cancer patients and their partners improve their quality of life,
      support from their partner, physical activity, diet, and inflammation.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To expand an existing couple-based behavioral intervention developed for African American
      (AA) or Hispanic men on active surveillance (Watchful Living; protocol #: 2017-0556) to AA
      prostate cancer (PCa) survivors who underwent active treatments to examine its feasibility of
      recruiting AA PCa survivor-partner dyads (N = 40 dyads) and implementing a lifestyle
      intervention.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate a preliminary efficacy of the intervention in improving quality of life, physical
      activity, nutrient intake, and inflammation.

      II. Explore psychosocial mediators and moderators of the intervention. III. Conduct a process
      evaluation. IV. Assess healthcare-provider level factors (with N=15 providers) that influence
      both survivors' and partners' healthy lifestyle behaviors.

      OUTLINE: Patients and their partners are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients and their partners receive an exercise plan and printed materials that
      includes instructions for walking or other moderate-intensity activities. Patients and their
      partners also receive coaching calls discussing physical activity and diet related questions,
      each lasting 45-60 minutes and occurring every 2 weeks for 6 months. In addition, patients
      and their partners complete 2 nutrition counseling sessions over 1 hour each at baseline and
      before month 3 with an MD Anderson registered dietitian.

      GROUP II: Patients and their partners receive information/materials regarding physical
      activity and healthy eating.

      PROVIDER INTERVIEWS: Healthcare providers participate in an interview regarding their
      opinions on family-focused care and its ability to improve health behaviors.
