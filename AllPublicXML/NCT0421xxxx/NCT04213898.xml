  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterized by estrogen receptor, progesterone
      receptor and HER2 negative, accounts for 10-20% of all breast cancers and usually occurs in
      young women. It is an aggressive and worst prognosis breast cancer subtype, which urgently
      requires effective treatment.The pathological complete response (pCR) of neoadjuvant therapy
      is associated with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of breast cancer.
      The correlation between pathological response and long-term survival in patients with
      early-stage breast cancer is the strongest among patients with triple-negative breast cancer.
