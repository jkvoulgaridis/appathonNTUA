  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Artificial Intelligence may provide insight into exploring the potential covert association
      behind and reveal some early ocular architecture changes in individuals with hepatobiliary
      disorders. We conducted a pioneer work to explore the association between the eye and liver
      via deep learning, to develop and evaluate different deep learning models to predict the
      hepatobiliary disease by using ocular images.
