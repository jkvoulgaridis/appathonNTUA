  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess emotional processes and their relation to treatment outcomes during
      Virtual reality exposure therapy for Flight Phobia. The researchers hypothesize treatment
      outcomes will be associated with positive changes in emotional constructs

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emotional constructs and emotion regulation capacities play a central role in the severity of
      anxiety disorders and are directly related to treatment outcomes in different anxiety
      disorders. In this study we will examine the relation between positive and negative affect,
      emotion regulation, emotional instability, emotional differentiation, experiential avoidance
      and therapy outcomes in participants undergoing Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy for Flight
      Phobia. We assume that treatment outcomes will be positively related to changes in the
      regulation, management and experience of emotions.

    <description>The Flight Anxiety Situations Questionnaire (Van Grewen, Spinhoven, Van-Dyck, &amp; Dikstra, 1999) is a 32-item, 5-point Likert-scale (1= no anxiety to 5=overwhelming anxiety). The FAS evaluates flight-related anxiety in various situations and includes 3 factors: generalized, anticipatory and in-flight anxiety.</description>

    <time_frame>Two weeks prior to therapy and one week after last therapy session (therapy includes 4 weekly 1-hour sessions over the course of 4 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>The Flight Anxiety Modality (FAM) questionnaire (Van Grewen et al. 1999) assesses somatic and cognitive aspects of Flight Phobia. It includes 18 items that are rated using a 5-point scale (1=not at all, 5=very intensely). The somatic factor assesses physiological symptoms and the cognitive factor assesses anxiety-provoking cognitions</description>

    <description>st stage: Participants will receive information about the study, complete measures of fear of flying and emotional variables, and undergo a diagnostic interview for flight phobia and additional disorders.
nd stage: During the week prior to treatment, participants will complete a brief measure of emotion-related variables every evening at a fixed time (08:00 pm).
rd stage: Participants will receive therapy for fear of flying using a Virtual Reality (VR) simulator. Therapy sessions will be held once a week during 4 weeks. Participants will complete a brief measure of emotion-related variables at a random time during the 12 hours before the therapy session at a random time during the 12 hours after the therapy session. This will occur for every therapy session.
th stage: After treatment, participants will complete measures of fear of flying and emotional variables.</description>

    <description>st stage: Participants will receive information about the study, complete measures of fear of flying and emotional variables, and undergo a diagnostic interview for flight phobia and additional disorders.
nd stage: During five weeks no therapy will be administered. Participants will fill questionnaires as follows: During the first week, participants will complete emotional measures every evening at a fixed time (08:00 pm)
rd stage: During each of the following 4 weeks, participants will complete two emotional measures during a 24 hour period.
th stage: Participants will complete measures of fear of flying and emotional variables.</description>

    <intervention_name>VRET - Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>VRET will include 4 weekly 1-hour sessions over the course of 4 weeks. The treatment protocol is based on the Virtual Reality (VR) treatment manual guidelines (Rothbaum &amp; Hodges, 1997,1999) and includes psychoeducation, anxiety management training, cognitive restructuring and exposure. The first therapy session focuses on creating an individually-tailored conceptualization and treatment plan. Following this process, participant and therapist conduct a short introductory VR flight exposure simulation to familiarize the participant with the VRET apparatus. The VRET apparatus is an advanced, large-scale VR system that allows maximal immersion within the virtual environment. The second, third and fourth sessions include psychoeducation, relaxation training, cognitive restructuring and individually-tailored VR exposures (the therapist can manipulate the turbulence level and other flight-related variables to fit participants' fears and current progress).</description>
