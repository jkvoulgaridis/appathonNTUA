  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, four-period, crossover study in healthy females of
      nonchildbearing potential and male subjects - to be conducted at a single center in the
      United States.

      The study will consist of a screening phase, a baseline phase, four treatment periods, and a
      follow-up phone call. The 4 treatment periods are divided into two pairs (Period 1 and 2 and
      Period 3 and 4), potentially separated by an intermission during which subjects will be
      discharged from the research unit: Periods 1 and 2 support relative bioavailability (RBA)
      estimation, while Periods 3 and 4 support estimation of PPI effects.

    <description>An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject's health, including laboratory test values (as specified by the criteria in Section 10.3), regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) should be considered an AE.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study (partial):

          1. Must understand and voluntarily sign a written informed consent form (ICF) prior to
             any study-related assessments/procedures being performed.

          2. Must be able to communicate with the Investigator, understand and comply with the
             requirements of the study, and agree to adhere to restrictions and examination
             schedules.

          3. Healthy adult male or female of any race, between 18 to 55 years of age (inclusive) at
             the time of signing the ICF, and in good health as determined by the screening history
             and PE.

          4. For males:

               1. Practice true abstinence (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis) or agree to
                  use a condom during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female of
                  childbearing potential while participating in the study, during dose
                  interruptions and for at least 3 months following investigational product
                  discontinuation, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.

               2. Agree to use barrier contraception not made of natural (animal) membrane (eg,
                  latex or polyurethane condoms are acceptable) when engaging in sexual activity
                  with a female of childbearing potential (FCBP) 1 while on study medication, and
                  for at 3 months after the last dose of study medication.

          5. Must have a body mass index between 18 and 33 kg/m2 (inclusive) at the time of signing
             the ICF.

          6. Clinical laboratory test results must be within the respective reference ranges; or if
             not, the results be clinically insignificant according to the Investigator's medical
             judgement.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:

          1. History of any clinically significant and relevant neurological, GI, renal, hepatic,
             cardiovascular, psychological, pulmonary, metabolic, endocrine, hematological,
             allergic disease, drug allergies, or other major disorders as determined by the
             Investigator.

          2. Exposure to an investigational drug (new chemical entity) within 30 days preceding the
             first dose administration, or 5 half-lives of that investigational drug, if known
             (whichever is longer).

          3. Use of tobacco - or nicotine-containing products within 3 months prior to Day -1
             (Period 1 for Part 2).

          4. Vaccination within 30 days of first dose administration or plans to receive
             vaccination within 30 days after dosing.

          5. Subjects with active hepatitis and HIV

          6. Use of any nonprescribed systemic or topical medication (including vitamin/mineral
             supplements, and herbal medicines) within 14 days of the first dose administration.

          7. Use of CYP3A inducers and inhibitors (including St. John's Wort) within 30 days of the
             first dose administration.

          8. Any surgical or medical conditions possibly affecting drug absorption, distribution,
             metabolism and excretion (ADME), eg, bariatric procedure. Appendectomy and
             cholecystectomy are acceptable. Prior procedures of unclear ADME significance should
             be reviewed with the Sponsor's Medical Monitor.
