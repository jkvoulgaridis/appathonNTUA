    <textblock>
      This study utilizes a multi-institutional registry to describe the natural history of
      medullary thyroid cancer that has spread from where it first started to nearby tissue, lymph
      nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced) in understanding disease management. The goal
      of this study is to learn about how medullary thyroid cancer develops and progresses.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the natural history of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) using a comprehensive
      battery of demographic, clinical, pathologic, and genotypic variables collected in our
      existing multi-institutional patient registry.

      Ia. To describe the demographic, clinical, pathologic, and genotypic variables associated
      with each phase of disease.

      Ib. To identify those variables which are predictors of progression to the most advanced
      phases of disease that require small molecule therapy, including commercially approved and
      experimental agents.

      II. To characterize patients' experience with the different phases of MTC through a
      systematic evaluation of patient-reported outcomes (PROs).

      IIa. To describe clinical, psychosocial, economic, and physical well-being variables and the
      subsequent impact on quality of life associated with each phase of disease.

      IIb. To evaluate longitudinal changes in clinical, psychosocial, economic, and physical
      well-being variables between and within all phases of MTC, and the subsequent impact they
      have on quality of life.

      III. To evaluate the association of selected biometric and patient-reported outcomes on
      adherence, change, and discontinuation of approved targeted therapies and drugs being tested
      within clinical trial.

      OUTLINE:

      AIM I &amp; II: Patients complete questionnaires over 10-40 minutes 2-4 times per year about
      health and how finances and quality of life effect experience with disease.

      AIM III: Patients complete a questionnaire over 2 minutes and undergo blood pressure
      measurements every day for up to 12 weeks.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 3 years.
