    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label，phase II study designed to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of Toripalimab plus nab-paclitaxel with or without cisplatin as first-line treatment
      of unresectable locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma.Each enrolled Patient
      will receive Toripalimab plus nab-paclitaxel with or without cisplatin until progressive
      disease or intolerable toxicity occurs, then enter a survival follow-up period.
      Nab-paclitaxel with or without cisplatin will be administered for up to 6 cycles, and
      Toripalimab up to 2 years.
