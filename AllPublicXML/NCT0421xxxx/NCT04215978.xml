    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of BGB-A445 alone and in
      combination with tislelizumab in participants with advanced solid tumors; and to determine
      the maximum tolerated dose(s) (MTD) or maximum administered dose(s) (MAD) and recommended
      Phase 2 doses (RP2D) of BGB-A445 alone and in combination with tislelizumab.
