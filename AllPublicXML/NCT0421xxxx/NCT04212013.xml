  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the combination of rituximab and ibrutinib can help
      people with marginal zone lymphoma who have not received treatment in the past. The study
      will also compare the combination of rituximab and ibrutinib with the combination of
      rituximab and placebo to see which combination works better.

             growth factor support, or medically significant need for intervention For subjects
             with presumptive evidence of transformation based on clinical assessment of factors
             such as, but not limited to, increasing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), rapidly worsening
             disease, or frequent B-symptoms, a pre-treatment biopsy is required to rule out large
             cell transformation
