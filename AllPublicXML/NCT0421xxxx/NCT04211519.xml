    <textblock>
      Recognition of community profiles in endodontic infections may allow a better understanding
      of the pathogenesis of the disease and the establishment of more effective treatment
      protocols.

      Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate bacterial diversity in
      endodontically infected primary and permanent teeth using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and QIIME
      2TM (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology 2) bioinformatics pipeline

      Endodontic infections are defined as an infection of the pulp and periapical tissues. This
      infection is caused by microorganisms that invade the pulp via dental caries or dental
      trauma. In these mixed population infections, anaerobic bacteria have been reported to be
      conspicuously dominant and the number of microorganisms per canal may vary. Traditionally,
      the endodontic microbiome has been identified by culture-based (phenotype-based) techniques.
      Inability to cultivate approximately 40-55% of bacteria in the endodontic microbiome, bias or
      inexperience of researchers may limit the results of cultural research. Microbiome-based new
      generation sequencing (NGS), which was initially used in ecological studies, has been widely
      used in recent years to identify bacterial diversity using the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene
      in endodontic infections microbiome, bias or inexperience of researchers may limit the
      results of cultural research. There are few studies investigating the endodontic microbiome
      in primary teeth. However, to the best of our knowledge, to date, there is no metagenomic
      study that investigates the endodontic microbiome of the primary and permanent teeth. It is a
      still question of whether there is a difference in the endodontic microbiomes during the
      mixed dentition period when both dentition types can be seen.

    <description>For the disinfection of teeth, 30% hydrogen peroxide and 2.5% sodium hypochlorite solution were used for 30 seconds each. Then, 5% sodium thiosulfate solution was used to inactivate the disinfectant agents. Cavity preparation and root canal access were accomplished using sterile high-speed diamond burs under water cooling. Microbial samples were taken immediately by the same researcher from the largest root canal under strict aseptic conditions by using paper point method. Sterilized minimum four paper points were placed to the same level in root canal and the root canal content was absorbed. Each paper point was kept into the canal for at least 30 seconds. Then, paper points were placed into the Eppendorf tubes and refrigerated at -80 °C within 10 min.</description>
