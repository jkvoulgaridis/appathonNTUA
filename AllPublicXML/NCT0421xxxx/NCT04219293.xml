      This pilot study will expand knowledge and application of 2 X concentration of Platelet Rich
      Plasma (PRP) in conjunction with microneedling using the SkinPen device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There have been numerous studies demonstrating benefits of microneedling. However, to date
      there is no published research expanding on the benefits of using platelet rich plasma in
      conjunction with microneedling for facial aesthetics. This pilot study will expand knowledge
      and application of 2 X concentration of Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) in conjunction with
      microneedling using the SkinPen device. The pilot aims to objectively measure skin quality
      using the Visia systemTM and provide objective data to compare Microneedling with the use of
      (PRP) versus microneedling without the use of PRP. The pilot also aims to subjectively
      measure skin improvement using the Face QTM and the Global Aesthetic Improvement ScaleTM.

    <description>The VISIA® facial scan uses 3-D imaging to accurately identify and quantify all aesthetic skin concerns, even before there are visible signs of damage or aging. Using a state-of-the-art, multi-point positioning system the visia scanner captures multiple angles of your skin.</description>

    <description>i. Split face comparison. Vertical line drawn midline nose extending upwards to hairline and downwards to jawline separating face into two equal treatment areas. The patients determined side of face will be treated with SkinPen Microneedling and PRP the other (nondetermined from randomization) will be treated with SkinPen Microneedling and glide. The patient side of face that will not use PRP will be treated first. The following settings will be used as treatment protocol. Topical anesthetic Benzocaine 20%, Lidocaine 10%, and Tetracaine 10% will be applied covering entire treatment area. The anesthetic will remain on skin for 30 minutes.</description>
