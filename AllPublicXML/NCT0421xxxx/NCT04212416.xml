    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects of leflunomide in treating patients with steroid
      dependent chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD). cGVHD is a common complication of bone
      marrow transplant. GVHD occurs when immune cells transplanted from a donor (the graft)
      recognize the transplant recipient (the host) as foreign, and cause damage to the skin,
      gastrointestinal tract or other organs. Steroids are the first line of therapy and benefits
      are seen in about one-third of patients with cGVHD. Prolonged use of steroids is associated
      with multiple complications. Leflunomide may decrease the body's immune response and reduce
      inflammation associated with cGVHD.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Evaluate safety and tolerability of leflunomide in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT)
      patients with steroid dependent chronic GvHD (cGvHD).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Characterize the toxicity profile of leflunomide in patients with steroid dependent cGVHD.

      II. Obtain preliminary evidence of leflunomide activity against GVHD by estimating the
      response rate (as defined by 2014 National Institutes of Health [NIH] consensus development
      project on clinical trials in cGVHD) in an expansion cohort of 12 patients with steroid
      dependent cGVHD.

      III. Evaluate changes in cGVHD severity using physician-reported cGVHD activity assessment
      form.

      IV. Evaluate changes in symptom activity using cGVHD activity assessment patient self-report.

      V. Evaluate failure-free survival and GVHD free survival. VI. Evaluate changes in steroid
      doses while on therapy. VII. Evaluate rate of infectious complications during leflunomide
      administration.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the presence and percentage of immune cell subsets (including but not limited to
      Th17 and Treg cells) in whole blood after leflunomide administration.

      II. Assess the changes in the presence and levels of GVHD inflammatory biomarkers and
      cytokines (including but not limited to IL-17A, IL-21, and IL-2) in plasma after leflunomide
      administration.

      III. Assess the plasma pharmacokinetics of teriflunomide (active metabolite of leflunomide).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive leflunomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) for days 1-28. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients may optionally continue leflunomide for an additional 6 cycles as long as response
      or stable disease is maintained.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then
      periodically thereafter.

             birth control or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study
             through at least 3 months after the last dose of protocol therapy. The effects of
             study treatment on a developing fetus have the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect that she is pregnant

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to study agent.

          -  Active infection requiring antibiotics. An active uncontrolled infection is defined as
             hemodynamic instability attributed to sepsis or new symptoms, worsening physical
             signs, or radiographic findings attributable to infection. Persisting fever without
             signs or symptoms will not be interpreted as an active uncontrolled infection.

          -  Uncontrolled cardiac angina or symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart
             Association [NYHA] class III or IV).

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study. Because there is an unknown but potential
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             leflunomide.

          -  Patients should not have any uncontrolled illness including ongoing or active
             infection.

          -  Known history of immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection.

          -  Any other condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, contraindicate the
             patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns with clinical
             study procedures.

          -  Inability to comply with protocol therapy and follow up visits.

          -  Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to
             comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to
             feasibility/logistics).
