  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of individuals with type I or type II diabetes. It is meant to test the
      effect of using the Diabits app on a participant's blood glucose control. The Diabits app is
      a diabetes management app which integrates with your continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and
      presents not only your current blood glucose trend, but also an estimate of your blood
      glucose values up to 60 minutes into the future. The Diabits app has been available in the
      USA and Canada for the past two years and was validated for predictive accuracy at BC
      Children's Hospital in Canada in 2017 with a predicted accuracy of 94.9%. Diabits app users
      in North America have shown some improvements in their individual time in range (TIR) and
      HbA1c values. This study aims to validate those results in a clinical setting. The study will
      randomise a total of 90 participants into using the Diabits app with or without the glucose
      forecasting enabled to help determine if the glucose forecasting (or predictions) can help
      participants make better treatment decisions and improve not only measurements of glucose
      such as time in range and HbA1c, but also reduce anxiety and improve quality of life with
      diabetes.

      This study focuses on the impact of the Diabits app, a smartphone application which assists a
      person with diabetes to better manage their blood glucose. The Diabits app connects to a
      user's continuous glucose monitor (CGM) such as an Abbott Freestyle Libre, and predicts what
      the user's blood glucose will be over the next 60 minutes, updating every 5 minutes. The
      Diabits app displays that prediction to the user so that the user may make proactive
      decisions about insulin and food, with the goal of achieving more stable blood glucose
      control.

      The study will evaluate the impact which having access to blood glucose predictions has on a
      user's time in range (TIR). The hypothesis is that having access to blood glucose predictions
      will improve the user's ability to stay within their target blood glucose range by 5% within
      a given 24 hour period. This is a randomized controlled trial. A control group with Abbott
      Freestyle Libre CGMs will be recruited, and given a version of the Diabits app which does not
      display any blood glucose forecasts. A treatment group, also with Abbott Freestyle Libres,
      will be given the Diabits app with glucose forecasts enabled. Both groups will be asked to
      use the app as their primary diabetes management tool for the duration of the study.

      The study will run for 3 months. At the beginning of the study the 90 participants will be
      separated evenly into two groups. A blood test will be done to measure HbA1c and each
      participant will complete a number of surveys. At the end of the study the same activities
      will occur. Following conclusion, results will be evaluated to determine what differences
      develop between the control and treatment groups.

    <description>The intervention arm.

    <description>Participants will be able to view predictions of future blood glucose. These predictions will indicate where the participant's blood glucose will travel over the next hour given that the participant's state does not change. Based on this, the participant is expected, but not required to make decisions about their activity, food, and insulin, in order to maintain blood glucose in a healthy range. The intervention does not require a specific method of glucose management, or event that a participant takes any action after viewing a prediction, the intervention is simply to display the prediction.</description>
