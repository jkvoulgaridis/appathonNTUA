    <textblock>
      This Phase II SBIR tests a newly developed web-based online parenting skills training and
      youth drug prevention program based on the evidenced-based &quot;Strengthening Families Program.&quot;
      The study design involves a three-condition parallel randomized control trial contrasting:
      (1) SFP Online, (2) SFP Home-use DVD/videos, and (3) Wait-Listed Controls.

      DELIVERY OF INTERVENTION: The intervention condition, SFP Online, is a highly interactive,
      multimedia condition testing a 10-session online program with two intersecting tracks, one
      for parents and one for youth. Both tracks involve completion of three mini-lessons per week
      delivered online for 10 weeks. For the parent track (biological parents, caregivers or legal
      guardians), each lesson entails learning nurturing parenting skills that strengthen family
      bonds, setting clear boundaries with positive discipline, and monitoring youth's social
      activities and emotional well-being. The youth lessons teach social competence-based skills
      and drug refusal skills. For both tracks, lesson material is scaffolded in an integrated
      fashion, with challenge quizzes and process evaluations interspersed throughout the lessons.
      Each track includes a gaming portion to increase engagement and reinforce lesson content
      through stealth learning. The SFP Home-use DVD/video series is an 11-session program with the
      same content as the online version, but is not interactive. It is viewed either online or
      using a DVD player at home. In the Wait-Listed control condition, parents receive emails with
      food recipes and nutritional information over the same 10-week period; while their children
      receive emails with riddles and puzzles. At the conclusion of a 3-month follow-up period the
      wait-listed controls receive the SFP Online intervention, thus doubling the size of the
      intervention treatment condition. A second design feature is the use of a non-inferiority
      trial (NIT) to empirically examine the efficacy of SFP Online when compared to the Home-use
      DVD/videos and Group Norms data. The Group Norms, which serve as a benchmark of SFP
      effectiveness, is a representative, demographically matched sample of n=1700 families drawn
      from a database of over 6,000 families that have taken the full 14-session traditional class
      format of SFP. Effects sizes, using the partial eta-squared statistic, will be compared
      between conditions for the major outcome measures.

      This study tests a new web-based online parenting skills training and youth drug prevention
      program based on the evidence-based Strengthening Families Program. The study design involves
      a three-condition parallel randomized control trial contrasting: (1) SFP Online, (2) SFP
      Home-use DVD/videos, and (3) Wait-Listed Controls. The intervention condition, SFP Online, is
      an interactive, multimedia condition testing a 10-session online program with interrelated
      tracks for parents and youth. Both tracks involve completion of three mini-lessons per week
      delivered online for 10 weeks. Each track includes a gaming portion to increase engagement
      and reinforce lesson content through stealth learning. The SFP Home-use DVD/video series is
      an 11-session program with the same content as the online version, but is delivered via an
      online video presentation or a DVD player. The Wait-Listed control condition receives emails
      with recipes over the same 10-week period; their youth receive riddles. At the conclusion of
      a 3-month follow-up period, the wait-listed controls receive the SFP Online intervention. Our
      statistical analysis addresses the differences between the online and Home-use DVD/video
      conditions.

      A second design feature is a Non-Inferiority Trial (NIT) to empirically examine the efficacy
      of SFP Online when compared to the SFP Group Norms data. The Group Norms, which serves as a
      benchmark of SFP effectiveness, is a representative, demographically matched sample of n=1700
      families drawn from a database of 6,000 families who have attended the full SFP 14-session
      classes. Effects sizes, using the partial eta-squared statistic, will be compared between
      conditions for the major outcome measures. The effect sizes will be adjusted for demographics
      differences at the individual level as well as implementation factors. The margin of
      equivalence for the effect size comparison between conditions is set at 10% (the effect sizes
      for the SFP Online program outcomes will be at least 10% larger than the corresponding effect
      sizes for the SFP videos or Group Norms).

      RECRUITMENT: The investigators will recruit 240 families with at least one parent and youth
      (n=480 participants), with 80 families randomly assigned to each experimental condition.
      Recruitment is handled by 24 SFP recruiters who sent Letters of Support. They are ethnically
      diverse and geographically dispersed across the U.S. They have access to multiple
      races/ethnicities and marginalized families. Each recruiter is targeting recruitment of 10
      families (24 recruiters x 10 families).

      ASSIGNMENT: Individual families will be randomly assigned to one of three interventions with
      a computerized random number generator to eliminate selection bias and control unobserved
      confounding variables that contribute to program outcomes. We will examine the distribution
      of relevant demographic variables (race/ethnicity, income, education, adult and child age) to
      assure balance between conditions at baseline. We conduct analyses to detect significant
      program differences in intervention effects by these variables.

      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Prior to evaluating program effects, we examine pretest equivalence
      between experimental conditions using appropriate tests for categorical or continuous
      baseline measures. Significant differences are controlled in covariate-adjusted models
      evaluating program efficacy. This analysis uses a 3 (condition) x 2 (baseline risk) ANOVA
      with continued presence in the study as the dependent variable. We also examine whether there
      is any differential attrition by condition (i.e., coding attrition as 1/0 and using logistic
      regression models to predict retention). We also use confirmatory techniques to contrast
      variance/ covariance matrixes between conditions to assess whether patterns of statistical
      relations differ by condition. Differential attrition by condition could potentially limit
      internal validity (intervention effects might be confounded with attrition effects) or
      external validity (generalizability to other families). Data analyses begins by generating
      simple descriptive statistics on all baseline measures (e.g., frequencies, means, variance),
      repeating this procedure for the posttest and the 3-month follow-up data. Distributions are
      examined for skewness and kurtosis and response patterns. Chi-square tests, point bi-serial
      and Pearson correlations are used to examine Statistical relations between baseline
      predictors (i.e., checking for multicollinearity), demographics, site characteristics, and
      outcome variables will be assessed using appropriate measures of association and evaluated
      for statistical significance using chi-square, t, and F tests). Violating assumptions of
      normality and homoscedasticity (often encountered in family research and when assessing youth
      self-report drug use) will require data transformations (e.g., logarithmic, arcsine, spline,
      or percentile weighting). If the transformations fail to normalize the data, we can use
      nonparametric tests (e.g., Kendall's Tau, Mann-Whitney U-test, Wilcoxon Rank Sum, Spearman's
      correlation, and Freidman's ANOVA). For non-Gaussian distributions that arise from low
      frequency behaviors we can employ Poisson regression, zero-inflated, and two-part
      semicontinuous models to adjust for highly skewed distributions with a preponderance of
      zeroes.

      MISSING DATA. There may be some participants that fail to take the outcome evaluation
      surveys, stop participating in the intervention or are reluctant to provide data. These
      occurrences represent different faces of attrition (withdrawal and poor adherence) and must
      be examined carefully. We assume that data is missing completely at random (MCAR), or that
      the mechanisms causing the missing data are &quot;ignorable&quot; with no bias in the condition
      comparison; however, we apply Little's test of MCAR for multivariate data to determine if
      missing data bias the results. Regardless of how it arises, the complete-data-methods used
      require using multiple imputation procedures to obtain efficient parameter estimates. We use
      Full Information Maximum Likelihood estimation to recover the missing data. A reasonable
      number of imputations is 10 given the efficiency of imputation with relatively low levels of
      missingness. The 10 imputed datasets are then combined using multiple inference procedures
      that adjust standard errors for missing data uncertainty142 producing more efficient
      parameter estimates.

      INTENTION TO TREAT. Noncompliance arises because participants may fail to finish all the
      lessons, take none at all, or only take the assessments without being exposed to the lessons.
      This makes those who complete the lessons no longer a &quot;random sample of the original group.&quot;
      Intention-to-treat (ITT) is a strategy for analyzing data in which participants remain in the
      experimental condition they were assigned regardless of their lesson completion or
      non-compliance status. Using sensitivity analyses, the data from completers is then
      contrasted to a dataset with cases excluded post-randomization because they were not exposed
      to the entire curriculum (efficacy subset analyses). This approach assumes that data from
      censored cases are missing at random (MAR) and the outcomes were obtained in an unbiased
      manner. Sensitivity analyses will compare outcomes based on different levels of lesson
      completion (relaxing the exclusion rule) with this procedure repeated leaving intervention
      exposure (number of sessions) continuous, as participants may benefit from any exposure. We
      will also use the complier average causal effects (CACE) estimation method to address
      differences in compliance with the intervention and its effects on program outcomes. Using
      CACE analysis, multiple groups (mixtures) are formed corresponding to their level of
      compliance (i.e., engagement) and treatment assignment (SFPOnline or SFP DVD/videos). Program
      outcomes are then contrasted between these mixtures using traditional logistic regression
      methods. We can further categorize compliers based on their observed lesson completion rates,
      yielding low- vs. high-compliers in each condition. Furthermore, engagement can be
      conditioned based on participant-level covariates (i.e., marital status, income, stress, drug
      use, or family size). ITT and CACE techniques keep the randomized design intact, mitigates
      bias from differential program completion, and enables us to make causal inferences about
      intervention effects in this sample. In the event that non-completing participants are not
      randomly dispersed among conditions, we will also report effect sizes among those who
      completed the lessons and took the Post Surveys.

      TESTS OF CONFOUNDING. Even with random assignment to experimental conditions and reduction in
      any pretest imbalances between them, confounding effects could remain a threat to validity
      (i.e., program effects could be biased). As a result, we will examine selected variables
      measured at baseline for evidence of any imbalance (i.e., pretest equivalence) and perform
      secondary analyses in which we model pretreatment covariates to account for between-group,
      outcome differences. This examination will be conducted using generalized linear models.
      Pretreatment differences can be participant specific (e.g., demographics). There is some
      evidence supporting inclusion of covariates in order to be able to causally attribute
      differences between the conditions to the intervention. Their inclusion increases model
      precision and boosts power and this efficiency holds for binary outcomes as well should we
      choose to model youth drug use in this manner.

      MANIPULATION CHECKS. We anticipate that certain relationships will be mediated by other
      variables. Our longitudinal study design allows us to make rigorous inferences regarding
      causal processes, addressing the putative mechanisms and treatment construct validity through
      which SFP works. We assume sequential ignorability even though the mediator is assessed
      post-randomization. We can statistically assess the decrement in magnitude of the direct
      effect, adjusted for the indirect effects. This case extends to longitudinal data with more
      than one putative mediator by the tracing rule for path analysis. The longitudinal design
      also provides temporal separation of the pretest, intervention (weeks 1-10), posttest (week
      10-11), and the 3-month follow-up (week 22-23). We use the multivariate delta method to
      compute standard errors for mediated effects, which simulations have shown to produce
      accurate estimates based on bootstrap confidence intervals for the mediated effect. Potential
      mediators in these longitudinal models assessing program efficacy include measures of
      parenting efficacy, skills performance (based on interim quizzes), parent-child
      communication, monitoring, boundary setting, and levels of engagement (based on satisfaction,
      lesson completion and usage metrics).

      EFFECT MODIFICATION. A limited set of post-hoc analyses will explore homogeneity of the
      intervention effect across participant subgroups. These analyses help gain precision in
      knowing whether program effects were optimized for certain groups.

      POWER. In estimating power, we assumed: (1) three experimental conditions, (2) multiple waves
      of data collection, (3) random effects associated with estimated outcomes. ranging between
      .35-.45 and differing types of outcome measures (dichotomous vs. continuous). We project the
      ability to recruit 80 families (1 parent + 1 youth) in each experimental condition over the
      recruitment period. With large sample sizes (n=480), we can detect significant effects across
      most effect sizes.

Each lesson contains 3 mini-lessons per week and includes behavioral skills training and interactive multimedia lessons with video vignettes that target parenting skills, family cohesion, organization, communication, social skills, and drug prevention for youth. The youth track is highly gamified to stimulate engagement and reinforce the core active ingredients. There are self-correcting quizzes to assess learning, and process evaluation to determine program fidelity and engagement. There are learning theory instructional design elements with scaffolding, stealth learning, and theoretical principles of social learning, social interactional, and family systems theory.
