      This study is intended to evaluate the effect of the dietary supplement combination of NEM®
      brand eggshell membrane + KD PUR® brand fish oil versus placebo in reducing exercise-induced
      joint pain, stiffness &amp; cartilage turnover in healthy men &amp; women. Half of the study
      participants will receive NEM + fish oil, once daily, orally while the other half of the
      study participants will receive placebo, once daily, orally while performing an exercise
      regimen every other day for two weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Moderate exercise can induce discomfort in joints when done infrequently or when done too
      intensely or for too long a period. This discomfort is often realized as either pain or
      stiffness in the joint that was the focus of the exercise. For example, one's knees will hurt
      after jogging for several miles, particularly if jogging for the first time. This study is
      intended to evaluate whether the combination of NEM® brand eggshell membrane + KD PUR® brand
      fish oil, commercially available as Move3™ can alleviate joint pain or stiffness, either
      directly following exercise or 12 hours post-exercise versus placebo. The study will also
      evaluate Move3's effect, on cartilage turnover via the cartilage degradation biomarker
      c-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II). Participants will perform a
      minimum of 40 steps per leg utilizing an aerobics step at the clinical site. They will follow
      this exercise regimen on alternating days for 2 consecutive weeks. Changes in pain &amp;
      stiffness (immediate &amp; 12-hour) will be compared to both baseline and to the placebo group.
      Urine samples will also be collected at baseline and at the end of Week 1 &amp; Week 2. The
      change in CTX-II from baseline will be compared to the placebo group.

          1. Male or Female subjects must be 40-75 years of age at the time of Screening.

          2. Subjects must not have been diagnosed with a JCT disease (i.e. osteoarthritis,
             rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, bursitis, gout, systemic lupus erythematosus,
             fibromyalgia, etc.) affecting the hip, knee, or ankle by a licensed physician prior to
             enrollment evaluation / screening.

          3. Subjects must have a resting pain/discomfort score of ≤ 2 on the 10-point continuous
             scale in the knee with the most severe pain/discomfort at the Follow-Up
             Screening/Baseline (first exercise visit).

          4. Subjects must be willing and healthy enough, as judged by the clinical Investigator or
             Sub-Investigator(s), to perform moderate exercise.
