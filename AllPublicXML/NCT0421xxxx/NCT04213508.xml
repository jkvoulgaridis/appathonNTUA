  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rhinosinusitis is a common clinical problem with significant morbidity which alters patients'
      quality of life that has its effect on 1 out of 7 adults. It has been found that
      rhinosinusitis accounts for almost 26 million clinics and emergency visits per year in United
      states .Nasal irrigation is standard management used to treat a variety of sinonasal
      diseases. Furthermore, nasal irrigation decreases the need of usage other medications in
      rhinosinusitis .Hence, it is considered safe, inexpensive, and easy to use with no evidence
      of major adverse effects .Up to our knowledge, there is no clear guideline in which type
      (isotonic saline vs hypertonic saline) and frequency (times per day) of nasal irrigation are
      superior and better.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nasal irrigation is one of the main treatment of sinonasal diseases. The mechanism of action
      of nasal irrigation has many physiological aspects such as removing of excess mucus which is
      a potential medium for bacterial growth and infection, cleaning of antigens and biofilm to
      decrease inflammatory process, increase mucocilliary function and removing curst and debris
      from post-surgery to enhance wound healing and mucosalization Hypertonic saline is defined as
      a solution with more than 0.9% weight per volume of sodium chloride while isotonic saline is
      defined as a solution that equals to 0.9% weight per volume of sodium chloride. There are
      controversial studies in the literature on which saline is superior on the other, some prefer
      hypertonic saline over isotonic saline because it can move water outside the cells, decrease
      edema of mucosa, increase hydration of sol layer and decrease muco-adhesiveness and improve
      mucociliary clearance while others found both solution had same efficacy, improved nasal
      stuffiness and nasal obstruction but patients prefer isotonic saline because it is well
      tolerated and less burning sensation. Frequency of nasal irrigation per day is poorly studied
      in the literature with no known recommended times per day. Our aim is to find which type of
      saline and number of irrigation per day are better and statistically significant .

    <time_frame>Change from baseline of Sino-Nasal Outcome Test 22 (SNOT-22) at 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) is a validated chronic rhinosinusitis -specific outcome measure consisting of 22 items that captures sinus-specific and general health-related impact of the disease process.
To answer the instrument, patients suggest their level of affection in each domain and identify the most 5 important items. Each item quantifies symptoms severity from 0 (no problem) to 5 (worst symptom). The sum of each item results in a maximum score of 110 while the minimum is 0 . High score indicates poor outcome.
Arabic version of a validated and reliable SNOT-22 will utilize in this study. We will measure the change of SNOT-22 from our baseline after follow up in 1 month</description>

    <description>Peri-Operative Sinus Endoscopy Score (POSE) is objective endoscopic scoring system was utilized to assess the surgical outcomes in the sinonasal cavities through the evaluation of the middle turbinate, middle meatal antrostomy,ethmoid cavity, and secondary sinuses.The sum of maxiumum score is 20 while the minimum is 0 . High score indicates poor result . Th We will measure the change of POSE from our baseline after follow up in 1 month</description>
