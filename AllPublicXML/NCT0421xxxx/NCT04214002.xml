  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a non-interventional, observational study that will evaluate the natural
      history of wounds in patients with Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (DEB) for inclusion into
      the Krystal Biotech Phase III protocol of B-VEC (previously KB103). Wound recurrence and
      wound size will be evaluated for up to four months.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to analyze the selected wounds' natural history prior to
      including the selected wounds in the evaluation of safety and efficacy in Krystal Biotech's
      Phase III protocol of B-VEC.

      Subjects will be enrolled upon obtaining consent and meeting eligibility criteria.

      Patient Screening is done on-site, followed by the imaging of at least 1 wound, but up to 15
      wounds. All remaining imaging will be performed remotely with a smartphone or tablet
      application.

      Patients are on-trial for approximately four months.

    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Patients must be 6 months of age or older, and have a diagnosis of DEB based on genetic
        analysis or histologic criteria. In addition, patients must have at least 1 wound that is
        suitable for imaging in investigator's opinion at time of screening.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent is provided. Patients 18 years of age and older, and
             parent(s)/legal guardian(s) of patients younger than 18 years of age, must provide
             written informed consent prior to participating in the study; additionally, informed
             assent will be obtained from patients younger than 18 years of age as specified by
             local requirements.

          -  Patient must have a documented diagnosis of DEB based on genetic analysis showing a
             mutation in COL7A1 or, in the opinion of the investigator, a confirmed diagnosis of
             DEB based on histologic criteria (antigen mapping or electron microscopy).

          -  Age: 6 months and older

          -  Patient must have at least 1 wound that is suitable for imaging, in the opinion of the
             investigator, at the time of enrollment.

          -  Patient is willing and able to undergo the protocol-specified procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, inclusion poses an unacceptable risk to the
             patient or interpretation of these study data.
