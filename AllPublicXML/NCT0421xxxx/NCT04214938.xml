  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transnasal Flexible Pharyngolaryngoscopy (NPL) is one of the most common and fundamental
      evaluation procedures in otolaryngologist's practice, performed in both outpatient and ward
      settings.In the studies the desired properties for an effective topical agent to be used in
      patients undergoing NPL. To date, only a local anesthetic and/or decongestant substance is
      applied to the nostrils to relieve pain. However, to date, no studies have been performed in
      which intranasal hypertonic saline was used prior to nasal endoscopy.

      NPL is a technique that has been used for more than 100 years and increases brightness,
      magnification and the ability to take still and video images (3). NPL is a simple, safe,
      cost-effective, and generally well-tolerated procedure. However, a portion of patients may
      refuse to allow the procedure to be repeated as they find it uncomfortable, intolerable, or
      painful.To date, only a local anesthetic and/or decongestant substance is applied to the
      nostrils to relieve pain and increase the field of view and to reduce the duration of
      examination and unpleasant sensations for the patient on NPL procedures.This randomised
      control trial was undertaken to compare the application of nasal hypertonic sea water (3.5%)
      with nasal lidocaine 10%, topical nasal decongestant xylometazoline 0.1% (OtrivineTM) and
      nasal isotonic serum physiologic as placebo group in relation to how they effectively improve
      the adequacy of the examination and if they reduce pain and discomfort associated with
      endoscopic nasal examination.

    <description>The primary outcome was to evaluate clinicians' field of the view according to Visual Analog Scale (VAS) questionnaire survey. Shortly after endoscopy, the endoscopist was asked to indicate the degree of quality of view, ease of procedure on a VAS (1: impossible to pass the endoscope, 100: excellent field of view)</description>

    <description>The secondary outcome was to evaluate the patients' pain after the naso-endoscopy procedure according to Visual Analog Scale (VAS) questionnaire survey. Shortly after endoscopy, subjects were asked to indicate their degree of pain on a VAS (1: no pain, 100: unbearable pain).</description>

    <description>The secondary outcome was to evaluate the patients' discomfort after the nasoendoscopy procedure according to Visual Analog Scale (VAS) questionnaire survey. Shortly after spraying each bottle, subjects were asked to indicate their degree of discomfort on a visual analogue scale (VAS) (1: no discomfort, 100: utmost discomfort). For each spray, one independent scores were obtained from each subject.</description>
