    <description>Patients received 4 sessions, separated one week between them. The treatment consisted the application of a galvanic current through an acupuncture needle (0,30x30mm). The approach were performed with a transverse axis with a needle in plane, being superficial and deep interface of medium nerve the target tissue. The parameters will be 2 mA (milliamps), 10 seconds, 3 impacts (3: 3: 3).</description>
