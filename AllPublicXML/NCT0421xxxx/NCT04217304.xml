    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety and feasibility of sonothrombolysis in the acute management
      of STEMI undergoing reperfusion therapy with systemic fibrinolysis as part of a
      pharmacoinvasive approach

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open label, single-centre, randomized investigation of sonothrombolysis in
      60 adult patients presenting with STEMI within 6 hours of the onset of clinical symptoms and
      receiving perfusion therapy with fibrinolysis as part of a pharmacoinvasive strategy.

      Patients will be randomized 2:1 to either adjunct treatment with sonothrombolysis or standard
      therapy alone according to the current American College of Cardiology/American Heart
      Association (ACC/AHA) or European Society of Cardiology (ESC) STEMI and PCI guidelines. All
      patients will receive serial echocardiography assessments during and after reperfusion with
      the final ECHO assessment at 90 days (+/- 7d) post reperfusion. Patient outcomes (medical
      records review) will be followed for 1 year after reperfusion.

    <description>Wall motion score index (WMSI) by ECHO assessed on Day 1 (pre reperfusion), Day 3 +/-2d (hospital discharge), and Day 90 +/-2d after infarction.
Each of the 17 LV segments is classified as:
1 normal 2.hypokinetic 3.akinetic 4.dyskinetic The WMS index is the sum of the scores divided by the number of segments. Usually 17, but if a segment cannot be classified, the sum is divided by the number of readable segments.
Minimum value is 1 : all segments are normal - best outcome Maximum value is 4: all segments are dyskinetic - worst outcome</description>

    <description>Microvascular perfusion score index (MPSI) by ECHO assessed on Day 1 (pre reperfusion), Day 3 +/-2d (hospital discharge), and Day 90 +/-2d after infarction
Each of the 17 LV segments is classified as:
normal, contrast replenishment within 4 seconds
mildly reduced, contrast replenishment takes longer than 4 seconds
no contrast replenishment over 10 seconds
The MPSI index is the sum of the scores divided by the number of segments. Usually 17, but if a segment cannot be classified, then the sum is divided by the number of readable segments
Minimum value is 1 : all segments are normal - best outcome Maximum value is 3: all segments are not perfused - worst outcome</description>

    <description>Global Longitudinal Strain (GLS) by ECHO assessed on Day 1 (pre reperfusion), Day 3 +/-2d (hospital discharge), and Day 90 +/-2d after infarction
GLS is measured using speckle tracking imaging (Epiq, Philips). The scale is - % which means percentage of longitudinal shortening of myocardial segments. Similar to the WMSI, GLS is calculated by dividing the sum of the longitudinal strain measurements in the myocardial segments segments by the number of segments which can be assessed by speckle tracking (18 when all segments in all 3 apical views can be analysed.
The lower the absolute strain value the worse the LV function.</description>
