  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the accuracy of Butterfly IQ ultrasound for
      intra-articular hip injections, and to see if an injection given intra-articular before
      incision provides any benefit in preemptive pain relief or blood loss reduction.

      This study is designed to be prospective randomized (1:1) controlled independent trial.
      Subjects are male and female, aged 18 and above, who are suitable candidates for either a
      unilateral (i.e. single) total hip replacement. Subjects that are scheduled with a single,
      extensively trained Physician Assistant assisting in their surgery will be exclusively
      included. This is single site study with projected enrollment of 150 subjects
