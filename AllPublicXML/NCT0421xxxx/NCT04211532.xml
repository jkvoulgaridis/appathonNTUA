  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, quality of life and individualised medicine are becoming more important in the
      everyday medical practice and surgery it is not an exception. In recent years, the interest
      in the improvement of the quality of surgical procedures and outcomes has increased. This
      quality can be improved by assessing the surgical or operative risk by evaluating the
      postoperative mortality and morbidity.

      Most of the risk stratification tools are used in elective surgery. Only few have been
      specifically validated for immediate or urgent. However, there are different situations. In
      elective interventions, the patient and the surgeon can discuss the advantages and drawbacks
      and postpone the decision. Moreover, an improvement in the physical status of the patient can
      be performed whereas in immediate or urgent surgery there is no time to neither of them.

      POSSUM is used as the main tool for the prediction of mortality and morbidity and for
      assessing the quality care of the General Surgery Unit of Corporació Sanitària Parc Taulí.
      Nevertheless, this system has its limitations. It overestimates mortality in low risk
      patients and it does not take into account the specific surgical procedure.

      That is why, it is believed that the ACS-NSQIP risk calculator -created in 2013- is a
      potential good tool to stratify surgical risks. In contrast with POSSUM, it considers any
      surgical procedure -according to the Current Procedural Terminology.

      The calculator has been externally validated in population of North-America which requires
      emergent surgery with a somewhat underestimation of the risk. As populations have different
      profiles and there are different levels of care, it is needed the external validation in
      other countries.

      In essence, there is a need of validation of risk calculators in different populations and
      emergency surgery (immediate and urgent) is distinct from the elective operation, therefore
      they should be considered separately when risk is calculated.

      Therefore, there is a need of validation of the ACS NSQIP risk calculator in Spanish
      population which requires emergency (immediate and urgent) surgery. On the other hand, it is
      suggested that ACS NSQIP risk calculator performs better than POSSUM . Hence, its prediction
      performance is compared with POSSUM.

      A prospective validation cohort study is proposed. The surgical risk of the patients
      recruited in the study was calculated by the ACS NSQIP risk calculator and by POSSUM.

      In order to compare the performance of ACS NSQIP risk calculator with POSSUM, area under the
      receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated for each tool. The statistical
      differences between the two AUC curves were compared using P value. Calibration of the
      agreement between observed and predicted outcomes was tested using the Brier score. The Brier
      score ranges from 0 to 1. The closer the score is to 0, the more accurate is the risk
      prediction model.

      There is a need of validation of the ACS NSQIP risk calculator in Spanish population which
      requires emergency (immediate and urgent) surgery. Besides, it is suggested that ACS NSQIP
      risk calculator performs better than POSSUM. Hence, its prediction performance is compared
      with POSSUM.
