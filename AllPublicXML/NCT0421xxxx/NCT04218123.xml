  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As of yet, the cause of Meniere's disease is uncertain and there is no cure. Given the lack
      of high level evidence for treatments, we seek to perform a randomized, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind, crossover, pilot trial of venlafaxine for treating Meniere's disease.
      Venlafaxine is a safe and well-tolerated medication. It has never been trialed in Meniere's
      disease, but there is evidence that it could be effective in helping with vertigo attacks and
      other aspects of the disorder.

    <measure>Change in Score on Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of treatment (6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The Dizziness Handicap Inventory is a 25-item questionnaire of self-perceived handicap from dizziness.There are 7 questions in the physical domain, 9 in the emotional domain, and 8 in the functional domain. It is scored from 0 (no perceived disability) to 100 (maximum perceived disability).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Score on Neuropsychological Vertigo Inventory (NVI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of treatment (6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The English version of the Neuropsychological Vertigo Inventory consists of 28-items with a 5-point Likert scale for each question. It is a cognitive assessment specific to patients with dizziness. The NVI assesses 7 domains of cognition: space perception, attention, time perception, memory, emotional, visual/ocular and motor. The score ranges from 0 to 140. The higher the score on the NVI the worse the cognitive function of the subject.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Score on Cognitive Failure Questionnaire (CFQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of treatment (6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The Cognitive Failure Questionnaire is a 25-item survey which assesses cognitive and executive function not tied to any specific disease state. It aims to assess perception, memory, and motor function in everyday tasks.The score ranges from 0 to 100 The higher score on the CFQ, the more frequent the cognitive failures experienced by the subject</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Score on Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of treatment (6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire is a 9-item survey which assesses the severity of depression. A low score is indicative of little to no depressive symptoms, and a high score is indicative of Moderately severe to severe depressive symptoms. Scores range from 0 to 27 with scores higher than 20 indicative of significant risk for depression and scores below 10 indicative at most of a mild depression.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Score on Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of treatment (6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The PSWQ is a 16-item survey for assessment of anxiety which has been used to identify generalized anxiety disorder. Scores range from 16 (Low worry) to 80 (high worry). A score higher than 60 is indicative of significant anxiety and risk for an anxiety disorder</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Score on The Meniere's Disease Patient-Oriented Symptom Index (MDPOSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of treatment (6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The Meniere's Disease Patient-Oriented Symptom Index is a 23-item survey developed as a MD-specific tool to assess the impact of MD symptoms on patients' lives. The score ranges from 0 to 100 with the higher score indicating an active disease with significant impact on function and quality of life.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Score on The Medical Outcomes Study 20-item Short Form Health Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of treatment (6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The Medical Outcomes Study 20-item Short Form Health Survey is a 20-item general health questionnaire to assess quality of life in chronic diseases. It assesses 6 areas of health: physical functioning, role functioning, social functioning, mental health, health perceptions, and pain. Scores range between 0 and 100, with 100 indicating best possible function and 0 the worst possible function</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Severity of Vertigo</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The study team will use a modified version of vertigo control classification because the treatment phases are 2 months long and the study team will not be able to wait 18-24 months after treatment to assess efficacy per academy guidelines. Previous studies have defined four categories of response to treatment: 1) very good response if more than 75% reduction in vertigo spells frequency and/or intensity, 2) good response if 50-75% reduction, 3) fair response if 25-50% reduction, and 4) poor response if less than 25% reduction.
The vertigo classes will be defined as follows; Class A: 0 (complete control of vertigo) Class B: 0-40 or &gt;60% reduction in mean vertigo episode severity (good control of vertigo) Class C: 41-80 or 20-60% reduction in severity (fair control of vertigo) Class D: 81-120 or -20-20% reduction in severity (no change in vertigo) Class E: &gt;120 or &gt;20% worsening in severity (worse vertigo)</description>
