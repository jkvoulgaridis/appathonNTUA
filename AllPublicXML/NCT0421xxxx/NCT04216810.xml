  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a major public health problem and is associated with a high rate of
      absenteeism at work, functional disability and frequent use of health services. Suction cup
      therapy is a common technique of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which has been around
      for about 3,300 years in Asia and the Middle East and has as its main feature the decrease in
      signs and symptoms of chronic pain. The technique was widely used in the 19th century
      throughout Asia and Europe, and in recent years demand has been increasing, possibly due to
      the inefficiency of conventional therapies and medicines. Objective: To verify the
      effectiveness of the suction cup therapy technique associated with conventional physiotherapy
      in patients with chronic low back pain. Method: We will include individuals between 18 and 60
      years old, both genders, with low back pain for more than 3 months, without having received
      physical therapy treatment for a period of 6 months. Individuals with severe spinal diseases,
      root conditions of the spine, carriers of vascular diseases and pregnant women will be
      excluded. They will be randomly divided into two groups, Conventional Physiotherapy (group 1)
      and Conventional Physiotherapy associated with suction cup therapy (group 2).
