  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic ring fractures are common and often the result of high energy trauma but also
      sometimes of lower energy trauma in older patients. A good classification and description of
      the fracture is essential to the choice of treatment.

      The classifications used to describe these fractures are numerous (Tile modified AO, Young
      and Burgess, Letournel, Rommens) and of a descriptive order more or less depending on the
      lesion mechanism allowing some to orient the surgical reduction technique. However, none of
      them helps with the choice of surgical or functional treatment, which is currently based on
      obvious notions of instability and / or displacement of lesions and, by habit, all different
      services.

      In addition, the complexity of these classifications leads to poor reproducibility of these.

      A new method for analyzing unitary lesions has been developed in the Orthopedic Surgery
      department of the Paris Saint-Joseph Hospital Group with a rating system which determines the
      indication according to the score.

      Teaching this new method of analyzing pelvic ring fractures would simplify decision making
      between surgical and functional treatment.
