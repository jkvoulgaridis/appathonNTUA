  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial, in a parallel design with two arms, aimed to
      evaluate the effects of a combined (i.e., resistance plus aerobic) exercise program with
      different weekly frequencies on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, glycohemoglobin and
      other cardiovascular risk factors in individuals with hypertension.

      The conceptual hypothesis is that a combined exercise program performed four times and two
      times per week with equalized volume will reduce blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk
      factors. However, we expected these results will be more pronounced in four times per week
      group when compared with two times per week group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most physical exercise guidelines suggest a total weekly volume in minutes (150 minutes per
      week), but its unclear if the same training volume performed in different weekly frequencies
      could induce different responses in blood pressure and others cardiovascular risk factors.

      A randomized superiority parallel trial will be designed to evaluate the effects of 12 weeks
      of a combined exercise program performed two or four times per week on ambulatory blood
      pressure monitoring, glycohemoglobin, endothelial function, cardiorespiratory and
      neuromuscular fitness in individuals with hypertension.

      Men and women aged to 50-80 years with medical diagnosis of hypertension will be randomly
      enrolled into a combined training program performed four times per week or two times per
      week. The outcomes measurements will be assessed by the same investigator, who will be
      blinded to the exercise intervention groups.
