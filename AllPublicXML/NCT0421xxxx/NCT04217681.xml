  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain concerns one in four adults in Belgium. Because of the psychological and social
      repercussions, a biopsychosocial approach is necessary in order to improve the quality of
      life of people suffering from chronic pain. Non-pharmacological techniques such as hypnosis,
      self-care learning and music-therapy are gaining more and more interest in the scientific
      field. Indeed, several studies have shown a reduction in psychological distress and an
      improvement in global quality of life after having learned self-hypnosis/self-care.
      Furthermore, other studies focusing on music as a treatment for chronic pain highlight an
      analgesic effect of music over pain and a reduction of common comorbidities. Nevertheless,
      only few studies aim at comparing these techniques to each other. The aim of our study would
      be to compare a 7 months learning program of self-hypnosis/self-care,
      music-therapy/self-care, motivation to learn self-hypnosis/self-care in order to highlight
      the most efficient treatment for chronic pain. Furthermore, we will include another type of
      chronic pain i.e. cancer pain to understand if self-hypnosis/self-care's impact is different
      in the other type of chronic pain.

    <intervention_model_description>Each patients will have a medical consultation and will have to fill-in questionnaires (T0). After, patients will have to participate in a 5-session psycho-education programme. After, the care staff will have a multidisciplinary discussion and will randomize the participants to different treatment groups : self-hypnosis/self-care and music/self-care. Another group will be included but will not be randomized because it includes patients who demand to learn self-hypnosis/self-care (non-malignant and malignant pain). After, participants will receive a 7 months (2 hours session a month) learning program of self-hypnosis/self-care animated by a therapist specialized in hypnosis or music/self-care (identical procedure but the hypnosis is replaced by music) at the end if which they will complete the same questionnaire (T2). A follow-up at 6 (T3) and 12 (T4) months will also be conducted to account for any long term effect.</intervention_model_description>
