  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that a new infant formula for term infants
      supports age-appropriate growth. This study is designed in accordance with Good Clinical
      Practice guidelines and the requirements of the Code of Federal Regulations, 21CFR106.96. In
      this randomized, controlled trial (RCT), healthy, term, formula-fed (FF) infants will be
      randomized to one of two infant formulas: a standard, commercially-available infant formula
      for term infants (CF) or the study formula for term infants (SF) for 16 weeks. A reference
      group of human milk-fed infants will also be enrolled. The primary efficacy objective is to
      compare the growth of infants randomized to the study infant formula (SF) versus growth of
      infants randomized to the standard commercial infant formula (CF).
