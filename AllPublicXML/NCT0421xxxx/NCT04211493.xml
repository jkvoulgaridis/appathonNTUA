  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigates the acute psychological effects of a whole-body-workout using
      Electromyostimulation (EMS) in participants with depression and healthy individuals.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EMS-whole-body-workouts are less time-consuming and effort-intensive but generate physical
      effects which are comparable to conventional strength training. Therefore EMS could lower the
      barrier to physical activity. The present study focusses on acute psychological effects of an
      EMS workout - especially with regard to the reduction of depressive symptoms. Physical
      activity is notably important for patients with depression and shows multiple positive
      psychological and physical effects. But due to disease-related factors like lethargy,
      physical activity is far too rarely implemented. Therefore EMS-whole-body-workouts could
      provide an opportunity to generate positive psychological effects through a less (subjective)
      cost-intense strength training.

    <time_frame>From directly before the intervention to immediately after the intervention - both: before/after the EMS-training-session and before/after the Placebo-session</time_frame>
    <description>Depressive symptoms are measured using the State-Scale of the State-Trait Depression Scales (STDS) by Spaderna, Schmukle &amp; Krohne (2002). The SDTS State-Scale has two subscales with each 5 likert scaled items with values ranging from 1 to 4. Higher scores mean a worse outcome for the first subscale and a better outcome for the second subscale.</description>

    <time_frame>From directly before the intervention to immediately after the intervention - both: before/after the EMS-training-session and before/after the Placebo-session</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety symptoms are measured using the the State-Scale of the State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) by Laux, Glanzmann, Schaffner &amp; Spielberger (1981). The STAI State-Scale has 20 likert scaled items with values ranging from 1 to 4, higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>General self-efficacy is measured using the General-Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE) by Jerusalem &amp; Schwarzer (1981). The GSE has 10 likert scaled items with values ranging from 1 to 4, higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>

    <description>20 minutes whole-body-workout with simultaneous muscle stimulation (EMS).
Participants carry out easy whole-body-exercises while wearing a EMS-vest-belt-system with interwoven electrodes. During the workout the muscles are simultaneously stimulated by those external electrodes with medium level (5) of stimulation intensity.</description>

    <description>20 minutes whole-body-workout without simultaneous muscle stimulation (EMS).
Participants carry out easy whole-body-exercises while wearing a EMS-vest-belt-system with interwoven electrodes. During the workout they are stimulated with the lowest possible stimulation intensity (1). This is perceptible as a slight tingling sensation but the impulse intensity lies below the muscular threshold and therefore generates no muscular activity.</description>
