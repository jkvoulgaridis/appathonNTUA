  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although corticosteroids have been shown to be beneficial anecdotally for refractory
      epilepsy, the effects of corticosteroids on pediatric epilepsy have primarily been studied
      retrospectively amongst a heterogeneous patient population. The objective of this prospective
      cross-over study is to determine the effect of oral steroids on convulsive seizure frequency
      and evaluate the tolerability of pulsed oral steroids. Participants will be prospectively
      enrolled from pediatric neurology clinic at Children's Hospital of New Orleans, and baseline
      seizure frequency will be assessed. Participants will then be randomized to receive either
      the study drug, methylprednisolone, or placebo during the first month, followed by a
      one-month wash-out period. During the third month of the study, participants will enter the
      cross-over phase of the study where those who received methylprednisolone will receive
      placebo, and those who received placebo will receive methylprednisolone. The primary outcome
      will be the percentage of patients with 50% or more reduction in seizure frequency following
      one course of oral methylprednisolone. frequency following 1 course of oral
      methylprednisolone.
