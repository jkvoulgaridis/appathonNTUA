  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a two-step trial with 1) a safety run in part conducted in pediatric
      patients and 2) a Phase II part in adult and pediatric patients aiming to evaluate the safety
      and clinical activity of atezolizumab + cobimetinib in advanced/metastatic soft tissue
      sarcomas.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the proposed combination is as follows: cobimetinib via MEK1/2 inhibition
      could modify the tumor microenvironment and improve the response of T cells against tumor
      cells. Therefore, the addition of cobimetinib to atezolizumab may improve immune recognition
      and result in improved anti-tumour activity.

      The combination of cobimetinib and atezolizumab showed clinical activity in a Phase I trial
      in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (Atezolizumab 840 mg every 2 weeks and
      Cobimetinib 60 mg/d) with a disease control rate of 31%. Atezolizumab and cobimetinib are
      currently being tested in pediatrics in the iMatrix clinical trial with no major safety
      concerns to date.

      A molecular screening step is mandatory for all patients enrolled in this trial in order to
      document MAPK pathway status and Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) using FoundationOne test (FOne
      Heme).
