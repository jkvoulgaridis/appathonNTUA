  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, half of the participants will be asked to floss as normal, while the other
      half will receive professional instructions on flossing from a dentist. The investigators
      want to see if the participants who have professional flossing instructions are able to
      remove plaque in between the teeth more effectively, and have less gum bleeding over time.
      The investigators also want to see if participants who receive professional flossing
      instructions get better at the technique over time, and if they can match the dentist's skill
      by the end of the study.

      Primary Aim: To determine whether subjects instructed with a specific flossing technique have
      less gingival inflammation as evidenced by bleeding on probing (BoP) than subjects without
      flossing instructions.

      Secondary Aim: To compare the effect of flossing by a dental professional with a patient's
      self-flossing following instruction in removing interdental plaque.

      Secondary Aim: To compare the completeness of plaque removal by the subjects instructed
      during the initial visit (Group A [test]) with their completeness at the final (fourth)
      visit.

      Secondary Aim: To compare the clinician's completeness of plaque removal at the fourth visit
      with the completeness of plaque removal by the subjects in both groups (Groups A [test] and B
      [control]). Each group will be analyzed separately. In Group A, a comparison of the plaque
      removal by the subjects and by the clinician will made with respect to the completeness at
      the first visit versus the final visit.

    <description>The subjects chewed a Sunstar Butler GUMâ„¢ disclosing tablet, and once dissolved in the saliva they swished it in their mouth for 30 seconds. Then they expectorated and rinsed their mouth with water. A plaque index (Modified O'Leary Plaque Score Index Chart) was recorded in which the all teeth surface are stained using a plaque disclosing dye. Plaque was marked as whether present or absent interproximally only for each tooth (buccal and lingual surfaces).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least 18 years of age

          -  Subjects must show &gt; 20% interproximal sites (mesial facial and mesial lingual and
             distal facial and distal lingual) with BoP. This includes mesial and distal sites next
             to edentulous areas.

          -  Subjects must have &gt; 24 natural teeth including teeth with crowns with margins
             confluent with the natural tooth as long as they do not violate the biologic width.

          -  Third molars will be excluded from study; unless the third molars are in the
             anatomical position of second molars. However, subjects with third molars present will
             be accepted into the study unless there are other factors that exclude them.

          -  Subjects must report having had a professional dental prophylaxis within four months
             of beginning the study.

          -  Subjects must be willing to floss daily and to be taught and use a specific technique
             of flossing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who use tobacco products.

          -  Subjects with fixed or removable orthodontic appliances

          -  Subjects with splinted fixed prostheses.

          -  Subjects who are incapable of flossing their teeth

          -  Subjects with defective interproximal restorations or interproximal caries that are
             clinically evident and impacting gingival health.

          -  Subjects where malposed teeth preclude the use of floss

          -  Subjects with probing depth greater than or equal to 5mm.

          -  Subjects who are pregnant (self-reported) due to the greater bleeding tendency due to
             the hormonal changes.

          -  Subjects with a systemic disease that affects the gingiva or are taking medications of
             which affect the gingiva.

          -  Non-English speaking subjects, as study assessments and instructions will be in
             English only. There is no direct benefit to subjects for taking part in this study,
             therefore the exclusion of non-English speaking subjects is not an ethical concern.
