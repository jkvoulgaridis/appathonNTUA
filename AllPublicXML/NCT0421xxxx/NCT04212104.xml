  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is designed to find the effect of mukbang on dieters. Mukbang is an online
      eating broadcast where a host (Asian mukbangs generally feature a young and slim female host)
      consumes a large amount of food while chatting with audiences. Since some dieters watch
      mukbang to get satiation and control their appetites, the investigators proposed the
      hypothesis that mukbang could increase people's satiation level and decrease their desire to
      eat. To test this hypothesis, one randomized controlled study was conducted and female
      participants were randomly selected to watch either a mukbang or a non-food related video.
      Their desire to eat were reported and measured after the video.
