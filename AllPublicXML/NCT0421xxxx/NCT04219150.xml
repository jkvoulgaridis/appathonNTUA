    <textblock>
      The aim of this study will be to compare the fluid management in acute respiratory distress
      syndrome ARDS guided by electrical cardiometry (EC) versus the guidance with simplified
      conservative fluid protocol, Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial &quot;FACTT Lite&quot;. Group (A)
      consists of 35 patients: Fluid management in this group will follow a simplified conservative
      fluid protocol, &quot;FACTT Lite&quot; The FACTT Lite provided three possible instructions determined
      by the CVP and urine output: furosemide administration, fluid bolus, or no intervention.
      Group (B) consists of 35 patients: Fluid will be allowed according to an FTc-based fluids
      algorithm protocol and the type of bolus fluids will be determined according to Transthoracic
      fluid content (TFC), vasopressors and inotropes will be given according to reading of EC
      reading of systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and index of contractility (I CON).

    <description>Four sensors of EC will be applied : first approximately 5 cm above the base of the neck, second on the base of neck, third on the lower thorax at the level of the xiphoid and the fourth one on the lower thorax approximately 5 cm below the 3rd electrode at the level of anterior axillary line. The EC monitor (Electrical Cardiometry monitor, ICON Cardiotronics, Inc., La Jolla, CA 92307; Osyka Medical GmbH, Berlin, and Germany, model C3, serial number 1725303) will be connected to the sensor cable and the patient data will be fed. Corrected flow time (FTC) and stroke volume (SV) will be measured continuously in less than 30 seconds after placing the sensors and inputting the height and weight.</description>

    <description>The FACTT Lite provided three possible instructions determined by the CVP and urine output: furosemide administration, fluid bolus, or no intervention. FACTT Lite contained instructions to withhold furosemide until the patient achieved a mean arterial pressure greater than 60 mmHg off of vasopressors for at least 12 h.</description>
