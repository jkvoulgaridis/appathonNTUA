  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies have shown that non-fasting blood lipid levels are closely related to the
      occurrence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, but it is still unclear in the
      Chinese population. The purpose of the study is to investigate the association between
      non-fasting blood lipid levels and adverse outcomes in Chinese community population.

      Study population includes subjects who living in community, of any race or ethnicity, 18 or
      older years of age, and have provided written informed consent to provide biological sample
      at one or more study visits. Physical examination, questionnaire survey and biological sample
      collection will be conducted at baseline and the incidence of a composite of major adverse
      cardiovascular events will be investigated during follow-up.
