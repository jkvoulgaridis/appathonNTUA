  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most common reproductive disorder in women of
      childbearing age and is also associated with metabolic abnormalities including obesity, type
      2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, etc. Importantly, a number of adverse outcome are seen in
      pregnancies complicated by PCOS, including gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), preeclampsia
      and miscarriage. However, optimal management of PCOS complicated pregnancy is not known. This
      study seeks to explore whether healthy lifestyle intervention in overweight/obese pregnant
      women with PCOS could reduce gestational weight gain (GWG) and incidence of GDM.

      A randomized controlled trial in PCOS pregnant women will be initiated at 8-12 weeks of
      gestation util delivery. Participants will be randomly assigned to the control group
      (standard care) or the intervention group (intensive lifestyle intervention). The
      intervention will focus on restricting energy intake combined with behavioral lifestyle
      modification through participation in group sessions and individual counseling. The primary
      outcome will be GWG and secondary outcome will be the incidence of GDM.

      Our hypothesis is that intensive lifestyle intervention in overweight/obese pregnant women
      with PCOS will decrease GWG and reduce the incidence of GDM.

    <description>Intervention group: Intensive lifestyle intervention will be initiated from the first trimester (8-12wks) to delivery, with follow up every 2-4 weeks. Participants in the intervention group will be provided with an individualized dietary protocol with not less than 1500 calories per day in the first trimester and not less than 1800 calories per day after 13 weeks of gestation. Guidance on regular exercise is reinforced at the first and each follow up visit.</description>

    <description>Standard care group: Participants will receive a 1.5-hour group session in which standard prenatal intervention on diet, nutrition and physical activity and recommendation for gestational weight gain are reviewed by a registered dietitian. Thereafter, participants will receive their regularly scheduled follow up visits without additional lifestyle guidance.</description>
