    <textblock>
      This study is an observational study designed to adopt a cross-sectional study design. In the
      context of China's longevity town (East Asian population), Yongfu, Guangxi, the background of
      non-medical care and antibiotic use was explored, and the intestinal microecological balance
      increased with age and natural health. Longevity relationship. This study was completed using
      a household survey. Through routine clinical examinations and analysis of biochemical
      laboratory indicators, at the same time, a questionnaire for ADL(activities of daily living),
      cognitive function, and related elderly information was carried out on the elderly to
      comprehensively provide health information for each elderly. Based on the remaining stool
      samples and serum samples, the second-generation sequencing technology and other omics-based
      technologies were explored. No additional collection of human specimens and information is
      involved.

      In addition, this study also hopes to explore the transmission rules of age-related bacteria
      in long-lived families, and the relationship with health phenotypes such as blood sugar,
      blood lipids, and cognitive function. Potential impact. In summary, this study will provide
      data support for exploring the relationship between healthy longevity and intestinal
      microecological balance based on the characteristic population of the longevity hometown.

        The current study was based on the Longevity and Health of Aging Population in Guangxi
        China (LHAPGC) study conducted in Yongfu County (qualified as the longevity town by
        Geriatric Society of China) in 2016.The enrolled subjects do not rely on medical care and
        do not take antibiotics recently. They are representative of a natural healthy-aging
        population model .
