  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this protocol, the investigators hypothesize that modifying the process of producing CAR+
      T-cells can help to improve responses and reduce toxicities. Building on previous in vitro
      studies that have shown successful production of CAR+ T-cells using a new production
      approach, the investigators are now studying the ability to produce these CAR+ T-cells and
      determine how well they work in the clinical setting.

      Autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) will be obtained by leukapheresis over
      one day and the cells will be transduced with an in house designed CAR retroviral vector.
      Participants will receive daily intravenous (IV) infusion of lymphodepleting regimen of
      fludarabine and cyclophosphamide for total of 3 days (Days -5, -4, -3). The dose of
      cyclophosphamide will be given at 500mg/m2. The dose of fludarabine will be given at 30mg/m2.
      Participants will receive the CAR transduced T cells IV infusion in the BMT Inpatient Unit
      and remain admitted for close monitoring for at least the first 7 days following the cell
      infusion (D0 to Day +7), possibly longer if any side effects are encountered. The CAR
      transduced T cells will be escalated from 1 x 106 transduced T cells/kg (± 20%) to 2 x 106
      transduced T cells/kg (± 20%) in a Phase I design, based on toxicity. Once discharged from
      the inpatient unit, for the next 7 days (Day +8 to Day +14) the patients will be evaluated in
      the High Dose Unit (labs and physical exam) to screen for toxicities.
