  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Somatosensory evoked potentials corresponds to a neurophysiological exam that studies the
      functioning of the sensitivity pathways. It is often complementary to the imaging examination
      (MRI or scanner) and the electroneuromyogram which studies only the peripheral part of the
      sensory and motor pathways while the somatosensory evoked potentials are interested in their
      central and peripheral component.

      The studied information are the potentials generated in the nervous system by the
      presentation of sensory stimulation. The examination makes it possible to study conduction
      times which will be defined as normal or pathological according to standards established on
      control subjects. Their indication is multiple: study of the repercussions of cervical
      osteoarthritis, specify the diagnosis of certain neuropathies, study of the conduction
      pathways at the medullary level in the event of trauma or inflammatory or other lesion.

      In our study, the investigators will only be interested in the somatosensory evoked
      Potentials.

      A study has shown that hypnotic suggestions to reduce the unpleasantness of pain triggered by
      thermal stimulation lead to a selective reduction of activity in the anterior cingulate
      cortex without modifying the activation of the somesthetic cortex.

      Pain is, like all sensory stimulation, subject to the influences of attention, anticipation,
      mental imagery, previous conditioning. The fronto-cingular areas, activated by analgesics
      such as morphine, or by cortical stimulation are the same as those used by non-drug
      techniques such as hypnosis.

      Therapeutic hypnosis is &quot;a relational experience bringing into play physiological and
      psychological mechanisms allowing the individual to live better, reduce or eliminate an acute
      or chronic painful pathology&quot; (Definition of Doctor Jean Marc Benhaiem).

      The study of somatosensory evoked Potentials is a long examination (90 to 120 minutes), which
      can be uncomfortable for the patient (patient lying down, immobile and relaxed), not having
      to contract his muscles, especially if he is already painful due to his pathology or if it is
      difficult for him to remain motionless in the supine position. It is indeed necessary to
      average around 600 to 1000 responses (number of averages) to a small electrical simulation on
      each member studied.

      The muscular contractions of an anxious and/or painful patient prolong the duration of the
      examination or even disturb the results, to the point of making it impossible to interpret
      the examination.

      To our knowledge, hypnosis has already been used to improve muscle relaxation and reduce
      anxiety and pain during electromyograms, but hypnosis has never been used to improve the
      outcome of somatosensory evoked Potentials. Furthermore, if hypnosis modifies certain late
      cortical waves, it does not cause modification of the early waves and therefore does not
      disturb the results expected in our clinical practice.

    <description>As part of this research, the patient must complete a pain scale and a Spielberger Stay-A anxiety self-assessment questionnaire before the PES examination. Hypno-relaxation is induced by following VAKOG: external sensory identification, fixation of attention, bodily sensation, breathing, sensory perceptions, closing of the eyes. The work phase follows induction and allows deepening of the hypnotic trance. It corresponds to a metaphorical narrative associated with post-hypnotic suggestions and is fueled by the construction of suggestions and metaphors. The protocol is adapted to each patient. The investigator who remains present throughout the duration of the examination, maintains a hypnotic, empathetic, attentive attitude, and makes it possible to recover this material. The investigator, thanks to hypnosis, allows the development of a creative imagination which allows a modification of the relation to space and time.</description>
