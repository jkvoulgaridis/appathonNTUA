  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oocyte retrieval procedure for in vitro fertilization is a source of anxiety for patients.
      Local anaesthesia or sedation are commonly used to manage many situations of anxiety,
      including the oocyte retrieval. However, this sedation should be as mild as possible in order
      to preserve oocytes.

      HappyMed Video Glasses are a recent medical device that allows the immersion of patients in
      films, cartoons or concerts. By distracting patients, this technology can reduce anxiety,
      discomfort and ultimately pain associated with care.

      This randomized monocentric trial compares audiovisual distraction versus usual care for the
      management of anxiety and pain related to oocyte retrieval.

      Hypothesis of this study is that the audiovisual distraction carried out with the HappyMed
      Video Glasses reduces the use of sedative drugs during oocyte retrieval while ensuring a
      better comfort and a faster walking ability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consent female patients between 18 and 43 years old scheduled for oocyte retrieval will be
      enrolled in this study and their anxiety level will be collected via a questionnaire.

      After randomization, patients will either benefit from audiovisual distraction using HappyMed
      Video Glasses, (medical device with CE marking), or from the usual management during
      procedure. The anaesthesiologist will check that no anxiolytic or sedative drug was given 12
      hours before anaesthesia. The patients will be stratified according to whether or not a
      previous intervention was performed. Anaesthesia will be started and maintained with
      administration of sufentanil (0.1 μg/kg) and propofol (using the Dixon's up-and-down method).
      The aim is a patient who spontaneously ventilates and does not react to gynaecological
      stimulation. Prevention of postoperative pain and nausea/vomiting will be carried out at the
      initiation of the surgical procedure. The effect of these drugs is longer than the
      intervention duration and will not influence the protocol.
