    <textblock>
      The purpose of this survey is to examine the safety of adult patients with relapsed or
      refractory CD30-positive peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) (excluding anaplastic large cell
      lymphoma (ALCL)) and pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive PTCL or
      Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) in the actual use of on concomitant Brentuximab Vedotin in routine
      clinical practice.

      The drug being tested in this survey is called Brentuximab Vedotin intravenous infusion 50
      mg. This intravenous infusion is being tested to treat adult patients with relapsed or
      refractory CD30-positive peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) (excluding anaplastic large cell
      lymphoma (ALCL)) and pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive PTCL or
      Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).

      This survey is an observational (non-interventional) study and will look at the safety of
      adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive PTCL (excluding ALCL) and pediatric
      patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive PTCL or HL in the routine clinical
      setting. The number of observed patients will be approximately 86 as total (80; Adult
      participants and 6; Pediatric participants).

      This multi-center observational survey will be conducted in Japan.

    <description>Best response is defined as the cumulative numbers of participants who achieve each level of best response including complete response (CR), complete response uncertain (CRu) (when no positron emission tomography [PET] data are available), partial response (PR), Stable Disease (SD), and Progressive Disease (PD) after treatment. Best response will be assessed by Cheson 2010 Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma. PET and Computed Tomography (CT) will be used in cancer diagnosis and treatment.</description>

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
