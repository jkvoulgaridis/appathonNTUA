  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a Phase I, open-label, dose-finding and cohort expansion study to
      determine the safety and preliminary efficacy of APR-246 in combination with venetoclax and
      azacitidine in patients with myeloid malignancies.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll adult male and female patients of age ≥ 18 years with documented
      diagnosis of AML, according to WHO classification, and documented TP53 mutation which is not
      benign or likely benign, who also meet the eligibility requirements of this protocol.

      The study will include a safety lead-in dose-finding portion followed by expansion portion.
      During the safety lead-in portion of the study, two cohorts will independently enroll
      patients following a 3 + 3 design. Each cohort will enroll up to 6 patients.

      The expansion portion will begin once the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of APR-246 in
      combination with venetoclax and in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine have been
      determined in order to assess the antitumor activity of these combinations.
