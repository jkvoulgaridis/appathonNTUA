  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a retro-prospective 12 month follow-up study of the safety and performance of the
      Round XTENDOBUTTON™ fixation device post knee repair in Australian centres.

      The Primary Objective is to assess successful fixation with the Round XTENDOBUTTON™ and the
      Secondary Objective is to generate safety and performance evidence for the Round
      XTENDOBUTTON™ Device via the collection of functional outcomes, patient reported outcomes and
      safety data.

      Forty subjects will be enrolled; who have had the round XTENDOBUTTON™ Device implanted. To
      eliminate the potential for selection bias, Investigators will consecutively screen all
      subjects who have undergone knee/ligament repair/reconstruction using the Round XTENDOBUTTON™
      Fixation Device. Subjects meeting the eligibility criteria will be contacted regarding
      interest in study participation. Screening will be conducted in sequential order based on the
      date of subjects' knee repair procedure; earliest to latest. Screening efforts must be
      documented on a screening and enrollment log, on which reasons for exclusion from or denial
      to participate should be noted A medical chart review will be conducted to identify potential
      study subjects who have been implanted with the ROUND XTENDOBUTTON™ device at the study site.

        1. If a patient is eligible and would like to participate in the study, obtain written
           informed consent from the subject as detailed in Section 7.5 ----- Do not proceed until
           consent has been obtained -----

        2. Assign the subject a Subject ID number and instruct the subject on treatment procedures

        3. Complete Screening and Enrollment Log

        4. Obtain demographic information and medical history, including information on all
           relevant concomitant medications

        5. Collect operative information and implant disposition (including review of evidence of
           implant failure). If a failure has occurred, record details of the cause of failure.
           Collect x-rays if available.

        6. Complete Patient Questionnaires:

             -  Lysholm Score

             -  Tegner Activity Scale

             -  KOOS(Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) Knee Score

        7. If any adverse events, adverse device effects or device deficiencies are observed or
           reported, they must be recorded as instructed in Section 12

        8. Instruct the subject on follow-up procedures, including returning for Visit 2 in 6
           months (-7 Days/+14 Days)

      Visit 2 - 12 months post -op.

        1. Query subject regarding any changes in general health and the use of concomitant
           medications since the last visit

        2. If any adverse events, adverse device effects or device deficiencies are observed or
           reported, they must be recorded as instructed in Section 12

        3. Complete Lysholm Score, Tegner Activity Scale and KOOS Knee Score

        4. Collect implant disposition information (including review of evidence of implant
           failure). If a failure has occurred, record details of the cause of failure. Collect
           x-rays if available

        5. Complete End of Study CRF.

      Safety will be evaluated by assessing the frequency and nature of adverse events, serious
      adverse events and revisions.

    <description>The fixation success at 6 months post knee operation with the XTENDOBUTTON™ device. The Kaplan-Meier product limit survival estimates will be presented up to 6 months post-op along with the associated 95% confidence intervals. The event of interest will be fixation failure, defined as a revision due to a device failure, by 6 months.</description>

    <measure>Lysholm Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Lysholm Scale evaluates the outcomes of knee ligament surgery. The Lysholm Scale currently consists of eight items that measure: pain (25 points), instability (25 points), locking (15 points), swelling (10 points), limp (5 points), stair climbing (10 points), squatting (5 points), and need for support (5 points). The total score is the sum of each response to the eight questions, and may range from 0-100. Higher scores indicate a better outcome with fewer symptoms or disability</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tegner Activity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 &amp; 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Tegner activity scale was designed as a score of activity level to complement other functional scores for patients with ligamentous injuries. The Tegner activity scale is a numerical scale ranging from 0 to 10. Each value indicates the ability to perform specific activities. An activity level of 10 corresponds to participation in competitive sports, including soccer, football, and rugby at the elite level; an activity level of 6 points corresponds to participation in recreational sports; and an activity level of 0 is assigned if a person is on sick leave or receiving a disability pension because of knee problems. An activity level of 5 to 10 is recorded only if the patient participates in recreational or competitive sports.</description>
