    <textblock>
      Anthracyclines combined with cyclophosphamide or taxane-containing regimens may cause nail
      pigmentation which reduces quality of life in breast cancer patients. We conducted this study
      to investigate nail pigmentation and other skin changes associated with these drugs and aim
      to evaluate the effect of ice water immersion of hands on nail pigmentation. The first phase
      is an observational study. Breast cancer patients who received anthracyclines combined with
      cyclophosphamide or taxane-containing regimens for adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy are
      enrolled. The second phase is a prospective phase II study. Early breast cancer patients who
      plan to receive these drugs for adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy are treated with ice water
      immersion of the left hands while their right hands serve as control. The primary end point
      is the degree of nail pigmentation. The other end points are the incidence of nail
      pigmentation in both hands, the degree and the incidence of onycholysis, the time from the
      first chemotherapy to the occurrence of nail pigmentation/onycholysis, the recovery of nail
      pigmentation/onycholysis, and patient comfort.

      Anthracyclines combined with cyclophosphamide or taxane-containing regimens are commonly used
      for adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. However, these drugs may
      cause nail pigmentation which reduces quality of life in patients. We conducted this study to
      investigate nail pigmentation and other skin changes associated with anthracyclines in
      combination with cyclophosphamide or taxane-containing regimens in breast cancer patients who
      received adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Besides, we aim to evaluate the effect of ice
      water immersion of hands on nail pigmentation caused by chemotherapy.

      The first phase is an observational study. Breast cancer patients who received anthracyclines
      combined with cyclophosphamide or taxane-containing regimens for adjuvant or neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy were followed up until six months after the last course of chemotherapy. The
      second phase is a prospective phase II study. Early breast cancer patients who plan to
      receive anthracyclines combined with cyclophosphamide or taxane-containing regimens for
      adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy are treated with ice water immersion of the left hands
      while their right hands serve as control. The primary end point is the degree of nail
      pigmentation. The other end points are the incidence of nail pigmentation in both hands, the
      degree and the incidence of onycholysis, the time from the first chemotherapy to the
      occurrence of nail pigmentation/onycholysis, the recovery of nail pigmentation/onycholysis,
      and patient comfort.
