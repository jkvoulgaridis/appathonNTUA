  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 4 weeks and at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>EDE-Q measures symptoms of eating disorder. It contains at total of 36 items. 23 of these are rated on a Likert scale between 0-6 and contains 4 subscales: Restraint (ranging from 0-30); Eating concern (ranging from 0-30); shape concern (ranging from 0-48); weight concern (ranging from 0-30). Higher scores indicating more difficulties with eating disorder. In addition, 11 open ended questions concern binge eating and compensating behaviors.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Body Attitude Test (BAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 4 weeks and at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>BAT measures attitudes toward one own body. It contains a total of 20 items that are rated on a Likert scale between 0-5. Total scores range from 0-100. Higher scores indicate more problems with body attitude.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 4 weeks and at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>BSQ measures dissatisfaction with one's own body/figure. It contains a total of 34 items, which are rated on a Likert scale ranging from 1-6. total scores range from 34-204, with higher scores indicating more dissatisfaction.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Figure Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 4 weeks and at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Figure Rating Scale measures body image and estimation of one's own body size. Each figure presents nine schematic silhouettes, ranging from extreme thinness (1) to extreme obesity (9). For research purposes, participants are asked to self-select the silhouette that best indicates his or her current body size (ranging from 1-9) and the silhouette that reflects his or her ideal body size (ranging from 1-9).</description>
