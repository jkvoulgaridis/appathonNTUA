  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective monocentric &quot; before and after &quot; study, ruled in 2 periods of 3 months : during
      the first period, the patient will adjust insulin treatment as usual, during the second
      period, the patient will adjust insulin treatment with IRTA support

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Freestyle Libre® continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system may improve glycemic control.
      However, this system contributes to the complexity of insulin adjustment by the diversity of
      the data delivered by CGM system.

      Insulin Real-Time Advisor (IRTA©), a decision support software, has been developed in order
      to guide patients in the adaptation of their treatment according to CGM data. IRTA© provides
      advice applicable to thousand situations according to six parameters: glucose level, trend
      arrows, meals, physical activity, before bedtime, time since the previous bolus.

      Type of advice :

        -  Insulin injection (carb and correction)

        -  To continue treatment without modification

        -  To lower the insulin dose (temporary basal rate)

        -  Sugar intake advice

        -  Glucose level control with CGM, self-monitor blood glucose, blood ketones monitor

        -  To change catheter for patients treated by insulin pump.
