    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to determine the effects of constraint induced
      movement therapy CIMT and BIM bimanual activities on functional outcome in hemiplegic CP. Two
      randomized groups of patients with CP are treated with constrained arm for three hours on
      affected side and bimanual activities on BIM group respectively. Both, male and female
      patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be included. Patients having concurrent
      malignancy, infection, trauma or any bony deformity will be excluded.

      It is a Randomized control trial. Cerebral palsy children of age groups of 5 yrs to 12 years
      were included in the study with total sample size of thirty eight (38) with confidence
      interval of 95%. Simple random sampling was done by lottery method and data was collected
      from ALFARABI special school of education Islamabad. Two groups were formed and named as
      group A; CIMT with nineteen participants and group B, BIM bimanual training with nineteen
      participants respectively. The RCT compared the functional outcome of 3 hours constraining
      for 3 times a week for 6 weeks duration for CIMT group and five bimanual activities performed
      for three hours a day for bimanual group B and were assessed on the pretest and post test
      score evaluation of QUEST and JTHF test. All the participants were hemiplegic cp from both
      gender, fall on MAC system level II. Treatment for three hours was done on alternate days for
      3 days a week. Five bimanual activites of holding a tray, cutting a fruit with knife,
      buttoning, cutting paper with scissor, and carry heavy objects with both hands are applied.
      Whereas the activities performed in CIMT are brushing teeth, holding spoon, fork combing hair
      and writing. Forty five children were screened before the evaluation and as a result 38 were
      enrolled in both groups having 19 in each group.

    <description>Quality of upper extremity skills test or QOL quality of life. This scoring includes dissociated movements, grasps, weight bearing and protected extension. This scoring helps the therapist to determine which functional limitations needs to be addressed for better flexion extension abduction and other related movements to improve quality of life . It includes 36 items to be tested and thirty to forty minutes to apply and assess the test.</description>

    <measure>JEBSEN Hand Function Test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The JEBSEN Hand Function Test was designed to provide a comprehensive, objective test of hand function for actions of daily living. It has 7 items and takes approximately 15-45 minutes to administer. 7 items include: writing, turning over 3-by-5 inch cards, picking up small common objects, stacking checkers, simulated feeding, picking up large light objects and picking up large heavy objects. The results are calculated by timing the time taken to complete each task. The tests are always presented in the same order and are performed with the non-dominant hand first</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Manual ability classification</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Manual Ability Classification System (MACS) describes how children with (CP) use their hands to carry objects in daily routine. MAC describes 5 levels. These levels are based on the children's self-initiated ability to handle objects and their need for assistance or adaptation to perform manual activities in everyday life. The MACS also describe differences between adjacent levels to make it easier to determine which level best corresponds with the child's capability to handle objects. The objects are relevant and age-appropriate for the children, used when they perform tasks such as eating, dressing, playing, drawing or writing. Etc.</description>

    <description>Constrained on more affected side for three hours. To minimize the learned non use in hemiplegic CIMT is applied and criteria of applying CIMT is;
10 degrees active wrist extension on the affected hand,
10 degrees active thumb abduction,
10 ยบ active extension of any two digits on the side or hand which is limited due to damage.
In order to gain the maximum good results from CIMT technique following points should also be considered attentively. Affected arm should move to 45 degrees shoulder flexion and abduction, and 90 degrees of elbow flexion and extension.
Constrained with cotton sling. 3 to 5 upper limb functional activities like
using fork or a spoon,
combing hair
brushing teeth
