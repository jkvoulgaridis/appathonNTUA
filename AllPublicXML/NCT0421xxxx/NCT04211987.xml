  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fast-track total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a well-established concept including optimized
      logistics and evidence-based treatment, focusing on minimizing surgical stress and improved
      post-operative recovery. The aim of this protocol is to compare the standard care and fast
      track total hip arthroplasties in terms of functional and subjective outcomes, hospital
      staying, number of transfusions and analgesic consumption.

      The aim of this protocol is to compare standard care and fast track total hip arthroplasties.
      The fast track care consists of:

        -  preoperative educational lesson in which orthopedic surgeon, anesthesiologist and
           physiotherapist illustrate the operative and post operative path to the patients

        -  antalgic protocol administered only orally

        -  early rehabilitation care. The day of the surgical operation, the physiotherapist helps
           the patient reach the upright position. The standard care consists of usual antalgic and
           physiotherapy post-operative care:

        -  Antalgic protocol consist in intravenous drugs

        -  the first physiotherapy session is the day after surgery

    <description>Early functional outcomes are collecting using Lowa Level of Assistance(ILOA) during the third post-operative day.
This scale is able to provide data on the autonomy reached by the patient in the first postoperative period going to investigate five main motor activities (get up from supine to seated, from sitting to standing position, walk around, take three steps, the speed of walking). the total score can vary from 0 to 50, where 50 indicates better functional results.</description>
