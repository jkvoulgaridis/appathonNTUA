  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the effect of the splint and rigid taping on the muscle
      activation of the upper trapezius muscle during computer typing tasks in office workers.

      The study will be conducted on 10 healthy office workers. The study subjects will be asked to
      type on a computer for 5 minutes (1) without splint or taping, (2) with a splint and (3) with
      rigid taping which limits the wrist flexion at the dominant side. The upper trapezius muscle
      activation will be recorded by surface EMG during the task. The mean values will be
      normalized according to Maximum Voluntary Isometric Contraction (MVIC) and %MVIC values.

    <measure>Measurement of Muscle Activation for Control Group</measure>
    <time_frame>It will be recorded at baseline for MVIC and 1 minute after baseline while performing the 5-minute typing task on computer for %MVIC</time_frame>
    <description>Surface Electromyography (sEMG) device will be used for measurement of muscle activation. The electrodes going to be placed according to the SENIAM criteria(1). First, the MVIC will be performed by each individual in the manual muscle testing position. 6 seconds MVIC will be measured with 3 repetitions and a 3-minute rest period going to be given. The highest value of the three measurements will be recorded as MVIC. The computer task consists of typing 300-word text for 5 minutes. Individuals will be instructed about the typing task and to be seated comfortably and as close to screen as possible. The 5-minute typing task will be performed without orthosis or taping. The upper trapezius muscle activation will be recorded with the sEMG. The number of words participants wrote will be noted. To prevent muscle fatigue, a resting period of 5 minutes will be given. The mean values (mV) during the writing task with sEMG will be normalized according to MVIC and %MVIC values will be determined.</description>
