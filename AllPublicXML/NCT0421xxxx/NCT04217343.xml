  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart Transplant recipients at Tampa General Hospital heart transplant program who have
      pAMR1(H+) or pAMR1(I+) rejection will have a DD-cfDNA /GEP sample obtained at the time of the
      rejection. The DD-cfDNA/GEP will then be drawn every month post treatment for the rejection
      until the DD-cfDNA/GEP level returns to normal. A total of fifteen recipients with pAMR1(H+)
      and fifteen recipients with pAMR1(I+) rejection will be included in the study which will last
      two years. The presence of HLA antibodies (DSA's) and the titers, presence of Autoantibodies,
      the measurement of cytokines IL2, IL4, IL6, IL 10, IL 17, TNF alpha, TGF beta, the presence
      of coronary artery vasculopathy, the time from transplant to the onset of the episode of AMR,
      time to resolution, the response to treatment and comparison to the DD-cfDNA/GEP level with
      pAMR2 and pAMR 3 rejections will be analyzed.
