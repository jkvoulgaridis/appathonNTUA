    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of anlotinib in combination with nivilumab as
      second-line treatment in advanced NSCLC patients. The primary endpoint of the study is
      progression-free survival (PFS);the secondary endpoints are disease control rate (DCR),
      objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS) and safety.
