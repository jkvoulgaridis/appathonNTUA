  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates and addresses challenges to implementing an acupuncture intervention for
      adults who have headaches after sustaining a moderate traumatic brain injury. Eligible
      participants will be recruited from Seattle and the surrounding areas to receive weekly
      acupuncture for 12 consecutive weeks. Participants will complete questionnaires to assess
      headache impact, depression, health-related quality of life, and cognitive function at the
      beginning of the study and every two weeks for the duration of the study. Participants will
      participate in structured interviews after the study for their views on the acceptability and
      tolerability of the study protocol.
