  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, open-label, multicenter study to compare the efficacy and safety of ATRA plus
      high-dose dexamethasone compared to high-dose dexamethasone monotherapy for the first-line
      treatment of adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are undertaking a parallel group, multicenter, randomized controlled trial
      of 240 adults with ITP in China. Patients were randomized to ATRA+ high-dose dexamethasone
      and high-dose dexamethasone monotherapy group. Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms
      were evaluated before and after treatment. Adverse events are also recorded throughout the
      study. Interim analysis was scheduled at 50% through recruitment. In order to report the
      efficacy and safety of ATRA plus high-dose dexamethasone for the first-line treatment of
      adults with ITP.
