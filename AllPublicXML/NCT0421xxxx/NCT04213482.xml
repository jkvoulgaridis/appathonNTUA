    <textblock>
      This study evaluated pediatric oncology patients in terms of quality of bone and determine
      any relation between bone quality and radiotherapy/chemotherapy. The alternative hypothesis
      is that the bone quality of the oncology patients who received radiotherapy/chemotherapy is
      lower than the control group.

      Cancer is the abnormal and uncontrolled proliferation of certain tissues in the body for a
      reason that cannot be determined yet. Childhood cancers occur between 0-17 years of age, and
      follow-up and treatment of these patients are performed in pediatric oncology services.
      Diagnosis in childhood cancers can be made by clinical examination as well as blood tests and
      examination of tissue samples. There are also some imaging methods used for diagnosis;
      ultrasonography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission
      tomography / computed tomography (PET / CT).

      Treatment methods in childhood cancers are as follows; surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy
      and stem cell transplantation. Once diagnosed, oncologists and surgeons may choose one of
      these treatment options by mutual consultation or decide on a treatment method. Fractal
      analysis is a numerical as fractal dimension. Trabeculae are thin columns with numerous large
      spaces that give a honeycomb or spongy appearance of cancellous bone, which is also called
      trabecular bone or spongy bone. Previously, fractal analysis has been reported as a useful
      method to detect various diseases that affect the trabecular bone structure. Particularly in
      the field of dentistry, studies have shown that fractal analysis by the box-counting method
      can successfully evaluate trabecular changes in the mandible of patients with osteoporosis
      and periodontal diseases and in lactating women.
