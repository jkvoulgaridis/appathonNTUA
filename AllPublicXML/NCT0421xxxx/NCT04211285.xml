      The aim of this study is to design and assess the accuracy of administering the electronic
      Geriatric Assessment Bundle (e-GAB) compared to geriatrician performed comprehensive
      geriatric assessment (CGA) in a group of Egyptian elderly. The development of an Arabic
      software platform for CGA can improve the clinical practice by providing a valid user
      friendly tool to collect and analyze data for geriatric patients attending non- Geriatric
      health care service.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Modern geriatric care is based primarily on the concept of multidisciplinary approach of
      elderly care. This could be achieved by integrating CGA in different disciplines dealing with
      the older patient. CGA is different from that of the standard medical evaluation; it is a
      systematic evaluation of frail older adults. It uses combinations of validated geriatric
      tools to formulate an inventory of health problems, and develop an individualized geriatric
      intervention plan.

      The software platform for CGA has been widely used in western countries; however, tools that
      can fit patients with different backgrounds should be implemented..

      From the initial pool of 3 potential subtests, four experienced geriatricians developed a
      bundle of 15 subtests, to evaluate cognition, mood, vision, hearing, urinary continence,
      nutrition, functional capacity, fall risk and balance impairment, frailty, polypharmacy,
      sleep, pain, home safety, and social problems. Moreover, a rapid survey of medical and
      surgical conditions was obtained.

      Initial evaluation of these subsets compared to the reference standard CGA was done. Each
      patient completed the bundle then underwent CGA by an experienced geriatrician blinded to the
      result of e-GAB
