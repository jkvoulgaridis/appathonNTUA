  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project, the investigator will test the effect of augmenting an evidence based joint
      attention intervention (JASPER) with a motor-sound system intervention (PROMPT) compared to
      JASPER only on speech and language outcomes. The investigator will model change over a year
      to determine the percentage of children who cross the hurdle from single words to word
      combinations by Kindergarten. The proposed research will foster the understanding of the
      mechanisms underlying speech heterogeneity in ASD, thereby ultimately contributing to the
      development of more personalized, efficacious interventions.

      Upon qualification to the study (after entry assessments), the child will be randomized to
      receive JASPER alone (play-based intervention) or JASPER plus PROMPT (both play-based and
      speech-based interventions). The active intervention will last for 12 weeks, 60 minute
      sessions twice a week. There are assessments scheduled at entry (6.5 hours), end of study
      (exit-2.5 hours), 3 month follow up (2 hours), and when the child turns 6 years of age (2
      hours). The total time commitment per participant is 37 hours.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children will be recruited through local school districts and early intervention service
      providers, approximately 20 children per year for a total of 80 children. Parents interested
      in the study will call the lab and be screened. If children pass the screen, they will be
      invited to go to UCLA for a series of assessments. The process will take 2-3 days. The
      following assessments and data will be collected: ADOS-2, ADI-R, Mullen Scales of Early
      Learning (MSEL), Demographic &amp; Medical Questionnaires, Vineland-III Interview, ELSA Language
      Sample, PLS-5,SPA, Repetitive Behaviors RBS-R, SSP, ABC-2, ESCS, BOSCC, KSPT, EEG, and saliva
      sample. Eligibility for the study will then evaluated. Each child's clinical diagnosis of ASD
      will be validated by administration of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 (ADOS-2)
      and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) by a research-reliable lab staff.
      Children will participate in a language sample (eligible if &lt; 20 words), and the Mullen
      Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) to evaluate nonverbal mental age (eligible if &gt; 12 months).

      After qualifying to the study, the screening data will be entered into Biostatistics and
      Epidemiology Data Analytics Center (BEDAC), secured website. Randomization will then occur.
      Children will be randomly assigned to one of two intervention options: JASPER + PROMPT versus
      JASPER only.

      JASPER is a naturalistic, developmental, behavioral intervention (NDBI) that focuses on
      developing social communication and language skills in the context of a play based
      intervention.

      Intervening on oral motor skills may improve speech. In Los Angeles, a fairly common
      community intervention delivered by certified speech language pathologists (SLP) is Prompts
      for Restructuring Oral Muscular Phonetic Targets (PROMPT). PROMPT has a growing evidence base
      among a number of clinical populations with language delays related to oral motor deficits
      (although not ASD).

        1. JASPER only: Child will receive 2, 60 minute sessions per week at UCLA. or

        2. JASPER + PROMPT: Child will receive 2, 60 minute sessions per week at Santa Monica's
           SSLP, Inc.

      Recruitment, screening assessments, consents, and treatment will occur in this Santa Monica
      location for this group. All these procedures will be done by the UCLA staff, except the
      PROMPT treatment. PROMPT will be done by the SLPs in the Scheflen Speech-Language Pathology,
      Inc.

      All assessments, consent forms, measures, recruitment material will be the same for both
      conditions.

      Interventions will occur for 12 weeks, 3 months. After the 3 months, there will be exit
      assessments (ELSA Language Sample, PLS-5, ESCS, BOSCC and EEG). There will also be assessment
      follow up at 3-months post exit, and when the child turns 6 years of age. The following
      assessments will be done at these time points: ELSA Language Sample, ESCS, BOSCC, PLS-5 at 3
      mo-FU and ELSA Language Sample, ESCS, BOSCC, PLS-5 when child turns 6.

    <description>SPA-R is designed to obtain the child's highest levels of spontaneous play acts. The child is presented with 5 different play sets by the experimenter; the entire play interaction last about 15-20 minutes. The child's play behaviors are videotaped and later coded. The variables of interest include the frequency of child initiated functional and symbolic play acts and also the count of different novel types of acts. This measure has shown excellent reliability and validity across a range of studies (Kasari et al., 2006; Sigman &amp; Ruskin, 1999; Sigman &amp; Ungerer, 1984).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children meeting ADOS-2 and ADI-R criteria for ASD

          -  age 48-66 months

          -  have had &gt; 3 months of early intervention/preschool (to ensure that children already
             have been exposed to some community interventions)

          -  walked prior to 24 months

          -  use &lt; 20 functional words (i.e., non-echoed, non-scripted). Number of functional
             spoken words will be totaled in a language sample assessment. The functional word
             criterion is based on a 2010 NIH workgroup definition of 'minimally verbal' in
             school-aged children. The same definition may also apply to younger children with
             limited language.

          -  stable medication over the past 6 months

          -  nonverbal mental age of &gt;12 months on the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (visual
             reception and fine motor subscales).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  We will exclude children who are deaf, blind or with cerebral palsy.

          -  We will not exclude on the basis of known genetic disorder associated with ASD (ex:
             TSC), but expect few will actually participate, in part due to rarity of these
             disorders, and because for some there are other trials available at UCLA (ex: TSC).

          -  We will exclude children in other intervention trials; in other words, we will not
             double enroll children into intervention trials.
