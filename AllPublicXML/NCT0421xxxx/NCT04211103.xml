      This is a single arm phase II trial evaluating Pembrolizumab single agent as neoadjuvant
      treatment before surgical conization and/or partial or radical vulvectomy in patients with
      pre-neoplastic cervical and vulvar high grade lesions. Patients with histologically confirmed
      H-SIL and/or VIN 2-3 lesions will be treated with Pembrolizumab 200 mg flat dose every 3
      weeks for 5 cycles. Within 3 weeks from the last Pembrolizumab administration patients will
      be submitted to surgical conization or partial or radical vulvectomy.

             lesions will be enrolled in this study.

          2. A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant, not
             breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies:

               1. Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) OR

               2. A WOCBP who agrees to follow the contraceptive guidance during the treatment

             informed consent for the trial.

          4. Have provided archival tumor tissue sample (if pre treatment biopsy performed at other
             institution) or newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of the lesion.
             Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks are preferred to slides. Newly
             obtained biopsies are preferred to archived tissue.

             Note: If submitting unstained cut slides, newly cut slides should be submitted to the
             testing laboratory within 14 days from the date slides are cut.

          5. Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1.
             Evaluation of ECOG is to be performed within 7 days prior to the date of registration
             .

          6. Have adequate organ function as defined in the following table (Table 1). Specimens

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A WOCBP who has a positive urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to study drug
             treatment. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum
             pregnancy test will be required.

             Note: in the event that 72 hours have elapsed between the screening pregnancy test and
             the first dose of study treatment, another pregnancy test (urine or serum) must be
             performed and must be negative in order for subject to start receiving study
             medication.

          2. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or antiPDL2 agent or with an
             agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (eg, CTLA-4,
             OX40, CD137).

          3. Has received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy including investigational agents
             within 4 weeks [could consider shorter interval for kinase inhibitors or other short
             half-life drugs] prior to [randomization /allocation].

             Note: Participants must have recovered from all AEs due to previous therapies to
             ≤Grade 1 or baseline. Participants with ≤Grade 2 neuropathy may be eligible.

             Note: If participant received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from
             the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting study
             treatment.

          4. Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study treatment.
             Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require
             corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted
             for palliative radiation (≤2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-CNS disease.

          5. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug.
             Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles,
             mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus
             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza
             vaccines (eg, FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.

          6. Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational
             agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of
             study treatment.

             Note: Participants who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study
             may participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous
             investigational agent.

          7. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy
             (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of

             within the past 3 years. Note: Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin,
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in situ (e.g. breast carcinoma) that
             have undergone potentially curative therapy are not excluded.

          9. Has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with
             previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically
             stable, i.e. without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging
             (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically
             stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to
             first dose of study treatment.

         10. Has severe hypersensitivity (≥Grade 3) to pembrolizumab and/or any of its excipients.

         11. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

         12. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current
             pneumonitis.

         13. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

         14. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Note: No HIV testing is
             required unless mandated by local health authority.

         15. Has a known history of Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]
             reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as qualitative HCV RNA is
             detected) infection. Note: no testing for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C is required
             unless mandated by local health authority.

         16. Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis).

         17. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         18. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         19. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days
