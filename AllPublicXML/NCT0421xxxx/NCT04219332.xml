  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether submucosal or subserous injection of
      indocyanine green during laparoscopic lymph node dissection of gastric cancer was different
      in tracing lymph nodes of gastric cancer. The patients with gastric adenocarcinoma (cT1-4a,
      Nmuramel +, M0) were studied.

    <textblock>
      In recent years, with the successful application of ICG fluorescence imaging technology in
      laparoscopic equipment, scholars have found that ICG near infrared imaging has better tissue
      penetration and can better identify lymph nodes in hypertrophic adipose tissue than other
      dyes under visible light, which makes ICG fluorescence imaging guide laparoscopic radical
      resection of gastric cancer lymph node dissection has become a new exploration direction. ICG
      near-infrared imaging technology has important research value, good application prospect and
      broad development space in laparoscopic radical resection of gastric cancer. However, at
      present, the application of ICG near infrared imaging technology in laparoscopic radical
      resection of gastric cancer is still in the exploratory stage, and there is no unified
      standard.Therefore, in the world, there is still a lack of high-level evidence-based evidence
      of large-sample prospective randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness,
      safety and feasibility of submucosal or subserous injection of ICG in guiding laparoscopic D2
      radical resection of gastric cancer.The investigator first carried out this study in the
      world to evaluate the lymph node acquisition and perioperative safety of gastric cancer
      patients who received submucosal injection of ICG and subserous injection of ICG during
      laparoscopic radical gastrectomy in the same period, in order to promote the standardized
      development of ICG near infrared imaging in laparoscopic radical gastrectomy.
