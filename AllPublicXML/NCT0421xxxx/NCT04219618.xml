    <description>After a standard median sternotomy, pericardium will be divided to expose the heart and major vessels, and the aortic cannulation sutures will be placed. Pyramid positioner will be applied to the apex of the heart, and the heart will be manually elevated upward. The inflow cannula placement location and placement of the sewing ring will be done with pledged sutures. The LV diaphragmatic site coring will be completed, and immediate LV digital exploration will be accomplished. The LVAD inflow cannula will be inserted through the sewing ring into the LV cavity. Upon completing proper LVAD inflow cannula placement into the LV and securing it in position, the heart will be dropped into the pericardial cavity with the outflow graft elevated for LVAD and outflow graft de-airing and to prevent potential later air embolization. A partial occlusion clamp will be placed on the ascending aorta and appropriately trimmed outflow graft will be sewn to the aorta.</description>

    <description>A standard median sternotomy incision will be performed and pericardium divided to expose the heart and major vessels. Cannulation will be done through the aorta and the right atrium and the patient will be put on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The patient's heart will be freed from the surrounding tissues. With a cylindrical blade, the surgeon will excise a core of myocardium from the apex. The LVAD sewing ring will then be sutured to the margins of the apical hole. The LVAD will be inserted into the LV cavity through the sewing ring. The outflow graft will be measured for the anastomosis into the aortic root. Partial occlusion clamp will be placed on the aortic root and the anastomosis will be performed. De-airing will be performed and the LVAD will be started. The patient will then be weaned from CPB and decannulated.</description>
