    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study with Phase 2 expansion cohort. Phase 1 will assess the safety and
      tolerability of autologous expanded NK cells in combination with irinotecan, temozolomide,
      and dinituximab. The phase 2 of the study will estimate the response to treatment.

    <description>The planned therapy will involve 6 cycles of 21 days each consisting of irinotecan, temozolomide, dinutuximab, and sargramostim (Cycle 1), or irinotecan, temozolomide, dinutuximab, sargramostim, and natural killer (NK) cells (Cycles 2-6).
Treatment cycles will be repeated every 21 days based upon disease response and toxicity criteria. Tumor response will be assessed after Cycles 2, 4 and 6. Patients who do not experience dose-limiting toxicities and achieve complete response, partial response or stable disease may continue to receive the assigned therapy for as many cycles as are possible with the number of NK cells manufactured.
Patients will be assigned an initial NK cell dose level at time of registration. If the NK cell dose is tolerated, intra-patient dose escalation will occur at cycle 4 and cycle 6.</description>
