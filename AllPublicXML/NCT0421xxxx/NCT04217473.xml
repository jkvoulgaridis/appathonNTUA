  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase 1, first-in-human (FIH), dose-escalation, multicenter,
      multinational trial evaluating the safety of oncolytic adenovirus TILT-123 as monotherapy and
      in association with T-cell therapy with TILs in metastatic melanoma patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the safety of TILT-123. The approach has
      the potential to a) increase the efficacy of adoptive T-cell therapy, b) remove the need for
      toxic pre- and post-conditioning regimens, c) yield the combined anti-tumor benefits of armed
      oncolytic viruses and T-cell therapy.

      Dose escalation of TILT-123 injection will take place between cohorts not intra-patient and
      will be determined based on Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs).

    <description>Patients will receive administrations of TILT-123. Patients will also receive Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) during the treatment phase.
Escalation to the next dose of TILT-123 level will occur when the safety data has been evaluated for all patients in the preceding dose level.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed and dated informed consent before any trial-related activities.

          -  Male or female, between 18-75 years of age (both included).

          -  Pathologically confirmed previously treated refractory or recurrent stage 3-4
             melanoma, which cannot be treated with curative intent with available therapies.

          -  At least one prior line of medical treatment is required (for example checkpoint
             inhibitors, kinase inhibitors, interleukin-2). Multiple prior therapies (e.g. surgery,
             checkpoint inhibitors, kinase inhibitors, interleukin-2, interferon, chemotherapy,
             radiation) are allowed.

          -  A &gt; 9 mm tumor (in diameter, typically a minimum of 1 cm3 in volume) without signs of
             necrosis must be available for biopsy/operation to enable growing of TILs.

          -  At least one additional tumor (&gt;14 mm in diameter) must be available for injections
             and biopsies for correlative analyses. The disease burden must be measurable, but does
             not need to fulfil RECIST 1.1.

          -  Eligible for adoptive T-cell therapy with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes

          -  Adequate hepatic, cardiac and renal functions as following:

               -  Bilirubin, creatinine (serum), leukocytes, platelets; normal values.

               -  Haemoglobin ≥ 100 g/L.

               -  AST and ALT &lt; 3 x ULN.

          -  Men and women must be willing to use adequate forms of contraception from screening,

             contraception (oral contraceptive pills, implants, transdermal patches, vaginal rings
             or long-acting injections).
