  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To confirm the clinical performance of Etermis 3 and Etermis 4 based on the blinded
      investigator´s assessments on the respective Merz Aesthetics Scales from day 0 (D0)
      pre-injection to month 6/7 (depending on touch up) visit for nasolabial folds and marionette
      lines and from D0 pre-injection to month 3/4 (depending on touch up) visit for upper and
      lower lip fullness.
