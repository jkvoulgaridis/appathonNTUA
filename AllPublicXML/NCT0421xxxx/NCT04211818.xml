  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eating Disorders (ED) are a major public health problem. Current care remains only partially
      effective and the pathophysiology of the disorders remains to be deepened. With regard to
      compulsive ED (bulimia and binge eating disorder), our clinical experience suggests that one
      of the major triggers for crisis may be related to glycemia. In fact, bulimia could be
      considered as a vicious circle where the binge eating disorder is going to be followed by a
      food restriction in order to control weight , putting the subject in a situation of &quot;energy
      deficiency&quot; which will favor the emergence of new crises . Technological advances have
      resulted in the emergence of new measuring devices, such as &quot;tracking&quot;, which records
      continuous glycemia, which would allow us to explore these clinical hypotheses.

      This is an open-label, exploratory, proof-of-concept study.

      20 patients will be recruited from the day hospital of the Endocrinology and Nutrition
      Department of the University Hospital of Montpellier, Lapeyronie and from Emergencies and
      Post-psychiatric Emergencies Department.

      During the inclusion visit, the dietician will explain to the patient the use of the dietary
      book and the glycemic sensor which will be allocated to it. The patient will also answer to
      self-questionnaires about his eating behavior.

      No nutritional approach will be addressed so as not to alter the patient's eating behavior
      and not to influence the results.

      They will be followed-up during 14 days.
