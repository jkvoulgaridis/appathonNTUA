    <textblock>
      Investigators are building an empirical evidence base for real world data through large-scale
      replication of randomized controlled trials. The investigators' goal is to understand for
      what types of clinical questions real world data analyses can be conducted with confidence
      and how to implement such studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, non-interventional study that is part of the RCT DUPLICATE
      initiative (www.rctduplicate.org) of the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical
      School. It is intended to replicate, as closely as is possible in healthcare insurance claims
      data, the trial listed below/above. Although many features of the trial cannot be directly
      replicated in healthcare claims, key design features, including outcomes, exposures, and
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, were selected to proxy those features from the trial.
      Randomization is also not replicable in healthcare claims data but was proxied through a
      statistical balancing of measured covariates according to standard practice. Investigators
      assume that the RCT provides the reference standard treatment effect estimate and that
      failure to replicate RCT findings is indicative of the inadequacy of the healthcare claims
      data for replication for a range of possible reasons and does not provide information on the
      validity of the original RCT finding.

        This study will involve a new user, parallel group, cohort study design comparing
        empagliflozin to the DPP-4 inhibitor (DPP4i) antidiabetic class. DPP4is serve as a proxy
        for placebo, since this class of antidiabetic drugs is not known to have an impact on the
        outcome of interest. The comparison against DPP4 inhibitors is the primary comparison. The
        patients will be required to have continuous enrollment during the baseline period of 180
        days before initiation of empagliflozin or a comparator drug (cohort entry date). Follow-up
        for the outcome (3P-MACE), begins the day after drug initiation. As in the trial, patients
        are allowed to take other antidiabetic medications during the study.
