  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the elderly patients undergoing elective non-cardiac major surgery, the differences of EEG
      parameters between those with and without postoperative cognitive dysfunction were observed
      to determine the characteristic changes of EEG parameters related to postoperative cognitive
      dysfunction
