  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is widely acknowledged that the transition from paediatric to adult health services should
      be a multidimensional and multidisciplinary process that addresses the medical, psychosocial,
      and educational needs of adolescents and young adults (AYA). Despite this, there is currently
      a scarcity of research examining the relationships between psychosocial factors (e.g.,
      anxiety, social support) and transition readiness in AYA with juvenile idiopathic arthritis
      (JIA). This study therefore aimed to examine the relationships between psychosocial factors
      and transition readiness in pre-transfer adolescents and post-transfer young adults aged
      10-25 years diagnosed with JIA at a single centre.

      In total, 40 adolescents aged 10-16 years together with a parent/guardian, will take part at
      Sheffield Children's Hospital and 40 young adults aged 16-25 years will take part at
      Sheffield Teaching Hospitals. Participants will be asked to complete a battery of self-report
      questionnaire measuring psychosocial factors (anxiety/depression, social support, family
      functioning, health-related quality of life) and transition readiness (transition knowledge
      and skills, self-efficacy). JIA disease severity was also measured during clinic
      appointments. This study has received full ethical approval, and all participants will give
      their written informed assent or consent before taking part.

      The results from this research will be important in better understanding which psychosocial
      factors affect how ready young people with JIA feel to move from paediatric to adult
      rheumatology services. We hope this research will inform further work to help target
      psychological interventions in this group of patients.
