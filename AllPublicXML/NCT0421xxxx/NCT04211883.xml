  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical Randomized Controlled Trial where the study personnel will run a
      personalized prevention clinic with patients in attempts to improve their preventive health
      outcomes and compare their health outcomes with a matched control sample of patients who do
      not receive the clinical intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Project ACTIVE intervention was constructed around the following framework, and then
      adapted to suit workflow demands of a busy inner-city clinic: (1) identify patients who could
      most benefit from improvements in adherence to evidence-based preventive care, (2) use a
      validated mathematical model that was published in Annals of Internal Medicine to quantify
      and rank the estimated amount of health benefit that would arise from improved adherence to
      each USPSTF preventive care guideline, with estimates personalized based on that patient's
      risk factors and medical history, (3) communicate this information in a manner informed by
      risk communication studies relevant to patients from disparate cultural groups and with low
      literacy and numeracy, (4) engage the patient in a shared decision making process in which
      the patient identified which preventive health goals patient aimed to achieve, and (5) set
      particular action steps for the next visit that were congruent with these goals. The program
      supplements rather than substitutes for normally scheduled primary care visits, and is
      coordinated with these visits whenever possible.

    <time_frame>Visits 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 16 weeks, 28 weeks, 40 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>At follow up visits the patient's data and goal achievement (or lack thereof) is updated into the model along with their new vital signs, lab work, screenings, and medication changes that occurred since their last visit, to enable the model to yield updated results. If the patient has made improvements to their health since the last visit, this is depicted graphically on an updated summary chart, demonstrating what they accomplished since their previous visit.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in life expectancy including smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, quality of life.</measure>
    <time_frame>Visits 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 16 weeks, 28 weeks, 40 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subject will meet with the health coach, who helps the patients meet their health goals in practical ways by setting corresponding behavioral goals. Motivational interviewing techniques are again used, and the patient ends the visit with clear behavioral goals they have created for the next visit. The goals are written out at the bottom of the patient's visual graph depicting the possible health gain. Educational materials and resources are also given to the patient depending on their specific needs, such as food logs to record their diets, lists of local gyms near their residence and lists of healthy foods to buy when grocery shopping. At the end of the visit, a copy of the patient's visual graph with their specific goals are left in the clinic mailbox of their primary care clinician, and notes are documented by the nurse practitioner and the health coach into the electronic medical record system.</description>
