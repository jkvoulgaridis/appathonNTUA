  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This registry aims to collect clinical, molecular and radiologic data including detailed
      clinical parameters, molecular pathology (1p/19q co-deletion, MGMT methylation, IDH and TERTp
      mutations, etc) and conventional/advanced/new MR sequences (T1, T1c, T2, FLAIR, ADC, DTI,
      PWI, etc) of patients with primary gliomas. By leveraging artificial intelligence, this
      registry will seek to construct and refine algorithms that able to predict molecular
      pathology or subgroups of gliomas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-invasive and precise prediction for molecular biomarkers such as 1p/19q co-deletion, MGMT
      methylation, IDH and TERTp mutations is challenging. With the development of artificial
      intelligence, much more potential lies in the preoperative conventional/advanced MR imaging
      (T1 weighted imaging, T2 weighted imaging, FLAIR, contrast-enhanced T1 weighted imaging,
      diffusion-weighted imaging, and perfusion imaging) could be excavated to aid prediction of
      molecular pathology of gliomas. The creation of a registry for primary glioma with detailed
      molecular pathology, radiological data and with sufficient sample size for deep learning
      (&gt;1000) provide considerable opportunities for personalized prediction of molecular pathology
      with non-invasiveness and precision.

      All participants have signed the informed consent. Fresh frozen tissues of participants are
      collected immediately after tumor resection and preserved in liquid nitrogen. Whole exome
      sequencing, RNA sequencing and proteomics are planed to be conducted.
