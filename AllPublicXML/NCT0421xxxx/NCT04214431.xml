  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women often experience fear of childbirth or anxiety toward the labor pain or
      uncertainties associated with labor process. To develop and evaluate the efficacy of
      childbirth educational interventions on reduction of fear or anxiety is an important issue in
      maternal health care.

    <textblock>
      Fear of childbirth is a common clinical problem among perinatal women and link to adverse
      health effects on mother's and offspring's well-being. Recently, reducing the childbirth fear
      becomes a highly important maternity care issues as a result of the fact that the birth rate
      has been declining rapidly as well as Cesarean rate increased steadily. However, the studies
      on fear of childbirth among perinatal population in Taiwan were limited. In this proposal the
      investigators plan to conduct a randomized controlled study examining the effects of
      mindfulness-based childbirth education. In the randomized controlled study, women will be
      recruited and randomized into the experiment group (receiving mindfulness-based childbirth
      education and traditional childbirth education),or will be allocated in the control group
      receiving traditional childbirth education. Intention-to-treat analysis as well as mixed
      regression modeling will be used to estimate the effectiveness of the interventions.
