  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multimodality treatment that comprises preoperative fluoropyrimidine with concurrent
      radiotherapy followed by total mesorectal excision (TME) surgery and adjuvant
      fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy is recommended as a standard treatment of patients with
      stage II/III rectal cancer. However, the main target of radiotherapy is local control but no
      improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS) has been shown with this
      treatment strategy, which leaves approximately 30% of patients in whom distant metastases
      will develop. Moreover, the short- and long-term adverse effects of radiotherapy such as
      chronic pain, faecal incontinence and urogenital/anal dysfunction are associated with poor
      quality of life.

      Neadajuvant chemotherpay (NACT) alone has been proposed instead of preoperative
      chemoradiotherapy (CRT) with the aim of elimination of potential micrometastasis as early as
      possible while avoiding the adverse effects of radiotherapy, without jeopardizing local
      control.

      Evidence from the UK CR07 trial suggests that, without RT, a local recurrence rate of 5%
      (27/543) can be achieved if a complete mesorectal excision is carried out with a negative
      CRM. A small single-center phase II pilot trial treated patients with stage II or III rectal
      cancer with induction FOLFOX/bevacizumab chemotherapy followed by CRT only in those with
      stable or progressive disease and resection in all patients. All 32 of the participants had
      an R0 resection, and the 4-year DFS was 84%. Another phase II trial, which included 60
      patients with stage II/III rectal cancer, assessed the R0 resection rate after FOLFOX plus
      either bevacizumab or cetuximab. An R0 resection was achieved in 98.3% of the participants,
      and the pathologic complete response rate was 16.7%. The phase III FOWARC trial, compared
      neoadjuvant therapy with and without radiation and found that perioperative mFOLFOX6 alone
      led to a similar downstaging rate as fluorouracil-radiotherapy, and no significant difference
      in outcomes was found between mFOLFOX6 without radiotherapy and 5-FU- radiotherapy.

      On the basis of the results of these trials, The investigators hypothesized that radiotherapy
      could be selectively omitted for patients who respond to NACT alone. The results of TRIBE
      showed that FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab yield a high objective response rate (ORR) (65%),
      early tumor shrinkage (ETS) (62.7%) and depth of response (DoR) (43.4%) in patients with
      metastatic colorectal cancer.

      The investigators were motivated to investigate this triplet-drugs chemotherpay plus
      bevacizumab both by the possibility of avoiding the toxicities of radiation without
      compromising local control, and the possibility that earlier introduction of intensive
      systemic therapy might achieve rapid tumor shrinkage, and improve distant control.

      The investigators conducted this phase III trial to compare neoadjuvant mFOLFOXIRI plus
      bevacizumab with selective radiotherapy with induction FOLFOX followed by concomitant
      chemoradiotherapy in patients with high-risk locally advanced rectal cancer.

      This trial is a two-arm, multicenter, open labelled, prospective, randomized phase III
      studies. Eligible patients with high-risk locally advanced rectal cancer patients (cT3 with
      any MRF involved, any cT4a/b or lateral node positive) will be randomly assigned, in a 1:1
      ratio, to receive either neoadjuvant mFOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab with selective radiotherapy
      or induction FOLFOX followed by concomitant chemoradiotherapy.

    <description>Patients will receive neoadjuvant mFOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab once every two weeks for 4 cycles and the same mFOLFOXIRI for 2 cycles. After completing all 6 cycles chemotherapy, the patient will have an MRI scan to examine the tumor. If MRI restaging is ycT4a/b, or MRF involved, the patient will receive concomitant chemoradiotherapy (preoperative radiotherapy consisted of 50 Gy in 25 fractions, and concurrent with capecitabine at a fixed dose of 825 mg/m2 twice daily on days 1 to 5 for 5 weeks). If MRI restaging is ycT0-3 and MRF negative, then the patient will proceed directly to surgery.</description>
