  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Residual and recurrent stones remain one of the most important challenges of hepatolithiasis
      which is reported in 20% to 50% of patients treated with these therapies. Up to now the most
      two common surgical procedures performed were choledochojejunostomy and T tube drainage as
      biliary drainage in hepatolithiasis. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the
      therapeutic safety, and perioperative and long-term outcomes of choledochojejunostomy versus
      T tube drainage for hepatolithiasis with sphincter of Oddi laxity.

      Background: SOL results in reflux of duodenal fluid and enteric bacteria infection, which
      lead to the formation of stones in the biliary tract. Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (HJ)
      shows considerable advantage for prevention of reflux of intestinal content into the bile
      duct. As a result, A randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluate the therapeutic safety, and
      perioperative and long-term outcomes of HJ versus T tube drainage for hepatolithiasis with
      SOL.

      Intervention: In total, 210 patients who met the following eligibly criteria were included
      and were randomized to choledochojejunostomy arm or T tube drainage in a 1:1 ratio.

      Clinical data include: the incidence of biliary complications (stone recurrence; biliary
      stricture; cholangitis); sphincter of oddi function; biliary leakage; mortality; hepatic
      injury; quality of life.

    <description>The common hepatic duct was cut and the duodenal side is closed by suture. The small intestine was cut off 15 cm below the ligament of Treitz. The distal end was lifted, and a 1-2 cm incision was made at the jejunal wall 4-5 cm from the jejunal stump. The anastomosis is used a 5-0 PSD Ⅱ suture, with double needles, inside-out in the jejunum and outside-in in the hepatic duct. One side of needles was used to continuely penetrate and suture the whole layer of the posterior-lateral wall of the jejunum, the posterior-lateral wall of the biliary duct, and the other side of needles was used to continuely stuere the anterior part of the anastomosis. Mucosa-to-mucosa contact should be ensured with every stitch.The anastomotic stomas were then checked for leakage. Enteric-enteric anastomosis was performed 60 cm below the site of the hepatojejunal anastomosis.</description>
