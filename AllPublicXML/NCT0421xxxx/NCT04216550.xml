    <textblock>
      Apatinib, also known as YN968D1, is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that
      selectively binds to and inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2).
      This study aims to collect clinical, radiological and histopathology imaging including
      detailed radiological data, survival data, clinical parameters, molecular pathology and
      images of HE slices in patients with recurrent gliomas whose are treated with Apatinib, for
      evaluating the efficacy and safety of Apatinib. Moreover, by leveraging artificial
      intelligence, this study seeks to construct and refine MR and histopathology imaging based
      algorithms that are able to predict the responses to Apatinib of patients with recurrent
      gliomas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Effective treatment for recurrent gliomas is still challenging. Malignant gliomas are
      considered to be one of the most angiogenic cancers and are mostly sustained by vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling via its endothelial tyrosine kinase receptor VEGF
      receptor 2 (VEGFR-2). Apatinib, also known as YN968D1, is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor (TKI) that selectively binds to and inhibits VEGFR-2. Apatinib has been
      demonstrated as monotherapy that prolongs OS in patients with gastric cancers after two or
      more lines of chemotherapy with moderate, reversible, and easily managed adverse effects.
      This study aims to collect clinical, radiological and histopathology imaging including
      detailed radiological data, survival data, clinical parameters, molecular pathology and
      images of HE slices in patients with recurrent gliomas whose are treated with Apatinib, for
      evaluating the efficacy and safety of Apatinib. Moreover, by leveraging artificial
      intelligence, this study also seeks to construct and refine MR and histopathology imaging
      based algorithms that are able to predict the responses to Apatinib of patients with
      recurrent gliomas. The creation of a registry for patients with recurrent gliomas treated by
      Apatinib with detailed survival data, radiological data, histopathology image data and with
      sufficient sample size for artificial intelligence provides opportunities for personalized
      prediction of responses to Apatinib.
