  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mukbang is an online eating broadcast where a host (Asian mukbangs generally feature a young
      and slim female host) consumes a large amount of food while chatting with audiences. Since
      some dieters watch mukbang to get satiation and control their appetites, the current study is
      aimed at testing the effect of mukbang on the desire to eat.

      Two randomized and controlled trails are conducted. The first randomized and controlled trail
      is conducted online using the Amazon Mturk. Participants (n=286) were randomly assigned to
      watch one of the following 3 videos: ramen mukbang (n=98), donut mukbang (n=97) and a
      non-food content video (n=91). The other study is a in person study. Participants (n=234)
      were randomly assigned to watch one of the following 3 videos: hotpot mukbang (n=79), hotpot
      cooking show (n=76) and a non-food content video (n=79).

      The investigators used the self-report survey to test whether the mukbang affects the desire
      to eat, and participants' satiation and disgust.
