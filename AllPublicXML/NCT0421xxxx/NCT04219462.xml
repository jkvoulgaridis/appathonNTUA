  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) is known not only for its widespread prevalence, but also for its
      significant complications including cerebrovascular disease, coronary artery disease, renal
      failure, vision loss, and neuropathy. Of particular importance to sexual medicine, diabetes
      has also been strongly associated with erectile dysfunction (ED).ED is defined as the
      inability to obtain and/or maintain the erection firm enough to achieve a successful sexual
      intercourse on a regular basis. It is a more common condition in males with type 2 DM. In the
      field of sexual medicine numerous studies have shown that extracorporal shock wave therapy
      (ESWT) is safe, noninvasive, and, most importantly, an effective method for treating vascular
      ED

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ED in DM is often complex and caused by several mechanisms including vascular disease,
      autonomic neuropathy, hormonal imbalance, and psychogenic factors. However, as the
      endothelial dysfunction is an important factor contributing to the development of ED in
      diabetic patients, such patients can be resistant to phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5I)
      like sildenafil therapy. There are reports of lower efficacy of sildenafil in DM patients
      compared to general population.In the field of sexual medicine numerous studies have shown
      that ESWT is safe, noninvasive, and, most importantly, an effective method for treating
      vascular ED

      Before starting the study, clearance will be obtained from the institutional ethical
      committee and prior informed consent of all the participants will be obtained before
      conducting the study. Patients will be recruited from outpatient clinic of andrology (Cairo
      University Hospitals). The patients were randomly divided into two equal groups:

      Group (1): (Study group): Men in this group (n= 20) men receive extracorporeal shock wave
      (ESWT) twice weekly for 3 consecutive weeks and repeated after a 3-week rest period, for a
      total of 12 treatment sessions+sildenafil 5mg) Group (2): (Control group):) will receive sham
      treatment underwent identical therapy with ESWT application with a similar appearance and
      sound as the active low intensity ESWT+sildenafil 5mg

    <description>Each patient will self- administrated the Arabic translated five- Item Version of International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) (in which every patient in both groups will be asked about erectile dysfunction (ED) over their last four weeks). The procedure of IIEF-5 conducted in the following steps:
The patient will be asked to answer each item by choosing an answer from the five answers of each five items
The number opposite to each answer from the five answers will be determined
The final number obtained by the sum of the ordinal responses to the five items.
The improvement of erectile dysfunction will be detected according ED severity classification: no ED (score 25-22) mild ED (score 21-17), mild to moderate ED (score 16-12), moderate ED (score 11-8) and severe ED (score 7-1).
Measurements will be done before initial session in both groups. Follow up will be after the sixth treatment and at 1, 3, 6 months in both groups.</description>
