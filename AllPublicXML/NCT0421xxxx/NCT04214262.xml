  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well atezolizumab added to the usual radiation therapy works in
      treating patients with stage I-IIA non-small cell lung cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal
      antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and
      may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Radiation therapy, such as
      stereotactic body radiation therapy, uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver
      radiation to tumors with high precision. This method can kill tumor cells with fewer doses
      over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving atezolizumab and
      radiation therapy may work better than radiation therapy alone in treating patients with
      early non-small cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To compare overall survival (OS) in patients with inoperable, early stage non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC) randomized to stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) with or without
      atezolizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare investigator-assessed progression-free survival (IA-PFS) between the arms.

      II. To compare progression free survival (PFS) by blinded independent centralized review
      (BIRC) between the arms in a random subset of patients.

      III. To evaluate distant, locoregional, and local failure rates within each treatment arm.

      IV. To evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicities within each treatment arm.

      ADDITIONAL OBJECTIVE:

      I. To collect specimens for banking.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 8 cycles. Starting on day 1 cycle 3, patients also
      undergo SBRT for 3-5 treatments over 1-3 weeks.

      ARM B: Beginning 21 days after randomization, patients undergo SBRT for 3-5 treatments over
      1-3 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at weeks 18, 30, 42, and 54,
      every 6 months for 2 years, and then every 12 months for 2 years.

    <description>Will compare overall survival between patients with inoperable, T1, T2, limited T3, N0M0 (early stage) non-small cell lung cancer randomized to stereotactic body radiation therapy with or without atezolizumab. Will be evaluated using the method of Kaplan-Meier. For point estimates at landmark times, the associated 95% confidence interval (CI) will be calculated using Greenwood's formula and based on a log-log transformation applied on the survival function. Hazard ratios for these outcomes will be estimated using a Cox Proportional Hazards regression model and estimated using a stratified Cox regression model.</description>

             within 6 months prior to randomization

          -  Patient must not have a history of clinically significant interstitial lung disease or
             evidence of active pneumonitis on the screening chest CT

          -  No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated
             basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, localized prostate
             cancer, adequately treated stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in
             complete remission, or any other cancer from which the patient has been disease free
             for five years

          -  Patients must not be pregnant due to the potential teratogenic side effects of the
             protocol treatment. Women of reproductive potential and men must have agreed to use an
             effective contraception method for the duration of protocol treatment, and for 5
             months (150 days) after the last dose of atezolizumab. A woman is considered to be of
             &quot;reproductive potential&quot; if she has had a menses at any time in the preceding 12
             consecutive months. In addition to routine contraceptive methods, &quot;effective
             contraception&quot; also includes heterosexual celibacy and surgery intended to prevent
             pregnancy (or with a side-effect of pregnancy prevention) defined as a hysterectomy,
             bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral tubal ligation. However, if at any point a
             previously celibate patient chooses to become heterosexually active during the time
             period for use of contraceptive measures outlined in the protocol, he/she is
             responsible for beginning contraceptive measures. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with atezolizumab, breastfeeding must be discontinued prior to randomization

          -  Patient must agree to have specimens submitted for translational medicine and banking

          -  Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must sign
             and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal
             guidelines

          -  As a part of the OPEN registration process the treating institution's identity is
             provided in order to ensure that the current (within 365 days) date of institutional
             review board approval for this study has been entered in the system
