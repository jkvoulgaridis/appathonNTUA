      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects on the exercise performance of anodal
      transcranial direct current stimulation combined with aerobic exercise in healthy
      individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method
      that has become increasingly popular in recent years. tDCS shows promising improvements for
      the motor performance of healthy individuals as well as pathological conditions. Moreover, it
      is frequently preferred because of its safety advantage, high tolerability as well as being
      cheap, portable and easily applicable.

      Studies have shown that tDCS can modulate the excitability of both cortical and subcortical
      brain regions. In recent years, there have been scientific studies investigating the effects
      of tDCS on improving physical performance in healthy individuals, but these studies are
      limited in number, their results are conflicted and as far as the investigators know there is
      no study that combines tDCS with exercise.

      Moreover, although the mechanisms of tDCS on physical performance are largely unknown, some
      tDCS devices are open to public usage and a large number of professional athletes have
      reported using tDCS during their training programs. Therefore, studies are needed to
      demonstrate the effects of tDCS which combined with exercise on performance.

      The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of anodal transcranial direct current
      stimulation combined with aerobic exercise on physical performance in healthy individuals.

    <measure>Effect of tDCS combined with aerobic exercise on exercise performance in healthy individuals.</measure>

    <description>The performance will be evaluated by measuring the maximal consumption of oxygen (VO2max). VO2max will be assessed continuously during the time to exhaustion trial using a gas analyzer</description>

    <measure>Effect of tDCS combined with aerobic exercise on ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) in healthy individuals.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>RPE will be assessed continuously (every 3 minutes) during the time to exhaustion trial using the Borg rating of perceived exertion scale (RPE scale). The Borg RPE scale is a quantitative measure of perceived exertion during physical activity. The scale starts with &quot;no feeling of exertion,&quot; which rates a 6, and ends with &quot;very, very hard,&quot; which rates a 20. Moderate activities register 11 to 14 on the Borg scale (&quot;fairly light&quot; to &quot;somewhat hard&quot;), while vigorous activities usually rate a 15 or higher (&quot;hard&quot; to &quot;very, very hard&quot;).</description>

    <description>This questionnaire evaluates different aspects of individual life such as Vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health. Through different questions, a score is generated for each subscale where zero represents the worst quality of life and 100 the best quality of life.</description>
