  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of high-dose intranasal oxytocin for
      treating tinnitus. The hypothesis is that high dose intranasal oxytocin can significantly
      reduce tinnitus severity and disability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, proof of concept, placebo-controlled, parallel study. Participants will be
      recruited from NYU Langone Medical Center's ENT Department and will receive either high-dose
      intranasal oxytocin or a nasal spray containing distilled water, serving as the placebo. Long
      term treatment with high-dose oxytocin (45 IU four times daily) may reduce the frequency and
      severity of tinnitus, the burden tinnitus symptoms cause patients, and improve their quality
      of life.

    <measure>Change of tinnitus loudness as measured by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) when compared to placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit Week 4 (8 wks)</time_frame>
    <description>Comparing endpoints of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of all 30 subjects at 4th week of treatment with active drug vs baseline. The primary outcome measure for this study will be a greater than 50% improvement in tinnitus loudness on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). No response to nasal spray is defined as a decrease in VAS &lt; 2, and a patient reported improvement is defined as an increase in VAS &gt; 3. No minimum and maximum values are defined.The higher the score indicates more improvement in tinnitus loudness.</description>

    <description>Comparative endpoint during the cross-over phase of VAS at the 4th week between the 15 subjects who received placebo vs the 4th week of the single blinded phase for the same subjects . This endpoint compares the 15 patients that were switched from active to placebo and compares their response on placebo with their response on placebo and compare them to the 15 subjects that remained on active drug during the entire study.</description>

             nasal spray.
