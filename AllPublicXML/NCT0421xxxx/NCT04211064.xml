  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased intracranial pressure (IICP) is a common problem in traumatic brain injuries and
      many medical diseases. Early recognition of IICP can save lives. Several invasive and
      non-invasive methods have been described for IICP diagnosis. In recent years,
      ultrasonographic measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) has become a popular
      method due to its high sensitivity and specificity for IICP estimation. Studies have shown
      that ONSD's ultrasonographic measurement correlates with the IICP and can detect intracranial
      hypertension. The ONSD measurement has advantages such as being easily applied by the
      clinician at the bedside, being non-invasive, providing immediate results, reproducibility
      and low cost. It is known that artificial carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum created in
      laparoscopic surgeries increases intracranial pressure.However, it is not easy to estimate
      the degree of changes in ICP during laparoscopic surgery under general anesthesia. In the
      literature, there are many studies on the sonographic measurement of optic nerve sheath
      diameter to evaluate the effects of trendelenburg position on intracranial pressure with the
      use of different anesthetic drugs in laparoscopic surgeries. In addition, there are studies
      reporting that deep neuromuscular blockade in laparoscopic surgeries increases surgical
      vision and decreases analgesic requirement in postoperative period. The relationship between
      neuromuscular block level and intracranial pressure is not clear. From this point of view,
      the investigators would like to evaluate the effect of moderate and deep neuromuscular block
      level on intracranial pressure by sonographic measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter in
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy operations performed with standard pressure artificial carbon
      dioxide pneumoperitoneum.

      Fifty patients in the American Society of Anesthesiologists' risk scale I-II category who are
      scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia will be included in the
      study. Patients will be randomly divided into 2 groups. In the first group (Group 1),
      patients undergoing intraabdominal insufflation pressure 12 mmHg and deep neuromuscular block
      (TOF 0 PTC 1-2), in the second group (Group 2) patients undergoing intraabdominal
      insufflation pressure 12 mmHg and moderate neuromuscular block (TOF 1-2) It would be
      classified.

      A value of 40-60 will be targeted by applying bispectral index (single channel EEG monitor)
      for standardization of anesthesia depth. The adductor pollicis muscle will be connected by
      mechanomyography for neuromuscular monitoring.

      Deep and moderate neuromuscular block level will be monitored with TOF and PTC values.
      Patients will be measured with optic nerve sheath diameter in sagittal and horizontal planes
      over both eyes with 5-14 MHz linear ultrasonography probe while eyes are closed.

      The sonographic measurement will be performed by the same practitioner. Sonographic optic
      nerve sheath measurements will be made 4 times, preoperatively, 5 minutes after endotracheal
      intubation, 10 minutes after pneumoperitoneum and 5 minutes after pneumoperitoneum is
      terminated.
