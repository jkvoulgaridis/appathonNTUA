      Dental caries can be prevented or arrested . Moreover, preventive measures for dental caries
      are more cost effective than emergency room visits or restorative treatments when the illness
      has been established . One of the recent preventive methods of dental caries is silver
      diamine flouride . SDF has been used as an alternative treatment for caries prevention and
      arrest . Several studies showed that silver diamine flouride cause staining of the treated
      teeth . However, parents have different attitudes toward using SDF considering its positives
      and negatives.

      Dental caries is one of the most common diseases in the world, with a prevalence of 69%‚Äê79% .
      Early childhood caries (ECC) has been recognized by the American Dental Association as an
      important public health issue and was defined as presence of 1 or more decayed, missing, or
      filled tooth surfaces (dmfs) in any primary tooth in a preschool-aged child . Caries was
      known to be managed through two main approaches: Treatment, which includes drill and fill
      which is a challenge specially in minimally cooperative children and the second approach is
      prevention which depends on cease the process of caries formation at an early stage which is
      more effective . One of the recently marketed preventive measures of dental caries is silver
      diamine fluoride (SDF) .

      In 2014, SDF was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for dentinal
      sensitivity .It was proven to be a cost-effective, minimally invasive, and handy treatment .
      Silver diamine flouride is easy to apply in a minimally cooperative individual . More
      important, it has shown a noticeable success rate in caries prevention, especially in early
      childhood caries cases . It provides families with an alternative solutions for managing
      dental caries, particularly if caries was detected at an early stage . Moreover, it could
      save time and effort for both families and dental teams.

      The major downside of SDF is the unesthetic permanent black discoloration of the arrested
      lesion , which could affect parental acceptance for the treatment and may result in shifting
      to another esthetically acceptable treatment.
