  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a public health phenomenon affecting more than 17% of women in France, and more
      than 20% of men and women in Champagne-Ardenne.

      Obese women are more likely to have an unplanned pregnancy, whereas these pregnancies are
      more at risk than women of normal weight and should be planned or considered after weight
      loss. These women are also often less well followed in terms of gynecology and especially on
      contraception.

      More and more patients are opting for bariatric surgery. However, bariatric surgery is not
      trivial. Indeed, the important loss of weight expected is at risk of nutritional
      deficiencies. In addition, a large number of patients are still obese during the months
      following surgery. This is why pregnancy is theoretically contraindicated within 12 or 18
      months postoperatively.

      Women with bariatric surgery must have been properly informed of these risks so that they can
      choose a contraceptive method, and that can be adapted to both their risk factors and the
      surgical technique performed.
