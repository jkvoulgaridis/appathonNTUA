  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial to assess the efficacy of oral
      solution of hyaluronic acid mixture (A+ HA(tm)). During 8 weeks treatment period, there were
      three follow-up visits requested (Week 2, Week 4 and Week 8).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects were initially screened at the Randomization/Baseline Visit (Week 0). Eligible
      subjects were randomized at the same visit into treatment period, and received the assigned
      treatment in a double-blind fashion for 8 weeks. Efficacy was measured by the several
      questionnaire including Knee injury and Osteoarthritis (KOOS), the Short Form-36 (SF-36) and
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (CPSQI) for each visit. Incidences of adverse events (AEs)
      were monitored for each subject once the subject had received 1 dose of study medication; the
      incidence of serious AEs (SAEs) were monitored for each subject once the subject had signed
      the informed consent through to the End-of-Study or ET Visit. Vital signs were measured at
      baseline and End-of-Study or ET Visit.
