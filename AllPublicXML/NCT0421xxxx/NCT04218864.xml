  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to test whether the innovative intervention, &quot;Strength for U
      in Relationship Empowerment&quot; (SURE), reduces the frequency of IPV more than an attention,
      time, and information matched control condition in perinatal women seeking mental health
      care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intimate partner victimization (IPV) is a significant social and public health problem among
      perinatal women. IPV places a woman at high risk for several psychiatric disorders, which
      transforms the perinatal period from an already challenging process into a potentially
      overwhelming one. IPV and untreated mental illness during the perinatal period poses a dual
      risk of adverse physical and emotional outcomes for women and their developing fetus/infant.
      Given the high rates of IPV among women who seek mental health treatment, mental health
      clinics compared to other medical settings (e.g. primary care) are more effective sites for
      focused case finding and intervention. In addition, the presence of IPV increases the
      likelihood of disengagement from treatment, which could further compromise the health and
      safety of women and their fetus/infant. Despite the high-risk profile of women with IPV and
      mental health illness, there are low screening and intervention rates of female mental health
      patients with IPV within mental health settings.

      The objective of this R01 Award is to fill this critical gap by building upon our promising
      pilot findings to test whether the innovative intervention, &quot;Strength for U in Relationship
      Empowerment&quot; (SURE), reduces the frequency of IPV more than an attention, time, and
      information matched control condition in perinatal women seeking mental health care.

      The investigators propose a two-group, randomized controlled trial in which 186 perinatal
      women with IPV women seeking mental health care who will be assigned to either (a) SURE, a
      computer-delivered, single-session brief intervention plus one interventionist-led phone
      booster that is consistent with motivational interviewing and informed by the literature on
      effective interventions for our target population and targeted risk factors, or (b) a
      computer-delivered control + one interventionist-led phone booster condition.
      Computer-delivered follow-up assessments will occur at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12
      months after the baseline assessment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Composite Abuse Scale (CAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 week follow up through 12 months follow up.</time_frame>
    <description>The frequency of IPV will be measured using the Composite Abuse Scale (CAS). The CAS is a 30-item scale with 4 subscales that measure severe combined abuse, emotional abuse, physical abuse, and harassment. Items are scored between 0 and 5, with Never=0 and Daily=5. Scale range is from 0-150. The lower the score, the better or less victimization. Mean score will be used to calculate differences between baseline and follow-up and between groups.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Positive Affect and Well-being Scale (PAW)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 week follow up through 12 months follow up.</time_frame>
    <description>Positive affect and well-begin will be measured by using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QoL) scale for Positive Affect and Well-being (PAW), a computerized adaptive test 9-item scale. This scale is scored between 1 and 5, with Never=1 and Always=5. Scale range is from 9-45. Higher scores indicate higher positive affect, life satisfaction, or an overall sense of purpose and meaning. Mean score will be used to calculate differences between baseline and follow-up and between groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PROMIS Emotional Support</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 week follow up through 12 months follow up.</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived emotional support will be measured using a 4-item scale developed by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS). PROMIS is a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Roadmap initiative that provides precise, reliable, valid, and standardized questionnaires measuring patient-reported outcomes across the domains of physical, mental, and social health. The PROMIS Emotional Support item bank specifically aims to measure perceived feelings of being cared for and valued as a person. This scale is scored between 1 and 5, with Never=1 and Always=5. Scale range is from 4-16. A higher PROMIS score represents increased emotional support. Mean score will be used to calculate differences between baseline and follow-up and between groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Personal Progress Scale-Revised (PPS-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 week follow up through 12 months follow up.</time_frame>
    <description>Empowerment will be measured using the Personal Progress Scale-Revised (PPS-R) for measuring skills, social supports, and resources to cope more effectively with relationship stress and trauma. The PPS-R is a 28-item scale scored between 1 and 7, with 1=Almost Never and 7=Almost Always. Scale range is from 28-196. Higher scores indicating higher empowerment. Mean score will be used to calculate differences between baseline and follow-up and between groups.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 week follow up through 12 months follow up.</time_frame>
    <description>Self-efficacy will be measured using the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE), a 10-item self-report measure. It measures personal competence to deal effectively with a variety of stressful situations. The GSE is scored from 10-40, with 1=Not at all true and 4=Exactly true. A higher score indicates more self-efficacy. Mean score will be used to calculate differences between baseline and follow-up and between groups.</description>
