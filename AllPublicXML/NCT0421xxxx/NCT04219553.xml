  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common indication for antibiotics for Canadian
      paediatric patients. As the gatekeepers of safe and effective prescription pharmacotherapy,
      community pharmacists are well positioned to influence and optimize antibiotic use. The
      purpose of this project is to develop, implement, and evaluate an antimicrobial stewardship
      program in the community pharmacy setting that aims to optimize antibiotic use for AOM. This
      nonrandomized pre-post study includes children aged 6 months to 12 years presenting with an
      antibiotic prescription for AOM at two community pharmacies in Toronto, Ontario. Participants
      are excluded if they exhibit signs/symptoms of mastoiditis, have an additional indication for
      systemic antibiotics, or parents/guardians cannot consent in English. The multifaceted AMS
      intervention includes pharmacist education, a clinical decision support tool, a
      parent/guardian questionnaire, and individualized monthly audit and feedback with each
      pharmacist. Prescriptions are reviewed and adapted by the pharmacist to optimize congruence
      with 2016 Canadian Paediatric Society AOM guidelines. The primary outcome is the percentage
      change in guideline congruence attributable to pharmacist intervention. This study will
      provide insight into the opportunities and barriers of developing large-scale antimicrobial
      stewardship programs for community pharmacies.
