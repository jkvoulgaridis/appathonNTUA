  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer promotes weight loss; it can also lead to particular complications for patients during
      treatment. A team led by Dr Michael Sawyer, showed the deleterious impact of undernutrition
      on the benefits of chemotherapy.

      Cancer patients are at high risk of undernutrition, which is generally more pronounced for
      solid tumours (upper digestive tract, ENT, bronchial tubesâ€¦). This undernutrition leads to
      major weight loss and wasting, and may represent the first sign of a call for a diagnosis of
      cancer. Cancer-related undernutrition is multi-factorial in origin and has multiple
      consequences; it has its own prognostic value.

      Chemotherapy treatments can induce various adverse effects in patients, including sensory
      disturbances at the beginning of treatment in addition to disturbances that may already be
      present before any treatment. Altered taste and odour, observed in 86% of patients, can
      induce a change in food preferences, promote the development of aversions, and therefore,
      lead to a significant reduction in the pleasure of eating. Loss of appetite, decreased food
      intake and the development of aversions to certain foods are situations experienced by a
      large proportion of patients undergoing chemotherapy.

      The assessment of taste disorders in patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment is
      established through the use of questionnaires, interviews and taste tests.

      Changes in the perception and identification of salty, sweet, bitter and sour flavours are
      common in patients undergoing chemotherapy.

      The objective of CANUT is to study the effect of pathology and chemotherapy on gustatory and
      olfactory mechanisms and in particular on interindividual differences in the perception and
      appreciation of food.

      In this study the investigators propose to adapt foods to best respond to sensory disorders
      related to the disease and/or treatment.
