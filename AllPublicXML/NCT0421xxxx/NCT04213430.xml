  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinal images can reflect both fundus and systemic conditions (diabetes and cardiovascular
      disease) and firstly to be used for medical artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm training
      due to its advantages of clinical significance and easy to obtain. Here, the investigators
      developed a single network model that can mine the characteristics among multiple fundus
      diseases, which was trained by plenty of fundus images with one or several disease labels (if
      they have) in each of them. The model performance was compared with those of both native and
      international ophthalmologists. The model was further tested by datasets with different
      camera types and validated by three external datasets prospectively collected from the
      clinical sites where the model would be applied.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The quality of fundus images should clinical acceptable. More than 80% of the fundus
             image area including four main regions (optic disk, macular, upper and lower retinal
             vessel archs) are easy to read and discriminate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Images with light leakage (&gt;30% of area), spots from lens flares or stains, and
             overexposure were excluded from further analysis.
