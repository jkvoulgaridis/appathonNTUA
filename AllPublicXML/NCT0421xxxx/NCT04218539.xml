      In seeking to understand the capacity for psilocybin to reduce migraine headache burden, this
      study will investigate single and repeated dosing of psilocybin up to two doses. In seeking
      to identify an underlying mechanism in psilocybin's effects, neuroinflammatory markers for
      migraine headache will be measured.

    <textblock>
      Migraine headache is a common medical condition and a top cause of disability worldwide.
      Treatment options for migraine headache are many and varied, though an approximated 10% of
      migraineurs is refractory to medication and thus, there is a need to develop alternative
      treatments. There is anecdotal evidence supporting lasting therapeutic effects after limited
      dosing of psilocybin and related compounds in headache disorders. The cause of this unique
      effect remains unknown, though the drug class has demonstrable anti-inflammatory activity, a
      biological process relevant to migraine and other headache disorders. In seeking to
      understand the capacity for psilocybin to reduce migraine headache burden, this study will
      investigate single and repeated dosing of psilocybin up to two doses. In seeking to identify
      an underlying mechanism in psilocybin's effects, neuroinflammatory markers for migraine
      headache will be measured. The results from this study will serve in the development of
      larger investigations seeking to understand the effects of psilocybin and related compounds
      in headache disorders.
