    <textblock>
      This study assesses the acute effects of a standardized 20-minute vaping episode compared to
      a non-vaping control condition on ad libitum food intake during a 30-minute buffet meal,
      occurring approximately 45 minutes after the vaping episode

      Weight control is a common motive for cigarette smoking and nicotine has been shown to
      suppress appetite and increase resting metabolic rate, and also serves as a behavioral
      alternative to eating or a distraction from hunger or food craving. Data on the acute effect
      of e-cigarette use ('vaping') on ad libitum food intake are non-existent. Given that many
      e-cigarette users report vaping for weight control and that certain e-cigarettes are being
      actively marketed for weight management and/or suppression of food cravings, addressing this
      research gap is of the utmost importance.

    <intervention_model_description>The study consists of two study visits. During the first visit, participants will undergo a 20-minute vaping condition before consuming an ad libitum buffet meal. During the second visit, participants will undergo a 20-minute control condition (instead of the vaping condition) before consuming an ad libitum buffet meal. The order of the two visits will be counterbalanced among participants.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Participants will be asked to sit in a trailer and use their JUUL device to vape 20 puffs over the next 20 minutes. The trailer has its own ventilation system and will be placed on the top level of the parking deck in front of the clinic building. Participants will use their own JUUL pods with 50% nicotine by weight, which equates to approximately 59 mg/mL. The anticipated amount of nicotine that will be absorbed with 20 puffs is approximately 1.6 mg, which is equal to approximately 1.5 cigarettes. During the vaping period, participants will be monitored via video camera/webcam to verify adherence to the vaping protocol (20 puffs in 20 minutes).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Regularly vaping e-liquids containing approximately 50% nicotine by weight from a JUUL
             device several times per day

          -  A self-reported habitual vaping rate of approximately 20 puffs in 20 minutes

          -  The participant's JUUL device must be store-bought and unaltered

          -  The participant's e-liquid must be store-bought and unadulterated (e.g., an original
             JUUL product and the participant cannot add anything to the liquid)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria include being unwilling to take 20 puffs from their JUUL device
             with a pod containing 50% nicotine by weight in 20 minutes

        Participants will use their own device and own liquids during this study; they will not be
        provided with a device or e-liquids. The liquid vaped during the study must be 50% nicotine
        by volume.
