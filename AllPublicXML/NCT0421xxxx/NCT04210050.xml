  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite growing evidence showing benefit (in both clinical and cost standpoints), only a
      small percentage of COPD patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure are managed
      with nocturnal ventilatory support. There is uncertainty of the value of aggressive nocturnal
      ventilation, especially polysomnographic estimation of therapy and home transcutaneous CO2
      tracking.

      The driving goal behind this project is to develop and implement a streamlined and
      comprehensive program for nocturnal ventilator management of patients with advanced,
      hypercapnic COPD.

      The purpose of this protocol is to perform a prospective, randomized, comparative
      effectiveness clinical trial to evaluate the role of non-invasive nocturnal ventilation in
      addition to usual care, compared to usual care alone in the management of adult COPD patients
      with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure. The study will focus on the primary end-points
      of time to hospital re-admission for acute exacerbation of COPD and/or an episode of acute on
      chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, in addition to other clinically relevant outcomes
      including patient health-related quality of life, sleep quality indices, and gas exchange
      parameters. Approximately 300 BIDMC adult patients will be recruited and each patient
      monitored over a period of 12 months.

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The RAND SF-36, a 36-question multiple choice QOL form will be used to assess general health perception. The questions target eight health domains or scales: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal/emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, general health perceptions, and one's perceived change in health.
There is a 2-step process used in scoring, such that the score for each of the scales represent the average for all item in the scale that were answered. Each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively. Next, items in the same scale are averaged together to create 8 scale scores. The lower the score the more disability and the higher the score the less disability.
Scores will be assessed at baseline, 3 and 12 months for usual care and usual care plus ventilation support for all subjects.</description>

    <description>St. George's Respiratory questionnaire, a 50 item questionnaire that measures health status in patients with COPD will be completed at baseline, and after 3 and 12 months in all subjects. For this questionnaire, a score of 0 = best QOL, and a score of 100 = worst QOL. The questions focus on three areas - symptoms, activity, and impact (psycho-social).</description>

    <description>In a subset of subjects (from usual care and usual care plus ventilation groups), 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring will be conducted (at baseline and after 3 months) to assess for change in 24-hour and nocturnal systolic, diastolic and mean BPs.</description>

    <description>High sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP], units mg/ml, can be measured from peripheral blood. Elevated levels reflect increased systemic inflammation. Studies have shown that individuals with elevated levels (above 2 mg/ml) are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. During this trial, HR-CRP will be obtained at baseline and after 3 and 12 months in subjects to assess whether there is a favorable change in subjects treated with nocturnal ventilation + usual care, as compared to usual care.</description>

    <description>In the usual care plus NIPPV group, those able to undergo attended PSG will be titrated with volume targeted pressure support mode, aiming to lower the baseline TcCO2 by 10 mmHg. In some cases, the CO2 cannot be lowered by that amount on a single titration, but rather will decrease over time.
For those unable to undergo lab titration (too frail, no transportation, decline/refuse), NIPPV will be initiated with empiric settings based on nighttime home CO2 tracking and daytime ABG monitoring.</description>
