  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2018, the severe medicine branch of the Chinese Medical Association and the American
      Society of severe medicine successively updated the pain and sedation guidelines for severe
      patients (PADIS guidelines). In addition to the update of the original evaluation and
      management of pain and sedation and delirium, the new guidelines also increased the
      monitoring and management of early activities and sleep quality for severe patients.
      Therefore, it is necessary for us to investigate the compliance of the new guidelines for
      analgesia, sedation and delirium management among the medical staff of critical care, so as
      to find out the existing problems in the management of analgesia, sedation and delirium in
      critical care patients, and find solutions to improve the overall quality level of our
      management of critical care patients

      The first part is to master the current situation of analgesia, sedation and delirium
      management of ICU patients in China. In order to understand the compliance of Chinese ICU
      doctors and nurses with the PADIS guidelines, a questionnaire survey was conducted with the
      participation of multiple centers in China, aiming at the doctors and nurses with different
      seniority in the critical medicine department. At the same time, the total number of
      critically ill patients, pain, agitation and delirium assessment tools and critical patients
      in 2018 were investigated The incidence of pain, agitation and delirium, the implementation
      of early activities, the monitoring and evaluation of sleep quality, and related
      interventions, including real-world clinical data such as drug treatment and non drug
      treatment.The second part focuses on the management of severe delirium in ICU in China. For
      the patients with delirium in the above survey, a further in-depth and detailed survey shall
      be conducted, covering the basic diseases of the patients, the occurrence time of delirium,
      the type of delirium, relevant risk factors, the diagnosis method of delirium, the duration
      of delirium, the prevention and treatment measures (including drug treatment and non drug
      treatment measures), and the prognosis of delirium patients .
