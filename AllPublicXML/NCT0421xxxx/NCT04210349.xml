      The primary objectives of the study were:

        -  To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the immune response in terms of geometric mean
           titers (GMTs) and seroconversion rates of the SP Shz QIV compared with the SP Shz TIV
           containing the Victoria lineage strain (TIV1) and the SP Shz TIV containing the Yamagata
           lineage strain (TIV2) for each strain

        -  To describe the safety profile of each dosage of SP Shz QIV, TIV1 or TIV2

      The secondary objectives of the study were:

        -  Group 1 (subjects 6-35 months): To demonstrate the superiority of the immune response of
           SP Shz QIV compared to TIV2 or TIV1 group after the last dose; demonstrate the
           superiority of the immune response of the 0.5 mL dose of SP Shz QIV compared to 0.25 mL
           dose of SP Shz QIV group after the last dose; describe the immune response after
           administration of the last dose of either SP Shz QIV or SP Shz TIV1 or SP Shz TIV2.

        -  Groups 2 through 5 (subjects ≥ 3 years): To demonstrate the superiority of the immune
           response of SP Shz QIV compared to TIV2 or TIV1 group after a single dose; describe the
           immune response after each and every dose for all subjects ≥ 3 years of either SP Shz
           QIV or SP Shz TIV1 or SP Shz TIV2

        -  To describe the safety profile of SP Shz QIV 0.5 mL after each dose.
