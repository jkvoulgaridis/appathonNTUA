  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to collect clinical, radiological, pathological, molecular and genetic data
      including detailed clinical parameters, MR and histopathology images, molecular pathology and
      genetic data. This study seeks to find the prognostic and clinical significance based on
      molecular and genetic biomarkers/subgroups of gliomas.

      Precise classification based on molecular and genetic biomarkers/subgroups for gliomas is
      challenging. This study aims to collect clinical, radiological, pathological, molecular and
      genetic data including detailed clinical parameters, MR and histopathology images, molecular
      pathology (1p/19q co-deletion, MGMT methylation, IDH and TERTp mutations, etc) and genetic
      data (Whole exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, proteomics, etc). This study seeks to find the
      prognostic and clinical significance based on molecular and genetic biomarkers/subgroups of
      gliomas.
