    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2D[s]) in B cell
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in Part 1 and to evaluate
      the safety of JNJâ€‘64264681 at the RP2D(s) in Part 2.

    <measure>Percentage Occupancy of the Target</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The pharmacodynamics of JNJ-64264681 will be assessed by determining the percentage of target occupancy. Blood samples will be obtained for pharmacodynamic assessments (target occupancy).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a complete response (CR) + partial response (PR) or better according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma and the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) Response Criteria and International Workshop for Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (IWWM) Response Criteria.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Response (TTR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>TTR is defined for participants who achieved PR or CR as the time from the first dose of study drug to first response of PR or CR according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma and iwCLL Response Criteria and IWWM Response Criteria.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>DOR is defined for participants who achieved PR or CR as the time between the date of initial documentation of PR or CR to the date of either the first documented evidence of disease progression or death according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma and iwCLL Response Criteria and IWWM Response Criteria.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Complete Response (CR) Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>CR rate is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a best response of CR according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma and iwCLL Response Criteria and IWWM Response Criteria.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of the study drug to the date of either the first documented disease progression (according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma and iwCLL Response Criteria and IWWM Response Criteria), or death due to any cause.</description>
