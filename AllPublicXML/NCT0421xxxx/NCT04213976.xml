  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical procedures for complex intestinal neonatal and paediatric diseases may require the
      use of an ostomy, in order to discharge the upper intestine. The traditional loop ileostomy
      has recently be challenged by ileostomies in continuity, either the Santulli or the
      Bishop-Koop one, that both decompresses the proximal dilated bowel and allow intestine fluid
      to pass through the underlying ileal anastomosis. Nevertheless, to date, no evaluation of
      their indications, complications and potential benefits has been made.

      The aim of this study is to retrospectively compare the outcomes of loop ileostomies and
      ileostomies in continuity in a paediatric population.

      It is thus expected to better define the specific indications for these different types of
      ileostomies in the paediatric and neonatal population.

  <detailed_description>

      The methodology used will be a retrospective non interventional study of the cohorts of
      paediatric patients having had one or more ileostomies performed in one of the surgical
      centers participating in this study, between 2007, january the 1st and 2019, august the 31th.

      The main outcome will be the duration (days) between full refunctionalization of the bowel in
      the groups of conventional ileostomy or ostomy in continuity, as assessed by the end of
      parenteral nutrition or the closure of the stoma.

      Secondary outcomes will include (1) the number and type of complications directly related to
      the stoma and/or to intestinal complications; (2) the comparison of the results obtained by
      Santulli and Bishop-Koop ileostomies; (3) a sub-group analysis of the outcomes in the
      different underlying pathologies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  all patient aged 16 or less having had one or more ileostomy created as part of its
             care for an intestinal obstruction, between 2007/01/01 and 2019/08/31. If a patient
             requires more than one ileostomy, each new stoma will be analysed as a new entry in
             the study.

          -  patients having been operated in one of the paediatric surgical department
             participating in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  refusal or absence on consent of the patient and/or their legal representative to
             participate to the study.

          -  patient who had an ileostomy created in another center than the ones participating in
             the present study.
