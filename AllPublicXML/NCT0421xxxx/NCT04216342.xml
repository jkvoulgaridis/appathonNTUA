  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Heart disease is the leading cause of death, disability, and healthcare expense in the United
      States. Researchers think a new drug called Fx-5A may be useful to treat different
      cardiovascular diseases and inflammation.

      Objective:

      To understand the safety, tolerability, and effects of Fx-5A.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy people ages 18 and older who are not pregnant

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood tests

      Pregnancy test for female participants

      Participants will stay in the hospital for 36-48 hours. This will include:

      Blood tests

      EKGs: Electrodes will be placed on the participant s chest. The patches are connected to
      cables that will send information from their heart to a machine.

      Single infusion of Fx-5A. A needle will be used to insert a plastic tube into a vein in the
      participant s arm. This tube will remain in the arm for the duration of the hospital stay for
      blood tests.

      Participants will have follow-up visits day 7 and day 28 after their infusion. At these
      visits, they will have blood tests and an EKG.

      Participation will last 5-10 weeks.

    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and elevated
      levels of cholesterol and triglycerides on plasma lipoproteins are major contributing risk
      factors. Therapeutic agents that increase High Density Lipoproteins (HDL) may be useful
      additions to our current treatment approaches for preventing Coronary Heart Disease (CHD),
      because while existing drugs lower Low

      Density Lipoproteins (LDL), they do not fully prevent CHD. A potential new CHD treatment
      strategy has recently been described called Acute HDL Therapy, which involves weekly
      intravenous infusions of HDL, or HDL components (i.e. ApoA-I), or HDL mimetics into patients
      suffering from acute coronary syndrome. In early stage clinical trials, a 5-week course of
      this therapy has been shown to

      rapidly reduce atherosclerotic plaques, as assessed by intravascular ultrasound. The goal of
      Acute HDL Therapy is to rapidly stabilize patients at significant risk for developing a
      myocardial infarction, while concurrently starting them on conventional lipid lowering drugs
      and other agents already known to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction.

      This clinical research project is designed to investigate the safety and pharmacological
      properties of a short synthetic peptide mimic of Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), referred to as
      the 5A peptide (or peptide 5A). This 5A peptide can potentially be used instead of
      recombinant apoA-I in Acute HDL Therapy, and has several potential advantages over the use of
      recombinant apoA-I. When the 5A peptide is combined with sphingomyelin, the complex is
      referred to as the Fx-5A peptide-lipid complex. Fx-5A was specifically designed to remove
      excess cellular cholesterol via the ABCA1 transporter, which is thought to be one of the main
      anti-atherogenic functions of HDL. Furthermore, the peptide-lipid complex has been shown to
      mobilize macrophage cholesterol in animal models. Fx-5A markedly decreases the development of
      atherosclerotic plaque in preclinical models, such as in apoE-deficient mice, while also
      decreasing macrophage recruitment and foam cell formation in the rabbit collar model.
      Separately, animal models have shown that Fx-5A can also minimize inflammation associated
      with diseases like asthma, colitis and chronic kidney disease.

      The current research project is designed as a Phase 1A, open-label, dose-escalation study to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of a single
      intravenous infusion of the Fx-5A peptide-lipid complex at 4 different doses in healthy
      subjects. Each of the 4 dosing cohorts (2.5, 5.0, 10.0 and 20.0 mg/kg) will enroll 4
      subjects.

      For each dosing cohort, there are three distinct phases of this study; Screening,
      Intervention, and Follow-Up.

    <description>A 'complete study' is defined by the procedures described up to day 7 after Fx-5A infusion, the intervention phase of the study. A 28 days follow up is designed to study the immunogenicity of the drug. Once a subject completes the day 28 follow up the study is ended for the subject ('end of the study').</description>

    <description>subjects entered into the trial may go thru a 0-4 weeks screening (Screening Phase). On the Intervention phase, subjects will be followed for 7 days which includes: entry criteria assessments and settling at the inpatient unit on Day 0, a single-dose I.V. infusion with data collection on Day 1 followed by 24 hours monitoring (Day 2), a 7-day and 28-day outpatient follow-up visit (Follow-Up Phase).</description>

    <description>subject will receive a slow I.V. infusion of the Fx-5A peptide complex. Five to 10 mL of blood will be collected at 30min (+/- 5min), 1h (+/-10min), 2h (+/-10min), 4h (+/-15min), 8h (+/-30min), 12h (+/-30min), and 24h (+/- 30min) for laboratory tests and to be stored for research tests (The goal will be to collect the samples at the exact time, but a delay within the +/- specified time will not be considered a deviation). The patient will be dismissed, as inpatient, 24-36 hours after the beginning of the treatment.</description>
