      This is a self-report survey utilizing a voluntary, non-probability sampling design. The
      survey instrument will be created in Google Survey© consisting of yes/no, multiple choice and
      free text response questions. This survey instrument questions have been developed
      empirically by the investigators.

      It will be distributed to all gastroenterology fellowship coordinators through an email
      listserv maintained by programs nationwide for the purpose of communicating with their
      trainees. The email will include instructions to share the survey link (Appendix 2) with all
      first/second/third year as well as all advanced gastroenterology fellow s in their programs.
      The survey will be disseminated over a 2 week period. The fellowship coordinator will receive
      three separate emails. The first email (Appendix 2) will be on opening day of the survey
      requesting them to forward the link to their fellows. The second email (Appendix 3) will be
      sent on day 8 of the study period serving as a reminder to participate in the survey with
      link once again attached. The final email (Appendix 4) will be distributed on day 14 of the
      study period serving as a final reminder for fellows to complete the survey if they have not
      already and that the survey will close at midnight. The link will have both the informed
      consent form and the survey. Participants must press a key indicating agreement to get past
      the consent to the survey. The survey will take less than 2 minutes to complete
      electronically. This will be an anonymous survey and will be distributed via a secure online
      platform.

      The results will be compiled using Google Survey© software. No personal identifying
      information will be included.
