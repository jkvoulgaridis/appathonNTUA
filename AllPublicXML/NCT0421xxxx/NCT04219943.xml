      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of conservative
      treatment in treatment of patients over 75 years with impacted femoral neck fracture.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is to compare clinical outcomes between conservative treatment, internal fixation,
      and hemiarthroplasty in patients over 75 years with impacted femoral neck fracture. All the 3
      groups were evaluated by hip pain(visual analogue scale,VAS), hip function(Harris hip
      score,HHS), health related quality of life(European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions index
      scores, Eq-5d). All thses parameters were assessed at admission and 1-, 3-, 6- 12-, 24- and
      36 months after intervention. Operation duration and blood loss were recorded. Mortality,
      union rate, complications and re-operation were also monitored throughout the study.
