  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study mainly evaluated the efficacy and safety of autologous stem cell transplantation
      for the treatment of AL amyloidosis, the role of induction and maintenance therapy in
      autologous stem cell transplantation, and the long-term efficacy and prognosis risk factors
      of autologous stem cell transplantation for the treatment of AL amyloidosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is divided into two parts. In the first part, the investigators retrospectively
      analyze the data of patients with AL amyloidosis who treated with autologous stem cell
      transplantation from July 2010 to December 2019. All patients had a biopsy-proven disease by
      positive Congo red stain with a concomitant demonstration of plasma cell dyscrasia. Organ
      involvement was established according to the criteria established at the 10th International
      Symposium on Amyloid and Amyloidosis. The protocol of ASCT included mobilization with
      colony-stimulating factor alone and conditioning with high-dose melphalan 140 or 200 mg/m2.
      In addition to analyzing the efficacy and safety of all the patients, the investigators also
      analyzed the difference in efficacy between patients in different subgroups. For example,
      subgroups divided according to different induction treatment regimens; subgroups divided
      according to different plasma cell FISH data and FCM data; subgroups divided according to the
      degree of organ involvement, and subgroups divided according to different maintenance
      treatment regimens.

      In the second part of the study, the investigators will conduct a prospective study to
      explore the best autologous stem cell transplantation treatment protocol for AL amyloidosis.
      The protocol includes the induction therapy with bortezomib and daratumumab before ASCT, the
      maintenance treatment with lenalidomide after ASCT, and the treatment options for recurrence
      after transplantation.

        All patients had an amyloid disease, which was confirmed by biopsy and documented plasma
        cell dyscrasia; the AL amyloidosis diagnosis and the assessment of organ involvement were
        based on previous consensus criteria. All patients had received autologous stem cell
        transplantation.
