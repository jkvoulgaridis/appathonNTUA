  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the effectiveness of neck and trunk stabilization exercises on communication
      and quality of life (QoL) in children with cerebral palsy (CP) with oral motor problems.
      Children with CP were randomly divided into Study Group (SG) and Control Group (CG).
      Neurodevelopmental treatment (NDT) approaches and oral motor therapy were applied to both
      groups. SG also received neck-trunk stabilization training.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the multidisciplinary approach, special approaches to secondary problems, oral-motor
      trainings and communication studies are used in addition to Neurodevelopment treatment
      approach in the treatment of children with CP. Because of their impact on postural control,
      neck-trunk stabilization exercises are very important for therapeutic interventions designed
      to improve quality of life with activities of daily living.

      As the increases in neck muscle strength are related to trunk stabilization, trunk
      stabilization exercises are thought to have positive effects on neck muscle strength. In
      addition, since the neck and trunk are complementary to each other, it is supported by the
      literature that neck stabilization exercises and trunk stabilization exercises should be
      applied together.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from VAS was assessed in 0 week (Baseline, in the first session), 6. week (6 weeks after treatment, in the 12th session).</time_frame>
    <description>With VAS, families were asked to mark their communication status with their children. The definitions of the parameter to be evaluated are written on both ends of a 100 mm line. (0= no communication; 10= best communication). According to scale, the higher scores mean a better communication status</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living (ADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Katz was assessed in 0 week (Baseline, in the first session), 6. week (6 weeks after treatment, in the 12th session).</time_frame>
    <description>Measures the capacity of a child to perform the activities that he/she has to do frequently in his/her daily life. The index has 6 questions. The patient gets 1 point if he/she makes each item independently; 0 points if he/she makes dependent. In the total score, 6 points indicate that patient is independent and 0 points indicate that patient is fully dependent. Higher Katz Index score means the better Activities of Daily Living.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL). Version 4.0- Parent Report for Toddlers (Ages 2-4)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from PedsQL was assessed in 0 week (Baseline, in the first session), 6. week (6 weeks after treatment, in the 12th session).</time_frame>
    <description>It is a quality of life scale that measures health-related quality of life of children. It consists of 21 items. Items are scored between 0-100. The higher total score means a better health-related quality of life.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form 36 Questionnaire (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from SF-36 was assessed in 0 week (Baseline, in the first session), 6. week (6 weeks after treatment, in the 12th session).</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life of mothers was assessed by using the short form 36 questionnaire. It evaluates 8 sub-parameters, consisting of 36 items. 0= poor quality of life; 100= good quality of life. The higher score means a better health-related quality of life</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Viking Speech Scale (VSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from VSS was assessed in 0 week (Baseline, in the first session), 6. week (6 weeks after treatment, in the 12th session).</time_frame>
    <description>This scale has been developed to classify children's speech production. The scale has 4 levels. (Level 1= Speech is not affected by motor disorder; 4= No understandable speech). The low scores mean good speech production.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before the intervention, the evaluation was performed in the first session (only one time).</time_frame>
    <description>The gross motor function of children with cerebral palsy can be categorised into 5 different levels for the clear description of a child's current motor function. The higher level in GMFCS, means a worse and severe outcome. (Level I = Children walk without any limits; Level V= Children are limited in their ability to maintain antigravity head and trunk postures and control leg and arm movements). The low levels means good motor function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Communication Function Classification System (CFCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before the intervention, an evaluation was performed in the first session (only one time).</time_frame>
    <description>CFCS provides 5 levels (CFCS I, II, III, IV, V) to describe everyday communication performance. The higher level in CFCS means a worse and severe outcome. Level 1= effective sender and receiver with unfamiliar and familiar partners; level 5=seldom effective sender and receiver even with familiar partners.
Low levels mean good communication performance</description>

Neurodevelopmental treatment: NDT is a holistic and interdisciplinary clinical practice model informed by current and evolving research that emphasizes individualized therapeutic handling based on movement analysis for habilitation and rehabilitation of individuals with neurological pathophysiology.
Feeding and oral-motor intervention strategies: Feeding and oral-motor intervention strategies have been developed to address difficulties with sucking, chewing, swallowing, and improve oral-motor skills.
Neck and trunk stabilization exercises: Trunk control affects head control. After gaining head control, it causes jaw stability and oral motor control (tongue control and lip closure).</description>

Neurodevelopmental treatment: NDT is a holistic and interdisciplinary clinical practice model informed by current and evolving research that emphasizes individualized therapeutic handling based on movement analysis for habilitation and rehabilitation of individuals with neurological pathophysiology.
Feeding and oral-motor intervention strategies: Feeding and oral-motor intervention strategies have been developed to address difficulties with sucking, chewing, swallowing, and improve oral-motor skills.
Neck and trunk stabilization exercises: Trunk control affects head control. After gaining head control, it causes jaw stability and oral motor control (tongue control and lip closure).</description>
