    <textblock>
      Investigators are building an empirical evidence base for real world data through large-scale
      replication of randomized controlled trials. The investigators' goal is to understand for
      what types of clinical questions real world data analyses can be conducted with confidence
      and how to implement such studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, non-interventional study that is part of the RCT DUPLICATE
      initiative (www.rctduplicate.org) of the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical
      School. It is intended to replicate, as closely as is possible in healthcare insurance claims
      data, the trial listed below/above. Although many features of the trial cannot be directly
      replicated in healthcare claims, key design features, including outcomes, exposures, and
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, were selected to proxy those features from the trial.
      Randomization is also not replicable in healthcare claims data but was proxied through a
      statistical balancing of measured covariates according to standard practice. Investigators
      assume that the RCT provides the reference standard treatment effect estimate and that
      failure to replicate RCT findings is indicative of the inadequacy of the healthcare claims
      data for replication for a range of possible reasons and does not provide information on the
      validity of the original RCT finding.

        This study will involve a new user, parallel group, cohort study design comparing
        dapagliflozin to the DPP-4 inhibitor (DPP4i) antidiabetic class. DPP4is serve as a proxy
        for placebo, since this class of antidiabetic drugs is not known to have an impact on the
        outcome of interest. The comparison against DPP4 inhibitors is the primary comparison. The
        patients will be required to have continuous enrollment during the baseline period of 180
        days before initiation of canagliflozin or a comparator drug (cohort entry date). Follow-up
        for the outcomes (a. 3P-MACE and b. composite of heart failure hospitalization/all-cause
        mortality), begins the day after drug initiation. As in the trial, patients are allowed to
        take other antidiabetic medications during the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients should not meet any exclusion criteria at the time of randomization. If at the

          1. Use of the following excluded medications:

               -  Current or recent (within 24 months) treatment with pioglitazone and/or use of
                  pioglitazone for 2 years or more at any time

               -  Current or recent (within 12 months) treatment with rosiglitazone

               -  Previous treatment with any SGLT2 inhibitor

               -  Any patient currently receiving chronic (&gt;30 consecutive days) treatment with an
                  oral steroid at a dose equivalent to oral prednisolone ≥10 mg (e.g.,
                  betamethasone ≥1.2 mg, dexamethasone ≥1.5 mg, hydrocortisone ≥40 mg) per day

          2. Acute cardiovascular event [e.g., acute coronary syndrome (ACS), transient ischemic
             attack (TIA), stroke, any revascularization, decompensated HF, sustained tachycardia
             &lt;8 weeks prior to randomization. Patients with acute cardiovascular events can be
             enrolled in the run-in period as long as randomization does not occur within 8 weeks
             of the event.

          3. Systolic BP &gt;180 or diastolic BP &gt;100 mmHg at randomization

          4. Diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes mellitus, MODY, or secondary diabetes mellitus

          5. History of bladder cancer or history of radiation therapy to the lower abdomen or
             pelvis at any time

          6. History of any other malignancy within 5 years (with the exception of successfully
             treated non-melanoma skin cancers)

          7. Chronic cystitis and/or recurrent urinary tract infections (3 or more in the last
             year)

          8. Any conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may render the patient unable
             to complete the study including but not limited to cardiovascular (NYHA class IV CHF,
             recurrent ventricular arrhythmias) or non-cardiovascular disease (e.g., active
             malignancy with the exception of basal cell carcinoma, cirrhosis, chronic lung
             disease, severe autoimmune disease) and/or a likely fatal outcome within 5 years

          9. Pregnant or breast-feeding patients

         10. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study or other dapagliflozin studies
             (applies to AZ, BMS, Hadassah and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] or
             representative staff and/or staff at the study site)

         13. Individuals at risk for poor protocol or medication compliance during run-in period
             (reasonable compliance defined as 80 - 120%, unless a reason for non-compliance is
             judged acceptable by the Investigator). If for any reason, the Investigator believes
             that the patient will not tolerate or be compliant with IP or study procedures, the
             patient should not be randomized and considered a run-in failure. Patients will be
             excluded during run-in and should not be randomized if the following are observed from
             laboratory or observation during enrollment and run-in assessments:

         14. HbA1c ≥12% or HbA1c&lt;6.5%

         15. AST or ALT &gt;3x ULN or Total bilirubin &gt;2.5 x ULN

         16. CrCl &lt; 60 ml/min (based on the Cockroft-Gault equation)

         17. Hematuria (confirmed by microscopy at Visit 1) with no explanation as judged by the
             Investigator up to randomization. If bladder cancer is identified, patients are not
             eligible to participate.

         18. Any reason the Investigator believes the patient is not likely to be compliant with
             the study medication and protocol.
