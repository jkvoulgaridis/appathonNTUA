  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antimicrobial resistance rates have reached alarming levels and the Worlds Health
      Organisation (WHO) states it constitutes a serious public health concern by threatening one
      of the most effective and mortality lowering interventions in modern medicine. Part of the
      solution to this problem includes minimizing overuse of antibiotics. But clinical signs alone
      are often not reliable to guide antibiotic treatment decisions and additional tests may be
      warranted to assist the doctor. Such tests include point-of-care biomarkers of infection like
      C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT). Targeting antibiotic use to the few
      patients with a high probability of benefit and withholding in the many with non-serious
      respiratory infection is a promising strategy and readily implemented in clinical practice.

      The Procalcitonin guided Antibiotics in Respiratory Infections (PARI) study will assess the
      effect of a novel point-of-care PCT guided antibiotic stewardship in acute respiratory tract
      infections in general practice.

      The overall aim of the PARI study is to reduce antibiotic use in patients with acute
      respiratory tract infections by targeting antibiotic treatment only to patients with a
      suspected bacterial etiology and thus likely to benefit from antibiotic therapy.

      The main research questions are:

      Does the addition of a point-of-care Procalcitonin test to standard care reduce antibiotic
      use in primary care? Is the intervention safe for the patients? The PARI study is a pragmatic
      two-arm (intervention and control (standard care) open randomized non-inferiority trial (up
      to 1 day difference in recovery) in general practice.
