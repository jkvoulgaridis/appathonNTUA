    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is emerging as an epidemic in 3rd world countries. Despite significant
      therapeutic advances, patients with chronic heart failure remain at high risk for HF
      progression and death. The two primary goals of its management are preventing further disease
      progression(mortality, hospitalizations and deterioration of left ventricular function)and
      alleviating patient suffering.Sacubitril /valsartan (previously known as LCZ696) is a
      first-in-class medicine that contains a neprilysin (NEP )inhibitor(sacubitril) and an
      angiotensin II receptor blocker (valsartan). NEP is an endopeptidase that metabolizes
      different vasoactive peptides including natriuretic peptides, bradykinin and Ang -II. In
      consequence, its inhibition increases mainly the levels of both natriuretic peptides
      (promoting diuresis, natriuresis and vasodilation) and Ang- II whose effects are blocked by
      the angiotensin receptor blocker, valsartan (reducing vasoconstriction and aldosterone
      release).

    <description>Sacubitril/valsartan is a combination of a neprilysin inhibitor, sacubitril and an angiotensin II receptor blocker, valsartan.
The recommended starting dose is one 49/51 mg (sacubitril/valsartan) tablet twice-daily. Double the dose of Sacubitril/valsartan after 2 to 4 weeks to the target maintenance dose of 97/103 mg (sacubitril/valsartan) twice-daily, as tolerated by the patient.
Reduce the starting dose to 24/26 mg (sacubitril/valsartan) twice-daily for:
Patients not currently taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) or previously taking a low dose of these agents.
Patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl less than 30 ml/min)
Patients with moderate hepatic impairment. (Child Pugh B) Double the dose of Sacubitril/valsartan every 2 to 4 weeks to the target maintenance dose of 97/103 mg (sacubitril/valsartan) twice-daily, as tolerated by the patient</description>

    <description>Sacubitril/Valsartan is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with chronic heart failure (NYHA Class II-IV) and reduced ejection fraction.
Sacubitril/Valsartan is usually administered in conjunction with another heart failure therapies, in place of an ACE inhibitor or other ARB.</description>
