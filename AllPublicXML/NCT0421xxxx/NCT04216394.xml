    <textblock>
      While DOACs are increasing in use in the EGS patient population, the risk of bleeding and the
      reversal of these agents to reduce hemorrhage is still evolving. Given the paucity of data
      regarding the impact of DOACs in this patient population, it becomes empiric to identify
      bleeding patterns and outcomes in the EGS population taking DOACs. We hypothesize that
      patients taking a DOAC will have a higher bleeding incidence and need for an unplanned
      intervention secondary to hemorrhage in EGS patients undergoing an urgent or emergent
      operation when compared to patients taking warfarin and antiplatelets.

      Emergency general surgery (EGS) represents illnesses of diverse pathology with
      urgent/emergent treatment needs being the common denominator.(1) A characteristic feature of
      EGS is its limitation in patient preparation. It is difficult and often impossible to
      eliminate certain patient dependent factors to reduce the operative risk. It has been
      reported that the annual case rate in the EGS population is (1,290 per 100,000) higher than
      the sum of all cancer diagnoses.1 The EGS burden is substantial and continues to increase.
      The elderly patient population represents 48% of the overall EGS population. With the
      increase in the prevalence of atherosclerotic disease in the elderly there has been an
      increase in the use of antiplatelets and anticoagulants.(2,3)
