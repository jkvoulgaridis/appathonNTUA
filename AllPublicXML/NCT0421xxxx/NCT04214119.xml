      This study is to identify potential biomarkers for the early detection of Barrett's
      Esophagus, esophageal carcinoma (both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma). Esophageal
      and gastric cytology will be collected via sponge capsule. Candidate genes will be tested
      with DNA isolated from these samples in order to identify optimal biomarkers to differentiate
      between Barrett's esophagus and esophageal/gastric cancer versus normal esophageal/gastric
      tissue.

    <description>Using DNA methylation, we plan on identifying, from a pool of highly selected marker candidates, the best biomarkers that are aberrantly methylated in Barrett's esophagus versus control in order to differentiate between subjects who have Barrett's esophagus and those who do not have Barrett's esophagus. This is measure using methylation index and the calculated probability score from different methylation index values.</description>
