  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of autologous adipose-derived
      mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs) plus autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP) in the treatment of
      severe knee osteoarthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centered, randomized, single blind phase II clinical study. Patients will be
      divided into two groups of case and control. Patients of case group will receive
      intra-articular injection of autologous AMSCs suspended in 3 ml autologous PRP for 3 times,
      patients of control group will receive intra-articular injection of 3 ml of autologous PRP
      for 3 times. The investigators designed this clinical study to evaluate therapeutic effects
      of AMSCs in patients with severe knee osteoarthritis.

    <time_frame>From before randomization until 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment start.</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation the changing of pain density measured by Visual Analogue Scale. Draw a 10 cm horizontal line on the paper. One end of the line is 0, indicating no pain; the other end is 10, indicating severe pain; and the middle part indicates varying degrees of pain. The patient selects a point from the horizontal line and the length from 0 to this point is the Visual Analogue Scale score.</description>

    <measure>Cartilage repair</measure>
    <time_frame>From before randomization until 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment start.</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of cartilage repair under MRI. Recht criterion was used for grading articular cartilage injury of knee joint, including 0-IV grade, in which: 0 grade, normal articular cartilage, no obvious abnormal signal was found; 1 grade, the layered structure of cartilage disappeared, and there were focal low signal areas, but the surface was smooth; 2 grade, the surface of cartilage was irregular, the depth of cartilage injury was less than 50% cartilage thickness; 3 grade, the surface of cartilage was heavy. The degree of injury is irregular, the depth of injury is more than 50% of the thickness of cartilage or through the whole layer, but the surface of cartilage is not completely exfoliated; Grade IV, full-thickness cartilage defect, articular cartilage injury deep to the cortex, subchondral bone exposed.</description>

    <description>Evaluation of the health-related quality of life change Measured by MOS item short from health survey(SF-36) after each cell injection. SF-36 is a self-administered questionnaire comprising 36-items measuring eight dimensions of general HRQOL: physical functioning (10 items), role limitation due to physical health problems (4 items), bodily pain (2 items), general health perceptions (5 items), vitality (4 items), social functioning (2 items), role limitations due to emotional problems (3 items), and general mental health (5 items).These outcomes will be grouped as physical component summary and mental component summary. The norm data is 0-100, the health related quality of life is increases as the scores are increased. The average score is 50.</description>

    <time_frame>From before randomization until 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment start.</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of severity of knee symptoms Lequesne Index includes the measurement of pain (5 items), walking distance (2 items), and activities of daily living (4 items). Maximal score is 24 and higher scores represent worse function</description>

    <measure>Change in knee society score (KSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From before randomization until 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment start.</time_frame>
    <description>The knee society score is divided into four parts: it consists of the ''Symptoms''(25 points), the ''Patient satisfaction''(40 points), the ''Patient expectation''(15 points) and the ''Functional activities''(100 points). Each part will be evaluated separately.Higher scores indicate better knee score/satisfaction/functioning or higher expectations.</description>
