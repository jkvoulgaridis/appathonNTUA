    <textblock>
      Complete occlusion of the Internal carotid artery (ICA) by atherosclerotic disease (COICA)
      causes approximately 15%-25% of ischemic strokes in the carotid artery distribution. Patients
      treated with medical therapy have a 7%-10% risk of recurrent stroke per year for any stroke
      and a 5%-8% risk per year for ipsilateral ischemic stroke during the first 2 years after ICA
      occlusion. Internal carotid artery occlusion causes an estimated 61,000 first-ever strokes
      per year in the US an incidence more than twice the annual occurrence of ruptured
      intracranial aneurysms Additionally, 40% of subjects with COICA who present with transient
      ischemic attack (TIA) and 70% of COICA who present with stroke have cognitive decline with
      increased risk of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's' disease (AD) with time (2,3).

      Symptomatic COICA subjects are at increased risk of developing cognitive impairment and
      progressive development of vascular dementia and AD with time. Our proposal leverages several
      compelling retrospective and prospective preliminary data from human to perform this
      exploratory trial with go/no-go criteria to proceed to a phase 3 based on the data generated

      Study Design:

      This is a phase 2 randomized single-center open label clinical trial with randomization of
      1:1 to either best medical management vs. best medical management and endovascular
      revascularization of COICA.

      Screening, Enrolling, &amp; Randomization:

      All subjects who presents to our tertiary hospital with a diagnosis of COICA will undergo
      full evaluation including 1) documenting previous history of transient ischemic attack (TIA)
      and/or stroke; 2) cervical and brain CT angiography (CTA) to document complete occlusion; 3)
      CT perfusion (CTP) to assess for presence of penumbra evident by increased mean transient
      time (MTT) in the ipsilateral side of COICA; and 4)MontReal cognitive assessment (MoCA)
      score. If any subject is found to have complete occlusion of COICA, evident of
      abnormal/prolongation of MTT on CTP, previous history of TIA and or stroke, and MoCA &lt;26 &amp; â‰¥
      23, then further evaluation is obtained including: MRI spectroscopy to assess for
      presence/absence of lactate in the ipsilateral watershed area (centrum semiovale), and size
      of ipsilateral hippocampus and amygdala, additional cognitive testing battery, and digital
      subtraction angiography (DSA) to document adequately the type of COICA the subject have (type
      A-D).

      If any subject does not have complete occlusion, or complete occlusion but no abnormalities
      on CTP and/or MoCA &gt;26, then the subject is excluded and no further testing needed (see
      exclusion criteria).

      If the subject meets all inclusion criteria, then a baseline of complete neurological
      testing, full demographics, CTA or MRA, CTP, MoCA, additional neurological testing, MRI
      spectroscopy and DSA are obtained and subject is randomized 1:1 to either best medical
      management or best medical management + endovascular balloon angioplasty and stenting. Follow
      up clinic visits are arranged at 3 and 12 months. Repeat testing of MoCA and additional
      cognitive testing battery are done at these clinical follow-up visits (3 and 12 months). MRI
      of the brain and DSA is performed at 1 year follow-up to assess brain bio-markers and
      revascularization respectively.

    <description>This is one outcome that reflects the overall cognition. The composite cognitive score at 12-month follow-up is assessed by a composite z score based on average z score for the tests for each subject (sum of the z scores divided by the number of tests included) from a specifically designed battery of 14 cognitive tests. Scores from tests in the proposed neuropsychological battery will be converted to z-scores. This is the following battery:
Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA),Wide Range Achievement Test-5 (WRAT-5); Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - IV (WAIS-IV); WAIS-IV, Coding subtest; WAIS-IV, Matrix Reasoning subtest; Hopkins Verbal Learning Test ; Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT) ; Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA) Test; Boston Naming Test;Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination, Complex Ideational Material subtest;Trail-Making Test, part A and part B; Beck Depression Inventory-Fast Screen (BDI-FS);Iowa Scales of Personality Change (ISPC).</description>
