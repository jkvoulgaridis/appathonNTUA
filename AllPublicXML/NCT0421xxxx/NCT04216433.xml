  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the spirit of improving patient safety and quality of healthcare in our region, the
      Dallas-Fort Worth Hospital Council Education and Research Foundation (Foundation) and Baylor
      Research Institute sought and obtained federal funding support (AHRQ grant) to develop an
      Abdominal Aortic Aneurism (AAA) surgery registry in North Texas. Participating centers will
      directly benefit from this project and will have access to a de-identified version of the
      registry data through their collaboration. These data may be used for quality improvement
      initiatives and/or to conduct your own research. In summary, this effort represents a
      substantial investment (with no costs to facilities) in improving outcomes for patients with
      AAA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, little is known about who receives which type of surgery. What data are available
      are largely from single-centre studies, with study populations of a few hundred to a thousand
      patients, comparing outcomes for open and endovascular repair and collecting patient
      characteristic data largely for risk adjustment. Data on endovascular vs open AAA repair from
      the population-based registry will provide important information regarding the current use of
      these two treatment strategies, as well as allowing comparison of long-term outcomes for each
      according to different patient characteristics.

      The proposed registry has the potential to provide means for internal quality assessment for
      the participating institutions. The de-identified registry will be made available to
      researchers at their request. This registry, focusing on AAA in the Dallas-Fort Worth
      metroplex, will provide data with the potential to improve treatments for more than 800,000
      patients in the US.
