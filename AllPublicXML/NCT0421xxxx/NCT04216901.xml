      This is an artificial intelligence-based optical endoscopic polyp diagnosis system that can
      assist endoscopic doctors in diagnosing polyps and improve the quality of training in
      clinical Settings.

    <textblock>
      Large sessile and laterally spreading colorectal lesions(LSLs) are increasingly encountered
      during colonoscopy. LSLs have an increased risk of harbouring invasive cancer and can be
      challenging to excise endoscopically. Wide-field endoscopic mucosal resection (WF-EMR) is
      widely used in treating LSLs. In the East, meanwhile endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD)
      is the dominant technique due to its ability to achieve en bloc resection in over 80% of
      cases. Many papers have demonstrated that selective-esd has the highest economic benefit. The
      key is to find a reliable way to select.

    <time_frame>2019.12.24-2020.12.31</time_frame>
    <description>Calculate the accuracy of ai's judgment on whether ESD should be implemented.Accuracy is: the machine over a period of time to judge the results are consistent with the pathological lesion number of molecules, all lesions detected by a period of time for the denominator expressed as a percentage.The gold standard is the pathological results of diagnostic treatment. After the specimen was removed, the area suspected by endoscopists of early cancer was marked with Indian ink for pathological recovery.The specimens were then placed in formalin and fixed for 24 hours until the ink was a little dry.Even if the specimen is cut into 2mm-wide shapes, the suspected area can be identified by Indian ink staining under a microscope.The doctor suspected cancer patients were followed up for 60 days.</description>

    <time_frame>2019.12.24-2020.12.31</time_frame>
    <description>Calculate the accuracy of the machine in locating the field of vision.The accuracy was as follows: the visual field localization results of the machine on the ESD intraoperative lesion screen captures were the numerator consistent with the number of visual fields determined by multiple endoscopists, and the number of visual fields of all localization in the same operation was the denominator, and the result was expressed as a percentage.The consistent results of visual field positioning by multiple endoscopic physicians watching the operation video were the gold standard.Patients with suspected cancer were followed up for 60 days, and the most serious pathological diagnosis within 60 days was taken as the diagnosis of the patient's disease.Patients whose doctors deemed no risk were followed until the end of colonoscopy.</description>
