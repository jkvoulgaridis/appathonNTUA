  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pneumococcal infections remain frequent and potentially fatal. To prevent them, two
      anti-pneumococcal vaccines exist: a 13-valent conjugate vaccine (Prevenar®) and a 23-valent
      polysaccharide vaccine (Pneumovax®). For their utilization, several studies approved a
      prime-boost strategy. It consist two administer Pneumovax® at least two months later than
      Prevenar®. Patients with diffuse large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) have a higher-risk to develop
      a pneumococcal infection. The main reason is immunosuppression, induced by rituximab (B cell
      depletion), chemotherapy and lymphoma. Patients are treated by immunochemotherapy, combining
      rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) and conventional chemotherapy (CHOP). However,
      those patients have a low rate of vaccination (about 15%).

      rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) and conventional chemotherapy (CHOP). However,
      those patients have a low rate of vaccination (about 15%). Also, in the current literature,
      rare studies investigated prime-boost immunogenicity in this relevant population. The
      investigators will evaluate vaccinal response of 10 serotype-specific immunoglobulin G (1, 3,
      4, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, 23F) at different time of treatment.

      The investigators search to compare efficiency of prime-boost anti-pneumococcal vaccination
      according to the time of prevenar administration (before or after immunochemotherapy) and to
      the dose of Prevenar® (single or double-dose).
