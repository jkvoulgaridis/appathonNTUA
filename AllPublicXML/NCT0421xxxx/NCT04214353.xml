  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Explorative study, which evaluates the effect of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) on the
      PSMA ligand uptake on 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT in salivary duct carcinoma patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a transmembrane protein, which is
      expressed on prostate cancers cells and other malignancies. Recently, several ligands have
      been developed that target PSMA. Linked to Gallium-68, this enables diagnostic
      68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT scans. Linked to Lutetium-177 enables therapeutic 177Lu-PSMA Radioligand
      therapy. Most research on the diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities of PSMA has been
      conducted in patients with advanced prostate cancer.

      This research group investigates whether these findings also apply to salivary gland cancer
      (SGC), a rare cancer. Previously the investigators conducted a phase II 68Ga-PSMA imaging
      study (NCT03319641), to evaluate PSMA ligand uptake in locally advanced, recurrent and
      metastatic ACC and SDC (two subtypes of SGC). A relevant PSMA-ligand uptake was observed in
      93% of ACC patients and 40% of SDC patients. However, since 60% of SDC patients showed low
      ligand uptake, these patients are not suitable for PSMA radioligand therapy. For advanced
      SDC, androgen deprivation therapy is often given as first-line treatment, because the
      majority of SDCs are androgen receptor positive. In prostate cancer, androgen deprivation
      therapy (ADT) can increase PSMA-ligand uptake. Therefore the aim is to investigate if ADT can
      increase the uptake of 68Ga-PSMA in patients with R/M SDC, as has previously been
      demonstrated in prostate cancer.

      Objective: The primary objective is to investigate if ADT can increase the uptake of
      68Ga-PSMA in patients with R/M SDC.

      Study design: Interventional clinical trial, an explorative study. Study population: Patients
      with locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic (R/M) SDC AR+ and who will start ADT as
      standard of care.
