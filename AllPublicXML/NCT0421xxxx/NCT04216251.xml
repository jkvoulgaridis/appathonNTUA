      This prospective, single-arm, research study evaluating the effect of AMR101, as a
      chemopreventive agent to reduce risk of colorectal cancer in individuals with a history of
      colorectal adenoma.

        -  AMR101 is made of marine omega-3 fatty acid, which is a family of natural substances
           found in the oil of certain fish, such as salmon and mackerel. Marine omega-3 fatty acid
           cannot be produced in sufficient amount by the human body and has to be obtained through
           diet or supplemented to maintain normal function in the body.

        -  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved AMR101 as a treatment for
           any disease.

        -  AMR101 is commercially available in the US as VASCEPA (icosapent ethyl)

        -  The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment
           including evaluations and follow up visits, including:

             -  Lifestyle questionnaire,

             -  Nutritional survey

             -  Flexible sigmoidoscopy (24 biopsies of normal colorectal mucosa, one stool sample)

             -  Blood samples,

        -  AMR101 administered daily, orally for 8-12 weeks and it is expected 80 participants will
           take part.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Participants must meet the following criteria on screening examination to be eligible to
        participate in the study:

          -  Underwent screening or surveillance colonoscopy with removal of at least one adenoma;

          -  Age 18-80 years.

               -  This study will only include adult participants because colorectal carcinogenesis
                  in children is more likely to be related to a cancer predisposition syndrome with
                  distinct biological mechanisms compared with sporadic colorectal cancer in
                  adults. Patients over age 80 will not be enrolled since the benefits and risks of
                  AMR101 over the age of 80 have not yet been well-characterized.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A)

          -  The effects of AMR101 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,
             women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration
             of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while she is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          -  Subjects must be able and willing to follow study procedures and instructions.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be eligible
        for admission into the study

          -  Currently using or have used any fish oil supplement at any dose more than once per
             week within the last month

          -  Regularly consuming more than three servings of fish per week.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to fish or compounds of similar chemical or
             biologic composition to omega-3 fatty acid.

          -  Diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, liver or kidney disease, bleeding diathesis

          -  Any prior diagnosis of gastrointestinal cancer (including esophageal, small intestine,
             colon, pancreatic), or any diagnosis of other cancers (with the exception of
             nonmelanoma skin) in which there has been any active treatment within the last three
             years.

          -  Known diagnosis of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) or Hereditary Non-Polyposis
             Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC, Lynch Syndrome).

          -  Any adenoma that was not completely removed during previous colonoscopy.

          -  Known bleeding tendency/condition (e.g. von Willebrand disease) or history of peptic
             ulcer or gastrointestinal bleed, endoscopic complications, or contraindication to
             colonoscopy.

          -  Current use of anticoagulant therapies, including Heparin, Warfarin, Dalteparin
             sodium,Bivalirudin, Argatroban, Lepirudin, Heparin Sodium, Heparin/Dextrose, and an
             unwillingness or inability to discontinue anticoagulants.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Inability or unwillingness to abstain from non-protocol use of fish oil supplements or
             to provide blood or stool samples or colon biopsies during the study.

          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Inability or unwillingness to swallow pills.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding. The effects of AMR101 on the developing human fetus are
             unknown. For this reason,women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform
             her treating physician immediately. Similarly, lactating women are excluded from this
             study because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with AMR101. Consequently, breastfeeding
             should be discontinued if the mother is enrolled on the study.

          -  Known positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus, or
             acute or chronic hepatitis B infection. Participants with these infections are
             ineligible because they are at increased risk of significant complications in the
             perioperative period, and because fresh tissue from patients with these infections
             cannot be harvested for research purposes, per institutional policy. Appropriate
             studies will be undertaken in participants receiving combination antiretroviral
             therapy when indicated.
