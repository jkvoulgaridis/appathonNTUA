  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general research question posed was 'How effective is a healthy lifestyle intervention
      using behavioural change strategies in the prevention of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)?'.

      The main aim was to assess the effectiveness of a healthy lifestyle intervention implemented
      for 12 weeks via face-to-face group sessions and by using social media tools (Facebook and
      WhatsApp) for young adults at risk of T2DM.

      The hypothesis was that this healthy lifestyle intervention may be effective in terms of
      initiating an increased physical activity (PA) level and a healthy balanced dietary intake
      resulting in improvements of other T2DM risk factors at 12 weeks.

      The specific research question posed was 'Is a healthy lifestyle intervention using Social
      Cognitive Theory (SCT)-based PA and dietary strategies implemented for 12 weeks through
      face-to-face group sessions and social media tools effective in the initiation and
      maintenance of increased PA level and healthy balanced dietary intake, resulting in
      improvements of T2DM risk score, anthropometrics, metabolic parameters and SCT-related
      psychosocial factors among Bruneian young adults at risk of T2DM?'.

      Study design was two-arm parallel, stratified with simple randomisation, and assessor-blinded
      randomised controlled trial. Participants were randomly allocated into intervention group and
      control group. Participants were students and alumni of Universiti Brunei Darussalam and
      Universiti Teknologi Brunei who were overweight-obese at risk of T2DM with a mean age of 23.1
      (2.48) years old. Intervention group went through a healthy lifestyle intervention using
      evidence-based SCT strategies emphasising on PA and diet for 12 weeks, while the control
      group only received leaflets on healthy lifestyle with no further guidance. Outcomes measured
      were changes from baseline at week 0 to post-intervention at week 13 between intervention and
      control groups. Outcomes were changes in diabetes risk score, anthropometrics, metabolic
      parameters, PA, dietary intake and SCT-related psychosocial factors, with repeated-measures
      ANOVA as the main analysis.

    <description>The main goal was to provide knowledge and skills for targeted population in order for them to adapt healthy lifestyle throughout their life. At the end of intervention, participants were expected to be fully equipped with necessary knowledge and fundamental skills in adapting and maintaining healthy lifestyle throughout their life. Gradual improvements were emphasised and at least 5% loss of initial body weight was expected, aiming for at least 0.5% loss in the first month.
It was divided into three phases (preparation, implementation, maintenance) focusing on PA and diet, in which self-efficacy enhancement and self-regulatory skills were emphasised during the first month of intervention.</description>
