  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To address the multifaceted problems associated with tuberculosis (TB) in-person directly
      observed therapy (DOT), the World Health Organization has recently recommended countries to
      maximize the use of digital adherence technologies. Sub-Saharan Africa needs to early
      investigate the effectiveness of such technologies in local contexts and proactively
      contribute to global decisions around patient-centered TB care. This study aims to evaluate
      the effectiveness of pillbox-enabled self-administered therapy (SAT) over standard DOT on TB
      medication adherence and treatment outcomes in Ethiopia. It also aims to assess the
      usability, cost-effectiveness, and acceptability by patients and healthcare providers of the
      pillbox-enabled SAT. It is designed as a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized,
      controlled, superiority, mixed-methods trial, supplemented with multiphase optimization
      strategy (MOST) for interventions on behavioral and social determinants of adherence.
