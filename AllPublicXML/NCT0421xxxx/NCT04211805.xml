  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunoprophylaxis failure of hepatitis B (HBV) remains a concern and has been reported in
      approximately 10-30% of infants born to highly viremic mothers with HBeAg-positive. Maternal
      HBV DNA &gt;6log10 copies/mL (or 200,000 IU/mL) is the major independent risk for
      mother-to-child transmission (MTCT). Two recent random controlled trial (RCT) studies have
      shown that the use of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF) in highly viremic HBsAg positive
      mothers may safely reduce the rate of MTCT when compared between groups of TDF treated and
      untreated patients. Tenofovir Alafenamide (TAF) is the successor to TDF, and both drugs have
      a similar mechanism of action to reduce HBV DNA levels and normalize serum alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT) in chronic hepatitis B patients (CHB) with few adverse effects. TAF
      however, has a better safety profile with less adverse effects to bone mineral density and
      renal function. The present prospective, double-arm study is to evaluate the non-inferiority
      in the efficacy and safety of TAF therapy versus TDF therapy in highly viremic mothers and
      their infants for the prevention of MTCT in the real world setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, double-arm, multi-center study conducted through 8 centers across
      China. Consecutive 450 mothers who are eligible for the study will be enrolled during
      gestational week 24-28 to receive TDF or TAF based on the patients' preference, and the
      treatment will be discontinued right after the delivery. All infants will receive HBV
      vaccination plus HBIg within 12 hours after birth and the additional HBV vaccination at the
      age of 4 weeks and 24 weeks. Primary outcome assessment will be performed at the infants' age
      of 28 will be collected to evaluate non-inferiority in the safety and efficacy of TAF therapy
      versus TDF therapy. These parameters will be extracted from test results of serum
      biochemistries, hematology, and virology, including but not limited to aspartate
      aminotransferase (AST), ALT, HBV DNA levels, and serological status of HBV (HBsAg, HBeAb,
      HBcAb, HBeAg, and HBsAg).

      All aforementioned clinical parameters will be extracted at three timepoints for assessment:
      the baseline, i.e. the start of TAF/TDF treatment, on delivery, and at postpartum week 24-28.
      For the infant, information from two timepoints, at birth and at infant age of 28 weeks, will
      be collected. This information regarding the infant will include the physical parameters
      weight, height, head circumference, HBV DNA levels, HBV serological status, if they received
      hepatitis B immunoglobin (HBIg), if they received the complete series of HBV vaccine. All
      relevant information regarding the patient will be logged into a password-protected computer
      for primary and secondary analysis.

      Group A: 225 participating mothers will receive TAF (oral 25 mg tablet daily) starting at
      gestational week 24-28 of pregnancy and continue until delivery. The mothers will be followed
      together with their infants until postpartum week 28.Infants will receive hepatitis B vaccine
      plus HBIg at birth (within 12 hours) and additional hepatitis B vaccine at the age of week 4
      and week 24. Group B: 225 participating mothers will receive TDF (oral 300 mg tablet daily)
      starting starting at gestational week 24-28 of pregnancy and continue until delivery.
      Patients in group B will have similar follow-up schedules as those in the Group A. Infants
      will receive hepatitis B vaccine plus HBIg at birth (within 12 hours) and additional
      hepatitis B vaccine at the age of week 4 and week 24.
