      To evaluate the safety and tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single intravenous
      (IV) dose of ETI-204 in adult volunteers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of a single IV dose of 16 mg/kg ETI-204
      in adult volunteers (210 subjects ETI-204; 70 subjects placebo).

      The total duration of the study for each subject will be approximately 100 days divided as
      follows:

      Screening: Days -28 to -2; In-unit Phase: Day -1, Day 1, and Day 2; Out-of-unit Visits: Day 8
      (±2 days); Day 15 (±3 days); Day 29 (±3 days); Day 43 (±3 days); Final Visit: Day 71 (±4
      days).

      Following completion of a screening visit subjects who qualify for entry into the study will
      be randomized to receive either ETI-204 or matching placebo on Day 1 in a 3:1 ratio. Subjects
      will be discharged from the clinic on Day 2 following completion of study assessments and
      will return for five additional visits on Days 8, 15, 29, 43 and 71.

      The first 12 subjects will be dosed in groups of no more than 4 subjects/day. A blinded
      safety review of the available clinical and laboratory AE data up to and including Day 2 will
      be completed for the first 12 subjects before any additional subjects are dosed. This review
      will be conducted by the Investigator in conjunction with the Clinical Trial Steering
      Committee. If the outcome of this review is satisfactory, dosing of additional subjects will
      be permitted to continue and subjects may be dosed in group sizes larger than 4.

      After Amendment 1, premedication with 50 mg oral diphenhydramine approximately 30 minutes
      prior to the start of study drug infusion was required.

    <description>Serum anti-ETI-204 antibody titers were determined for all subjects in the safety population. Blood samples were collected and serum samples were assayed at an initial dilution of 1:10. Samples that were positive at the 1:10 dilution were serially diluted 1:2 and assayed until a negative result was attained. The titer of the most dilute sample yielding a positive result was recorded as the titer for that time point. Immunogenicity was measured by the number of participants in each study arm with anti-ETI-204 antibody values post-treatment ≥ 4-times higher than baseline at Day 8, 43 or 71, or if the titer was negative at baseline, the post-treatment sample(s) required a titer of at least 1:20 for it to be considered positive.</description>

        <description>Serum anti-ETI-204 antibody titers were determined for all subjects in the safety population. Blood samples were collected and serum samples were assayed at an initial dilution of 1:10. Samples that were positive at the 1:10 dilution were serially diluted 1:2 and assayed until a negative result was attained. The titer of the most dilute sample yielding a positive result was recorded as the titer for that time point. Immunogenicity was measured by the number of participants in each study arm with anti-ETI-204 antibody values post-treatment ≥ 4-times higher than baseline at Day 8, 43 or 71, or if the titer was negative at baseline, the post-treatment sample(s) required a titer of at least 1:20 for it to be considered positive.</description>
