    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate at 12 Months follow-up the association between Atrial
      Fibrillation (AF) and Sleep Apnea (SA) severity based on data measured and stored in REPLY
      200 DR pacemaker.

      The object of the investigation relates to the function named Sleep Apnea Monitoring or SAM
      function. This function is part of the REPLY 200 DR pacemakers, whose intended use is cardiac
      pacing. Sleep Apnea Syndrom (SAS) causes serious social and economic problems, not only
      because of its high prevalence but also because it is associated with increased
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

      Patients with Sleep Apnea often have arterial and pulmonary hypertension, a high risk of
      coronary artery disease, and heart failure, whereas a high percentage of patients show heart
      rhythm disturbances. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of being involved in
      traffic accidents, as well as suffering a decline in their family, social, and professional
      lives. Therefore, the prompt diagnosis of these patients could be of great importance. Today
      the gold standard for the diagnosis of SAS is overnight polysomnography (PSG) in a sleep
      laboratory. However, the shortage of sleep laboratories and the high cost of PSG render this
      method inadequate for widespread screening. For these reasons, in recent years, there have
      been attempts to develop alternative diagnostic with a view to simplify the diagnosis.

      Thanks to the feature SAM included in the pacemaker, sequences of respiratory cycles are
      analyzed to detect, to count and to report abnormal breathing events during the night. This
      analysis is based on the Minute Ventilation (MV) signal. The MV signal represents the real
      time expansion/contraction of the thorax of the patient. It is derived of the transthoracic
      impedance periodic measurements. The device is able to provide the physician with day-by-day
      Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI) equal to the sum of events divided by the number of hours
      per night. Physician will also access to the total number of events over the previous night
      presented per hour.

    <measure>Evaluate at 12 Months follow-up the association between Atrial Fibrillation (AF) and Sleep Apnea (SA) severity based on data measured and stored in the pacemaker.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is to prove that the difference in AF occurrence between severe SA patients versus non severe is greater or equal to 6 % after 12 Months follow-up. AF will be measured using the Fallback Mode Switch duration (FMS) and SA using the Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI), both stored in the device.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Collect all major serious adverse events as reported by the investigator during the duration of the study corresponding to death, myocardial infarction, stroke and re- intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The co-primary endpoint is to evaluate the rate of composite endpoint of all major serious adverse events as reported by the investigator over 18 months follow up corresponding to death, myocardial infarction, stroke and re-intervention (at least one of the 4 types of major SAE per patient). These major SAE will be also assessed by type.</description>

    <measure>Assess prevalence of SA in pacemaker population based on RDI measured and stored in the pacemaker at 1, 6, 12 and 18 Months.</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 6, 12 and 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The prevalence of SA will be calculated considering the sum of SA patients out of all patients having performed the given follow up.
Patients known as treated for SAS could not be taken into account in a secondary analysis.</description>

    <description>Same method as described in outcome 1 except in this secondary objective, a patient will be considered as presenting subclinical AF when presenting between enrolment and a given follow up (M1, M6, M12 or M18) at least one fallback mode switch episode as following:
1st case: below or equal to 6 minutes in the same day
2nd case: between 6 minutes and 6 hours 17 in the same day
3rd case: strictly greater than 6 hours17 in the same day.</description>

    <time_frame>1, 6, 12 and 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Same method as described in outcome 1 except in this secondary objective, a patient will be considered as presenting AF based on the FMS burden value. FMS burden is the time spent in fallback mode switch divided by the follow up period in days. This FMS will be measured between 2 consecutives available follow up: enrolment and M1, then M1 and M6, M6 and M12, M12 and M18.</description>

    <time_frame>1, 6, 12 and 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The AF episode diagnosed on clinical assessment will be collected in CRF at each follow up (M1, M6, M12 and M18). The RDI stored at the date of each AF event will be collected. We will then measure out of all AF events, how many of them are associated with a severe Sleep Apnea (RDI &gt;=20).</description>

    <description>The aim of this secondary objective was to observe how cardiologists in their routine practice would use this new information offered by SAM function (RDI). In particular, the physician process to decide whether he/she refers the patient to a sleep specialist will be observed. At each follow up the cardiologist asked the patient whether he/she had any visit to a sleep specialist since the last follow-up (pneumologist, neurologist, Ear Nose and Throat specialist …).
For the patients evaluable at each of the scheduled visits, the number and percentage of patients who made a visit to a sleep specialist were to be presented overall and by the type of specialist (pneumologist, neurologist, Ear Nose and Throat specialist, etc) for severe and non-severe SA patients.</description>

    <description>The aim of this secondary objective was to observe whether patients will undergo further sleep investigations (Polygraphy, Polysomnography…).
At each follow up the cardiologist asked the patient whether he/she had any sleep exam since the last follow-up (Polygraphy, Polysomnography, oxymetry). Then the data was filled in the patient CRF.
For the patients evaluable at each of the scheduled visits, the number and percentage of patients who underwent a sleep exam were to be presented overall and by the type of test (Polygraphy, Polysmonography, Oxymetry, etc).</description>
