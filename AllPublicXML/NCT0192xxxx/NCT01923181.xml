    <measure>Change in HbA1c (Glycosylated Haemoglobin)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in HbA1c was evaluated at week 26. The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from the on-treatment without rescue medication observation period, which was the time period when a participant was on treatment with trial product, excluding any period after initiation of rescue medication and/or premature trial product discontinuation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjects Who Achieve (Yes/no) HbA1c Below 7 Percent (53 mmol/Mol)</measure>
    <time_frame>After 26 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who achieved HbA1c &lt;7.0%, was evaluated at week 26. The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from the on-treatment without rescue medication observation period, which was the time period when a participant was on treatment with trial product, excluding any period after initiation of rescue medication and/or premature trial product discontinuation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Body Weight</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in body weight was evaluated at week 26. The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from the on-treatment without rescue medication observation period, which was the time period when a participant was on treatment with trial product, excluding any period after initiation of rescue medication and/or premature trial product discontinuation.</description>

    <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in waist circumference was evaluated at week 26. The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from the on-treatment without rescue medication observation period, which was the time period when a participant was on treatment with trial product, excluding any period after initiation of rescue medication and/or premature trial product discontinuation.</description>

    <measure>Change in Body Mass Index (BMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in body mass index (BMI) was evaluated at week 26. The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from the on-treatment without rescue medication observation period, which was the time period when a participant was on treatment with trial product, excluding any period after initiation of rescue medication and/or premature trial product discontinuation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) Recorded</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0-31</time_frame>
    <description>TEAEs were recorded during weeks 0-31 (26 weeks treatment period+5 weeks follow-up period). Adverse events (AEs) with onset during the on-treatment observation period were considered treatment-emergent. On-treatment observation period: Time period when a participant was on treatment with trial product, including any period after initiation of rescue medication.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Confirmed Hypoglycaemic Episodes Recorded</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0-31</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment-emergent confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes were recorded during weeks 0-31 (26 weeks treatment period + 5 weeks follow-up period). Hypoglycaemic episodes with onset during the on-treatment observation period were considered treatment-emergent. On-treatment observation period was defined as the time period when a subject was on treatment with trial product, including any period after initiation of rescue medication. Confirmed hypoglycaemic episode is an episode that is severe according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) classification or plasma glucose value &lt;3.1 mmol/L with or without symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia.</description>
