  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Existing literature investigating the impact of smoking cessation on new-onset diabetes
      mellitus (DM) risk is conflicting.

      Combing the need for smoking cessation and body weight self-management to prevent the
      progression of prediabetes stage into DM, with the public implementation of the
      second-generation cessation program, we aimed to study the effectiveness of smoking cessation
      and body weight control in prediabetic smokers regarding glucose control and new-onset DM.

      Participants We recruit study participants at National Taiwan University Hospital and its
      Yunlin branch. All participants gave informed consent, with personal data protected. Only
      individuals aged 30 to 75 years are included. A history of diabetes, hypertension, FTND,
      alcohol consumption, physical activity, depression, sleep quality, and current medications is
      collected through standardized personal interviews. Prediabetic participants are those
      repeatedly having either of the following: 1) plasma glucose 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9
      mmol/L) in the fasting state; 2) plasma glucose 140 to 199 mg/dL (7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L) two
      hours after a 75-g oral glucose load; 3) glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) 5.7% to 6.4%, in the
      absence of diabetic medications. Prediabetic participants who smoke ≥10 CPD for at least 6
      months are classified as prediabetic smokers. Excluded are those with existing diagnosis of
      DM, thyroid diseases, acute cardiac conditions within 3 months, acute renal failure, chronic
      glomerulonephritis, polycystic kidney disease, mental health disorders ever diagnosed by
      psychiatrists, pregnancy, breast-feeding, malignancy; or current use of diabetic medications,
      smoking cessation medications, steroids, lithium or antipsychotics. The study protocol was
      approved by the National Taiwan University Hospital Research Ethics Committee.

      Intervention group At baseline, all prediabetic smokers were asked if they want to join the
      second-generation smoking cessation program. Participants who decided to receive intervention
      were referred to smoking cessation clinics at National Taiwan University Hospital and its
      Yunlin Branch. Participants in this group could receive their medications up to 16 weeks
      within one year. Each participant also received counseling for individualized techniques for
      smoking cessation and body weight control at each visit. We do not prescribe the nicotine
      replacement therapy (NRT) because it may induce insulin resistance and confound our study
      outcome. Bupropion is not available for smoking cessation in our institutions. Varenicline
      users are encouraged either to set their quit day 8 days after starting the medication; or to
      freely choose quit day at any time between Days 8 and 35 after starting treatment (i.e.,
      following drug titration that took place within the first week). Varenicline users are also
      forbidden to use NRT during the study period. Varenicline is administered according to the
      manufacturer's directions, and a 1- to 4-week supply of medicine is prescribed at every
      clinic visit. During the therapy course, physicians are allowed to adjust varenicline dosage
      according to tolerability. Drug adverse events, withdrawal symptoms, and perceived barriers
      to quitting should be recorded and addressed. Physicians should emphasize that if there are
      any uncontrolled depressed moods, suicidal thoughts, or attempts, they are to cease
      varenicline treatment and consult a psychiatrist immediately.

      At the end of the program, smoking status is assessed by self-reported 7-day point-prevalence
      abstinence, confirmed by a breath CO level of less than 3 ppm. Cotinine is not used to assess
      abstinence because, when used with self-report to indicate whether a person has smoked, CO
      and cotinine levels show high agreement. We provide participants in the intervention group
      with individualized counseling to help minimize the relapse rate.

      Usual care group Participants who decide not to receive intervention and only received usual
      care are classified as the usual care group. This usual-care practice includes explanation of
      blood test results and encouragement to do a therapeutic lifestyle change.
