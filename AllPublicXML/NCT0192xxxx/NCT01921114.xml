  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to confirm whether the AngioDynamics BioFlo™ Peripherally
      Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) is associated with less formation of blood clots compared to
      another commercially available PICC.

  <detailed_description>

      Purpose:

      To investigate whether the BioFlo™ PICC will be associated with a reduced incidence of
      catheter-related venous thrombosis (including both symptomatic and asymptomatic) compared to
      another commercially available PICC: the Bard® PowerPICC SOLO2®

      Design:

      This is a randomized, multi-center clinical study. The study is designed as a two-arm
      prospectively controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the study or
      control catheter using a 1:1 schema.

      Enrollment:

      Four hundred sixteen (416) patients will be enrolled at four (4) to eight (8) study sites in
      order to obtain 354 evaluable patients.

      Study Objectives:

      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the incidence of catheter-related
      venous thrombosis in patients receiving either the 5 Fr BioFlo™ PICC catheter or the control
      catheter, i.e., the 5 Fr Dual-Lumen PowerPICC SOLO2® catheter.

      Secondary objectives of this study are to investigate:

        -  Incidence of other catheter-related complications, inclusive of catheter occlusion,
           catheter-related infection, technical failures, and premature catheter removals

        -  Incidence of catheter occlusion (independently from other catheter-related
           complications)

      Additionally, economic outcomes with respect to medical resource utilization requirements
      will be compared between the two catheter groups (at US sites only).

          2. Is ≥ 18 years of age

          3. Is expected to require use of a PICC for a minimum of 10 days

          4. Has normal findings on initial ultrasonography (complete Ultrasound Checklist)

          5. Vein used for PICC placement must be a minimum of 5mm in diameter

Incidence of other catheter-related complications, inclusive of catheter occlusion, catheter-related infection, technical failures, and premature catheter removals
Incidence of catheter occlusion (independently from other catheter-related complications)</description>
        <time_frame>Up to 30 days post-insertion</time_frame>
        <population>The study was prematurely terminated and the PI was blinded to study data, and therefore never had access to the data and does not have any information that might help us locate it. Additionally, AngioDynamics' IT team ran a thorough search for any data related to this study and no results were found.</population>
