  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether low-dose (LD) CT is noninferior to standard-dose (SD) computed
      tomography (CT) as the first-line imaging test in adolescents and young adults in regard to
      negative appendectomy rate (NAR).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Acute appendicitis is a very common disease. Many patients are adolescents or young
           adults.

        -  CT is the current standard imaging test for the diagnosis of appendicitis.

        -  In recent years, the awareness of carcinogenic risk associated with CT radiation has
           increased.

        -  According to a recent single-institutional randomized controlled trial, LD CT (employing
           a quarter of standard radiation dose) was found to be noninferior to SD CT with respect
           to NARs in adolescents and young adults with suspected appendicitis.

        -  However, LD CT is not yet widely accepted.

        -  To establish LD CT as the first-line imaging test, a multi-institutional study is needed
           to confirm the generalizability of the prior single-institutional study.

    <measure>Negative Appendectomy Rate</measure>

    <description>Negative appendectomy rate was defined as the percentage of negative (unnecessary) appendectomies among all non-incidental appendectomies. As a secondary analysis, negative appendectomy rate in an alternative definition was calculated by excluding cases with appendiceal neoplasms without superimposed appendicitis, as appendectomy would be clinically necessary in such patients. Any surgery performed for the treatment of presumed appendicitis was counted as non-incidental appendectomy, even though the surgical procedures were more extensive than simple appendectomy (e.g., ileocectomy).</description>

    <description>The percentage of negative appendectomies among all randomized cases. In January, 2016, when more than 2000 patients were enrolled, the data and safety monitoring board noted a between-group imbalance in the number of appendectomies. Because of the concern that such an imbalance might potentially jeopardize the comparability for the prespecified endpoints, the study protocol was amended to adopt the following additional secondary endpoints, which were assessed among all randomly assigned patients: the number of appendectomies, number of negative appendectomies, prevalence of perforated appendicitis, and prevalence of non-perforated appendicitis.</description>

    <ipd_description>The LOCAT Group has an active standpoint for sharing the LOCAT data, which is in line with the proposal from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. The LOCAT Group will share de-identified individual-participant data underlying the main LOCAT results no later than 6 months after the publication of the results. The data will be kept in a publicly available website and freely available to anyone upon request.</ipd_description>

        <title>Negative Appendectomy Rate</title>
        <description>Negative appendectomy rate was defined as the percentage of negative (unnecessary) appendectomies among all non-incidental appendectomies. As a secondary analysis, negative appendectomy rate in an alternative definition was calculated by excluding cases with appendiceal neoplasms without superimposed appendicitis, as appendectomy would be clinically necessary in such patients. Any surgery performed for the treatment of presumed appendicitis was counted as non-incidental appendectomy, even though the surgical procedures were more extensive than simple appendectomy (e.g., ileocectomy).</description>
