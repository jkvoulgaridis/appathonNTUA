      The purpose of this study is to determine the response of acne patients and healthy control
      patients to the P. acnes bacteria. Half a tube of blood will be drawn from all participants
      to determine whether or not they have antibodies to the P. acnes bacterium. Anywhere from 1
      to 4 skin biopsies of acne pimples or normal control skin will be taken from all subjects for
      further analysis in the lab to determine whether the inflammation in these pimples can be
      reduced using anti-P.acnes antibodies.

    <measure>Level of Antibody to CAMP(Christie-Atkins-Munch-Petersen) Factor</measure>
    <time_frame>post biopsy</time_frame>
    <description>Antibody titers were determined by using recombinant CAMP factor or green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a capture antigen for coating onto a enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate. The endpoint was defined as the dilution of serum on CAMP factor-coated wells producing the same Optical Density(570-450) as a 1/100 dilution of serum on GFP-coated wells. Sera negative at the lowest dilution tested were assigned endpoint titers of 100. The data were presented as geometric mean endpoint ELISA titers.</description>

               1. Healthy subject with no active skin disease or history of skin disease

               2. Diagnosis of moderate-to-severe truncal acne diagnosed clinically and confirmed
                  using the modified Leeds criteria with no reported use of topical acne treatments
                  within the past 2 weeks prior to enrollment in the study, and no reported use of
                  oral acne treatments during the past 4 weeks prior to enrollment in the study

               3. Diagnosis of moderate-to-severe truncal acne diagnosed clinically and confirmed
                  using the modified Leeds criteria who has used any topical acne treatments in the
                  2 weeks prior to enrolling in the study, or who has used any oral acne treatments
                  during the 4 weeks prior to enrolling in the study 2. Age 18-60 years 3. Male or
                  female of any race and ethnicity 4. Subject agrees to comply with study
                  requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

             with a history of active or malignant disease (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) as
             determined by the participant's medical history.

          5. Subjects with a history of psychiatric disease or history of alcohol or drug abuse
             that would interfere with the ability to comply with the study protocol

          6. Subjects with significant concurrent medical condition(s) at screening that in the
             view of the investigator prohibits participation in the study (e.g., severe concurrent
             allergic disease, condition associated with malignancy, and condition associated with
             immunosuppression)

          7. Active viral or fungal skin infections at the target areas

          8. Are currently receiving lithium now or within the last 4 weeks.

        <title>Level of Antibody to CAMP(Christie-Atkins-Munch-Petersen) Factor</title>
        <description>Antibody titers were determined by using recombinant CAMP factor or green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a capture antigen for coating onto a enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate. The endpoint was defined as the dilution of serum on CAMP factor-coated wells producing the same Optical Density(570-450) as a 1/100 dilution of serum on GFP-coated wells. Sera negative at the lowest dilution tested were assigned endpoint titers of 100. The data were presented as geometric mean endpoint ELISA titers.</description>
