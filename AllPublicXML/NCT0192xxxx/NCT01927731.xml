    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well eltrombopag olamine works in increasing platelet counts
      in patients undergoing transplant. Eltrombopag olamine may help platelet counts and the
      immune system recover from blood or bone marrow transplant.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the rate of platelet engraftment by day 60 in patients undergoing cord blood
      transplant (CBT) or haploidentical donor stem cell transplantation treated with eltrombopag
      (eltrombopag olamine).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess safety of eltrombopag in this population. II. To assess neutrophil engraftment
      with eltrombopag in this population. III. To characterize immune reconstitution. IV. To
      assess overall survival (OS). V. To assess progression free survival (PFS). VI. To assess
      incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (CORD BLOOD TRANSPLANT): Patients receive eltrombopag olamine orally (PO) once daily
      (QD) for 60 days beginning on day -1.

      ARM II (HAPLOIDENTICAL DONOR STEM CELL TRANSPLANT): Patients receive eltrombopag olamine PO
      QD for 60 days beginning on day 5.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months.
