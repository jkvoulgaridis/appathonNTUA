  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      steady-state PK and confirm the dose of EVG/r in HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral
      treatment-experienced children 4 weeks to &lt;18 years of age.

      The study consists of 2 parts: Part A and Part B. Part A will enroll participants with
      suppressed viremia (HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL) or failing a current antiretroviral (ARV)
      regimen (HIV-1 RNA &gt; 1,000 copies/mL only for participants in Cohort 2, Part A) to evaluate
      the steady state PK and confirm the dose of EVG. Part B will enroll participants who are
      failing a current ARV regimen (HIV-1 RNA &gt; 1,000 copies/mL) to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, and antiviral activity of EVG. The study consists of 4 age cohorts with each
      cohort including 2 parts (Part A and Part B) with the exception of the adolescent age cohort
      (Cohort 1: 12 to &lt; 18 years old) containing Part B only.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were enrolled at study sites in North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. The first participant was screened on 26 August 2013. The last study visit occurred on 03 November 2017.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>48 participants were screened.
The study was discontinued after enrollment of only Cohort 1, Part B and Cohort 2, Part A. The study close-out was triggered by the voluntary withdrawal of single-agent Vitekta® sale based solely on low utilization of the product, and was not a result of any ongoing or new safety issue.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Tanner Stage (pubic hair and breasts for females; pubic hair and genitalia for males) at Week 24 visit was summarized using frequency count and percentage. Tanner Stages is a scale that defines physical measurements of development based on external primary and secondary sex characteristics.

        <title>Tanner Stage Evaluation by Sex at Week 48</title>
        <description>Tanner Stage (pubic hair and breasts for females; pubic hair and genitalia for males) at Week 48 visit was summarized using frequency count and percentage. Tanner Stages is a scale that defines physical measurements of development based on external primary and secondary sex characteristics. It was used in this study to assess pubertal development with values ranging from Stage 1 (pre-pubertal characteristics) to Stage 5 (adult or mature characteristics).</description>
        <time_frame>Week 48</time_frame>
        <population>Participants in the Safety Analysis Set with available data were analyzed. Tanner Stage Assessments were not defined for participants with screening HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL because there were no postbaseline assessments scheduled in the protocol for these participants.</population>

            <description>EVG 50 mg, or 85 mg, or 150 mg tablet administered QD for at least 48 weeks, based on body weight and dependent on the coadministered background regimen. (Background regimen may consist of the following PI/r: LPV/r, ATV/r, DRV/r, TPV/r, or FPV/r. Use of additional antiretrovirals in background therapy was allowed.). After Week 48, participants were given the opportunity to continue receiving EVG in an extension phase, during which they attended study visits every 12 weeks, until they reached 18 years of age and EVG was commercially available for use in adults in the country in which they were enrolled; the age-appropriate EVG formulation became commercially available in the country in which they were enrolled; or Gilead elected to terminate the development of EVG.</description>
