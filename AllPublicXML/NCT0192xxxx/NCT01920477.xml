  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a rare, chronic, debilitating, and potentially life-threatening
      autoimmune disorder that is characterized by mucocutaneous blisters. Ofatumumab is a novel
      monoclonal antibody (mAb) that specifically binds to the human CD20 antigen, which is
      expressed only in B lymphocytes.

      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of
      ofatumumab injection for subcutaneous use (ofatumumab SC) 20 milligrams (mg) administered
      once in every 4 weeks, (with an additional 20 mg loading dose [i.e. 40 mg total] at both Week
      0 and Week 4) in subjects with PV. It was anticipated that with sustained B-cell depletion in
      the presence of ofatumumab SC, and the resultant reduction of pathogenic anti Dsg
      (desmoglein) autoantibodies in PV, that clinical remission of the disease would result.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Novartis terminated the development of the PV program and this study was terminated for
      non-safety reasons

  </detailed_description>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Novartis has acquired the rights to ofatumumab and terminated the OPV116910 and OPV117059
    studies. This decision is not linked to any safety consideration.

             Period.

          -  At least 1 previous episode of a failed steroid taper (ie, disease flare/relapse) at a
             prednisone/prednisolone dose &gt;10 mg/day. The following criteria must have been met as
             evidence of disease severity at the time of the failed steroid taper: a) A Pemphigus
             Severity of Clinical Disease score of moderate (2) or severe (3) (may be
             historical/retrospective assessment). b) Required a treatment change at the time of
             the failed steroid taper of at least one of the following: i) A steroid increase to
             &gt;=20 mg/day OR ii) The addition of immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory agent/treatment
             OR iii) A dose increase of immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory agent/treatment

          -  Screening anti-Dsg antibodies consistent with a diagnosis of PV (ie, elevated antiDsg3
             antibodies).

          -  Has initiated and received a stable dose of prednisone/prednisolone from a minimum of
             20 mg/day (example: 0.25 mg/kg/day for an 80 kg person) up to a maximum of 120 mg/day
             or 1.5 mg/kg/day (whichever is higher) for &gt;=2 weeks prior to randomization.

          -  Has exhibited PV disease control, defined as no new lesions for &gt;=2 weeks.

             Women who are &lt;2 years postmenopausal are required to have menopausal status confirmed
             by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels at the screening
             evaluation. If FSH and estradiol levels do not provide confirmation of menopause,
             subject will be considered to be of childbearing potential.

             product or medically significant adverse effects (including allergic reactions) from
             cetirizine (or antihistamine equivalent) or paracetamol/acetaminophen.

          -  Prior treatment with rituximab without achieving disease control within 6 months of
             initiating rituximab dosing.

          -  Prior treatment with immunosuppressant or immunomodulation agents within the protocol
             specified periods

             noninvasive basal cell and squamous cell skin carcinoma and cancer diagnoses with a
             duration of complete response (remission) &gt;5 years

          -  Significant concurrent, uncontrolled medical condition that could affect the subject's
             safety, impair the subject's reliable participation in the study, impair the
             evaluation of endpoints, or necessitate the use of medication not allowed by the
             protocol. This includes subjects who require any systemic steroid treatment for a
             concurrent medical condition (other than pemphigus vulgaris).

          -  Use of an investigational drug or other experimental therapy within 4 weeks, 5
             pharmacokinetic half-lives, or the duration of biological effect (whichever is longer)

          -  Electrocardiogram (ECG) showing a clinically significant abnormality or showing a QTc
             interval ≥450 msec (≥480 msec for subjects with a bundle branch block)
