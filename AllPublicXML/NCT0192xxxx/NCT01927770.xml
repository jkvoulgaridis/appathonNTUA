      Background:

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the process of consenting participants to whole
      exome/genome sequencing and its outcomes. It is unknown how best to consent people to this
      new technology. NO GENOME SEQUENCING IS OFFERED AS PART OF THIS STUDY. This protocol is a
      companion to other NIH studies that involve genomic sequencing. Participants must be enrolled
      in a parent NIH study that is collaborating on this consent study to be eligible. Currently
      this involves only one NIH study.

      Objectives:

      - To learn the best way to help participants understand sequencing, so they can decide
      whether to join studies that use it.

      Eligibility:

        -  Adults at least 18 years old who are enrolled in a National Institutes of Health (NIH)
           study that uses WES/WGS.

        -  Adults at least 18 years old whose children are enrolled in an NIH study that uses
           WES/WGS.

      Design:

        -  Participants will take part in the study either in person or over the phone.

        -  Participants will review two sequencing consent forms with a genetic counselor.

        -  Before and after meeting with the counselor, participants will answer several questions
           about sequencing. Each questionnaire will take about 15 minutes.

        -  Six weeks later, participants will answer questions about sequencing. This will take
           about 15 minutes.

      Consent to participant in studies that include whole exome and whole genome sequencing
      (WES/WGS) studies and to receive results present challenges to achieving informed consent due
      to the scope, depth and uncertainty of the information. NIH Intramural studies increasingly
      involve WES/WGS to identify elusive primary variants. This umbrella protocol aims to compare
      an evidence-based consent for WES/WGS to a standard consent in collaboration with ongoing and
      future NIH studies. An equivocal hypothesis will be tested to evaluate whether informed
      choice and perceptions of uncertainty differ between two consent

      groups. A mixed-methods design is proposed that starts with a qualitative mental-model pilot

      study to revise an expert opinion consent intervention by integrating lay-person response

      preferences. Following development of this evidence-based intervention, a randomized two-
      factor design will be used for a quantitative survey study conducted in conjunction with a

      number of NIH studies conducting WES/WGS to test for differences between two consent

      models. A descriptive analysis of the audiotaped consent process will also be conducted to

      assess differences in the content or extent of the process, and related outcomes of
      satisfaction and decisional conflict will also be assessed.
