      To compare the efficacy of flexible dosing of brexpiprazole with placebo in subjects with
      agitation associated with dementia of the Alzheimer's type
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Behavioral symptoms, such as agitation, are core features in subjects with Alzheimer's
      disease and related dementias and develop in the majority of dementia subjects. The presence
      of agitation in subjects with Alzheimer's disease places a significant burden not only on
      subjects and their caregivers but also on the healthcare system.

      This is a trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of flexible dosing of
      brexpiprazole in the treatment of subjects with agitation associated with dementia of the
      Alzheimer's type. The trial consists of a 12-week double-blind treatment period with a 30-day
      follow-up. The trial population will include male and female subjects between 55 and 90 years
      of age (inclusive) with a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease, who are residing either
      in an institutionalized setting or in a non-institutionalized setting where the subject is
      not living alone.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 12/Early Termination in the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From screening to week 12/early termination</time_frame>
    <description>The CMAI is widely used in clinical research for evaluation of agitation associated with Alzheimer's dementia, with reliability and validity in both institutionalized and noninstitutionalized participants. It consists of 29 items, all rated on a 1 to 7 scale (1=Never and 7=Several times in an hour), with 1 being the &quot;best&quot; rating and 7 being the &quot;worst&quot; rating. The total score is the sum of ratings for all 29 items. The possible total scores range from 29 to 203. The total score will be unevaluable if less than 24 of the 29 items are recorded. If 24 to 28 of the 29 items are recorded, the total score will be the mean of the recorded items multiplied by 29 and rounded to the first decimal place. The mean change from baseline (Day 0) to week 12 in the CMAI total score is reported. Statistical comparison of interest was brexpiprazole flexible dose versus placebo, analyzed using a mixed-effect model repeated measure approach. A decrease in score indicates improvement in symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness (CGI-S) Score, as Related to Symptoms of Agitation</measure>
    <time_frame>From screening to week 12/early termination</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of agitation for each participant was rated using the CGI-S. The investigator (or designee) answered the following question: &quot;Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill (as related to agitation) was the participant at the observation period?&quot; Response choices were 0 = not assessed; 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; and 7 = among the most extremely ill participants. The score 0 (= not assessed) was set to missing. The CGI-S was therefore a 7-point scale (1-7). The primary analysis used a mixed-effect model repeated measure approach.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted at 62 sites in 9 countries: Bulgaria, Canada, Finland, France, Russia, Slovenia, Ukraine, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US) and 270 participants were randomized. The date of the first ICF signed by a participant in this trial was 28 October 2013 and the date of the last trial observation was 30 March 2017.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The screening period ranged from 2 to 42 days (with an option to extend with approval of the medical monitor). The screening period was to determine the participant’s eligibility and to washout prohibited concomitant pharmacotherapy prior to randomization.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 12/Early Termination in the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) Total Score</title>
        <description>The CMAI is widely used in clinical research for evaluation of agitation associated with Alzheimer's dementia, with reliability and validity in both institutionalized and noninstitutionalized participants. It consists of 29 items, all rated on a 1 to 7 scale (1=Never and 7=Several times in an hour), with 1 being the &quot;best&quot; rating and 7 being the &quot;worst&quot; rating. The total score is the sum of ratings for all 29 items. The possible total scores range from 29 to 203. The total score will be unevaluable if less than 24 of the 29 items are recorded. If 24 to 28 of the 29 items are recorded, the total score will be the mean of the recorded items multiplied by 29 and rounded to the first decimal place. The mean change from baseline (Day 0) to week 12 in the CMAI total score is reported. Statistical comparison of interest was brexpiprazole flexible dose versus placebo, analyzed using a mixed-effect model repeated measure approach. A decrease in score indicates improvement in symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change in the Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness (CGI-S) Score, as Related to Symptoms of Agitation</title>
        <description>The severity of agitation for each participant was rated using the CGI-S. The investigator (or designee) answered the following question: &quot;Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill (as related to agitation) was the participant at the observation period?&quot; Response choices were 0 = not assessed; 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; and 7 = among the most extremely ill participants. The score 0 (= not assessed) was set to missing. The CGI-S was therefore a 7-point scale (1-7). The primary analysis used a mixed-effect model repeated measure approach.</description>
