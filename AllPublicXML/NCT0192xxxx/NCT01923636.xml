  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to validate , in the neonatal period, a prognostic score
      for the development of neurosensorineural sequelae at 1 year and at 2 years in neonates
      infected in utero by cytomegalovirus. This score will be based on clinical, imaging and
      biological criteria .

      The second objective of the study is to estimate the prevalence of this infection in France
      and to describe its epidemiology through the screening of 12,000 consecutive neonates.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most frequent cause of congenital neurological
      handicap of infectious origin in industrialized countries. Around 10% of infected neonates
      have symptoms and more than 50% of those will develop long term neurological sequelae and
      sensorineural hearing loss. Among asymptomatic infected neonates 10 to 15% will ultimately
      develop hearing loss. To establish the prognosis of infected neonates remains difficult and
      the purpose of the study is to better define early prognosis factors The true burden of CMV
      congenital infection is unknown in France: the prevalence of the infection as well as the
      description of its epidemiology (proportion of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, rate of
      long term sequelae, proportion of cases following primary or secondary maternal infections)
      are unknown.
