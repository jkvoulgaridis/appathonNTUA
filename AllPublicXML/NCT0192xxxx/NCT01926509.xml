  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of MK-8892 in participants with
      pulmonary arterial hypertension. The primary hypothesis is that the geometric mean of MK-8892
      area under the concentration time-curve from Hour 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24hr) in participants
      with PAH, will be equal to or greater than the efficacious exposure in humans of 0.6 μM•hr.

    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE was any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
