  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3b, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
      study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apremilast monotherapy in subjects with active
      psoriatic arthritis.

      Approximately 214 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either apremilast 30 mg BID
      (twice a day) or identically-appearing placebo, with approximately 107 subjects per treatment
      group.

      This is a 113-week study. The subjects will spend 24 weeks in the double-blind,
      placebo-controlled treatment phase, followed by 28 weeks of active treatment phase (ie, up to
      Week 52 visit). The original treatment assignments (apremilast 30 mg BID (twice a day) or
      placebo) will remain blinded until all subjects have completed their Week 52 visit (or have
      discontinued). After the Week 52 visit, all subjects in the extension phase will continue to
      receive treatment with apremilast 30 mg BID (twice a day) until the end of the study (ie, up
      to Week 104 visit) or until early discontinuation from the trial.

      The study will consist of 5 phases:

        1. Screening Phase - up to 5 weeks

        2. Randomized, Placebo-controlled, Double Blind Treatment Phase - Weeks 0 to 24

        3. Active Treatment Phase - Week 24 to Week 52

        4. Open-label Extension Phase - Week 52 to Week 104

        5. Post-treatment Observational Follow-up Phase

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ-DI is a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. A higher score indicates worse physical functioning, and a negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <description>The SF-36 (v 2.0) is a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health). The physical component summary (PCS) score includes the physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, and general health domains. Minimum clinically important difference (MCID) for the scale scores, as well as the PCS and MCS, is defined as a 2.5-point improvement (increase) from baseline. The summary scores range from 0 to 100, with lower scores reflecting more disability, and higher scores reflecting less disability and better health. The 8 domains are regrouped into the PCS and MCS scores.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study consisted of a 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment phase, followed by a 28-week active treatment phase and a 52-week open-label extension phase, for an overall study duration of 113 weeks. 219 subjects were enrolled from 59 centers across 10 countries.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Randomized participants were stratified by their baseline prednisone use (yes or no) and by their previous disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) use (excluding biologics). Participants were allowed to take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and/or low dose corticosteroids during the study.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Placebo/Apremilast (PBO)</title>
          <description>Participants were randomized to placebo tablets twice daily (BID) during the double-blind, 24-week placebo-controlled phase. Those whose improvement was less than 10% in both swollen and tender joint counts at Week 16 were eligible for early escape (EE), at the discretion of the investigator and transitioned onto apremilast 30 mg BID in a blinded fashion. Those who had a 10% or more improvement in either swollen or tender joint counts at Week 16 were not eligible for early escape. Participants who completed the double-blind, 24-week treatment phase entered into the blinded, active treatment phase for an additional 28 weeks (Week 24 to Week 52) and continued receiving Apremilast 30 mg tablets BID. Participants who completed the active treatment phase entered into the open-label extension phase for an additional year (Week 52 to Week 104) continuing to receive apremilast 30 mg tablets BID until the end of the study (up to Week 104 visit) or until early discontinuation.</description>

        <description>HAQ-DI is a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. A higher score indicates worse physical functioning, and a negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the 36-item SF-36 Physical Component Summary Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>The SF-36 (v 2.0) is a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health). The physical component summary (PCS) score includes the physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, and general health domains. Minimum clinically important difference (MCID) for the scale scores, as well as the PCS and MCS, is defined as a 2.5-point improvement (increase) from baseline. The summary scores range from 0 to 100, with lower scores reflecting more disability, and higher scores reflecting less disability and better health. The 8 domains are regrouped into the PCS and MCS scores.</description>

        <description>HAQ-DI is a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability.

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Disease Activity Score DAS28 (CRP) at Week 16</title>
        <description>The DAS28 measures the severity of disease at a specific time and is derived from the following variables:
28 tender joint count
28 swollen joint count, which do not include the DIP joints, the hip joint, or the joints below the knee;
C-reactive protein (CRP)
Patient's global assessment of disease activity. DAS28 (CRP) scores range from 0 to 9.4. A DAS28 score higher than 5.1 indicates high disease activity, a DAS28 score less than 3.2 indicates low disease activity, and a DAS28 score less than 2.6 indicates clinical remission. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The SF-36 (v 2.0) is a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health). Norm-based scores were used in analyses, calibrated so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10. Higher scores indicate a higher level of functioning. The physical functioning domain assesses limitations in physical activities because of health problems. A positive change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Weeks 52 and 104</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI is a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. A higher score indicates worse physical functioning, and a negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Disease Activity Score (DAS28) at Week 52 and 104</title>
        <description>The DAS28 measures the severity of disease at a specific time and is derived from the following variables:
28 tender joint count
28 swollen joint count, which do not include the DIP joints, the hip joint, or the joints below the knee;
C-reactive protein (CRP)
Patient's global assessment of disease activity. DAS28 (CRP) scores range from 0 to 9.4. A DAS28 score higher than 5.1 indicates high disease activity, a DAS28 score less than 3.2 indicates low disease activity, and a DAS28 score less than 2.6 indicates clinical remission. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in 36-item SF-36 (V2.0) Physical Functioning Domain Score at Weeks 52 and 104</title>
        <description>The SF-36 (v 2.0) is a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health). Norm-based scores were used in analyses, calibrated so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10. Higher scores indicate a higher level of functioning. The physical functioning domain assesses limitations in physical activities because of health problems. A positive change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) During the 24 Week Placebo Controlled Phase</title>
        <description>A TEAE is an AE with a start date on or after the date of the first dose of Investigational Product (IP). An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence, that may appear or worsen in a participant during the course of study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the participant's health, including laboratory test values regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) was considered an AE. A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward adverse event that is fatal, life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, requires or prolongs existing in-patient hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or a condition that may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>

        <description>A TEAE is an AE with a start date on or after the date of the first dose of Investigational Product (IP). An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence, that may appear or worsen in a participant during the course of study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the participant's health, including laboratory test values regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) was considered an AE. A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward adverse event that is fatal, life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, requires or prolongs existing in-patient hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or a condition that may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>
