      The present study addresses problematic anger and irritability in community dwelling persons
      with traumatic brain injury (TBI). It is designed to test the worth of a novel treatment
      approach called Anger Self-Management Training (ASMT), compared to a treatment offering
      supportive therapy focused on personal readjustment and education, the PRE (Personal
      Readjustment and Education). The project is a 3-center randomized controlled trial employing
      equivalent therapist time and therapeutic structure in the delivery of treatment options. The
      overall aim is to evaluate the relative response rate and correlates of treatment response
      for the ASMT as compared to the PRE.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Problematic anger/ irritability is common, persistent, and difficult to treat after TBI, and
      has a broad impact on community and social function. Anger following TBI is related, in part,
      to deficits in executive function including impaired problem-solving and impaired
      self-monitoring. In this 2-group, 3-center clinical trial with masked outcome assessment, we
      will explore feasibility and efficacy of a manualized, 8-session individual treatment, Anger
      Self-Management Training (ASMT), compared to a treatment using non-specific ingredients of
      therapist attention, education, and psychological support (PRE).

      The ASMT was designed to decrease subjective and objective anger and irritability following
      traumatic brain injury (TBI), using theoretically motivated &quot;active ingredients.&quot; The ASMT
      focuses on 2 executive deficits implicated in anger post TBI, (1) self-awareness and
      self-monitoring and (2) problem-solving. Participants will be randomly assigned in 2:1
      proportion to ASMT or PRE. The PRE treatment is manualized to the same degree as the ASMT,
      but focuses on educational and personal readjustment to injury rather than anger-specific
      strategy training.

      The overall goals are to examine the effects of the ASMT compared to PRE on self-reported
      problematic anger, both 1 week and 2 months after treatment, and to assess the time course of
      treatment response during the treatment phase.

      Specific Aims

        1. To examine the efficacy of ASMT compared to a control treatment (PRE) as measured by
           improvement from baseline to post-treatment on the State-Trait Anger Expression
           Inventory-Revised (STAXI-2) Trait Anger; STAXI-2 Anger Expression-Out; or the Brief
           Anger-Aggression Questionnaire (BAAQ) (primary outcome).

        2. To examine the trajectory of treatment response within the treatment phase of ASMT/ PRE
           as shown by a change on 1 or more of the target scales halfway through the treatment
           (i.e., after 4 of 8 sessions) for those participants who exhibited a positive response
           post treatment (as defined above).

        3. To examine the persistence of treatment effects 2 months after the end of the treatment
           phase.

    <description>Participant report only. The State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-Revised Trait Anger Scale (STAXI-2 TA) measures how often angry feelings are experienced and the Anger Expression-Out (STAXI-2 AX-O) Scale addresses the expression of anger toward other persons or objects in the environment. The Brief Anger-Aggression Questionnaire (BAAQ) is a 6-item self-report scale that measures frequency of &quot;acting-out&quot; symptoms of anger. Overall treatment response is defined as ≥ 1 standard deviation change in the direction of improvement from pre- to 10 wk post-treatment on any 1 of the three anger scales used. Analysis first done by including participants who did not complete the assessment as non-responders (labeled as &quot;missing outcomes included&quot; or &quot;MOI&quot;). Analysis done a second time only using participants who completed the assessment (labeled as &quot;missing outcomes removed&quot; or &quot;MOR&quot;).</description>

        <title>Post-Treatment Response Rate From Baseline on Anger Measures - Participant Report</title>
        <description>Participant report only. The State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-Revised Trait Anger Scale (STAXI-2 TA) measures how often angry feelings are experienced and the Anger Expression-Out (STAXI-2 AX-O) Scale addresses the expression of anger toward other persons or objects in the environment. The Brief Anger-Aggression Questionnaire (BAAQ) is a 6-item self-report scale that measures frequency of &quot;acting-out&quot; symptoms of anger. Overall treatment response is defined as ≥ 1 standard deviation change in the direction of improvement from pre- to 10 wk post-treatment on any 1 of the three anger scales used. Analysis first done by including participants who did not complete the assessment as non-responders (labeled as &quot;missing outcomes included&quot; or &quot;MOI&quot;). Analysis done a second time only using participants who completed the assessment (labeled as &quot;missing outcomes removed&quot; or &quot;MOR&quot;).</description>

    <reported_events>
      <time_frame>Adverse event data were monitored from the first treatment session to the final outcome evaluation. This consisted of a monitoring period of 4 months per study participant. Adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) were queried with a checklist at each data collection episode and each therapy session through study completion (4 months altogether). If endorsed, events were evaluated as to seriousness, duration, resolution date if any, and possible relationship to study procedures.</time_frame>
      <desc>For SAEs, we adhered to a standard definition used in medical trials: any event for which the outcome is death, hospitalization, life-threatening (i.e., person is at risk of death at the time of the event) or the event leads to disability and/or incapacity, or requires intervention to prevent those outcomes. We defined AEs as self-reported emergency care visits, arrests, episodes of violence, thoughts of harming self or others and withdrawal from therapy sessions and/or from the study at large.</desc>
