  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the benefits of using first line heated humidification. The
      primary objective of this research is to determine the effect of high levels of
      humidification delivered by ThermoSmart™ on CPAP adherence. In addition, to determine if it
      is possible to predict which patients benefit the most (i.e. be more adherent with therapy)
      from high levels of humidification delivered by ThermoSmart.

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence with treatment per night averaged over total time period measured via internal software on the CPAP device and reported using InfoSmart™ software. The report will include all the supporting information recorded within the CPAP device.</description>

    <measure>Epworth Sleepiness Score</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective measure of daytime sleepiness. There are 8 questions where the patient picks a scale of 0 = would never doze to 3 = high level of dozing for each questions. There can be a total score of 24. A score of 0-10 indicates normal daytime sleepiness, 11-12 mild excessive daytime sleepiness, 13-15 moderate excessive daytime sleepiness and 16-24 is severe excessive daytime sleepiness.</description>

    <measure>Short Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Collected through the Short Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ-10). The questionnaire has 10 questions which ask how daytime sleepiness has impacted their quality of life. Each question has a scale of 1 = yes extreme to 4 = No. Lower total score (min 10) means that the disease is affecting your quality of life while a higher total score (maximum 40) means that the disease is not affecting your quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Subjective Dry Nose</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured through a visual analog scale. The patient has to mark a cross on the scale to indicate the severity of their symptoms. On the left side of the scale has &quot;not at all&quot; and on the right side of the scale has &quot;extremely&quot;, In order to analyze the data, a ruler from the start of the scale (Left side) to the middle of the cross is measured in cm. The total length of the scale is 14 cm. Therefore, the minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 14. The higher the score means that the participant is experiencing more symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Through a questionnaire, the participant is asked to picked rather they prefer treatment A (No ThermoSmart) or treatment B (ThermoSmart). If they did not pick neither, it is considered no preference.</description>

        <title>Short Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ-10)</title>
        <description>Collected through the Short Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ-10). The questionnaire has 10 questions which ask how daytime sleepiness has impacted their quality of life. Each question has a scale of 1 = yes extreme to 4 = No. Lower total score (min 10) means that the disease is affecting your quality of life while a higher total score (maximum 40) means that the disease is not affecting your quality of life.</description>

        <description>Measured through a visual analog scale. The patient has to mark a cross on the scale to indicate the severity of their symptoms. On the left side of the scale has &quot;not at all&quot; and on the right side of the scale has &quot;extremely&quot;, In order to analyze the data, a ruler from the start of the scale (Left side) to the middle of the cross is measured in cm. The total length of the scale is 14 cm. Therefore, the minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 14. The higher the score means that the participant is experiencing more symptoms.</description>
