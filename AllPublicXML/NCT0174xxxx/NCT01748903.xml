  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective registry is to collect real world, post-marketing data on the
      use of Stryker Target® 360,Target® 2D, and 2nd generation Target® Nano coils for the
      embolization of ruptured or unruptured intracranial saccular aneurysms. Up to 300 patients
      (150 in the TARGET 360°/Helical arm and 150 in the New NANO arm) presenting with intracranial
      aneurysms suitable for coil embolization will be enrolled at up to 20 sites. A post hoc
      analysis comparing Target® 360° and Target® 2D coil technical and clinical endpoints will be
      performed.
