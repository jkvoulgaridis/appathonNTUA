  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the complete remission/complete remission
      with incomplete recovery of blood counts (CR/CRi) rate for relapsed and refractory acute
      myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AML patients with relapsed and refractory disease have very poor outcomes. Sequential
      azacitidine and lenalidomide was recently shown by the PI of this study to be well-tolerated
      and effective in elderly, treatment naïve AML patients. Observations from this study and
      others that have piloted this combination have suggested that patients who received and
      failed prior treatments may also respond to this regimen. Therefore, the sequential
      combination of azacitidine with lenalidomide could potentially improve outcomes for relapsed
      and refractory AML patients by providing them with a treatment option that is tolerable and
      potentially clinically synergistic. To determine the efficacy of this combination in this
      population, we will pilot this phase 2 study.
