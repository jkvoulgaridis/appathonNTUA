  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to examine the extent to which inflammation is affected by acute and chronic opioid
      exposure.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We are interested in learning how the immune system and the inflammation process is effected
      by acute and chronic opioid exposure. Preliminary evidence in animal models show that acute
      opioid exposure leads to decreased inflammatory responses, while chronic opioid exposure
      causes increased inflammatory responses, as measured by local cytokine release at the site of
      injury. Translating these findings to humans will lead to important new mechanistic knowledge
      that may ultimately improve our ability to treat pain.

    <measure>Peltier Device-Heat Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Differences in heat pain are assessed between measurements taken on Day 1 and Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>A hand-held 0.6x0.6 inch metal probe will be brought into contact with the patient's skin. Starting at 95 F, the probe temperature will increase at a rate of 1.8 F per second. The patient will be asked to push a button of a hand-held device as soon as the patient feels pain.</description>

    <measure>Mechanical Pain Stimuli</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes in mechanical pain stimuli will be assessed between measurements taken on Day 1 and Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Pain sensitivity will be tested with three different mechanical stimuli that can elicit mild pain:
Stroking stimulus: skin will be tested with a brush that is moved three times across the lesion
Punctuated stimulus: a metal rod (1/100 of an inch in diameter) mounted onto 10 different weights (0.03-2.9 ounces) will repetitively be placed onto the skin
Blunt stimulus: a flat probe (0.4 inch in diameter) will be placed five times onto the patient's skin</description>

        <description>Pain sensitivity will be tested with three different mechanical stimuli that can elicit mild pain:
Stroking stimulus: skin will be tested with a brush that is moved three times across the lesion
Punctuated stimulus: a metal rod (1/100 of an inch in diameter) mounted onto 10 different weights (0.03-2.9 ounces) will repetitively be placed onto the skin
Blunt stimulus: a flat probe (0.4 inch in diameter) will be placed five times onto the patient's skin</description>
