    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to improve the treatment of veterans with co-occurring alcohol
      dependence and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The PI and co-investigators will conduct
      a controlled clinical trial of topiramate for the treatment of these co-occurring disorders.

    <measure>Change in PTSD symptom severity as assessed by the PTSD Checklist (PCL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL is a 17-item self-report measure reflecting DSM-IV symptoms of PTSD. A total symptom severity score (range = 17-85) can be obtained by summing the scores from each of the 17 items that have response options ranging from 1 &quot;Not at all&quot; to 5 &quot;Extremely&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Change in impulsivity as assessed by Delay Discounting</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The DD task provides a measure of impulsivity by evaluating discount rates for rewards delayed by 10 seconds.</description>

    <measure>Change in risk-taking behavior as assessed by the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) is a computerized measure of risk taking behavior.</description>

    <measure>Change in decision-making behavior as assessed by the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is a computerized assessment that evaluates decision making mediated by the prefrontal cortex by tracking the selection of avantageous or disadvantageous electronic cards from four desks.</description>
