      The study's primary aim is to test the hypothesis that an intervention integrating pediatric
      clinic-level quality improvement with home-level behavioral counseling (CQI+BC) will result
      in greater reductions in child cotinine (a biomarker of secondhand smoke exposure) and
      reported cigarettes exposed/day than a clinic-level quality improvement plus attention
      control intervention (CQI+A). A secondary aim is to test the hypothesis that relative to
      CQI+A, CQI+BC will result in higher cotinine-verified, 7-day point prevalence quit rate among
      parents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Child secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) is a significant public health problem that has been
      linked to asthma, acute respiratory illnesses, otitis, and SIDS, and is associated with
      increased risk of cancers, cardiovascular disease, and behavior problems. This project will
      test the effectiveness of a comprehensive multilevel intervention to reduce young children's
      SHSe in minority and medically underserved communities known to have the highest SHSe-related
      morbidity and mortality risk. First, we will provide a clinic-level quality improvement (CQI)
      intervention to improve the care of pediatric patients with SHSe in four pediatric clinics in
      North and West Philadelphia. We will then randomize eligible parents visiting the CQI clinics
      into either a home-level behavioral counseling intervention (CQI+BC) or a home-level
      attention control intervention (CQI+A). In addition to clinic-level intervention, CQI+BC
      provides personalized, behavioral counseling with intensive skills training and support where
      SHSe occurs (in the home), as well as systems navigation to facilitate access to and
      effective use of reimbursable nicotine replacement therapy and smoking cessation medication.
      Participants will complete assessments at pre-treatment, 3-month end of treatment, and
      12-month follow-up.

Over the course of 12 weeks participants receive a home visit designed to orient them to the program and trained health counselors provide multiple individualized phone counseling sessions designed to build coping skills, urge management skills, and self-efficacy. Counseling also includes assistance with goal setting and navigation of local resources.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Pre-assignment clinic-level intervention and referral (recruitment): Across five pediatric primary care clinics in Philadelphia's three largest pediatric health systems (Temple University, Drexel University, and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia), 334 providers conducted the Ask, Advise, Refer clinic-level treatment implemented for this study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Providers referred 2949 parents to the trial: 1280 were not eligible, 598 declined participation, 702 could not be contacted. Of 369 at baseline, 369 completed self-report assessments; 42 did not complete the pre-randomization home-visit child urine (cotinine) pick-up. Thus, 327 participants were randomized between the two treatment conditions.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>This multilevel intervention includes advice and a referral from a pediatrician, behavioral counseling by study staff, and community systems navigation, all designed to reduce pediatric secondhand smoke exposure. Over the course of 12 weeks participants receive a home visit designed to orient them to the program and trained health counselors provide multiple individualized phone counseling sessions designed to build coping skills, urge management skills, and self-efficacy. Counseling also includes assistance with goal setting and navigation of local resources.
