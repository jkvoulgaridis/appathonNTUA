  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether combination therapy with Tolterodine ER and
      Tamsulosin is more effective than monotherapy with tamsulosin alone in reducing stent
      symptoms. The second purpose is to determine if people have less stent discomfort if they
      take these medications starting 2 weeks before the stent is placed

      The investigators hope to show that the addition of Tolterodine ER to Tamsulosin will provide
      added benefits in reducing stent symptoms in patients who have had unilateral placement of a
      ureteral stent.

      The investigators aim to show that the addition of Tolterodine ER to Tamsulosin will provide
      added benefits in ameliorating stent-related symptoms in participants who have had unilateral
      placement of a ureteral stent for urolithiasis. This objective will be assessed by
      determining the mean difference in the urinary symptom index domain of the Urinary Stent
      Symptom Questionnaire, which is a validated tool used to assess stent symptoms. The
      investigators suggest that a 15% further decrease in the index score in the experimental
      group, compared to the control group would represent a clinically significant improvement in
      urinary symptoms, based on the prior studies evaluating lower urinary tract symptoms in
      patients with stents. The investigators hypothesize that combination therapy with Tamsulosin
      and Tolterodine ER will yield greater symptom relief than tamsulosin alone.

      Initially, a 7-day design (medical starts 7 days before stent insertion) was conducted to
      determine whether combination therapy with Tolterodine ER and Tamsulosin is more effective
      than monotherapy with tamsulosin alone in reducing stent symptoms.

      Previous studies showed that tolterodine ER therapy significantly reduces urinary symptoms by
      week 4 of medication therapy. Given the evidence that tolterodine ER requires a longer
      duration to have maximum benefit, in the second phase, investigators increased the duration
      of medication to start 2 weeks prior to surgery and continued for 7 days after surgery, for a
      total of 21 days of medication, to test whether combination therapy is more effective than
      monotherapy in reducing stent symptoms

    <description>The ureteral stent symptom questionnaire contains 36 items from the 5 subscales: urinary index (11-items, total range of scores 11-54, The range of the mean score is 1-4.9), pain (8-items, total range of scores 5-27. Two items are not included in the calculation. The range of the mean score is 0.83-4.5), general health (6-items, total range of scores 4-28. The range of the mean score is 0.67-4.67), work (if stent influence patients work; 7-items, total range of scores 3-15. Four items are not included in the calculation. The range of the mean score is 1-5), and sexual matters (4-items, total range of scores 2-10. Two items are not included in the calculation. The range of the mean score is 1-5). In all cases, higher scores indicate worse outcomes. The score for each subscale is summed and divided by the number of items on the subscale.

        <title>Ureteral Stent Symptom Questionnaire Score Up to 24 Hours Prior to Stent Insertion</title>
        <description>The ureteral stent symptom questionnaire contains 36 items from the 5 subscales: urinary index (11-items, total range of scores 11-54, The range of the mean score is 1-4.9), pain (8-items, total range of scores 5-27. Two items are not included in the calculation. The range of the mean score is 0.83-4.5), general health (6-items, total range of scores 4-28. The range of the mean score is 0.67-4.67), work (if stent influence patients work; 7-items, total range of scores 3-15. Four items are not included in the calculation. The range of the mean score is 1-5), and sexual matters (4-items, total range of scores 2-10. Two items are not included in the calculation. The range of the mean score is 1-5). In all cases, higher scores indicate worse outcomes. The score for each subscale is summed and divided by the number of items on the subscale. The group mean for each subscale is reported, the score is not normalized.</description>

          <description>The ureteral stent symptom questionnaire contains 36 items from the 5 subscales: urinary index (11-items, total range of scores 11-54, The range of the mean score is 1-4.9), pain (8-items, total range of scores 5-27. Two items are not included in the calculation. The range of the mean score is 0.83-4.5), general health (6-items, total range of scores 4-28. The range of the mean score is 0.67-4.67), work (if stent influence patients work; 7-items, total range of scores 3-15. Four items are not included in the calculation. The range of the mean score is 1-5), and sexual matters (4-items, total range of scores 2-10. Two items are not included in the calculation. The range of the mean score is 1-5). In all cases, higher scores indicate worse outcomes. The score for each subscale is summed and divided by the number of items on the subscale.

Two items are not included in the calculation. The range of the mean score is 0.83-4.5), general health (6-items, total range of scores 4-28. The range of the mean score is 0.67-4.67), work (if stent influence patients work; 7-items, total range of scores 3-15. Four items are not included in the calculation. The range of the mean score is 1-5), and sexual matters (4-items, total range of scores 2-10. Two items are not included in the calculation. The range of the mean score is 1-5). In all cases, higher scores indicate worse outcomes. The score for each subscale is summed and divided by the number of items on the subscale. The group mean for each subscale is reported, the score is not normalized.</description>

      <desc>The study drugs being used are Tamsulosin and Tolterodine ER. Both drugs are FDA-approved for treating specific conditions and are routinely used in urology for other conditions as well. Previous studies showed that most of side effects are bothersome at worst to the patient.</desc>

          <description>Tamsulosin is a selective α1a-blocker (FlomaxTM), generic since 2009. It is an antagonist of α1-mediated contraction of prostate, bladder and proximal urethral smooth muscle, and as such, reduces urethral pressure and resistance, bladder outlet resistance, bladder hyperactivity, and consequently lower urinary tract symptoms.
Tamsulosin: 0.4 mg by mouth once per day.</description>
