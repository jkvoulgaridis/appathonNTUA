  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation is often inadequate due to poor
      guideline adherence. An integrated chronic care program (ICCP) at a specialized AF-clinic was
      found to be superior to usual care provided by a cardiologist in terms of cardiovascular
      hospitalizations and cardiovascular mortality.

      Hypothesis: treatment at a specialized AF clinic is superior to usual care in terms of
      cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations, cost-effectiveness, quality of
      life and guideline adherence.

      Objectives: primary objective is to show that an ICCP reduces cardiovascular hospitalizations
      and mortality.

      Study design: randomized controlled trial with two study arms: usual care provided by
      cardiologists (control) versus integrated chronic care program at a specialized AF clinic
      (intervention) in 8 hospitals in the Netherlands. The RACE4 is an event driven study. A total
      number of 246 events is needed. In total 1716 patients with newly diagnosed AF will be
      included. Total duration of the study is 5 years and 10 months with a minimal follow up of 1
      year. Data is collected at inclusion, after 3, 6, 12 months, every year thereafter and at the
      end of the study.

      Study population: Patients older than 18 year with newly diagnosed AF.

      Intervention: The intervention is delivered through the specialized outpatient AF clinic. The
      multidisciplinary team at the AF clinic consists of a nurse practitioner or physician
      assistant or specialised cardiovascular nurse, cardiologist, and is guided by
      guidelines-based decision support software program based on the applicable ESC guideline
      recommendations. The use of a web-based patient centered management of patient's own
      medication (Medication manager TM) was optional. A standardized diagnostic, treatment and
      follow-up pathway was performed within the ICCP.

The use of a web-based patient centered management of patient's own medication (Medication manager TM) was optional. A standardized diagnostic, treatment and follow-up pathway was performed within the ICCP. In addition, the intervention is based on identifying risk factors and potential problems in patients, and addressing needs through dynamic use of personalized education and adjustment of treatment.</description>
