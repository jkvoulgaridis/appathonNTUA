    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is currently enrolled in a Novartis-sponsored, Oncology Clinical Development &amp;
             Medical Affairs study receiving imatinib and has fulfilled all their requirements in
             the parent study. 2.Patient is currently benefiting from the treatment with imatinib,
             as determined by the investigator. 3. Patient has demonstrated compliance, as assessed
             by the investigator, with the parent study protocol requirements.4. Willingness and
             ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans and any other study
             procedures. 5. Written informed consent obtained prior to enrolling in roll-over
             study. 6.If consent cannot be expressed in writing, it must be formally documented and
             witnessed, ideally via an independent trusted witness.

             Exclusion Criteria:

               -  1. Patient has been permanently discontinued from imatinib treatment in the
                  parent study due to unacceptable toxicity, non-compliance to study procedures,
                  withdrawal of consent or any other reason.

          2. Patient has participated in a Novartis sponsored combination trial where imatinib was
             dispensed in combination with another study medication and patient is still receiving
             combination therapy.

          3. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive hcG laboratory test.

          4. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             during the study and for 30 days after the final dose of imatinib. Male patients must
             use highly effective contraception during the study and for 30 days after the final
             dose of imatinib.

        Highly effective contraception is defined as either:

          -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
             subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation
             methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

          -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
             hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In
             case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been
             confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.

          -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to enrolling). For female patients on the
             study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient.

          -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement of
             an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of hormonal
             contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for example hormone
             vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.

        In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same pill for a
        minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.

        Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12
        months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (i.e. age
        appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy
        (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation at least
        six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the
        woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of
        child bearing potential.

        If a study patient becomes pregnant or suspects they are pregnant during the study or
        within 30 days of the final dose of imatinib, the Investigator/Study Doctor needs to be
        informed immediately and ongoing study treatment with imatinib has to be stopped
        immediately.
