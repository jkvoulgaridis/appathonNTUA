  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are inviting your child to participate in this research study because your
      child is having myringotomy (putting a tiny incision in the eardrum with or without tube
      insertion) under general anesthesia.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a single injection of Dexmedetomidine
      (study medication) decreases the frequency of awaking from anesthesia frightened or agitated
      in children having myringotomy surgery as compared to those children who receive placebo
      (sterile saltwater).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emergence agitation (EA) is common in children, especially in the preschool age group who
      undergo general anesthesia. It has been described as a mental disturbance during the recovery
      from general anesthesia and can consist of hallucinations, delusions and confusion in the
      child. To the parent or caregivers this may be seen as moaning, restlessness, involuntary
      physical activity &amp; thrashing about in bed. Emergence agitation (EA) can result in the child
      losing their intravenous therapy (IV) access &amp; bodily injury. Some agitated children may
      retain vivid memories about their negative experience waking up from anesthesia. This can
      result in seeing new behaviors by the child such as anxiety, nighttime crying and temper
      tantrums. Dexmedetomidine given as an injection into the muscle of children is considered
      investigational, which means it hasn't been approved by the U.S. FDA for treatment of this
      problem in children.

      Immediately following surgery measurements of eye contact, purposeful actions, aware of
      surroundings, restless and crying are observed and recorded using the Pediatric Anesthesia
      Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale in PACU.

      Follow-up is made approximately 3 days after surgery by phone call or/and email with
      parent(s) to see if child has experienced any of the following: sleep disturbances, anxiety,
      eating disturbances, postoperative muscle pain or swelling at the injection site.

    <measure>Participant's Severity of Emergent Agitation (EA) Using the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) Scale in PACU (Post-Op Area).</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of first PACU recovery step, an expected average visit of 30 minutes. Measurements will be observed immediately following subject's awakening from anesthesia.</time_frame>
    <description>The aim/measurement of the study is to determine whether or not a single IM injection of Dexmedetomidine will reduce the severity of Emergent Agitation (EA) in children undergoing Bilateral Myringotomy with/without tubes under general anesthesia.
We used the only validated scale to assess the severity of post operative emergence delirium in pediatrics. This Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale is a composite score of the following items:
Makes eye contact with caregiver.
Child's actions are purposeful.
Child aware of his/her surroundings.
The child is restless.
The child is inconsolable.
Items 1, 2, and 3 are reversed scored as follows: 4-not at all, 3-a little, 2-quite a bit, 1-very much, 0-extremely. Items 4 and 5 are scored as follows: 0-not at all, 1-a little, 2-quite a bit, 3-very much, 4-extremely.
The total score will range from 0 to 20; with 0 indicating no emergence delirium and 20 indicating extreme emergence delirium.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Stay in PACU</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed immediately following surgery, approximately 30 minutes. Measurements will be observed immediately following subject's awakening from anesthesia.</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of stay in the PACU (Post-Op Area) until discharge criteria are met based on modified PADSS score: level of consciousness, physical activity, hemodynamic stability, respiratory stability, oxygen saturation status, post-operative pain, and post-operative emetic symptoms. Duration of time will be measured in total minutes participate is in PACU until discharged.</description>

    <measure>Respiratory Complications Peri-Operative</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration immediately following surgery, approximately 30 minutes. Measurements will be observed immediately following subject's awakening from anesthesia by Anesthesia staff.</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative adverse respiratory events: moderate to severe coughing, oxygen desaturation (SPO2 &lt;90%), breath holding, bronchospasm, aspiration, stridor and/or laryngospasm during PACU duration to discharge. The adverse respiratory events and the adverse hemodynamic events will be documented by the anesthesia provider in the operating room and by the recovery room nurses in the PACU recovery room. All will be blinded to the drug administered. Measurement will be obtained by &quot;yes&quot;/&quot;no&quot; to each possible adverse respiratory event by anesthesia staff.</description>

    <measure>Hemodynamic Instability</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration immediately following surgery, approximately 30 minutes. Measurements will be observed immediately following subject's awakening from anesthesia by Anesthesia staff.</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative adverse hemodynamic events: bradycardia-a decrease in heart rate, hypotension-a decrease in systolic blood pressure (both determined as a 30% decrease from baseline) during PACU duration to discharge. The adverse hemodynamic events will be documented by the anesthesia provider in the operating room and by the recovery room nurses in the PACU recovery room. All will be blinded to the drug administered.Measurement will be obtained by &quot;yes&quot;/&quot;no&quot; to each possible adverse respiratory event by anesthesia staff.</description>

    <description>Behavioral disturbances analyzed are: sleep disturbances, anxiety, eating disturbances. These post-operative behavioral disturbances are not considered an adverse event. Data regarding postoperative behavioral disturbances will be collected by a blinded individual in a telephone interview 3 days after the surgery. Any &quot;other adverse event&quot; (not including serious) will also be documented by the telephone interview. Measurement will be obtained by &quot;yes&quot;/&quot;no&quot; to each possible AE by staff based on parent(s) response. &quot;Other adverse events&quot; (not including serious) reported immediately post-operatively includes: 1. allergic reaction to medication, 2. Respiratory distress, 3. Bronchospasms 4. Laryngospasm, 5. Hemodynamic instability</description>

        <title>Participant's Severity of Emergent Agitation (EA) Using the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) Scale in PACU (Post-Op Area).</title>
        <description>The aim/measurement of the study is to determine whether or not a single IM injection of Dexmedetomidine will reduce the severity of Emergent Agitation (EA) in children undergoing Bilateral Myringotomy with/without tubes under general anesthesia.
We used the only validated scale to assess the severity of post operative emergence delirium in pediatrics. This Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale is a composite score of the following items:
Makes eye contact with caregiver.
Child's actions are purposeful.
Child aware of his/her surroundings.
The child is restless.
The child is inconsolable.
Items 1, 2, and 3 are reversed scored as follows: 4-not at all, 3-a little, 2-quite a bit, 1-very much, 0-extremely. Items 4 and 5 are scored as follows: 0-not at all, 1-a little, 2-quite a bit, 3-very much, 4-extremely.
The total score will range from 0 to 20; with 0 indicating no emergence delirium and 20 indicating extreme emergence delirium.</description>
        <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of first PACU recovery step, an expected average visit of 30 minutes. Measurements will be observed immediately following subject's awakening from anesthesia.</time_frame>

Dexmedetomidine: Active study agent: Dexmedetomidine at 1 microgram/kilogram Intramuscular (IM) Placebo study agent: Same volume as the study drug of placebo (normal saline).
All blinding, labeling, preparation, storage of agents done by the pharmacist. The drug will be administered into the deltoid muscle by using a TB syringe attached to a 3/4 inch length and 25 Gauge width needle by anesthesia provider after the induction of general anesthesia by the anesthesia provider.</description>
