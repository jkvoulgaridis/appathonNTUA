  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate blood levels of solifenacin succinate (the study
      drug) in children with neurogenic detrusor overactivity after taking a single oral dose. If
      the bladder contracts strongly and without warning, the muscles surrounding the urethra
      (detrusor muscles) may not be able to keep urine from passing. This may happen as a
      consequence of spinal cord defects, and then is called neurogenic detrusor overactivity.

    <description>Safety is monitored by collecting AEs, which includes abnormal laboratory tests, vital signs or ECG data that are defined as an AE if the abnormality induces clinical signs or symptoms, requires active intervention, interruption or discontinuation of study medication or is clinically significant in the investigator's opinion. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE that occurs or worsens after study drug administration. A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: Results in death, is life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in congenital anomaly, or birth defect, requires inpatient hospitalization or leads to prolongation of hospitalization or other medically important events.</description>
