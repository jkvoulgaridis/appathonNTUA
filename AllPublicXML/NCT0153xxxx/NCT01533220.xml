  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The common cold is a major cause of nasal obstruction and reaches children and adults two or
      more times a year. At the moment, there is no cure for the common cold, and therefore the
      reduction of symptoms is the focus of the treatment.

      The study has parallel distribution design, with two equal groups, in which one group will be
      treated by a combination of naphazoline hydrocloride + pheniramine maleate + panthenol and
      the other will receive treatment with naphazoline hydrocloride.
