  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health care benefits and services are received through the Veterans Health Administration
      (VHA), a component of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Over 40,000 Veterans
      across the Veterans Health Administration are diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD), a
      chronic condition that affects motor function as well as cognition, mood, sleep, and
      autonomic function. There are not enough subspecialists to manage every Veteran with
      Parkinson's disease. However, a care model of nurse care managers as catalysts and advocates
      using needs assessments, evidence-based protocols, and VHA and community access coordination
      mechanisms to optimize Parkinson's disease care may improve quality of Parkinson's disease
      care and patient-centered outcomes. If efficacious, this model may be practical to
      disseminate via an existing VHA national consortium network for Parkinson's disease.

      Objectives are (1) to implement then analyze via a randomized controlled trial whether a
      nurse-led, coordinated care management intervention, Care Coordination for Health Promotion
      and Activities in Parkinson's Disease (CHAPS), compared to usual care will improve adherence
      to evidence-based practice guidelines and improve health outcomes in Veterans with
      Parkinson's disease in a region of the southwest United States, and (2) to analyze extent of
      implementation of the CHAPS intervention and its costs to determine how the intervention can
      be made sustainable and disseminated throughout Veterans Affairs Medical Centers if
      efficacious.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a 5-year randomized controlled trial, we enrolled 345 Veterans with PD that were then
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive up to 24 months of a PD care management program, &quot;Care
      Coordination for Health Promotion and Activities in Parkinson's Disease&quot; (CHAPS), or continue
      with usual care. Eligible participants across 5 sites of the Southwest Parkinson's Disease
      Research, Education and Clinical Center (SW PADRECC): Greater Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Loma
      Linda, Long Beach and San Diego VISN 22 (VA Desert Pacific Healthcare Network) facilities
      were identified through administrative data and vetted by physicians. The multi-faceted
      nurse-led intervention, CHAPS, incorporated PD quality improvement (QI) tools to enhance
      proactive Veteran-centered care delivery. PDQI tools included: (1) a structured telephone
      assessment administered by a nurse care manager (NCM) to proactively identify medical
      problems and unmet needs; (2) problem-specific evidence-based interventions organized into
      treatment plans including follow-up/monitoring protocols with VA and community linkages; (3)
      the Siebens Domain Management ModelTM, a structural approach to improve collection and
      organization of health information and enrich communication among providers; (4) Siebens
      Health Care Notebooks prepared with Veteran self-management materials; (5) a Microsoft Access
      care management database, containing the CHAPS Assessment and algorithms for problem
      identification based on Veteran data; and (6) decision-support meetings of NCMs with movement
      disorder specialists. Research interviewers administer a structured telephone survey at
      baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Participants were provided $25 per survey. Medical
      records were abstracted.

      Ongoing analyses (1) measure PD quality indicator adherence, health outcomes, and health
      service utilization; (2) evaluate qualitative and quantitative data to summarize the extent
      of intervention implementation and barriers and facilitators to potential dissemination; and
      (3) examine costs of CHAPS care and cost offset between randomization arms to provide new
      knowledge to aid in future dissemination of the CHAPS Program in a &quot;National Rollout&quot;
      according to the VA Quality Enhancement Research Initiative QUERI process.
