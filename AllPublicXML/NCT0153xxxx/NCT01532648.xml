    <textblock>
      Eligible participants will be randomized to 1 of the following 2 treatment arms:

        1. Budesonide MMX 9 mg (1 tablet)

        2. Placebo (tablet indistinguishable from budesonide MMX 9 mg tablet)

      The assigned study drug will be taken as a single oral tablet each morning after breakfast.
      In addition to the study drug, all participants will continue their existing background oral
      5-ASA regimen during the treatment period.

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Achieved Clinical Remission at Day 56</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission defined as a score of 0 for rectal bleeding and 0 for stool frequency components from the Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index (UCDAI). UCDAI is the sum (0 to 12) of 4 severity scores (0 to 3). Stool frequency and rectal bleeding were based on information recorded in daily participant diaries. The diary entries were averaged for rectal bleeding and stool frequency for 3 days prior to (and closest to) Day 56 with non-missing diary data, within 5 days prior to (and closest to) Day 56. The 5 days did not include any days of the flexible sigmoidoscopy (or colonoscopy) or the preparation for the flexible sigmoidoscopy (or colonoscopy). These averages were rounded to integer values. If either subscore could not be calculated because of missing data, the score for that UCDAI component was set to missing. Participants with insufficient data at Day 56 were excluded from the analysis. Participants who had clinical remission at Baseline were classified as non-responders.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants of Who Achieved Clinical Response at Day 56</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response defined as an improvement in UCDAI from Baseline of ≥3 points with a rectal bleeding score ≤1. UCDAI is the sum (0 to 12) of 4 severity scores (0 to 3). Rectal bleeding was based on information recorded in daily participant diaries. The diary entries were averaged for rectal bleeding for 3 days prior to (and closest to) Day 56 with non-missing diary data, within 5 days prior to (and closest to) Day 56. The 5 days did not include any days of the flexible sigmoidoscopy (or colonoscopy) or the preparation for the flexible sigmoidoscopy (or colonoscopy). These averages were rounded to integer values. If either subscore could not be calculated because of missing data, the score for that UCDAI component was set to missing. Participants with insufficient data at Day 56 were excluded from the analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Achieved UCDAI Remission at Day 56</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>UCDAI remission was defined as a total UCDAI score ≤1 with subscores of 0 for rectal bleeding, stool frequency, and mucosal appearance of the colon. UCDAI is the sum (0 to 12) of 4 severity scores (0 to 3). Stool frequency and rectal bleeding were based on information recorded in daily participant diaries and mucosal appearance was based on endoscopy results. The diary entries were averaged for rectal bleeding and stool frequency for 3 days prior to (and closest to) Day 56 with non-missing diary data, within 5 days prior to (and closest to) Day 56. The 5 days did not include any days of the flexible sigmoidoscopy (or colonoscopy) or the preparation for the flexible sigmoidoscopy (or colonoscopy). These averages were rounded to integer values. If the subscore could not be calculated because of missing data, the score for that UCDAI component was set to missing. Participants with insufficient data at Day 56 were excluded from the analysis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Achieved Endoscopic Remission at Day 56</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening and Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>Endoscopic remission was defined as a score of 0 in the mucosal appearance component subscore of the UCDAI at Day 56. UCDAI is the sum (0 to 12) of 4 severity scores (0 to 3). Mucosal appearance was based on endoscopy results. If the mucosal appearance subscore could not be calculated because of missing data, endoscopic remission was set to missing. Participants with insufficient data at Day 56 were excluded from the analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Achieved Histologic Healing at Day 56</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>Participants achieved histologic healing if histologic assessments of all biopsy specimens were graded as 0 (normal mucosa). If the score for ≥1 sample was missing, the overall score at that visit was set to missing. Participants with insufficient data at Day 56 were excluded from analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Failure at Day 56</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment failure was defined as an unchanged, worsened, or missing UCDAI score at Day 56. UCDAI is the sum (0 to 12) of 4 severity scores (0 to 3). Stool frequency and rectal bleeding was based on information recorded in daily participant diaries and mucosal appearance was based on endoscopy results. The diary entries were averaged for rectal bleeding and stool frequency for 3 days prior to (and closest to) Day 56 with non-missing diary data, within 5 days prior to (and closest to) Day 56. The 5 days did not include any days of the flexible sigmoidoscopy (or colonoscopy) or the preparation for the flexible sigmoidoscopy (or colonoscopy). These averages were rounded to integer values. If the subscore could not be calculated because of missing data, the score for that UCDAI component was set to missing. Participants with insufficient data at Day 56 were excluded from the analysis.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Inflammatory Bowel Disease-Quality of Life (IBD-QoL) Questionnaire Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Days 14, 28, and 56</time_frame>
    <description>The IBD-QoL questionnaire was self-completed by the participant. The IBD-QoL is a disease-specific instrument to evaluate the quality of life of participants with UC. This 32-item questionnaire has 4 dimensions: bowel function, emotional function, systemic symptoms, and social function. The total score is presented, which ranges from 32 to 224, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life. The scores of participants in remission usually range from 170 to 190. If &gt;50% of the questionnaire answers for a particular dimension were missing, this dimension score was set to missing. The total score for the IBD-QoL was the sum of the domain scores, however, if any dimension score was missing, the total IBD-QoL score was set to missing.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Achieved Clinical Remission at Day 56</title>
        <description>Clinical remission defined as a score of 0 for rectal bleeding and 0 for stool frequency components from the Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index (UCDAI). UCDAI is the sum (0 to 12) of 4 severity scores (0 to 3). Stool frequency and rectal bleeding were based on information recorded in daily participant diaries. The diary entries were averaged for rectal bleeding and stool frequency for 3 days prior to (and closest to) Day 56 with non-missing diary data, within 5 days prior to (and closest to) Day 56. The 5 days did not include any days of the flexible sigmoidoscopy (or colonoscopy) or the preparation for the flexible sigmoidoscopy (or colonoscopy). These averages were rounded to integer values. If either subscore could not be calculated because of missing data, the score for that UCDAI component was set to missing. Participants with insufficient data at Day 56 were excluded from the analysis. Participants who had clinical remission at Baseline were classified as non-responders.</description>

The 5 days did not include any days of the flexible sigmoidoscopy (or colonoscopy) or the preparation for the flexible sigmoidoscopy (or colonoscopy). These averages were rounded to integer values. If either subscore could not be calculated because of missing data, the score for that UCDAI component was set to missing. Participants with insufficient data at Day 56 were excluded from the analysis. Participants who had clinical remission at Baseline were classified as non-responders.</description>

        <description>The IBD-QoL questionnaire was self-completed by the participant. The IBD-QoL is a disease-specific instrument to evaluate the quality of life of participants with UC. This 32-item questionnaire has 4 dimensions: bowel function, emotional function, systemic symptoms, and social function. The total score is presented, which ranges from 32 to 224, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life. The scores of participants in remission usually range from 170 to 190. If &gt;50% of the questionnaire answers for a particular dimension were missing, this dimension score was set to missing. The total score for the IBD-QoL was the sum of the domain scores, however, if any dimension score was missing, the total IBD-QoL score was set to missing.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Inflammatory Bowel Disease-Quality of Life (IBD-QoL) Questionnaire Scores</title>
          <description>The IBD-QoL questionnaire was self-completed by the participant. The IBD-QoL is a disease-specific instrument to evaluate the quality of life of participants with UC. This 32-item questionnaire has 4 dimensions: bowel function, emotional function, systemic symptoms, and social function. The total score is presented, which ranges from 32 to 224, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life. The scores of participants in remission usually range from 170 to 190. If &gt;50% of the questionnaire answers for a particular dimension were missing, this dimension score was set to missing. The total score for the IBD-QoL was the sum of the domain scores, however, if any dimension score was missing, the total IBD-QoL score was set to missing.</description>
