      This randomized phase III trial studies how well methotrexate works compared to dactinomycin
      in treating patients with low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as methotrexate and dactinomycin, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. It is not yet known whether methotrexate is more effective than
      dactinomycin in treating gestational trophoblastic disease.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the hypothesis that treatment with multi-day methotrexate is inferior to treatment
      with pulse actinomycin-D (dactinomycin) in patients with low-risk gestational trophoblastic
      disease with respect to complete response.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the frequency of post protocol surgical treatment for each arm. II. To
      describe the frequency of post protocol multi-agent chemotherapy treatment for each arm.

      III. To compare multi-day methotrexate to actinomycin-D with respect to frequency and
      severity of adverse events in patients with low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia.

      IV. To investigate the impact of treatment on overall quality-of-life (QOL) and explore the
      influence of treatment on issues such as body image, sexual functioning, and patient-reported
      side effects and disruption.

      V. To assess whether uterine artery pulsatility index (UAPI) can provide independent
      prognostic information predictive of single-drug resistance.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive dactinomycin intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes on day 1.

      ARM II: Patients receive methotrexate intramuscularly (IM) on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 and
      leucovorin calcium orally (PO) on days 2, 4, 6, and 8 OR single agent methotrexate IV on days
      1-5.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 20 courses* in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 1 year and then
      every 3 months for 1 year.

      NOTE: * Patients will be treated for three courses after human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) &lt;
      5 mIU/mL or until evidence of treatment failure (biologic progression), disease progression,
      or unacceptable toxicity despite dose modifications. Upon normalization of hCG (&lt; 5 mIU/mL),
      patients will be treated with three additional courses.

    <description>Patient reported quality of life was measured with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Generic (FACT-G). The FACT-G is a scale for assessing general QOL of cancer patients. It consists of four subscales: Physical Well Being, Functional Well Being, Social/Family Well-Being, and Emotional Well-Being. Each item in the FACT-G was scored using a 5-point scale (0=not at all; 1=a little bit; 2=somewhat; 3=quite a bit; 4=very much). For the negative statements, reversal was performed prior to score calculation. According to the FACIT measurement system, a subscale score was the summation of the individual item scores if more than 50% of subscale items were answered. When unanswered items existed, a subscale score was prorated by multiplying the mean of the answered item scores by the number of items in the subscale. The FACT-G score is calculated as the sum of the subscale scores. The FACT-G score ranges 0-108. A larger score suggests better QOL.</description>

        <title>Patient-reported Quality of Life (QOL) at Baseline</title>
        <description>Patient reported quality of life was measured with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Generic (FACT-G). The FACT-G is a scale for assessing general QOL of cancer patients. It consists of four subscales: Physical Well Being, Functional Well Being, Social/Family Well-Being, and Emotional Well-Being. Each item in the FACT-G was scored using a 5-point scale (0=not at all; 1=a little bit; 2=somewhat; 3=quite a bit; 4=very much). For the negative statements, reversal was performed prior to score calculation. According to the FACIT measurement system, a subscale score was the summation of the individual item scores if more than 50% of subscale items were answered. When unanswered items existed, a subscale score was prorated by multiplying the mean of the answered item scores by the number of items in the subscale. The FACT-G score is calculated as the sum of the subscale scores. The FACT-G score ranges 0-108. A larger score suggests better QOL.</description>
