  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a mobile app called Resolving Psychological Stress (REPS)
      for people with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The app will administer threat-related
      attention bias modification to individuals who score high on a PTSD checklist. This study
      will be administered remotely to individuals in the United States. The aims of the study are
      to explore feasibility, acceptability and usability of the app in an entirely remote study,
      as well as to explore the efficacy of the app at reducing attention bias and PTSD symptom
      severity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly disabling disorder that affects
      approximately 8% of the population worldwide. Threat-related attention biases represent an
      important mechanism that may underlie PTSD symptoms. Such attention biases predict risk for
      PTSD following trauma exposure, and are thought to maintain some symptoms of PTSD. Research
      indicates that specific forms of computerized attention bias modification (ABM) training are
      effective in reducing attention bias for threat. We have developed a mobile app called REPS
      (Resolving Psychological Stress) to administer threat-related ABM training to people with
      symptoms of PTSD and have tested it in a laboratory-based pilot study of 22 people with
      elevated PTSD symptoms. Our preliminary data indicate that the app is highly acceptable to
      patients and that use of the app reduces attention bias for threat and PTSD symptom severity.
      The proposed study will expand on this prior lab-based study to test ABM training on an app
      entirely remotely. Our primary aim is to examine the feasibility, acceptability and usability
      of remotely administered app-based ABM training and to determine the efficacy of remote
      app-based ABM training in reducing attention bias and PTSD symptom severity. Our secondary
      aim is to examine whether a personalized version of ABM training results in greater
      attentional bias change and anxiety reduction compared to a non-personalized ABM training.

    <description>This self-help program will aim to reduce neurobiological threat sensitivity with the ultimate goal of developing a low-cost and highly scalable self-help tool to alleviate symptoms of PTSD. The app can be used on an iOS compatible phone and involves a training program that aims to directly reduce threat sensitivity by modifying attention. The contents of the app will be personalized for each user.</description>
