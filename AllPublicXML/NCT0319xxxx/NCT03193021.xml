  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the trial is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the Cardiva
      Mid-Bore Venous Vascular Closure System (VVCS) in sealing femoral venous access sites and
      providing reduced times to ambulation (TTA) compared with manual compression at the
      completion of catheter-based procedures performed through 6 - 12 Fr introducer sheaths.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized, controlled multi-center clinical trial designed to evaluate the
      safety and effectiveness of the study device in sealing multiple femoral venous access sites
      and providing reduced times to ambulation compared with manual compression at the completion
      of catheter-based procedures performed through 6 - 12 Fr introducer sheaths.

      Only patients with multiple access sites will be enrolled in order to support the desired
      indication. Randomization will be stratified to account for patients with varying numbers of
      access sites in a 1:1 treatment device to control arm ratio to ensure treatment and control
      arms have the same proportion of access sites/patient, i.e. 3 access sites/patient vs. 4
      access sites/patient.
