    <description>This secondary outcome measure analyzed the percentage of subjects with &lt; 50 copies/mL RNA at time points 24, 36 and 48 weeks.
The percent of subjects with an RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL at each time point was analyzed using McNemar's test following the guidelines of the Snapshot algorithm. Missing RNA data was considered a treatment failure.</description>

      <recruitment_details>A retrospective chart review of appoximately 400 HIV+ patients receiving treatment at an urban diverse FQHC was conducted to identify those who were receiving an NRTI-sparing regimen of DRV and DTG.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects included were at least 18 years of age, receiving DRV/r + DTG QD for at least 24 weeks and had laboratory data through 48 weeks of follow up. Those excluded were not taking the study regimen, missed more than five doses of medication over two weeks prior to study visit or if there was missing lab data for 2 or more study time points.</pre_assignment_details>

Subjects were included if they were ≥ 18 years of age, receiving DRV/r + DTG QD for ≥ 24 weeks, and had laboratory data through 48 weeks of follow up. Subjects were excluded if they received a regimen of DRV/r in combination with DTG for &lt;24 weeks duration, if they received DRV/r + DTG + NRTI’s, missed more than five doses over two weeks prior to study visit or if there was missing laboratory data for ≥2 or more study time points. The primary endpoints evaluated were the percent of patients with an RNA &lt;50 copies/mL at 48 weeks after initiation of the regimen, as well as, the change in serum creatinine from baseline to 48 weeks.</description>

            <description>We conducted a retrospective chart review of approximately 400 HIV+ patients receiving treatment at an urban diverse FQHC to identify those who were receiving a NRTI-sparing regimen of DRV and DTG. Subjects were included if they were ≥ 18 years of age, receiving DRV/r + DTG QD for ≥ 24 weeks, and had laboratory data through 48 weeks of follow up. Subjects were excluded if they received a regimen of DRV/r in combination with DTG for &lt;24 weeks duration, if they received DRV/r + DTG + NRTI’s, missed more than five doses over two weeks prior to study visit or if there was missing laboratory data for ≥2 or more study time points. The primary endpoints evaluated were the percent of patients with an RNA &lt;50 copies/mL at 48 weeks after initiation of the regimen, as well as, the change in serum creatinine from baseline to 48 weeks.</description>

          <title>Retrospective Chart Review</title>
          <description>We conducted a retrospective chart review of approximately 400 HIV+ patients receiving treatment at an urban diverse FQHC to identify those who were receiving a NRTI-sparing regimen of DRV and DTG. Subjects were included if they were ≥ 18 years of age, receiving DRV/r + DTG QD for ≥ 24 weeks, and had laboratory data through 48 weeks of follow up. Subjects were excluded if they received a regimen of DRV/r in combination with DTG for &lt;24 weeks duration, if they received DRV/r + DTG + NRTI’s, missed more than five doses over two weeks prior to study visit or if there was missing laboratory data for ≥2 or more study time points. The primary endpoints evaluated were the percent of patients with an RNA &lt;50 copies/mL at 48 weeks after initiation of the regimen, as well as, the change in serum creatinine from baseline to 48 weeks.</description>
