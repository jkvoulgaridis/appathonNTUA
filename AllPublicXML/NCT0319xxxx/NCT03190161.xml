      The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of self-selected music listening which
      targets disrupting the reward process maintaining smoking and additionally attenuating the
      reward processing deficits associated with schizophrenia. Five participants with
      schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder who smoke/nicotine will participate in an individual
      session of self-selected music listening for a half an hour.
