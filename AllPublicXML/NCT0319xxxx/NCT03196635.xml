  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to compare the image quality of breast images obtained using
      standard (technologist-controlled [TC]) compression and patient-assisted (PA) compression and
      to evaluate the impact of PA compression on clinical workflow.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient-assisted (PA) compression allows the patient to participate in controlling the amount
      of compression force during mammography and is a personalized approach that has demonstrated
      successful reduction in discomfort experienced during mammography. GE Healthcare's Senographe
      Pristina, an innovative mammography platform that provides both two-dimensional (2D) and
      three-dimensional (3D) imaging capabilities, offers both standard and PA compression modes.
      This study is being conducted to compare the image quality of breast images obtained using TC
      compression and PA compression, and to evaluate the impact of PA compression on clinical
      workflow. The study population will consist of adult asymptomatic women presenting for
      screening 2D mammography.

    <time_frame>Through study completion, on average 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>One PA image set and one TC image set was acquired from each completed subject. The overall clinical image quality acceptability was collected and summarized on a per subject-basis using binary responses of either acceptable or unacceptable for unilateral, two-view PA and TC compression image sets. Two readers evaluated each of the 60 image sets (30 PA and 30 TC compression image sets from 30 completed participants). In cases of disagreement between Readers 1 and 2, a third reader provided adjudication.</description>

    <description>The technologist will properly position the breast and apply minimum compression. The subject will be instructed to apply compression as the technologist ensures the breast tissue is in appropriate position and tautness. The technologist will then guide the subject to achieve appropriate compression level, sufficient but not excessive, and the image will be acquired. This will be done for both standard views CC &amp; MLO.</description>

Randomization of breast of interest was performed so that approximately half the subjects were assigned to the first breast imaged and the other half was assigned to the second breast imaged.

          <description>One PA image set and one TC image set was acquired from each completed subject. The overall clinical image quality acceptability was collected and summarized on a per subject-basis using binary responses of either acceptable or unacceptable for unilateral, two-view PA and TC compression image sets. Two readers evaluated each of the 60 image sets (30 PA and 30 TC compression image sets from 30 completed participants). In cases of disagreement between Readers 1 and 2, a third reader provided adjudication.</description>

The one (1) withdrawn subject did not undergo image acquisition study procedures and thus was not included in this analysis set.</population>
