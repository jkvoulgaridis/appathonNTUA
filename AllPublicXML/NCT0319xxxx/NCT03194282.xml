  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor balance capacity is one of clinical symptoms of stroke patient. The reason of loss
      balance capacity is motor impairment, as well as a diminished capacity to voluntarily shift
      body weight or to with stand external pertubations. Postural movement patterns include three
      discrete control strategies: hip, knee, and ankle strategy. The ankle rocker is an important
      factor to maintain balance during standing and the ankle strategy restores the center of mass
      (CoM) to a position of stability through body movement. As a result, effective control of
      foot motion and ankle stability may decrease postural sway and the risk of fall in chronic
      stroke.The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of the insole on balance
      capacity in chronic stroke.

    <textblock>
      An important determinant of activities of daily living performance is standing balance.
      Therefore, poor balance, or postural stability, is significant predictors the risk of fall.
      After a fall, the patient can experience psychological, physical, social, economic, and
      sometimes fatal effects. The injuries can reduce the patient's mobility as well as
      independence and influence quality of life.Patients with chronic stroke wearing functional
      insoles and sham insoles to challenge balance tests.
