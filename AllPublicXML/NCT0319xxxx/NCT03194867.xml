  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of isatuximab (also known as
           SAR650984) and cemiplimab (also known as REGN2810) in patients with relapse/refractory
           multiple myeloma.

        -  To compare the overall response of the combination of isatuximab and cemiplimab versus
           isatuximab alone in patients with RRMM based on International Myeloma Working Group
           (IMWG) criteria.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy as assessed by clinical benefit rate (CBR), duration of
           response (DOR), time to response (TTR), progression free survival (PFS), and overall
           survival (OS).

        -  To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of isatuximab and cemiplimab when given in
           combination.

        -  To assess the immunogenicity of isatuximab and cemiplimab when given in combination.

      The duration of the study for a patient will include a period for screening of up to 21 days
      and 3-month post treatment follow up. The cycle duration is 28 days. Patients will continue
      treatment until disease progression, unacceptable adverse events, consent withdrawal, or any
      other reason.

             Seasonal flu vaccines that do not contain live virus are permitted.

          -  Has allogenic haemopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplant.

          -  Prior treatment with idelalisib (a PI3K inhibitor).

          -  Poor bone marrow reserve.
