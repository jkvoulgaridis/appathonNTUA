    <measure>Number of Participants Reporting Product Tolerability Based on Evaluator Global Assessment Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days after completion of the facial peel procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The dermatologist assessed the local tolerance of the post-procedure skin care regimen in context of the expected effects of the procedure for each participant using the scale as below: 0 - Product regimen was well tolerated, 1 - product regimen was not well tolerated. The dermatologist observed on the total set of clinical and participant self-assessment data for each participant. Lower scale value implies that no clinically significant worsening of the expected signs/symptoms of the procedure, no new signs/symptoms manifest during product use. Whereas, higher scale value implies clear, clinically relevant worsening of the severity or frequency of expected signs/symptoms of the procedure and/or any occurrence of new, unexpected signs/symptoms during product use.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Score of Dermatologist Assessments</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days after completion of the facial peel procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The assessments of Erythema, Dryness, Desquamation and Edema were conducted by a dermatologist on the participant's skin condition at the 5 x 5 cm square area on the volar surface of forearm. The signs were scored on a scale. Erythema on 0-3 where, 0=none-no redness, 1=mild-slight redness, 2=moderate-definite redness, 3=severe-marked redness. Dryness on 0-3 where, 0=none-no dryness, 1=mild-barely perceptible, fine scales to limited areas of test site, 2=moderate-fine scales generalized to all areas of test site, 3=severe-scaling and peeling of skin over all areas of test site. Desquamation on 0-3 where, 0=none-no sign of peeling, 1=mild-barely perceptible scaling, 2=moderate-minimal scaling, 3=severe-moderate scaling. Edema on 0-3 where, 0=none-no edema, 1=mild-barely perceptible edema, 2=moderate-definite edema, 3=severe-pronounced edema. The measure is sum of participant scores, so a total score scale ranges from 0-12, with higher scores indicating increased signs of irritation.</description>

The dermatologist observed on the total set of clinical and participant self-assessment data for each participant. Lower scale value implies that no clinically significant worsening of the expected signs/symptoms of the procedure, no new signs/symptoms manifest during product use.

        <description>The assessments of Erythema, Dryness, Desquamation and Edema were conducted by a dermatologist on the participant's skin condition at the 5 x 5 cm square area on the volar surface of forearm. The signs were scored on a scale. Erythema on 0-3 where, 0=none-no redness, 1=mild-slight redness, 2=moderate-definite redness, 3=severe-marked redness. Dryness on 0-3 where, 0=none-no dryness, 1=mild-barely perceptible, fine scales to limited areas of test site, 2=moderate-fine scales generalized to all areas of test site, 3=severe-scaling and peeling of skin over all areas of test site. Desquamation on 0-3 where, 0=none-no sign of peeling, 1=mild-barely perceptible scaling, 2=moderate-minimal scaling, 3=severe-moderate scaling. Edema on 0-3 where, 0=none-no edema, 1=mild-barely perceptible edema, 2=moderate-definite edema, 3=severe-pronounced edema. The measure is sum of participant scores, so a total score scale ranges from 0-12, with higher scores indicating increased signs of irritation.</description>

Participants were scored as per signs/symptom: pain, stinging/burning, itching, tightness, redness and dryness on scale of 0 to 3, where 0= none; no sign or symptoms, 1= mild; barely perceptible, 2= moderate; definite signs and symptoms, and 3= severe- marked or pronounced signs or symptoms. This outcome measure is the sum of participant scores, so a total score, i.e. the range is 0-15, with higher scores indicating increased signs or symptoms of irritation.</description>

        <population>The safety population (N=96) included all participants with at least 1 application of product in test phase. This population was based on treatment the participant actually received. Of which, there were 50 in test product and 46 in no treatment. Number of participants (n=91) analyzed in this outcome measure signifies those who were evaluated.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Participant Self-assessment Scores for Dryness</title>
        <description>The following assessments were conducted by participants reflective of their skin condition at the time of evaluation for dryness. Participants were scored on a scale of 0 to 3. (0= None, 1= Mild, 2= Moderate, and 3= Severe). Lower scores indicate better results.</description>
        <time_frame>14 days after completion of the facial peel procedure</time_frame>
        <population>The safety population (N=96) included all participants with at least 1 application of product in test phase. This population was based on treatment the participant actually received. Of which, there were 50 in test product and 46 in no treatment. Number of participants (n=91) analyzed in this outcome measure signifies those who were evaluated.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Instrumental Measurement of Barrier Function Using Tewameter</title>
        <description>Trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) measurement was performed by evaporimetry with a Tewameter. Measurements were taken in triplicates on the left cheek (below the cheekbone between the nose and ear). TEWL measurements were taken with the participant lying horizontally, on their back, so that the chimney of the Tewameter probe is aligned vertically. An increase in TEWL values shows damage to the skin barrier function.</description>
