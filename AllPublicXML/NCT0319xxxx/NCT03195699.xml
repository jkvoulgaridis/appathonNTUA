  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients have cancers that have increased activity of a protein called STAT3 that
      contributes critically to the development and growth of their cancer. Despite our knowledge
      of STAT3's importance to cancer, scientists and doctors have not developed a drug that
      targets it and that patients can take to treat their cancer more effectively than treatments
      that are now available. Tvardi Therapeutics, Incorporated has developed a compound, TTI-101,
      which can be given by mouth and acts as a direct inhibitor of STAT3. Administration of
      TTI-101 to mice demonstrated that it blocked growth of cancers of the breast, head and neck,
      lung, and liver and it was safe when administered at high doses to mice, rats, and dogs. In
      this application, Tvardi is proposing to further develop TTI-101 for treatment of solid
      tumors for which the prognosis is dismal. The investigators will determine how safe it is
      when administered to patients with cancer, determine whether an adequate dose can be
      administered to patients with cancer that will block STAT3 in their cancer, and determine
      whether treatment with TTI-101 leads to reduced growth of their cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a member of a family of seven
      closely related proteins responsible for transmission of peptide hormone signals from the
      extracellular surface of cells to the nucleus. STAT3 is a master regulator of most key
      hallmarks and enablers of cancer, including cell proliferation, resistance to apoptosis,
      metastasis, immune evasion, tumor angiogenesis, epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT),
      response to DNA damage, and the Warburg effect. STAT3 also is a key mediator of oncogene
      addiction and supports the self-renewal of tumor-initiating cancer stem cells that contribute
      to cancer initiation, cancer maintenance, and relapse in several types of tumors. STAT3
      activity is increased in ~50% of all cancers, due either to naturally occurring STAT3
      mutations, as have been demonstrated in human inflammatory hepatocellular adenomas and large
      granular lymphocytic leukemia, or, more commonly as a result of activation of signaling
      molecules upstream of STAT3, including receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK; e.g. epidermal growth
      factor receptor, EGFR), tyrosine kinase-associated receptors (e.g. the family of IL-6
      cytokine receptors or G-protein coupled receptors, GPCR), and Src kinases (e.g. Src, Lck,
      Hck, Lyn, Fyn, or Fgr). Thus, STAT3 is an attractive target for drug development to treat
      many types of cancer including breast cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC),
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), colorectal cancer (CRC),
      gastric adenocarcinoma and melanoma.

    <description>In a 3 + 3 cohort design, three patients are initially enrolled into a given dose cohort. If there is no DLT observed in any of the first three subjects, the trial proceeds with enrolling additional subjects into the next higher dose cohort. If one subject develops a DLT at a specific dose, an additional three subjects are enrolled into that same dose cohort. Development of DLTs in &gt;1 of 6 subjects in a specific dose cohort will determine the MTD and no further dose escalation is done.

    <description>Patients in the first cohort are treated at dose level 1. Each cohort of a dose level will include at least 3 patients, who will be evaluated for at least one cycle (28-days). The next dose level will be determined after careful review of the tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the previous cohort. If the current dose is the lowest dose and the rule indicates dose de-escalation, we will treat the new patients at the lowest dose unless the number of DLTs reaches the elimination boundary, at which point we will terminate the trial for safety. If the current dose is the highest dose and the rule indicates dose escalation, we will treat the new patients at the highest dose.</description>
