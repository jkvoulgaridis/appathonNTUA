    <textblock>
      This is a global Phase III, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study designed to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant treatment with atezolizumab (anti-programmed
      death-ligand 1 [anti-PD-L1] antibody) and nab-paclitaxel followed by doxorubicin and
      cyclophosphamide (nab-pac-AC), or placebo and nab-pac−AC in participants eligible for surgery
      with initial clinically assessed triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
