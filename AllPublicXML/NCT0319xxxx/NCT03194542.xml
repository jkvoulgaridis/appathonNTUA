    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      luspatercept in subjects with MPN-associated myelofibrosis and anemia with and without
      RBC-transfusion dependence. The study is divided into a Screening Period, a Treatment Period
      (consisting of a Primary Phase, a Day 169 Disease Response Assessment, and an Extension
      Phase), followed by a Posttreatment Follow-up Period.

      Subjects satisfying the eligibility criteria will be assigned to 1 of the following cohorts
      (which are enrolling in parallel) based on their eligibility:

        -  Cohort 1 (subjects with anemia only that are not currently receiving RBC transfusions) -
           Cohort 2: (subjects that are RBC-transfusion dependent)

        -  Cohort 3A: (subjects on ruxolitinib as part of their standard of care therapy that have
           anemia only)

        -  Cohort 3B: (subjects on ruxolitinib as part of their standard of care therapy that are
           RBC-transfusion dependent) Overall, the study will enroll approximately 100 subjects
           worldwide.

    <description>Luspatercept is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of a modified form of the extracellular domain of the human active in receptor type IIB linked to the IgG1 Fc domain. Luspatercept, through a mechanism of action different from erythropoietin, works to correct ineffective erythropoiesis by promoting late-stage maturation of erythroblasts.</description>
