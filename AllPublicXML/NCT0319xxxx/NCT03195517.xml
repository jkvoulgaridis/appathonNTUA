  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our research was to define both in vivo and in vitro whether and to what extent an
      high-impact exercise program would affect bone cell turnover and improve the QoL in
      osteopenic postmenopausal women.

      Subjects were selected among those attending the &quot;Bone and Mineral Metabolism Disorders&quot;
      Clinic of Perugia University, Italy, since May 2nd 2015 and January 31st 2016. A total of 33
      post-menopausal women volunteered to participate in the study.

    <intervention_model_description>This was an interventional, single group assignment study in which the subjects were first assigned to the control group and, after 1-month interval with no physical training, were shifted into the 3-months exercise intervention group. Thus, the subjects acted as their own control at the end of the study.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The exercise program was performed at C.U.R.I.A.Mo. Institute of &quot;Università degli Studi di Perugia&quot;. Twenty-four exercise sessions were provided, carried out twice a week for three months. Each session was supervised by two graduated trainers and two medical doctors with a maximum attendance of 5 patient/group.
Each session lasted 45 minutes divided into 15 minutes of aerobic activity and 30 minutes of weight-bearing and resistance activities.
This latter section was specifically projected for adults and older adults with increased risk of fractures and was intended to improve muscle strength and flexibility, balance and, as a result, to prevent the risk of falls.</description>

Twenty-four exercise sessions were provided, carried out twice a week for three months. Each session was supervised by two graduated trainers and two medical doctors with a maximum attendance of 5 patient/group.
Each session lasted 45 minutes divided into 15 minutes of aerobic activity and 30 minutes of weight-bearing and resistance activities.
This latter section was specifically projected for adults and older adults with increased risk of fractures and was intended to improve muscle strength and flexibility, balance and, as a result, to prevent the risk of falls.

The program provided 24 exercise sessions supervised by 2 physical education instructors and 2 medical researchers with a maximum attendance of 5 patient/group and carried out twice a week for three months.
Each session lasted approximately 45 minutes divided into 15 minutes of cardiovascular activity performed using various ergometers and 30 minutes of weight-bearing endurance activities, resistance training and other exercise to develop balance and prevent falls, organized according to circuit training methodology.
The great part of the exercise included in the program aim to provide variably strains (compression, bending, twisting) distributed across an higher surface of the femoral neck, to produce a maximal osteogenic response.</description>
