    <textblock>
      Agomelatine is a melatonin drug used to treat depressive disorder. Agomelatine may also some
      effects on ocular pressures. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate that melatonin decreases
      intraocular pressures when given depressive patients.

    <textblock>
      Melatonin has been shown to be effective to decrease intraocular pressure in experimental
      animal researches. Agomelatine is a melatonin derivative drug approved for the treatment of
      depression, which is also available in our country. Depending on animal experiments, it can
      be assumed that agomelatine can decrease intraocular pressure. Demonstrating that agomelatine
      is effective to reduce eye pressure may give a concurrent treatment of depressive patients
      with glaucoma. With this it may be possible to treat both diseases at the same time with
      single drug. In this study, the researchers intended to investigate the changes in ocular
      tension in normotensive depressive patients treated with agomelatine.

    <description>The investigators analyze the intraocular pressure changes on patients who have been using Agomelatine for their primary depressive disorder. For the treatment of depression, patients will have been started routinely Agomelatine tablet of 25 mg orally. The investigators measure the eye pressure for one months in those patients receiving standard depression treatment.</description>

        Investigators seek to analyze the intraocular pressure changes depending on Agomelatin
        treatment. Depressive patients who are deemed suitable for agomelatine treatment on a
        routine basis by psychiatry clinic will be monitored with regard to intraocular pressure
        changes. Treatment decision will be given by the psychiatrist independently from patient's
        enrollment to the study. Then, investigators will measure intraocular pressure before the
        treatment and one month after the treatment.
