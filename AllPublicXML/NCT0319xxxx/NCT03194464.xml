  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effects of sub-maximal exercise to task-failure (e.g., fatigue)
      with the less involved, or so-called non-paretic hand, in people who have experienced a
      stroke. In previous work the investigators found that non-paretic hand exercise to
      task-failure increased excitability of the motor cortex in the more involved hemisphere and
      produced behavioral improvements in the unexercised paretic hand. Importantly, the magnitude
      of increased brain excitability is greater than what has been observed following brain
      stimulation with either repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or transcranial
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) and lasts longer. This approach could be implemented in the
      clinical setting and could be accessible to a greater number of people than brain
      stimulation. The investigators' goals in the current study are to: repeat previous findings
      in a different group of participants and investigate the neural mechanisms that produce brain
      and behavioral facilitation in order to inform development of this approach for clinical
      implementation.

      The long-term goal is to restore upper extremity (UE) motor function following stroke. The
      overall objective of this proposal is to improve the investigators' understanding of neural
      mechanisms contributing to inter-limb and inter-hemispheric transfer following non-paretic
      limb exercise to task failure. The investigators will use transcranial magnetic stimulation
      to probe acute adaptations in cortical excitability, intracortical and inter-hemispheric
      circuits that accompany behavioral facilitation of the paretic hand.

      The work proposed in this two year project will enable the investigators to obtain three data
      elements critical to complete the working hypothesis:

        1. . Changes in intracortical and interhemispheric inhibition in both hemispheres following
           non-paretic limb exercise to task-failure.

        2. . Behavioral effects using a motor task involving manipulation and dexterity.

        3. . Determine the persistence and consistency of neural and behavioral facilitation.

    <time_frame>baseline, post task-failure (minutes to an hour), every 45 min up to 3.5 hours post-task-failure (7 points total)</time_frame>
    <description>SICI is a neurophysiologic measure of intra-cortical inhibition, obtained using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) measured here in the ipsilesional hemisphere (IH) at each point to determine how it is modulated in response to task-failure. SICI is quantified as a ratio where values &lt;1 reflect inhibition and &gt;1 disinhibition or relative excitation. In health, SICI is ~0.5. Thus if SICI = 0.8, while &lt;1 it would indicate less inhibition than expected in health. Transient change in SICI from 0.8 to 1.1 over the course of this experimental paradigm would reflect a period of relative excitation in response to the exercise paradigm.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, post task-failure (requires variable timeline from minutes to an hour), every 45 min up to 3.5 hours post-task-failure (7 points total)</time_frame>
    <description>The BBT measures motor function/dexterity, scored as the number of blocks transferred in 1 minute. Here function of the paretic hand was measured at each time point: baseline, post-task failure, 45min post, 90min post, 135min post, 180min post, 225min post-task failure to determine the change in paretic hand BBT performance following exercise to task-failure. Scores are numeric ranging from 0 (no blocks transferred) to whatever the participant is able to achieve. Healthy age-matched adults without motor disability score in the range of 60 (+/- 10) blocks transferred in 1 minute.</description>

    <description>The BBT measures motor function/dexterity, scored as the number of blocks transferred in 1 minute. Here function of the paretic hand was measured prior to exercise at each of 8 repeated sessions conducted twice weekly for 4 weeks to determine the change in paretic hand BBT performance following repeated sessions of exercise to task-failure. Scores are numeric ranging from 0 (no blocks transferred) to whatever the participant is able to achieve.

          <description>The Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment is a widely-used validated measure of motor impairment for individuals post-stroke. The upper-extremity component totals 66 points. Higher scores reflect less impairment/less severe hemiparesis, although 66 points is not equivalent to &quot;normal&quot; or scores achieved by non-disabled individuals. Lower scores reflect greater impairment/more severe hemiparesis.</description>

        <title>Short Intracortical Inhibition (SICI)</title>
        <description>SICI is a neurophysiologic measure of intra-cortical inhibition, obtained using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) measured here in the ipsilesional hemisphere (IH) at each point to determine how it is modulated in response to task-failure. SICI is quantified as a ratio where values &lt;1 reflect inhibition and &gt;1 disinhibition or relative excitation. In health, SICI is ~0.5. Thus if SICI = 0.8, while &lt;1 it would indicate less inhibition than expected in health. Transient change in SICI from 0.8 to 1.1 over the course of this experimental paradigm would reflect a period of relative excitation in response to the exercise paradigm.</description>

Scores are numeric ranging from 0 (no blocks transferred) to whatever the participant is able to achieve. Healthy age-matched adults without motor disability score in the range of 60 (+/- 10) blocks transferred in 1 minute.</description>

          <title>Box and Blocks Test (BBT)</title>
          <description>The BBT measures motor function/dexterity, scored as the number of blocks transferred in 1 minute. Here function of the paretic hand was measured at each time point: baseline, post-task failure, 45min post, 90min post, 135min post, 180min post, 225min post-task failure to determine the change in paretic hand BBT performance following exercise to task-failure. Scores are numeric ranging from 0 (no blocks transferred) to whatever the participant is able to achieve. Healthy age-matched adults without motor disability score in the range of 60 (+/- 10) blocks transferred in 1 minute.</description>
          <population>The Box and Blocks test (BBT) is an accepted measure of motor function/dexterity. Score reflect the number of 1&quot; blocks moved from one half of a divided box to the other in 1 minute. Higher numbers indicate better performance.
Only 13/15 data sets were analyzed because other data sets were not usable.</population>

        <description>The BBT measures motor function/dexterity, scored as the number of blocks transferred in 1 minute. Here function of the paretic hand was measured prior to exercise at each of 8 repeated sessions conducted twice weekly for 4 weeks to determine the change in paretic hand BBT performance following repeated sessions of exercise to task-failure. Scores are numeric ranging from 0 (no blocks transferred) to whatever the participant is able to achieve. Healthy age-matched adults without motor disability score in the range of 60 (+/- 10) blocks transferred in 1 minute.</description>
