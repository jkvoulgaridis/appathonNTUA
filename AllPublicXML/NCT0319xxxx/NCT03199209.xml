  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well a theoretically-based motivational behavior change program called
      Tu Salud Si Cuenta! works in promoting healthy lifestyles in Latino families. Tu Salud Si
      Cuenta! will deliver programs on healthy lifestyles and healthy homes to Hispanic/Latino
      families and may help to improve their health.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of the Tu Salud, Si Cuenta! Familiar (TSSC-Family) intervention
      in facilitating positive changes in physical activity and nutrition among Latino adults not
      meeting physical activity or nutrition recommendations.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the effects of TSSC-Family on hypothesized intervention mechanisms (e.g.,
      self-efficacy, stage of change, social support, social control), and the role of those
      mechanisms in mediating TSSC-Family effects of physical activity and nutrition outcomes.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Participants and their family member meet with a community health worker in their
      home over 90 minutes to learn about physical activity, healthy eating, and to set goals, once
      a month for 6 months. Participants also receive 2-5 text messages per week that contain
      health tips related to healthy lifestyles and information about local resources. Participants
      also attend a study visit with a research staff over 90-120 minutes at a community center, MD
      Anderson, or at home at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months.

      GROUP II: Participants and their family member meet with a community health worker in their
      home over 90 minutes to receive information on how to be safe and healthy at home and
      information about indoor air quality, home safety, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)/first
      aid, how to prepare for emergencies, and keeping pests away, once a month for 6 months.
      Participants also receive 2-5 text messages per week that contain information about healthy
      homes and local resources. Participants also attend a study visit with a research staff over
      90-120 minutes at a community center, MD Anderson, or at home at baseline, 6 months, and 12
      months.
