  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety profile of long-term vedolizumab IV
      treatment in pediatric participants with UC or CD.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called Vedolizumab. Vedolizumab is being tested to
      treat pediatric participants who have moderately to severely active UC or CD.

      This study will look at the long-term safety profile in participants who take vedolizumab IV.
      Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) which will remain
      undisclosed to the participant and investigator during this double blind study (up to Week
      40) maintaining the dose at study entry and escalating the dose at disease worsening.

      The dosing regimen selected for the long-term study is intended to maintain clinical response
      at the lowest possible exposure.

      At the discretion of the investigator, participants receiving the low dose (150 or 100 mg) of
      vedolizumab IV may be escalated to the high dose (300 or 200 mg) if the participants
      demonstrate disease worsening at 2 consecutive visits (scheduled or unscheduled).

      Participants who experience continued disease worsening during the study despite being
      administered vedolizumab 300 or 200 mg every 8 weeks (Q8W) will be discontinued from the
      study.

      Study duration is expected to be up to 5 years, depending on the enrollment rate in the
      previous randomized double blind study (MLN0002-2003).

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

    <description>The IMPACT-III questionnaire is a self-reported measure with 35 closed questions encompassing 6 domains: Bowel Symptoms (7 items), Systemic Symptoms (3 items), Social Functioning (12 items), Body Image (3 items), Treatment/Interventions (3 items), and Emotional Functioning (7 items). The IMPACT-III uses a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5 for all answers. The outcome score ranges from 35 to 175, with higher scores suggesting better quality of life.</description>

    <description>Tanner Stage Evaluation is a scale used to evaluate growth parameters standardized for age, sex, and pubertal development. Female pubertal development staged by pubic hair development and breast size; male pubertal development staged by size of the genitalia and development of pubic hair. Rated in 5 stages: stage 1 (no development) to 5 (adult-like development in quantity and size). Tanner stage is assessed at or before age 16 years for females or 17 years for males.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With UC Meeting Complete Mayo Score Response at Week 32</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 32</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response is defined as a continued reduction in complete mayo score of &gt;=3 points from baseline (at initiation of MLN0002-2003) and continued decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of &gt;=1 point from baseline, or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of &lt;=1 point. Mayo score is an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. It consists of 4 subscores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings on endoscopy and physician rating of disease activity, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. These scores are summed to give a total score range of 0 to 12; where higher scores indicate more severe disease.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With CD Meeting 50 Percent (%) Reduction in Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) Score at Week 32</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 32</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response is defined as a 50% reduction in SES-CD score on endoscopy compared to the baseline endoscopy (at initiation of MLN0002-2003) and continued reduction in CDAI that is a &gt;=70 point decrease from the baseline Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) score at the initiation of MLN0002-2003. CDAI is a research tool used to quantify the symptoms of participants with Crohn's disease. SES-CD consists of 3 variables: ulcer size, ulcerated and affected surfaces and presence of narrowing each graded from 0 to 3 with score of 0 means no colonic lesions or mucosal healing, and SES-CD greater than (&gt;) 1 indicates the presence of mucosal lesions.</description>

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received, an opportunity for the primary publication of the research has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com/Approach for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
