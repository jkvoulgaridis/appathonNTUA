  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to understand how the intestinal microbiota plays a role in the effectiveness of an
      anti-cancer treatment by an immune control point inhibitor, this study aims to constitute a
      catalog of microbial genes of a patient with cancer. This catalog will help to characterize
      the intestinal microbiota of cancer patients and to be able to use this catalog as a
      reference tool for screening the microbiota of patients treated with immune control point
      inhibitors. To produce this catalog, five types of cancer were selected: non-small cell lung
      cancer, colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer and prostate cancer.

      The metagenomic analysis of a group of five different types of cancers introduces a lot of
      heterogeneity which is favorable to the richness of a catalog. For non-small cell lung cancer
      treated with immune control point inhibitors, two stool collections will be performed per
      patient (one stool collection before setting up an immune control point inhibitor and one
      collection after one month of being inhibited Of immune control point) to assess the impact
      of the immune control point inhibitor on the microbiota (pilot study). For this study, two
      stool collection tubes containing different preservative solutions will be used (one RNAlater
      tube and one DMSO-EDTA tube for Dimethylsulfoxide-Ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid).

      In parallel, we will also collect samples of serum and plasma to evaluate, in a second step,
      protein markers in circulating blood.
