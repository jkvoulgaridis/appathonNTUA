  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Catheter-related bladder discomfort (CRBD) is not uncommon in male patients under general
      anesthesia, and it may cause patient agitation and exacerbated postoperative pain. In this
      study, the investigators will enroll male patients undergoing elective colonal and rectal
      surgery with surgical duration of at least 2 h, requiring catheterization of the urinary
      bladder with urinary catheterization after anesthetic induction, and compare preoperative
      education with image illustrations combined with local tetracaine mucilage vs. local
      tetracaine mucilage alone in alleviating CRBD during the post-operative period.
