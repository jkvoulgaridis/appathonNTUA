  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The advent of continuous flow (CF) pumps for patients with severe heart failure has led to
      marked improvements in survival; however, pump operation remains fraught with adverse
      thrombotic events. This climbing rate of thrombosis and stroke during CF pump support has led
      to a recent warning by the US Food and Drug Administration. Despite a rising incidence of
      pump thrombosis and its downstream complications of stroke, the hematologic mechanisms behind
      these devastating adverse events remain uncertain. Recently, it has been recognized that CF
      pump induced hemolysis precedes and is associated with thrombosis. In-vitro studies show
      increased platelet function with exposure to products of hemolysis, which is also known to
      occur in diseases of intravascular hemolysis such as sickle cell anemia. This proposal will
      investigate if hemolysis associated increased platelet function can be reduced by a
      potentiation of nitric oxide signaling by an oral phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, sildenafil.
      Elucidating mechanisms of hemolysis induced thrombosis may inform best strategies for
      prevention of end organ damage and maintaining optimal CF pump operation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the remarkable improvements in survival with durable continuous flow (CF) pumps and
      the clear lifesaving effects of Impella and veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
      (VA ECMO), serious adverse hematological events such as bleeding and thrombosis create
      substantial morbidity and mortality and remain major barriers for further expansion of this
      technology. In particular, thrombosis is a devastating adverse event during CF pump support
      as it can lead to stroke, device stoppage, and hemodynamic collapse. Although the annual
      incidence of pump thrombosis has been reported to range from 8 to nearly 30%, the
      pathobiological mechanisms of thrombus formation during CF pump support with ongoing
      anticoagulation remain elusive. Our preliminary data associates hemolysis, which is inherent
      to such devices due to high shear stress, with subsequent formation of thrombosis and stroke,
      possibly through increasing platelet activation and aggregation. Our prelim data and drawing
      from a body of literature from diseases of intravascular hemolysis such as sickle cell anemia
      suggest that free hemoglobin released during hemolysis, which reduces NO levels, may be
      activating platelets. In retrospective analysis, we have noted a significant reduction in
      mean platelet volume (potential in-vivo marker of platelet activation), thrombosis and stroke
      with concurrent sildenafil administration. However, this mechanism and efficacy of NO
      signaling enhancers such as sildenafil remains to be proven during CF pump support.

      Aim: To conduct a randomized placebo controlled study to test the hypothesis that platelet
      activation and aggregation, endothelial dysfunction and pro-thrombotic inflammation during
      ongoing low level hemolysis in outpatients on chronic CF pump support can be reduced by
      sildenafil.

    <description>Baseline blood samples and study measurements will be acquired. Then 20 mg of the study drug will be administered. Then BP will be recorded every 30 minutes for two hours. If BP is stable (drop is &lt; 5 mmHg after 2 hours and patient is asymptomatic), patient will proceed to take 20 mg of the study drug every 8 hours. The patient will return to clinic on day 8 and 20 mg of the study drug will be administered. After 2 hours blood samples and study measurements will be collected and the patient will resume 20 mg of the study for the next two doses. The patient will return for a third clinic visit on the next day and if BP is in the acceptable range, 40 mg of the study drug will be administered. If BP remains stable for 2 hours, then the patient will continue taking 40 mg every 8 hours. The patient will return to clinic on day 15 for a final study visit and will be given the last 40 mg dose of the study drug and after 2 hours blood samples and study measurements will be taken.</description>
