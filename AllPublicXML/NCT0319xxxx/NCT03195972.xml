  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral anticancer treatments are increasingly numerous. They represent an additional
      alternative in the therapeutic arsenal of the clinician, and appear to satisfy patients who
      prefer this route of administration over intravenous treatment. The objective of oral
      therapies is twofold: to remove the constraints and risks associated with infusions and to
      allow the patient to follow his treatment at home.

      However, they have significant adverse effects that may affect patients, who are sometimes at
      a disadvantage compared to how they are treated, and potentially lead to non-compliance with
      the consequences.

      This study will identify the factors associated with non-adherence and determine the impact
      of this non-adherence in terms of treatment efficacy and tolerance.

      The aim of this routine care study is to evaluate the adherence to oral anticancer therapies
      during 3 months.

      Primary objective

      - To evaluate adherence to oral anti-cancer therapies at 3 months

      Secondary objectives

        -  To evaluate the adherence to 3 months according to the age of the patients (less than 75
           years versus 75 years and more)

        -  Evaluate compliance at 1 and 2 months

        -  Evaluate toxicity at 1, 2 and 3 months according to compliance according to criteria
           CTCAE 4.03.

        -  Evaluate response to treatment at 3 months based on adherence

        -  Evaluate the factors associated with adherence and describe the reasons for
           non-adherence.
