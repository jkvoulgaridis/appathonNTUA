      The purpose of this study is to assess the benefit of adding stretching exercises to cervical
      mobilization and cervical range of motion exercises on cervical range of motion, pain, pain
      threshold, level of disability and patient satisfaction for patient with non-specific
      mechanical neck pain

      All recruited participants will sign a statement of informed consent. Subjects were randomly
      divided into two groups (combined intervention group and standard intervention group). The
      following questionnaires were completed in the following order: Neck Disability Index (NDI),
      Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), and Global Rating of Change Scale (GROC). Next, Cervical
      Range of Motion (ROM) and Pain threshold were measured for both groups. The combined
      intervention group received the cervical passive mobilization, stretching, and home program
      (Stretching and ROM exercise). The standard intervention group received cervical mobilization
      and home program (ROM exercises).

The cervical passive mobilization were selected by the physical therapist based on the participant's condition. Stretching techniques were performed in the combined intervention group for 30 seconds and repeated 3 times twice a week in the following order on the following muscles: anterior, middle and posterior scalene, upper fibers of trapezius, pectoralis minor and interspinous muscles .AROM Exercise were performed 10 repetitions 3-4 times daily. The ACROM exercise consisted of the subject placing fingers over the manubrium bone and placing chin on the fingers. The subject was then instructed to rotate to one side as far as possible and return to neutral.</description>

            <description>The combined intervention group received the cervical passive mobilization, stretching, and home program (Stretching and ROM exercise).
Stretching, cervical passive mobilization, and range of motion: The manual therapy was conducted by a physical therapist who has experience in manual therapy and is licensed from the California Board of Physical Therapy. The manual therapy intervention will consist of Passive Accessory Intervertebral Movements (PAIVMs). The nature of PAIVMs techniques were selected by the physical therapist based on the participant’s condition.
Stretching exercise will be given to the participants by the physical therapist. Stretching techniques were performed in the combined intervention group for 30 seconds and repeated 3 times twice a week in the following order on the following muscles: anterior, middle and posterior scalene, upper fibers of trapezius, pectoralis minor muscles and interspinous muscles.</description>

Cervical mobilization and range of motion: The manual therapy was conducted by a physical therapist who has experience in manual therapy and is licensed from the California Board of Physical Therapy. The manual therapy intervention will consist of Passive Accessory Intervertebral Movements (PAIVMs). The nature of PAIVMs techniques was selected by the physical therapist based on the participant’s condition.
Active Cervical Range of Motion Exercises (ACROM) were performed 10 repetitions 3–4 times daily. Subjects were advised to maintain their usual activity within the limits of pain. The ACROM exercise consisted of the subject placing fingers over the manubrium bone and placing chin on the fingers. The subject was then instructed to rotate to one side as far as possible and return to neutral.</description>

Stretching, cervical passive mobilization, and range of motion: The manual therapy was conducted by a physical therapist who has experience in manual therapy and is licensed from the California Board of Physical Therapy. The manual therapy intervention will consist of Passive Accessory Intervertebral Movements (PAIVMs). The nature of PAIVMs techniques were selected by the physical therapist based on the participant’s condition.
Stretching exercise will be given to the participants by the physical therapist. Stretching techniques were performed in the combined intervention group for 30 seconds and repeated 3 times twice a week in the following order on the following muscles: anterior, middle and posterior scalene, upper fibers of trapezius, pectoralis minor muscles and interspinous muscles.</description>

            <title>The Standard Intervention</title>
            <description>The standard intervention group will receive cervical mobilization and home program (ROM exercises).
Cervical mobilization and range of motion: The manual therapy was conducted by a physical therapist who has experience in manual therapy and is licensed from the California Board of Physical Therapy. The manual therapy intervention will consist of Passive Accessory Intervertebral Movements (PAIVMs). The nature of PAIVMs techniques was selected by the physical therapist based on the participant’s condition.
Active Cervical Range of Motion Exercises (ACROM) were performed 10 repetitions 3–4 times daily. Subjects were advised to maintain their usual activity within the limits of pain. The ACROM exercise consisted of the subject placing fingers over the manubrium bone and placing chin on the fingers. The subject was then instructed to rotate to one side as far as possible and return to neutral.</description>

Stretching, cervical passive mobilization, and range of motion: The manual therapy was conducted by a physical therapist who has experience in manual therapy and is licensed from the California Board of Physical Therapy. The manual therapy intervention will consist of Passive Accessory Intervertebral Movements (PAIVMs). The nature of PAIVMs techniques were selected by the physical therapist based on the participant’s condition.
Stretching exercise will be given to the participants by the physical therapist. Stretching techniques were performed in the combined intervention group for 30 seconds and repeated 3 times twice a week in the following order on the following muscles: anterior, middle and posterior scalene, upper fibers of trapezius, pectoralis minor muscles and interspinous muscles.</description>

Active Cervical Range of Motion Exercises (ACROM) were performed 10 repetitions 3–4 times daily. Subjects were advised to maintain their usual activity within the limits of pain. The ACROM exercise consisted of the subject placing fingers over the manubrium bone and placing chin on the fingers. The subject was then instructed to rotate to one side as far as possible and return to neutral.</description>

            <description>The combined intervention group received the cervical passive mobilization, stretching, and home program (Stretching and ROM exercise).
Stretching, cervical passive mobilization, and range of motion: The manual therapy was conducted by a physical therapist who has experience in manual therapy and is licensed from the California Board of Physical Therapy. The manual therapy intervention will consist of Passive Accessory Intervertebral Movements (PAIVMs). The nature of PAIVMs techniques were selected by the physical therapist based on the participant’s condition.
Stretching exercise will be given to the participants by the physical therapist. Stretching techniques were performed in the combined intervention group for 30 seconds and repeated 3 times twice a week in the following order on the following muscles: anterior, middle and posterior scalene, upper fibers of trapezius, pectoralis minor muscles and interspinous muscles.</description>

Active Cervical Range of Motion Exercises (ACROM) were performed 10 repetitions 3–4 times daily. Subjects were advised to maintain their usual activity within the limits of pain. The ACROM exercise consisted of the subject placing fingers over the manubrium bone and placing chin on the fingers. The subject was then instructed to rotate to one side as far as possible and return to neutral.</description>
