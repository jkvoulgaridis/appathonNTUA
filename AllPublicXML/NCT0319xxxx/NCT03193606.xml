  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      eligible teeth will be randomly divided into two groups to be treated with incomplete caries
      excavation (A), where (A1) represents teeth to be treated with application of Nano silver
      fluoride solution on remaining carious dentin prior to final permanent glass ionomer
      restoration application, (A2) represents comparator group to be restored without Nano silver
      fluoride application prior to restoration. Every participant will receive both the
      intervention and control treatment. Image of radiographic density of remaining carious dentin
      will be evaluated using PSP plate at baseline immediately after restoration and after 6
      months after restorative procedures.

      The null hypothesis tested is that application of Nano silver fluoride solution prior to
      glass ionomer restoration will not increase radiopacity of the underlying dentin treated by
      incomplete carious removal technique compared to that of direct glass ionomer restoration
      without prior application of Nano silver fluoride.

    <description>prepared Nano-silver fluoride could have the capability to arrest caries. As its Nano silver particles have an antimicrobial activity against Mutans Streptococci and Lactobacilli; the main pathogens involved in the development of carious lesions. In addition, its fluoride component is well known to enhance remineralization and inhibit bacterial activity. So, Nano silver fluoride could be a promising solution to combat residual bacteria in tooth cavity with effective remineralization potential on remaining carious dentin</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients presenting with at least 2 teeth with active carious lesions limited to the
             occlusal surface of molars at risk of pulp exposure during direct complete excavation
             (primary caries lesion involving more than half of the entire dentin thickness
             determined radiographically).

          -  Signs and symptoms indicative of pulp vitality, i.e. a positive response to thermal
             stimulation during a cold test

          -  Absence of apical pathosis, clinical diagnosis of pulp exposure, fistula, swelling of
             periodontal tissues.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Teeth with spontaneous pain or sensitivity to percussion.

          -  Teeth with periodontal lesions, internal or external root resorption, mobility of
             tooth, sinus opening, or abscessed tooth.

          -  Radiographic examination revealed, interrupted or broken lamina dura, widened
             periodontal ligament space, periapical radiolucency.

          -  patients with systemic medical conditions

          -  pregnant females
