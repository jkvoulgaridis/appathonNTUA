      To demonstrate a reduction of debris in knee synovial fluid as demonstrated by WBC cell
      counts before and after irrigation with Bactisure Wound Lavage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will demonstrate a reduction in fluid cell counts in aspirate acquired from
      primary total knee arthroplasty patients diagnosed with infection. WBC cell counts will be
      compared before and after articular irrigation with Bactisure Wound Lavage.

      This study is a prospective, multi-center, single arm study involving orthopedic surgeons
      skilled and experienced in deep surgical debridement and in I &amp; D or reoperation (revision)
      total knee arthroplasty procedures. A maximum of seven study centers will enroll a maximum of
      40 subjects.
