  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted in Europe. The aim of the study is to compare the effect of
      semaglutide subcutaneous (s.c., under the skin) 1.0 mg once-weekly to liraglutide s.c.1.2 mg
      once-daily on blood sugar levels after 30 weeks of treatment in people with type 2 diabetes.
      The study will last approximately 9 months (37 weeks). Each participant will have 7 visits at
      the clinic and 3 phone calls with the study doctor. At the visits, participants will have a
      number of tests, for example: general health checks, blood samples, heart and eye checks etc.
      Participants will also fill in some forms about their health and satisfaction with their
      diabetes treatment.

    <measure>Change in SF-36v2 Short Form Health Survey. Total Summary Scores (Physical Component and Mental Component) and Scores From the 8 Domains</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 30</time_frame>
    <description>Short form-36 version 2 (SF-36v2) is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the subject's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The questionnaire measures the individual overall HRQoL on 8 domains: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional and mental health. Each domain is scored using the sum of the individual item responses and normalised relative to the 2009 US reference population. Overall, the domain scores range from around 0-100 (higher scores indicated a better HRQoL), where the range of possible scores depends on the 2009 US reference population for each domain. The two total summary scores (mental and physical summary components) are calculated through weighted sums of the 8 domain scores. The presented result is the change from baseline (week 0) to week 30 in SF-36v2 scores. A positive change in score indicates an improvement since baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change in Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ). Treatment Satisfaction Summary Score (Sum of 6 of 8 Items) and the 8 Items Separately</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 30</time_frame>
    <description>The DTSQs questionnaire was used to assess subject's treatment satisfaction. This instrument contains 8 items and measures the treatment for diabetes in terms of convenience, flexibility and general feelings regarding treatment. Q 1 = &quot;satisfaction with current treatment&quot;; Q 2 = &quot;hyperglycemia&quot;; Q 3 = &quot;hypoglycemia&quot;; Q 4 = &quot;flexibility&quot;; Q 5 = &quot;convenience&quot;; Q 6 = &quot;understanding of diabetes&quot;; Q 7 = &quot;recommend treatment to others&quot;; and Q 8 = &quot;willingness to continue&quot;. Each item is rated on a 7-point Likert scale with a score ranging from 0 (ie, very dissatisfied) to 6 (ie, very satisfied). DTSQ items 2 and 3 are rated differently: 0 reflects 'never' and 6 reflects 'most of the time'. The 'treatment satisfaction' score is the sum of 6 of the 8 DTSQs components (Q 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8) (range 0-36). Higher scores on the DTSQ total score indicate higher treatment satisfaction. The results presented is the change from baseline (week 0) to week 30 in DTSQ scores.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted at 77 sites in 11 countries as follows (number of sites that screened subjects/ number of sites that randomised subjects):
Bulgaria (9/ 9); Czech Republic (5/ 5); Finland (8/ 8); France (8/ 8); Hungary (8/ 8); Italy (4/ 4); Poland (3/ 3); Slovenia (4/ 4); Spain (5/ 5); Sweden (6/ 6); United Kingdom (17/ 17)</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>After screening, subjects were required to continue their oral anti-diabetic drug (OAD) pre-trial background medication (i.e. metformin, Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, sulphonyl ureas, or combinations of these) throughout the entire trial.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change in Self-measured Plasma Glucose (SMPG), 7 Point Profile: Mean 7-point Profile</title>
        <description>Mean change from baseline in 7-point profile. SMPG was recorded at the following 7 time points: before breakfast, 90 minutes after start of breakfast, before lunch, 90 minutes after start of lunch, before dinner, 90 minutes after dinner and at bedtime. The mean of the 7-point SMPG profile, defined as the area under the profile, was calculated using the trapezoidal method and divided by the measurement time. Results are based on the 'on-treatment without rescue medication' observation period. Missing data were imputed using observed data from subjects within the same group defined by randomised treatment, using a regression model including stratification factor as categorical effect and data from baseline and all previous visits as covariates.</description>

        <title>Change in SF-36v2 Short Form Health Survey. Total Summary Scores (Physical Component and Mental Component) and Scores From the 8 Domains</title>
        <description>Short form-36 version 2 (SF-36v2) is a 36-item patient-reported survey of patient health that measures the subject's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The questionnaire measures the individual overall HRQoL on 8 domains: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional and mental health. Each domain is scored using the sum of the individual item responses and normalised relative to the 2009 US reference population. Overall, the domain scores range from around 0-100 (higher scores indicated a better HRQoL), where the range of possible scores depends on the 2009 US reference population for each domain. The two total summary scores (mental and physical summary components) are calculated through weighted sums of the 8 domain scores. The presented result is the change from baseline (week 0) to week 30 in SF-36v2 scores. A positive change in score indicates an improvement since baseline.</description>

Overall, the domain scores range from around 0-100 (higher scores indicated a better HRQoL), where the range of possible scores depends on the 2009 US reference population for each domain. The two total summary scores (mental and physical summary components) are calculated through weighted sums of the 8 domain scores. The presented result is the change from baseline (week 0) to week 30 in SF-36v2 scores. A positive change in score indicates an improvement since baseline.</description>

        <title>Change in Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ). Treatment Satisfaction Summary Score (Sum of 6 of 8 Items) and the 8 Items Separately</title>
        <description>The DTSQs questionnaire was used to assess subject's treatment satisfaction. This instrument contains 8 items and measures the treatment for diabetes in terms of convenience, flexibility and general feelings regarding treatment. Q 1 = &quot;satisfaction with current treatment&quot;; Q 2 = &quot;hyperglycemia&quot;; Q 3 = &quot;hypoglycemia&quot;; Q 4 = &quot;flexibility&quot;; Q 5 = &quot;convenience&quot;; Q 6 = &quot;understanding of diabetes&quot;; Q 7 = &quot;recommend treatment to others&quot;; and Q 8 = &quot;willingness to continue&quot;. Each item is rated on a 7-point Likert scale with a score ranging from 0 (ie, very dissatisfied) to 6 (ie, very satisfied). DTSQ items 2 and 3 are rated differently: 0 reflects 'never' and 6 reflects 'most of the time'. The 'treatment satisfaction' score is the sum of 6 of the 8 DTSQs components (Q 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8) (range 0-36). Higher scores on the DTSQ total score indicate higher treatment satisfaction. The results presented is the change from baseline (week 0) to week 30 in DTSQ scores.</description>
