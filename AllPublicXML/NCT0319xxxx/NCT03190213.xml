    <time_frame>planned for up to two years from baseline; actual time was up to 230 days (average of 70.5 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response was measured using Immune Related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST). At baseline, lesions found on CT or MRI imaging are cataloged as &quot;target&quot; or &quot;non-target&quot; lesions, and the longest dimensions of target lesions (or shortest dimension of target lymph nodes) are summed. irRECIST defines Complete Response (irCR) as a complete disappearance of all lesions after baseline. Partial Response (irPR) is defined as a 30% or more decrease in the target lesion measurements. Overall response rate is defined the percentage of participants with a best response of irCR + irPR.</description>

Progressive Disease (irPD) is a defined as a 20% or more increase in target lesion measurements. Stable Disease (irSD) is neither a sufficient shrinkage to qualify as irPR or irCR nor an increase that would qualify as irPD. Clinical Benefit Rate is defined as the percentage of participants with a best response of irCR + irPR + irSD.</description>

    <measure>Median Progression Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>planned for up to four years from baseline; actual time was up to 230 days (average of 70.5 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival (PFS) is the length of time during and after treatment that a participant lives and the disease does not get worse. PFS was measured as the time from first dose of pembrolizumab until disease progression by irRECIST criteria (&gt;= 20% increase in target lesion measurements), and is reported as the median number of days patients survived without disease progression as calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

    <description>Overall survival (OS) is the length of time from the start of treatment that a participant lives. OS was measured as the time from first dose of pembrolizumab until the death of the participant or the end of follow-up (whichever was first), and is reported as the median number of days patients survived as calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. This study was intended to follow participants up to four years after the initiation of study treatment, but the study and the follow-up period were terminated prematurely. The maximum follow up was 360 days.</description>

    <measure>Number of Patients With Adverse Events Reported</measure>
    <time_frame>planned for up to two years of treatment plus 90 days; actual time was up to 338 days (average of 170 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse Events were reported using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4. Each adverse event reported is assigned a severity grade from 1 to 5, where 1 is mild, 2 is moderate, 3 is severe, 4 is life threatening, and 5 indicates the event resulted in death. The number of patients experiencing any Grade 1-2 event and the number of patients experiencing any Grade 3 event are reported. There were no Grade 4 or Grade 5 events reported on this study. AEs were reported during study treatment and up to 90 days after last dose of treatment.</description>

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or receiving steroid therapy of any other form of
             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to first dose of trial treatment.
             Subjects who receive daily steroid replacement therapy serve as an exception to this
             rule. Daily prednisone at doses of 5 to 7.5 mg (or hydrocortisone equivalent doses) is
             an example of replacement therapy.

          -  Has a known history of active Bacillus Tuberculosis (TB).

          -  Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.

          -  Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study
             Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events
             due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., less than or equal
             to Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent.
             Note: Subjects with less than or equal to Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this
             criterion and may qualify for the study. Note: If subject received major surgery, they
             must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the
             intervention prior to starting therapy. Patients receiving hormone manipulation (e.g.
             tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, LHRH agonist, etc.) for reasons other than treatment
             of metastatic breast cancer may continue this treatment at the discretion of the
             investigator.

          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.
             Patients on long-term adjuvant therapy with no evidence of disease are not excluded if
             felt appropriate by investigator.

          -  Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least 2 weeks prior

             baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include
             carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.

          -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine,
             insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary
             insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.

             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

          -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-programmed death (PD) -1, anti-PD-L1, or
             anti-PD-L2 agent.
