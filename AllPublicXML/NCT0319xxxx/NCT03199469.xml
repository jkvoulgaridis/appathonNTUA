  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multinational, open-label, ascending-dose, delayed-treatment concurrent control
      clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AT132 in subjects with X-Linked
      Myotubular Myopathy aged less than 5 years old. Subjects will receive a single dose of AT132
      and will be followed for safety and efficacy for 5 years

      This study will evaluate safety and efficacy of gene transfer in X-Linked Myotubular
      Myopathy. Subjects will receive a single dose of AT132 delivered intravenously.

      ASPIRO is being conducted in two parts. Part 1 is a dose escalation phase that is evaluating
      the preliminary safety and efficacy of AT132 at doses of 1x1014 vg/kg and 3x1014 vg/kg. Part
      2 of ASPIRO is a pivotal expansion cohort designed to confirm the safety and efficacy of
      AT132 at a dose of 3x1014 vg/kg. The pivotal expansion cohort will enroll eight subjects,
      consisting of four age-matched pairs (within +/- 6 months of age). One subject from each pair
      will be randomized to receive a single dose of AT132 at 3x1014 vg/kg, and the other will
      serve as a delayed treatment control. Eligible delayed treatment control subjects will be
      administered AT132 after that individual subject has completed the Week 24 visit as a delayed
      treatment control.

      The primary efficacy endpoint measures will be assessed at Week 24. Subjects will be followed
      for a total of 5 years after administration of AT132.

      This study utilizes an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) that will monitors subject
      safety and provides recommendations to Audentes regarding dose escalation, dose expansion,
      and safety matters.

        positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) during sleeping
        hours).

        Part 2: Subject requires invasive mechanical ventilatory support ranging from 20 - 24 hours
        per day at screening (confirmed by daytime polysomnographic study).

          -  Subject requiring invasive mechanical ventilator support is fitted with or willing to
             be fitted with a cuffed tracheostomy tube for some respiratory assessments.

          -  Subject has ventilator maximum positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) &lt;8 cm H2O at
             screening.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is participating in an interventional study designed to treat XLMTM.

          -  Subject born &lt;35 weeks gestation who is still not term as per corrected age.

          -  Subject tests positive for AAV8 neutralizing antibody with titers above protocol
             specified threshold.

          -  Subject had recent surgery (&lt;3 months before Day 1) or has planned surgery that may
             confound data collection during the first 48 weeks of the study.

             investigator.

          -  Subject has a clinically significant underlying liver disease.

          -  Subject is currently experiencing a clinically important respiratory infection or
             other active infection.

          -  Subject has received pyridostigmine or any medication to treat XLMTM within 3 months
             before Day 1.

          -  Other than as required per protocol, subject has received immune-modulating agents
             within 3 months before Day 1 (use of inhaled corticosteroids to manage chronic
             respiratory conditions is allowed); use of other concomitant medications to manage
             chronic conditions must have been stable for at least 4 weeks before dosing.
