  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The chemical messenger dopamine carries signals between brain cells. It may affect addiction.
      Heavy use of pain medicines called opioids may decrease the amount of dopamine available to
      the brain. Researchers want to study if decreased dopamine decreases self-control and
      increases impulsiveness.

      Objective:

      To learn more about how opiate use disorder affects dopamine in the brain.

      Eligibility:

      Adults 18-65 years old who are moderate or severe opiate users

      Healthy volunteers the same age

      Design:

      Participants will first be screened under another protocol. They will:

        -  Have a physical exam

        -  Answer questions about their medical, psychiatric, and alcohol and drug use history

        -  Take an MRI screening questionnaire

        -  Give blood and urine samples

        -  Have their breath tested for alcohol

      Participants will have up to 3 study visits.

      They will have 2-3 positron emission tomography (PET) scans. A radioactive chemical will be
      injected for the scans. Participants will lie on a bed that slides in and out of the
      donut-shaped scanner. A cap or plastic mask may be placed on the head.

      Vital signs will be taken before and after the PET scans.

      Participants will get capsules of placebo or the study drug. They will rate how they feel
      before, during and after.

      Participants will have their breath and urine tested each day.

      Participants will have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. They will lie on a table that
      slides into a cylinder in a strong magnetic field. They may do tasks on a computer screen
      while inside the scanner.

      Participants will have tests of memory, attention, and thinking.

      Participants will wear an activity monitor for one week....

      Objectives: Primary objective is to assess whether the balance between dopamine D1 (D1R) and
      D2 receptors (D2R) signaling in striatum is disrupted in participants with an opioid use
      disorder (OUD) who are on opioid agonist medication (MAT+: methadone or buprenorphine)
      relative to OUD participants treated with the opioid antagonist medication naltrexone and OUD
      participants not being treated with medications (MAT-). Secondary objectives are to assess
      how striatal D1R to D2R availability (assessed with PET) influences: (1) striatal dopamine
      (DA) release; (2) the function of brain reward and self-control networks (assessed with task
      fMRI activation and with resting functional connectivity, RFC) and (3) behavior (locomotor
      activity and neuropsychological tests); (4) to assess if DA increases, as induced by oral
      methylphenidate (MP), improve the function of brain reward and control networks in OUD; and
      (5) to assess if there is recovery after protracted treatment (comparing treated and
      non-treated) by repeating fMRI at 6 month follow-up.

      Study population: We will complete studies in 150 (n=150) subjects: N=60 healthy control
      adults and N=90 OUD participants (30 MAT+, 30 naltrexone-treated and 30 MAT-) aged 18-65
      (male/female) will be included.

      Design: Single-blind. Participants will undergo three scans with positron emission tomography
      (PET): one with [11C]NNC-112 to assess baseline D1R, another with [11C]raclopride after
      placebo to assess baseline D2R and a third one with [11C]raclopride after MP administration
      (60mg oral) to assess striatal DA release (assessed as the difference in specific binding of
      [11C]raclopride between baseline and MP). In addition, participants will undergo two imaging
      sessions with MRI to assess functional reactivity to drug-cues and to a measure of
      self-control (delayed discounting task), to assess RFC and to obtain structural brain
      measures (including diffusion tensor imaging, DTI). One of the sessions will be done under
      baseline conditions (no drug administered) and the other after MP (about one hour after the
      [11C]raclopride MP scan is completed). Neuropsychological tests (NP) and accelerometers will
      be used to assess cognitive performance and locomotor activity respectively.

      Outcome Measures: Main outcome: (1) Differences in D1R to D2R striatal ratio between
      participants with an OUD and controls and between MAT+, naltrexone, and MAT- groups.
      Secondary outcomes: Correlations between striatal D1R to D2R and (1) striatal DA release; (2)
      fMRI activation in reward and controls networks (assessed with cue-reactivity and delay
      discounting tasks, and with RFC) and (3) NP performance and locomotor activity. (4)
      Differences in fMRI activation and RFC after MP when compared with baseline measures.

                  60 or less) will undergo a urine pregnancy test that must be negative to
                  participate. Urine pregnancy tests will be repeated on subsequent days of study.

               9. Presence of ferromagnetic objects in the body that are contraindicated for MRI
                  (pacemakers or other implanted electrical devices, brain stimulators, some types
                  of dental implants, aneurysm clips, metallic prostheses, permanent eyeliner,
                  implanted delivery pump, or shrapnel fragments) or fear of enclosed spaces -
                  self-report checklist. However, OUD subjects who are contraindicated for MRI
                  participation, or the study team cannot access prior surgical records to confirm
                  that a subject is cleared for MRI, may still participate in all aspects of the
                  study except MRI. If it is discovered during the clinical brain MRI or after
                  enrollment onto the study that the subject experiences anxiety or becomes
                  claustrophobic, we will discontinue the MRI portion of the study and he/she can

                  scanners self-report.

              14. Weight &gt; 400 pounds, which is the maximum weight the PET scanner can hold.

              15. Study investigators and staff, as well as their superiors, subordinates and
                  immediate family members (adult children, spouses, parents, siblings).

              16. Participation in a court ordered residential treatment program.

                  Additional exclusion criteria for MAT- OUD participants only:

              17. Currently seeking treatment for OUD, for the MAT- group.

        Note that subjects will not be excluded from enrollment onto this study if their urine test
        is positive for drugs on initial screening. The following guidelines will be followed for
        positive drug screens on study procedure days:

          -  If a Healthy Volunteer subject s urine drug screen test is positive on days involving
             imaging (MRI and/or PET) and NP testing, the procedures will be postponed and
             rescheduled. We will allow for up to 3 rescheduled study days resulting from positive
             urine drug screens. If urine drug screen is positive for THC-COOH, a saliva drug
             screen will be performed and subject may proceed with study day testing procedures if
             saliva results for THC are negative. If the urine/saliva drug test is positive on the
             third rescheduled visit, the participant will be withdrawn from the study.

          -  If an OUD subject s urine drug screen test is positive for drugs (except opiates), the
             procedures will be postponed and rescheduled to another day. If urine drug screen is
             positive for THC-COOH, a saliva drug screen will be performed and subject may proceed
             with study day testing procedures if saliva results for THC are negative. We will not
             place a limit on rescheduling study days in this group.

        Also, note that at any time during participation in this study if any subject expresses
        that he/she wants to get treatment for their OUD, we will immediately refer him/her to a
        treatment program. The subject will be withdrawn from the study at that time. No
        medications will be stopped or held for participation in this protocol.
