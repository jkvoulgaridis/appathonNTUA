  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine the effects of different doses and dosing regimens of ESN364 on
      the frequency and severity of hot flashes. The treatment will be administered for 12 weeks to
      postmenopausal women, ages 40 to 65, suffering at least 50 moderate to severe hot flashes per
      week.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, parallel-group,
      multicenter study to assess the efficacy of ESN364 in postmenopausal women suffering from
      vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes).

      This study will consist of a screening period (Days -35 to -1, including the screening visit
      [Visit 1] and a minimum 7-day collection of baseline vasomotor symptom frequency and severity
      assessments), a 12 week treatment period (Day 1 [Visit 2] to Week 12 [Visit 5]), and a follow
      up visit (Week 15 [Visit 6]) 3 weeks after the last dose of study drug.

      The study will be performed on an ambulatory basis. The screening visit (Visit 1) will occur
      up to 35 days prior to randomization. Eligibility will be assessed via physical examination,
      clinical laboratory testing, vital signs, ECG, Pap smear, mammography, and endometrial
      biopsy. Subjects will receive an electronic diary in which to record daily vasomotor symptoms
      during the duration of the screening period. Subjects must have â‰¥7 consecutive days of
      vasomotor symptom recordings to participate in the study. Subjects are encouraged to continue
      recording for the duration of the whole screening period. The electronic diary will be
      reviewed by study site staff on Day 1 (Visit 2) to confirm study eligibility. Subjects may be
      rescreened 1 time upon approval of the medical monitor.

      During the treatment period, subjects will return to the study site every 4 weeks for
      assessments.

      The follow-up visit will occur approximately 3 weeks following the last dose of study drug.

    <description>The HFRDIS is a 10-item scale that measures a woman's perceptions of the degree to which VMS interfere with 9 daily life activities (work, social activities, leisure, sleep, mood, concentration, relations with others, sexuality, and enjoying life); the 10th item measures interference with overall quality of life. This scale is modeled after items on the Brief Pain Inventory and Brief Fatigue Inventory, which assess the extent to which pain or fatigue interfere with daily life. Participants will be asked to rate the extent to which VMS have interfered with each item during the previous 4-week time interval using a 0 (do not interfere) to 10 (completely interfere) scale, the overall mean score (sum of items/10) will be calculated. Change from baseline will be reported.</description>

    <description>The LSEQ is a 10-item self-rated questionnaire that assesses a patient's aspects of sleep and early morning behavior. The questions are grouped into 4 chronological areas: ease of getting to sleep, perceived quality of sleep, ease of awaking from sleep, and integrity of early morning behavior following wakefulness. The LSEQ is a visual analog scale that requires respondents to place marks on a group of 10 cm lines. Lines extend between extremes like &quot;more difficult than usual&quot; and &quot;easier than usual.&quot; Responses are measured using a 100 mm scale and are averaged to a score for each domain. Change from baseline will be reported.</description>

    <description>The GSC is a 21-item scale that provides a brief but comprehensive and valid measure of climacteric symptomatology. Each item is rated by the patient according to its severity using a 4-point rating scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). The first 20 items of the scale combine into 3 main independent symptom measures by summing up the individual item scores: psychological symptoms (items 1 to 11; score 0 to 33), physical symptoms (items 12 to 18; score 0 to 21), and VMS (items 19 to 20; score 0 to 6). Item 21 is a probe for sexual dysfunction. The total score can range from 0 to 63. Higher scores indicate worse symptoms. Change from baseline will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Menopause-Specific Quality of Life (MENQoL) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and up to week 15</time_frame>
    <description>The MENQoL is self-administered and consists of a total of 29 items in a Likert-scale format. Each item assesses the impact of 1 of 4 domains of menopausal symptoms, as experienced over the last month: vasomotor (items 1 to 3), psychosocial (items 4 to 10), physical (items 11 to 26), and sexual (items 27 to 29). Items pertaining to a specific symptom are rated as present or not present, and if present, how bothersome on a 0 (not bothersome) to 6 (extremely bothersome) scale.. Means are computed for each subscale by dividing the sum of the domain's items by the number of items within that domain. Non-endorsement of an item is scored a &quot;1&quot; and endorsement a &quot;2,&quot; plus the number of the particular rating, so that the possible score on any item ranges from 1 to 8. Change from baseline will be reported.</description>
