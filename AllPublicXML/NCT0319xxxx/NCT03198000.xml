  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, double-blinded study designed to demonstrate the therapeutic
      equivalence of over-the-counter eye drops in healthy adults with red eyes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible participants will use assigned eye drop products as directed. Participants will be
      required to attend 2 consecutive clinic visits. Assessments for eye redness and eye comfort
      will be completed. Participants will complete brief questionnaires about their eyes.
