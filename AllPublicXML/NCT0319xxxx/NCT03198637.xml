  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objectives of the prolonged resuscitation paralysis are usually adaptation to
      mechanical ventilation, lower insufflation pressures and cough suppression.

      The use of monitoring during the prolonged neuromuscular blockade is the subject of
      recommendations. Its interest is subject to a recommendation grade B and its use in
      prevention of overdose is associated with a recommendation of Grade C.

      However, many practitioners continue to objectify the depth of neuromuscular blockade and
      reversal by simple clinical evaluation. This is a subjective estimate of the depth of
      neuromuscular block.

      Resuscitation in several pharmacokinetic parameters are taken into account. First, the drug
      distribution volume is usually increased in the Intensive Care patient and requires an
      increase in initial doses to obtain the same pharmacological effect.

      Then, unlike a short-term administration, the administration of neuromuscular blocking agents
      on days causes diffusion in peripheral compartments. Their diffusion coefficients are slower
      which contributes to the increase of the elimination period after interruption of the
      administration of curare. There is therefore a risk of residual paralysis.

      Secondarily, the curare needs can be influenced by thermoregulation, water and electrolyte
      disorders and acid-base, administration of certain drugs, the inter- and intra-individual
      variability and tachyphylaxis (form tolerance of particularly rapid installation during a few
      close administration, linked to the proliferation of cholinergic receptors).

      The value of monitoring neuromuscular blockade in intensive care is the prevention of
      overdose and in finding the lowest effective dose.
