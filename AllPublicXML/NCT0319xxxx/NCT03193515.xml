  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Voided urinary cytology (VUC) is the most widely used urine-based assay for detecting bladder
      cancer (BCa); however, it fails to detect approximately 50% of low-grade or early stage BCa
      when it is most curable. Furthermore, the detection rate of VUC for recurrent BCa is not much
      better. Because of this severe limitation, all patients who are under surveillance to monitor
      for recurrent BCa must undergo an invasive examination of the urinary bladder, where a
      miniature camera is inserted into the bladder and the bladder inspected (cystoscopy). We
      propose to improve the non-invasive detection of recurrent BCa by further validating a
      multiplex ELISA assay directed at a BCa-associated diagnostic signature in voided urine
      samples.

        Participants must be:

          -  Age 18 years or older

          -  Have a history of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer or muscle invasive bladder cancer
             treated by bladder sparing techniques (or not yet treated) and diagnosed within the
             past 24 months on cystoscopic surveillance

          -  Participants may be treated with adjuvant intravesical therapy

          -  Willing and able to give written informed consent (see Appendix 1)

          -  Be willing to adhere to the surveillance regimen (high risk and intermediate risk seen
             every 3 months for 2 years; low risk seen every 6-12 months for 2 years)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Participants must not:

          -  Have had radical cystectomy

             within the past 3 years

          -  Have a known active urinary tract infection or urinary retention

          -  Have active stone disease (renal or bladder) or renal insufficiency (creatinine &gt;2.0
             mg/dL) - Serum creatinine value can be up to 60 days before consent, otherwise repeat.

          -  Have ureteral stents, nephrostomy tubes or bowel interposition

          -  Have recent genitourinary instrumentation (within 10 days prior to signing consent)
