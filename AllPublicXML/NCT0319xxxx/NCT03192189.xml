  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury is a frequent and growing complication associated with a risk of
      progressing into a chronic kidney disease. Recent guidelines have recommended systematic
      consultations with a nephrologist 3-6 months following hospitalization. Risk factors of
      developing chronic kidney disease between hospital visits are understudied.

        Patients undergoing dialysis for acute kidney injury. All new adults (&gt;18 years old)
        hospitalized in a university center with severe AKI was included from August 2016 to
        December 2017. Inclusion criteria was a severe AKI defined by dialysis start for AKI or an
        increase of Scr upper 354 μmol/L. Exclusion criteria was CKD stage 5 , patients living with
        kidney transplant, plan dialysis for bilateral surgery nephrectomy, patient witch justice
        protection and refuse to participate. Eligible patients were identified by physicians for
        ICU and nephrology department and by laboratory biochemistry department for others wards. A
        Biochemistry alert system controlled the exhaustively of inclusion in ICU and Nephrology
        department during the period of the study.
