      This randomized phase III trial studies how well paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab with
      or without atezolizumab works in treating patients with breast cancer that has spread to
      other parts of the body (metastatic). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Trastuzumab is a form of &quot;targeted
      therapy&quot; because it works by attaching itself to specific molecules (receptors) on the
      surface of cancer cells, known as HER2 receptors. When trastuzumab attaches to HER2
      receptors, the signals that tell the cells to grow are blocked and the cancer cell may be
      marked for destruction by the body's immune system. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      pertuzumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Immunotherapy
      with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may induce changes in body's immune system
      and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. It is not yet known
      whether giving paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab with or without atezolizumab may kill
      more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine whether the addition of atezolizumab to a regimen of paclitaxel, pertuzumab,
      and trastuzumab will improve the progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed by investigator
      using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria, relative to a
      regimen of paclitaxel, pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and placebo in patients with newly documented
      HER2-positive measurable metastatic breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the addition of atezolizumab to a regimen of paclitaxel, pertuzumab,
      and trastuzumab will improve the overall survival (OS) relative to a regimen of paclitaxel,
      pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and placebo.

      II. To determine whether the addition of atezolizumab to a regimen of paclitaxel, pertuzumab,
      and trastuzumab will improve the overall objective response (OR), assessed by investigator
      using RECIST 1.1 criteria, relative to a regimen of paclitaxel, pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and
      placebo.

      III. To determine whether the addition of atezolizumab to a regimen of paclitaxel,
      pertuzumab, and trastuzumab will improve PFS, OR, and/or duration of objective response
      assessed by retrospective blinded central review using RECIST 1.1 criteria, relative to a
      regimen of paclitaxel, pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and placebo.

      IV. To determine whether the addition of atezolizumab to a regimen of paclitaxel, pertuzumab,
      and trastuzumab will decrease the incidence of subsequent brain metastases in patients
      without known brain metastases at study entry relative to a regimen of paclitaxel,
      pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and placebo.

      V. To determine whether the addition of atezolizumab to a regimen of paclitaxel, pertuzumab,
      and trastuzumab will contribute to increased patient-reported fatigue in comparison to a
      regimen of paclitaxel, pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and placebo.

      VI. To determine the utility of PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining as a predictive and
      prognostic biomarker associated with clinical response, as assessed by investigator using
      RECIST 1.1 criteria, to atezolizumab in combination with paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and
      pertuzumab.

      VII. To determine the immune-related toxicity profile of the two treatment regimens.

      VIII. To determine the cardiac safety profile of the two treatment regimens.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the addition of atezolizumab to a regimen of paclitaxel, pertuzumab,
      and trastuzumab will improve the progression-free survival and overall objective response,
      assessed by investigator using immune-modified RECIST (iRECIST) criteria, relative to a
      regimen of paclitaxel, pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and placebo.

      II. To identify potential biomarkers that can predict benefit from the addition of
      atezolizumab in patients with newly documented HER2-positive measurable metastatic breast
      cancer treated with a regimen of paclitaxel, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab, and placebo.

      III. To explore the toxicity profile of the two treatment regimens using patient-reported
      symptomatic adverse events in addition to standard adverse event reports.

      IV. To determine the feasibility and added value of frequent assessment of toxicity using
      Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO)-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) with
      electronic(e)PRO reporting.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive pertuzumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 22,
      trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 22, paclitaxel IV over 60 minutes on days 1,
      8, 15, 22, 29, and 36, and atezolizumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 22. Cycles for
      pertuzumab, trastuzumab and atezolizumab repeat every 6 weeks and treatment with paclitaxel
      repeats every 6 weeks for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients may receive additional 3 cycles of paclitaxel in the absence
      of progression at the investigator's discretion.

      ARM II: Patients receive pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel as in Arm I. Patients also
      receive placebo IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 22. Cycles for pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and
      placebo repeat every 6 weeks and treatment with paclitaxel repeats every 6 weeks for up to 4
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may receive
      additional 3 cycles of paclitaxel in the absence of progression at the investigator's
      discretion.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years and
      then every 6 months for 4 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient must have signed and dated an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved
             consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines

          -  Patient must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0
             or 1

          -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast with locally recurrent,
             unresectable disease or metastatic disease confirmed as described below; eligible
             patients include those with either:

               -  De novo metastatic disease presenting without prior history of HER2-positive
                  breast cancer:

                    -  Diagnosis should have been made from a biopsy of a metastatic disease site,
                       but biopsy from the breast primary or involved regional lymph nodes is
                       acceptable if biopsy of the metastatic sites was thought to carry excessive
                       risk for the patient

               -  Locally recurrent or metastatic disease following prior therapy for early breast
                  cancer:

                    -  Diagnosis must have been made from the biopsy of the locally recurrent or
                       metastatic disease

                    -  There must be an interval of &gt;= 6 months between completion of
                       neoadjuvant/adjuvant HER2-targeted therapy and documentation of locally
                       recurrent or metastatic HER2-positive disease by biopsy

          -  Patients must have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1, as determined by the site,
             to be eligible

          -  The tumor specimen obtained at the time of diagnosis of locally recurrent or
             metastatic disease must have been determined to be HER2-positive based on central
             testing according to American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American
             Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) guidelines (Wolff 2018); HER2 status will initially be
             assessed using a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared IHC assay; positive is
             defined as IHC 3+ staining intensity; if HER2 IHC results are equivocal (2+), then
             HER2 status will be determined using a FDA-cleared HER2 in situ hybridization (ISH)
             test according to ASCO/CAP guidelines; sites can send biopsy specimens for central
             testing which have been determined to be HER2-positive or initially equivocal by
             either IHC or ISH on local testing

          -  The tumor specimen obtained at the time of diagnosis used for HER2 testing must also
             have central testing for PD-L1 status; patients will be eligible irrespective of PD-L1
             testing result including PD-L1 indeterminant

          -  The tumor specimen obtained at the time of diagnosis used for HER2 and PD-L1 testing
             should also have central testing for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor
             (PgR) according to current ASCO/CAP guideline recommendations for hormone receptor
             testing; patients with &lt; 1% ER and PgR staining by IHC will be classified as negative;
             if sufficient material for central confirmation of ER and PgR is unavailable, local
             testing results for ER and PgR may be used for eligibility

          -  Localized palliative radiation therapy is allowed for symptom management if completed
             &gt;= 14 days prior to randomization

          -  Patients must have imaging of the chest/abdomen/pelvis, preferably with a computed
             tomography (CT) scan, and a bone scan within 4 weeks prior to randomization; (NOTE: if
             a patient is unable to receive CT contrast, a magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] of the
             abdomen/pelvis and non-contrast chest CT should be performed; positron emission
             tomography/computed tomography [PET/CT] is not an acceptable alternative)

          -  MRI of the brain (or contrast CT scan of the brain if patients are unable to undergo
             MRI) must be obtained in patients with symptoms suggesting possible central nervous
             system (CNS) metastatic disease; neuroimaging is recommended but not required in
             asymptomatic patients

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be &gt;= 1200/mm^3 (within 14 days prior to
             randomization)

          -  Hemoglobin must be &gt;= 8 g/dL (within 14 days prior to randomization)

          -  Total bilirubin must be =&lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for the lab or direct
             bilirubin =&lt; ULN for patients with bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 x ULN (within 14 days prior
             to randomization)
