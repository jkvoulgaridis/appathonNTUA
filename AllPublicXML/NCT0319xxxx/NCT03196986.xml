  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, multi-center phase 3 study is aimed to compare the efficacy
      and safety of MIL60 with bevacizumab as first-line treatment when combined with standard
      chemotherapy (paclitaxel/carboplatin) in treatment-naive patients with advanced or recurrent
      non-squamous NSCLC.

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group Phase 3 clinical trial
      evaluating the efficacy and safety of MIL60 plus paclitaxel and carboplatin versus
      bevacizumab plus paclitaxel and carboplatin in first-line treatment for patients with
      advanced (unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic) non-squamous NSCLC.The
      primary objective of the study was to compare the Objective Response Rate according to RECIST
      1.1 of MIL60 in combination with paclitaxel plus carboplatin and bevacizumab plus paclitaxel
      plus carboplatin in the treatment of advanced or recurrent non-squamous NSCLC subjects.
