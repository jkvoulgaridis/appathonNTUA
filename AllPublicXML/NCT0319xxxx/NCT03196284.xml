  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Africa, Asia, Europe and North America. The aim of the trial is to
      assess the efficacy of concizumab administered s.c. (subcutaneously, under the skin) once
      daily in preventing bleeding episodes in haemophilia A and B patients with inhibitors.
