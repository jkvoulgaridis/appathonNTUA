             a blood sample, drawn at least 3 days apart, between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m.

          3. At least 1 clinical feature consistent with male hypogonadism. If a subject is

             study drug, throughout the entire study.

          5. No unstable ongoing concomitant medical conditions. Treated and well-controlled

             implantable pellets within the previous 6 months.

          3. Use of any drug that could interfere with measurement or assessment of serum androgen

             antiandrogenic properties (eg, spironolactone, cimetidine, flutamide, bicalutamide,
             and ketoconazole). These drugs must be stopped for at least 1 month prior to study
             entry (6 months in the case of dutasteride). Patients taking potent, long-acting
             opiate therapy on a daily basis are not eligible for the study. Conversely, ad hoc use
             of potent, short-acting opiates for a period of less than 7 days may be permitted
             after discussion with the Marius Pharmaceuticals medical monitor.

          4. Use of over-the-counter products, including natural health products (eg, food
             supplements and herbal supplements such as saw palmetto or phytoestrogens) that may
             affect total T levels, within 7 days prior to study entry.

          5. History of drug or alcohol abuse within the past 2 years that in the opinion of the

             patient safety, including psychiatric disorders.

             skin cancer with clear margins.

         10. Any surgical or medical condition that might alter administration of the study drug or
             comparator, including history of gastric surgery, cholecystectomy, vagotomy, bowel
             resection, or any surgical procedure that might interfere with gastrointestinal
             motility, pH, or absorption of TU.

         11. Duodenal or gastric ulcers, or gastrointestinal/rectal bleeding during the 3 months
             prior to screening.
