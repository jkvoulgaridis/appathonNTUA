      This is a multicenter, open-label Phase 1 study of acalabrutinib, a selective and
      irreversible Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in Japanese adult patients with advanced
      B-cell malignancies. This study is divided into 3 parts: Part 1 (dose-confirmation phase),
      Part 2 (dose-expansion phase) and Part 3 (dose-confirmation phase for combination therapy).
