  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a parallel arm, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial to assess
      the efficacy of an experimental software program designed to improve cognitive functions
      versus a computer-based software control. Both the study and the software being investigated
      meet the criteria of Non-Significant Risk.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of the experimental treatment
      (cognitive training) further outlined in this protocol on the cognitive abilities (e.g.,
      processing speed, attention, working memory, and executive function), brain functionality,
      functional status and quality of life of individuals with age-related cognitive decline as
      compared to a computer-based active control.
