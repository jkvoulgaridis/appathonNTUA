      1. To determine the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on vigilance
           in subjects with central hypersomnia without cataplexy.

        2. To determine the effects of tDCS on subjective measures of sleepiness and alertness in
           subjects with central hypersomnia without cataplexy.

      This is a randomized, sham-controlled, parallel group study. The study will last up to 5
      weeks. After informed consent, subjects with idiopathic hypersomnia with an MSLT mean sleep
      latency of &gt;8 minutes will undergo actigraphy and those with an average sleep time of &gt;10
      hours per day will continue with the study while those with &lt;10 hours sleep time will be
      excluded. In addition, OSA subjects with complaints of hypersomnia with an ESS score &lt;10 will
      also be excluded. Female subjects of child bearing age and not menopausal will have a
      pregnancy test performed as pregnancy is an exclusionary criteria.

      Subjects will be randomized to receive either active tDCS or sham stimulation for 30 minutes
      daily for 4 sessions. The randomization will be generated by means of a computer-generated
      random-number table. An unrestricted randomization scheme will be followed. Subjects will be
      blinded as to whether they are receiving sham or active tDCS treatments. The investigator who
      will conduct the analysis of all outcomes will be blinded as to subject treatment assignment.

      All stimulation visits will be completed within a five-consecutive day period; that is one
      stimulation visit may be missed provided a total of four stimulation visits are completed
      within a five-day period. Outcome measures will include: psychomotor vigilance test (PVT),
      subjective measures of sleepiness, and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression
      (CES-D) scale. PVT will be performed pre- and post- stimulation during the first and last
      stimulation sessions. Subjective measures of sleepiness include the following: Epworth
      Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS), Functional Outcomes of Sleep
      Questionnaire-10 (FOSQ-10), and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).

    <intervention_model_description>This is a 5 week randomized, sham-controlled, parallel group study involving subjects with any of the following diagnoses: Idiopathic Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy without Cataplexy, Hypersomnia in OSA patients adequately treated with PAP therapy or dental device, Posttraumatic hypersomnia, Hypersomnia, unspecified. Subjects with idiopathic hypersomnia with an MSLT mean sleep latency of &gt;8 minutes will undergo actigraphy and those with an average sleep time of &gt;10 hours per day will continue with the study while those with &lt;10 hours sleep time will be excluded. OSA subjects with complaints of hypersomnia with an ESS score &lt;10 will be excluded. Female subjects of child bearing age and not menopausal will have a pregnancy test performed.
Subjects will receive either active tDCS or sham stimulation for 30 minutes daily for 4 sessions. Subjects will be blinded as to whether they are receiving sham or active tDCS treatments.</intervention_model_description>
