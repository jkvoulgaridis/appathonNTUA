      Primary Objectives:

      Dose escalation (Part 1)

      Part 1A (SAR439459 monotherapy)

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or maximum administered dose (MAD) of
           SAR439459 when administered intravenously as monotherapy in adult patients with advanced
           solid tumors.

      Part 1B (SAR439459 and cemiplimab combination therapy)

        -  To determine the MTD and/or MAD of SAR439459 administered intravenously in combination
           with cemiplimab administered intravenously in adult patients with advanced solid tumors.

      Dose expansion (Part 2)

      Part 2A (SAR439459 monotherapy)

        -  To determine optimal dose of SAR439459 administered intravenously in adult patients with
           advanced melanoma who have failed a prior therapy based on anti-PD-1 (programmed cell
           death-1) or anti-PD-L1.

      Part 2B (SAR439459 and cemiplimab combination therapy)

        -  To determine the objective response rate (ORR) of SAR439459 in combination with
           cemiplimab in adult patients with selected advanced solid tumors by evaluation of
           antitumor response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST
           1.1).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile SAR439459 monotherapy and combined with cemiplimab, PK
           profile of cemiplimab combined with SAR439459.

           cemiplimab.

        -  Preliminary recommended phase 2 dose (pRP2D) of SAR439459 as monotherapy or combined
           with cemiplimab.

      Dose expansion (Part 2)

        -  Progression free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), ORR, and safety of SAR439459
           as monotherapy and PFS, TTP, duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR) and
           safety in combination with cemiplimab.

      The duration of the study for an individual patient will start from the signature of the main
      informed consent and include a screening period of up to 4 weeks (28 days), a treatment
      period of at least 1 or 2 cycles (21 or 14 days per cycle, respectively), an end-of-treatment
      visit at least 30 days following the last administration of study drug (or until the patient
      receives another anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier), and a follow-up visit 3 months
      after treatment discontinuation and every 3 months following, until disease progression, or
      initiation of another antitumor treatment, or death, whichever is earlier. For the urothelial
      cancer cohort in Part 2B, follow-up visits will occur every 3 months until death or the
      cutoff date for the overall survival analysis (approximately 12 months after last patient
      first dose), whichever comes first.

      Patients who have no disease progression, and continue to benefit from the study drug(s),
      will be allowed to continue treatment beyond the common study end-date at their assigned dose
      unless the study is terminated by the Sponsor. The expected enrollment period is
      approximately 42 months.
