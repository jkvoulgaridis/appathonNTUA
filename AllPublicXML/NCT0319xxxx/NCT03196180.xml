    <textblock>
      This early phase I clinical trial studies the side effects of topical fluorouracil and
      imiquimod ointment in treating patients with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.
      Topical fluorouracil may kill precancerous cells. Imiquimod ointment may stimulate the immune
      system. Applying topical fluorouracil and imiquimod ointment may cause fewer side effects and
      may be a better way to treat patients with precancerous cervical lesions.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Assess feasibility, evaluated based on safety and tolerability, of a combination agent
      intervention (once-weekly self-administered intravaginal application of 5-fluorouracil
      alternating with once-weekly provider-applied imiquimod) for treatment of high-grade cervical
      squamous intraepithelial lesions.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess efficacy of the combination agent intervention on cervical disease regression
      (endpoint based on histologic regression from high-grade lesions to low-grade or no lesions
      and clearance of high risk-human papillomavirus [HPV] detection) between baseline and study
      exit visits.

      II. Assess efficacy of the combination agent intervention on genotype-specific HPV clearance
      between baseline and study exit visits.

      III. Assess efficacy of the combination agent intervention on biomarkers of local immune
      activation (measurement of changes in expression of Toll-like receptors (TLR) and
      T-regulatory cells and the levels of innate, immune mediating and proinflammatory cytokines
      with intravaginal 5-fluorouracil [FU] and imiquimod) between baseline and study exit visits.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of imiquimod.

      Patients receive topical fluorouracil intravaginally via applicator at weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9,
      11, 13, and 15 and imiquimod intravaginally via applicator at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14,
      and 16. Patients who are menstruating will delay application until the end of the menstrual
      cycle.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 8 months.

    <description>Graded by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Will assess the number of participants experiencing the dose limiting toxicity (DLT). DLT is defined as grade 2 or greater toxicity (or grade 1 toxicity of any genital lesion [blisters, ulcerations, or pustule]) that is possibly, probably, or definitely related and lasts for more than 5 days. Descriptive statistics of the type and frequency of all adverse events will be generated, including 95% confidence intervals. The adverse event rate and tolerability rate will be reported along with their 95% confidence intervals.</description>

          -  Women with biopsy confirmed high grade cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions
             (i.e., cervical squamous intraepithelial neoplasia 3 [CIN3] lesions, and cervical
             squamous epithelial neoplasia 2 [CIN2] lesions with diagnosis confirmed by positive
             p16 immunohistochemistry staining) within 12 weeks of baseline visit

          -  Karnofsky &gt;= 70%

          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/microliter

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/microliter

          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/microliter

          -  Serum creatinine =&lt; the upper institutional limits

          -  Participants must have a negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody/antigen
             test and negative Chlamydia (C.) trachomatis/Neisseria (N.) gonorrhea nucleic acid
             amplification test (NAAT)

          -  Agree to use an effective form of contraception; the effects of intravaginal
             5-fluorocuracil and imiquimod on the developing human fetus at the recommended
             therapeutic dose are unknown; for this reason and because 5- fluorouracil is known to
             be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate dual
             methods of contraception (hormonal method of birth control, intrauterine device, or
             tubal ligation - plus condoms) or abstinence prior to study entry and for the duration
             of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while participating in this study, she should inform her study physician immediately

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women treated previously with 5-fluorouracil or imiquimod or other medications for
             high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions will be excluded from the study

          -  Concurrent vaginal, vulvar, anal lesions or symptomatic infections

          -  Pregnant or planning pregnancy within the next 6 months, or breastfeeding; pregnant
             women are excluded from this study because 5-fluorouracil is an antimetabolite with
             the potential for teratogenic effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk
             for adverse events (AEs) in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             5-fluorouracil, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with
             5-fluorouracil

          -  Inability to speak or read English or Spanish

          -  Prior hysterectomy

          -  Use of anticoagulant medications

                  cells, favor neoplasia cytology diagnosis)

               -  Evidence of cervical carcinoma on Pap smear or biopsy

               -  More than two cervical quadrants of CIN 3 as visualized by colposcopy

               -  Nonvisual squamous columnar junction on colposcopy with no concurrent
                  endocervical sampling performed

             failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements
