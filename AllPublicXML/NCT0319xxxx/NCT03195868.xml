  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to determine if photobiomodulation (PBM, or low level laser light) affects
      the growth and distribution of nerves int he skin. Our previous study demonstrated that the
      treatment we use here was effective at reducing the symptoms of neuropathy (as measured by
      the modified total neuropathy score) in patients who had been treated with chemotherapy. The
      current effort is designed to repeat this confirm this observation using a more extensive
      battery of survey as well as to begin to elucidate the mechanism through which
      photobiomodulaiton produces the effect. WE will also be attempting to determine if diabetic
      patients differ in terms of response from chemotherapy patients

      Consenting patients with self-reported neuropathy following either diabetes or administration
      of chemotherapy, will undergo sensory testing and skin biopsies of the the foot and leg prior
      to initiating treatment. They will undergo PBM 3 times weekly for 6 weeks with with a
      follow-up biopsy performed at the conclusion of therapy and sensory testing throughout.
      Patients will have one remote evaluation at 26 weeks to determine whether the effect, if any
      extinguishes.
