    <description>Subjects will participate in 18 sessions of training in the outpatient clinic with a licensed physical therapist. Therapy sessions will include 30 minutes of task specific training and another 15 minutes of the session can be used to focus on patient specific goal areas related to functional mobility and balance. Training sessions will occur 2-3 times a week for 6-8 weeks to complete the training protocol.</description>
