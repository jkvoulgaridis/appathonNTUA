      SUMMARY

      Rationale: For persons with Parkinson's disease (PD), medical decisions are based almost
      exclusively on periodic in-clinic evaluations by a neurologist or a nurse. For a variety of
      reasons, such &quot;snapshots&quot; are unable to capture the actual impact of PD on the patient's
      functioning in their own home environment. Outpatient evaluations cannot detect rare and
      typically domestic events, such as falls. In addition, episodic visits are not well suited to
      detect changes in important lifestyle issues, such as gradual declines in physical activity.

      Objective: To objectively, continuously and accurately collect detailed information on
      (changes in) physical activity and fall patterns among patients with PD in daily life.

      Study design: Observational cohort study in 200 patients with PD, with a 12 month follow-up
      period.

      Study population: Patients with PD (n=200), with an increased fall risk (i.e. at least one
      fall within the last six months).

      Intervention (if applicable): This study does not include an intervention. After a baseline
      assessment on demographics and PD symptoms, patients will use a remote monitoring system at
      home (a pendant falls detector) combined with an smartphone application aimed at falls
      self-reporting, and an application to report medication intake for 12 months. A similar set
      up (i.e.Vital@Home) has been previously tested on feasibility (Dossiernummer: 2017-3382).
      Additionally, patients will report sleep patterns through paper-based diaries.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameters are physical activity and number
      of falls. They are remotely registered by the pendant falls detector.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: In this study, no invasive measurements will be performed. The participation is
      free of risks. Subjects could potentially benefit personally from participating in this
      study, as they can use the devices for free during the study and receive periodically
      feedback about physical activity and the occurrence of falls.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must confirm that they have been diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease by a
             neurologist (self-reported)

          -  Age 18 or older

          -  At least 1 fall incident in the previous 6 months. A fall is defined as any unexpected
             event that caused the person to unintentionally land on any lower surface (object,
             floor, or ground), regardless of any sustained injury (self-reported)

          -  Able and willing to provide written informed consent in accordance with Good Clinical
             Practice, and national and local regulation

          -  Fluent in Dutch

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patients receives advanced therapy for their Parkinson's disease (deep brain
             stimulation, duodopa pump, apomorphine pump);

          -  The patients shows cognitive of psychiatric impairments that may hinder successful
             completion of the study protocol (as judged by the researcher running the
             recruitment).
