      Perineal block with the anesthesia of the pudendal nerve`s terminal branches allows to
      perform a hemorrhoidectomy with the optimal intraoperative and postoperative analgesia The
      purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the intraoperative use of perineal
      block with spinal anesthesia to reduce postoperative pain and the amount of used analgesics.

      Hemorrhoidectomy, as has being demonstrated to be an effective method of treatment for stage
      III-IV hemorrhoidal disease. However it is associated with intense postoperative pain that
      requires the use of multimodal analgesia. Inadequate pain control leads to the prolongation
      of admission, increasing the consumption of opioid analgesics.

      Traditionally spinal or general anesthesia is used in proctological practice. However, the
      number of studies about using of perianal local anesthesia, both in combination with general
      anesthesia and as a separate practice has been increasing recently.

      Perineal block with the anesthesia of the pudendal nerve`s terminal branches allows to
      perform a hemorrhoidectomy with the optimal intraoperative and postoperative analgesia. The
      drugs used for this have some pharmacological differences in the duration of the drug and the
      form of administration.

      The aim of this prospective, randomized, double-blind study is to assess the effectiveness of
      the intraoperative use of perineal block with spinal anesthesia to reduce postoperative pain
      and the amount of used analgesics.

    <masking_description>Randomization of the patients included in the study was performed before surgery. Patients were being randomly divided into two groups. All patients getting subarachnoid anesthesia. Perineal block using solution of ropivocaine and epinephrine for the first group was performed and placebo with epinephrine - for the second group. A researcher who does not participate in the surgery and does not contact with patients at all perioperative stages performs randomization and prepares a solution block. Neither the patient nor the operating surgeon and the doctors who register the results of the treatment are not informed about the anesthesia used in each case.
The probability of introduction to each group is 50%. The number of patients in both groups equally and is 50 people.</masking_description>

    <description>Perineal block using solution of ropivocaine and epinephrine for the first group was performed. Anococcygeal ligament is infiltrated with 10 ml of the solution after the intracutaneous infiltration in 2 cm from the anus. Ten ml of the solution is injected in ischiorectal fat on each side. The needle is orienteered at the angle of 45 degrees cranially and laterally, and to the surface what allows the surgeon to anesthetize the deep branches of the pudendal nerve. In addition, 10 ml of solution is injected transdermal on the front edge of the anus with further subcutaneous infiltration on each side of the anus to provide anesthesia to the nerve branches laying more superficial. The total amount of the injected solution is 50 ml.</description>
