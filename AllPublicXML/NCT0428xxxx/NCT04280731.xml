  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The demand for alternatives to dairy products has increased in recent years and a lot of
      proposals for vegetable milk and yogurt products have taken place in the market. Quinoa is a
      plant from South America that has growth in popularity in recent years as many sought out
      nutritious and healthier eating, the herb is known for its high nutritional value. It is
      complete protein source containing all the essential amino acids. If this herb were fermented
      with probiotic bacteria, there is a potential for a product that is lactose free, gluten free
      and cholesterol free.

      The probiotic potential of quinoa milk, fermented with food associated lactic acid bacteria
      will be investigated. This includes a study that examines how daily consumption of this
      vegetable drink changes the composition of the oral and intestinal flora. Therefore, healthy
      people are now seeking to participate in the study, which will be for just over 2 weeks.
