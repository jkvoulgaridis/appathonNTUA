      The primary objective is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the Axys EX
      rotational atherectomy system in subjects with peripheral arterial disease who have de novo
      or non-stented restenotic obstructive lesions in the peripheral vasculature of the lower
      limbs.

          7. Target lesion present in a single limb that consists of a single de novo or
             non-stented restenotic lesion, or qualifies as a tandem or combination lesion per the
             definitions below:

               1. Tandem (adjacent) Lesion: Lesions present in the same target vessel that can be
                  treated as one single lesion and is separated by an angiographic normal vessel ≤3
                  cm at any point. Multiple points of separation can be present in single lesion
                  treatment if no single point of separation is &gt; 3 cm

               2. Combination Lesion: A single lesion that is not completely occluded but includes
                  a segment of complete occlusion anywhere along the length

          8. Exchangeable guidewire must cross target lesion within the lumen

          9. Total target lesion length is ≥ 20 mm and ≤ 200mm

         10. Reference vessel diameter (RVD) is ≥ 2.0 mm and ≤ 5.0 mm

             anticipated to provide reconstitution of blood flow to the foot. Angiographic evidence
             of adequate distal runoff through the foot (at least one native calf vessel [posterior
             tibial, anterior tibial, or peroneal artery] is patent, defined as &lt; 50% stenosed)

         12. Multiple lesions in the target limb (including the target lesion and non-target
             lesions) may be treated if all of the following applies:

               1. Non-target lesion(s) must be located proximal to the target lesion

               2. Non-target lesion(s) must be successfully treated (defined as optimally treated
                  [e.g. no untreated arterial dissections or perforation present]) by standard
                  endovascular procedures prior to initiation of treatment of the target lesion

               3. Non-target lesions treated prior to target lesion cannot be treated with
                  rotational, orbital or laser atherectomy
