      This trial examines if a prostate magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging can be performed
      on a 3T scanner using an investigational contrast called hyperpolarized 13-C pyruvate for the
      development of a clinical prostate cancer exam. 3T refers to the strength of the magnetic
      resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) machine. MRSI is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      technique that can show certain chemical differences in healthy and diseased prostate tumor
      tissue compared to standard multiparametric MRI that may not detect the tumor. Hyperpolarized
      (HP) 13-C pyruvate is a contrast drug that may help the scanner see the tumor site better
      during imaging. Hyperpolarization of 13-C pyruvate may allow pyruvate and its metabolites to
      be detected upon injection, which in turn, allow the prostate cancer to be found and treated.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess reproducibility of quantitative spectroscopic and imaging parameters in
      hyperpolarized 13-C pyruvate magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI), including kpl,
      which assesses the rate of conversion of 13-C pyruvate to 13-C lactate in the tissue of
      interest, using a test-retest study design.

      II. To test the reproducibility of the normalized area under the lactate curve (nLac), a
      semi-quantitative biomarker for tumor metabolism.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To provide initial assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of hyperpolarized
      13-C-pyruvate MRSI performed pre-therapy for detecting high risk localized prostate cancer.

      II. To assess the correlation between kpl and tumor grade.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM Ia: Patients receive hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate intravenously (IV) and undergo
      MRSI at least 5 weeks after prostate cancer biopsy.

      ARM Ib: Patients receive hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate IV and undergo MRSI at least 5
      weeks after prostate cancer biopsy and at a second time 3-4 weeks after.

      ARM II: Patients receive hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate IV and undergo MRSI at least 5
      weeks after prostate cancer biopsy, followed by standard of care surgery within 6 months
      after.

      After the completion of study, patients in Arm Ia and Arm Ib are followed up once.

    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed using a test-retest study design. Will be summarized by the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Data from patients at both MD Anderson and University of San Fransisco, San Fransisco (UCSF) will be pooled if possible to increase significance. Bland-Altman analysis will be included if the ICC proves unreliable as a measure of reproducibility. ICC is sensitive to data range; thus, Bland-Altman plot, limits of agreement, repeatability coefficient, and the within-patient coefficient of variation (wCV) may be included as appropriate.</description>

    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis will be restricted to lesions &gt; 0.5 cc and the 3 most significant pathologic cancer foci from each patient. Specificity will be calculated as the ratio of true negatives to the sum of true negatives and false positives. Specificity will be assessed using pooled data from MD Anderson (N=25) and UCSF (N=25). A ROC analysis will be carried out.</description>
