  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of mindfulness and placebo
      treatments on hearing improvement. More specifically, researchers will be investigating
      whether the following variables impact the effectiveness of placebo treatment such as:
      mindfulness, and attention to variability. Extant research has found the effectiveness of
      psychological treatment in multiple domains, and researchers look to further investigate this
      success in the domain of hearing symptom sensations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The placebo effect, described as &quot;psychological or physiological responses attributed to
      expectations of an inert substance or procedure&quot;, has been demonstrated to have powerful
      effects in multiple instances (Colloca &amp; Benedetti, 2005). Although research on the placebo
      effect is prolific, the mechanisms involved can vary based on the context and have been
      difficult to research with consistent approaches and results (Brown et al., 2013; Holmes et
      al., 2018). Some researchers have found that the mere perception of a treatment as &quot;new&quot; is
      enough to elicit a placebo effect, while others have found that the key mechanism may be
      attention to symptoms - nevertheless, &quot;little evidence exists on the precise mechanisms
      through which psychological treatments actually work&quot; (Brown et al., 2013; Holmes et al.,
      2018).

      Earlier work suggests the potential for psychological treatments for hearing loss or other
      forms of hearing disability, including coping techniques (Scott et al, 2009). We are
      extending the mind-body unity theory as suggested by Dawes, et al (2011, 2013) who found in
      two successive studies that there is a reliable placebo effect in hearing-aid trials. While
      the objective of these studies was to encourage double-blind methodology (to optimize
      results), these results suggest that such effects can optimize outcomes and as the audiology
      field does not typically consider placebo effects (Dawes et al, 2013) it suggests that
      hearing improvements can be impacted by (positive) expectations in a &quot;general&quot; sense (not a
      specific type of hearing aid but simply a &quot;new technology&quot; hearing aid). While this will be
      of great use clinically in double blind trials, it suggests that the use of a psychological
      construct, specifically the Langerian attention to variability construct, can function to
      encourage a placebo effect or a clinical response by encouraging a sense of personal control
      over the symptoms of the hearing loss. In this study, researchers will look to further
      investigate one potential mechanism important to the placebo effect - attention to
      variability.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hearing Improvement - subjective preferred volume</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes daily for 6 days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be told to wear the hearing device and listen to a brief audio (ballad of under 3 minutes) twice a day daily for 6 days.The survey will ask them to listen to the audio and record the volume level that they used at the beginning and at the end, and then answer a few questions after. The change in the participants subjective preferred volume over the course of the week (and from T1 at the beginning of the week) will represent hearing change.</description>

    <measure>Langer Mindfulness Scale,14-Item scale</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>3 subscales, each ranging from 1-7, with 1 being 'Strongly Disagree' and 7 being 'Strongly Agree'. Subscales are 'Flexibility'; 'Novelty Seeking'; and 'Novelty Producing'.Ratings on these items are then added together to create a score for each subscale and an overall mindfulness score.</description>

    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The following questions ask about one's feelings and thoughts during the past month. In each question, individuals are asked how often they felt or thought a certain way.
Scoring: Each item is rated on a 5-point scale ranging from (0) never to (4) almost always</description>

    <measure>Hearing Handicap Inventory (HHIE-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>For participants over the age of 65. The Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly Screening Version (HHIE-S) is a 10-item questionnaire that assesses how an individual perceives the social and emotional effects of hearing loss. The higher the HHIE-S score, the greater the handicapping effect of a hearing impairment. Possible scores range from 0 (no handicap) to 40 (maximum handicap).</description>

    <description>Participants in this condition will be told at the time of the initial assessments (T1) that the device they will be testing will improve their hearing. All participants will be instructed to put on the hearing device and listen to an audio twice per day for 6 days. After listening to the 2nd audio of the day, they will be asked if they perceive their hearing to be changed by the device in addition to qualitative descriptions of the audio. This group will allow researchers to investigate the main effect of the placebo hearing aid - without calling participant's attention to variability in their symptoms.</description>

    <description>Participants in this condition at the time of the initial assessments (T1) will be told that the device they will be testing will improve their hearing. They will then be told that in-order to receive the maximum benefit from the hearing device, they should focus on instances in which they can hear better and worse. All participants will be instructed to put on the hearing device and listen to an audio twice per day for 6 days. After listening to the 2nd audio of the day, they will asked 1) if they perceive their hearing to be changed by the device; 2) to note any changes in what they heard in the audio focusing on the story in the ballad; and 3) whether their hearing is possibly impacted by activities and behavior and what they were doing.This condition will enable researchers to test the effects of the interaction between attention to variability and the placebo effect.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>ATV only condition</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants in this condition will be told that the device they will be testing is merely a prototype that they are testing for design purposes. However, these participants will also be told that their input while wearing the device will help the team in developing the final device and allow the team to focus on how to best improve hearing. All participants will be instructed to put on the hearing device and listen to an audio twice per day for 6 days. After listening to the 2nd audio of the day, they will be asked 1) to note any changes in what they heard in the audio focusing on the story in the ballad and 2) whether their hearing might possibly be impacted by activities and behavior. They will also be asked 3) about their general health and wellness, as compared to the last time they were contacted by email. This condition will enable researchers to test the main effect of attention to variability, without an explicit placebo effect.</description>

    <description>Participants in this condition will be told that the device they will be testing is merely a prototype that they are testing for ergonomic purposes. They will listen to the audio and record volume levels at the start and at the end of the audio and provide feedback on the design. They will be told that each day they will listen to a brief audio (ballad of under 3 minutes) and will be asked a few similar questions twice daily for 6 days. After the 2nd audio of the day, they will be asked for feedback on the hearing device design. They will also be asked about their general health and wellness, as compared to the last time they were contacted.This group will allow researchers to test for the effects of having any device at all.</description>
