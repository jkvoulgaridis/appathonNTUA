  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal research objective is to provide enhanced understanding of the cellular and
      molecular events important in the pathogenesis of Oral Lichen Planus to enable improved
      diagnosis and development of novel treatments for patients.

      The following questions will also be addressed:

        1. Are the histological architectural tissue changes that take place in oral lichen planus
           quantifiable using computer based imaging, graph theory and fractal geometry principles?
           Quantification of these changes would allow the development of a tool to facilitate the
           accurate measurement of response to treatment.

        2. What is the nature of such architectural changes and what are the differences with
           normal, dysplastic and neoplastic epithelia (the investigators have morphometrical data
           collected from previous research to allow such comparisons).

        3. Is it possible to produce evidence−based statistical classification into established
           diagnostic classes using the proposed methodology? This would contribute towards making
           histopathological diagnosis more quantitative, reproducible and accurate.

        4. Is it possible to automate such morphometrical analysis/classification? This would allow
           large data sets to be screened automatically in a shorter time frame and at lower cost
           than human based screening.

        5. Is it possible to determine differences in genetics and gene expression of keratinocytes
           involved in Oral Lichen Planus compared to those of 'normal' tissue by using biopsy
           material and an in vitro model of oral lichen planus?
