  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective, non-randomized, single-center pilot exploratory study is to
      investigate whether established circulating tumor cell (CTC) cultures have a similar response
      to targeted therapy treatment as the in vivo (patients') disease.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will isolate circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from blood samples taken from patients
      with liver and/or lung metastases who will receive systemic treatments. The CTCs will be
      cultured and given the same treatment as the patient received. The main goals of this project
      are 1) to assess CTC cultures' treatment response and compare the in vitro response to the
      clinical response, and 2) determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value
      (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of CTC cultures' response in predicting clinical
      response including complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and
      progressive disease (PD).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a metastatic solid tumor malignancy with either liver and/or lung
             metastasis. Patients with newly diagnosed metastatic disease who have not had systemic
             therapy or are progressing on systemic therapy fitting one of the following cohorts:

               -  Patients had a tumor or liquid biopsy with molecular analysis (genomic analysis
                  or other type of molecular characterization) resulting in a therapeutic target
                  with planned targeted therapy by the patient's treating physician.

               -  Gastric cancer patients who have failed the first and second line chemotherapy.

               -  Bladder cancer patients (with liver and/or lung metastasis) who will receive
                  systemic treatment.

          -  Scheduled to initiate systemic treatment for management of their disease. The systemic
             treatment will be either cytotoxic chemotherapy or targeted therapy but not checkpoint
             inhibitor immunotherapy.

          -  â‰¥18 years of age

          -  Written informed consent obtained and signed

          -  Able to have blood collection without excessive difficulty

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient unwilling or unable to complete informed consent

          -  Currently pregnant or lactating women

          -  Physical or psychological inability to complete sample collection for any reason
             including but not limited to: inability to tolerate any study procedures, any physical
             limitation that would undermine the safety of the subject in the study, or any
             psychiatric or neurological condition that inhibits full comprehension of study
             requirements and inability to complete informed consent, as determined by treating
             physician
