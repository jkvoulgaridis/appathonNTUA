  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the evaluation of the services provided in hospitals in recent years, importance has been
      given to the measurements based on the perception of the patients. Today, the most frequently
      used criteria for this purpose are quality of life and patient satisfaction. The general
      opinion of the experts is that the information obtained with these criteria is valid and
      reliable.The researchers pointed out that patients who are dissatisfied with the health
      service provided comply with the recommendations of the healthcare personnel less and thus
      the primary and secondary preventive services are adversely affected.Although treatment
      satisfaction is a very important factor in terms of patient adherence to treatment, there is
      no valid and reliable scale in Turkish to evaluate this factor. This study was carried out to
      investigate the validity and reliability of The Turkish version of the Functional Assessment
      of Chronic Illness Therapy - Treatment Satisfaction - General Questionnaire in the patients
      receiving health care.
