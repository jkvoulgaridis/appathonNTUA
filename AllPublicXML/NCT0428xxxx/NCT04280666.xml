  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center, clinical study.This study is to evaluate the
      feasibility of genetic susceptibility screening based on the detection of tumor tissue
      mutations by a NGS panel.

  <detailed_description>

      In this study, gene mutation profiling was performed on primary tissue samples from
      colorectal cancer patients who met relevant clinical screening criteria, unearthing suspected
      germline pathogenic mutations. At the same time, germline mutation detection was performed on
      peripheral blood leukocytes of patients, and the consistency between suspected germline
      mutations in tumor somatic mutation detection and control leukocytes was compared.
      Establishing the feasibility of tumor somatic mutation-based detection to guide genetic
      susceptibility screening.Pedigree verification will be carried out for blood relatives of
      patients with germline mutations which have been identified for colorectal cancer.Through the
      tumor somatic and germline gene mutation profiles of Chinese hereditary colorectal cancer
      patients, it reveals the molecular characteristics of hereditary colorectal cancer in Asian
      populations and provides molecular-level evidence for possible subsequent clinical diagnosis
      and treatment.
