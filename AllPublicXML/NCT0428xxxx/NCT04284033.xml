  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized trial to determine if an extended wear infusion set can be worn for up
      to 7 days with a hybrid closed-loop system in adult with Type 1 Diabetes
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare use of a standard infusion set with an extended wear infusion set.
      Subjects will be asked to wear both types of sets twice for up to 7 days, alternating wear of
      set type over 4 weeks. The order of infusion set wear will be randomized with the first set
      wear. The investigators aim to see whether there is a benefit to using an extended wear
      infusion set.
