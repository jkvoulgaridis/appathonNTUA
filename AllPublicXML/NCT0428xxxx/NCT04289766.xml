  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the second leading cause of death, accounting for 11.13 % of total deaths, and the
      main cause of disability worldwide. The major type of stroke is ischemic, which occurs in
      about 87% of all stroke cases Stroke has different risk factors, which can be grouped into
      modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. Major risk factors for stroke include age,
      history of cerebrovascular event, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity,
      hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, metabolic syndrome, diet,
      nutrition, and genetic risk factors. Many new technique used for rehabilitation after stroke
      includes Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy for Arm or Leg Paralysis, Mirror Therapy for
      Hand Recovery, Harness the Relentless Force etc. Segmental muscle vibration (SMV) is also a
      new technique and effective to decrease the hyper-toned muscles spasticity but still less
      work done on it. SMV with different frequencies have different effects for both flaccid and
      spastic patients of all 3 stages of stroke. In our study we will work with 60hz and 120hz
      frequencies to reduce the spasticity of upper limb and improves their functional level.

      Evidence strongly suggest that a period of pure sensory stimulation can affect motor
      corticoids activity excitability.

      In 2019 segmental muscle vibration(SMV) used to improve upper extremity functional ability
      post stroke and concluded that patients in both groups improved significantly after treatment
      in Barthel index (BI), elbow Range of Motion (ROM) and elbow muscle strength. However muscle
      tone in elbow joint of hemiplegic upper extremity improved significantly after only in the
      experimental group. They suggested that with routine physiotherapy with extended exposure SMV
      will results in significant reduced spasticity and better improved Activities Of Daily
      Livings (ADLs).

      In 2019 a work done with SMV to improve gate performance in patients with foot drop after
      chronic stroke. Results of this study revealed moderate improvement in mean gate speed,
      normal side swing velocity, bilateral stride length and normal-side toe off in experimental
      group. Further studies needed to evaluate the optimal and minimum SMV dosage.

      Another study conducted in 2019 to see Results show that processing speed, inhibitory control
      and attention improved following SMV. But working memory between groups and also not show a
      association between executive functions course and fall risk, so they suggest further work to
      examine effects of vibration therapy on executive functions.

      In 2014 another therapist highlight the potential use of SMV to modulate electromyographic
      (EMG) for reaching movement in chronic stroke patients but needs to be confirmed by larger
      control perspective trials of SMV.

      In 2019 combined work done with repetitive focal muscle vibration with physiotherapy to
      improve the motor function even in very acute phase of stroke and finds it a valid
      complementary non pharmacological therapy In 2019 another study suggest that Whole Body
      Vibration (WBV) and Upper and Lower Cycle (ULC) effective upper for upper extremity motor
      function and grip strength in sub-acute stroke.

      In 2019 a study reported the risk factors (vibration injury to hands vascular components,
      intermediate blanching neurological components and lower back pain for drivers of work
      machines) and benefits (improvement in bone health and neuromuscular function). So is a room
      for research to design a balanced WBV protocol.

      A study in 2018 did a meta-analysis and compare the effects of WBV in stroke patients and
      concludes that it is a safe therapeutic method for improving symptoms.

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from the Baseline this scale was measured
Fugl Meyer Assessment is the utmost extensively used and approved clinical scale for assessment of sensorimotor loss in post stroke patients.This scale is comprised of five domains and there are 155 items in total:
Motor functioning (in the upper and lower extremities)
Sensory functioning (evaluates light touch on two surfaces of the arm and leg, and position sense for 8 joints)
Balance (contains 7 tests, 3 seated and 4 standing)
Joint range of motion (8 joints)
Joint pain 3-point ordinal scale where 0=cannot perform, 1=performs partially and 2=performs fully. The total possible scale score is 226.
MAS detecting the changes in muscle tone in patients with stroke.. It's a 6 point scale. 0=no muscle tone, 4= affected parts rigid flexion or extension.Its reliability is 0.567.</description>

    <measure>Motor Assessment Scale (MAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from the Baseline this scale was measured
. The Motor Assessment Scale (MAS) is used to assess everyday motor function in patients with stroke. 8 items assess 8 areas of motor function
Patients perform each task 3 times, only the best performance is recorded
Items (with the exception of the general tonus item*) are assessed using a 7-point scale (0 to 6)
A score of 6 indicates optimal motor behavior
Item scores (with the exception of the general tonus item) are summed to provide an overall score (out of 48 points)
Completing a higher-level item suggests successful performance on lower-level items and thus lower-items can be skipped. For the general tonus item, the score is based on continuous observations throughout the assessment. A score of 4 on this item indicates a consistently normal response, a score &gt; 4 indicates persistent hyper-tonus, and a score &lt; 4 indicates various degrees of hypo-tonus</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from the Baseline this scale was measured
Modified Ashworth Scale' scores exhibited better reliability when measuring upper extremities than lower[11]. The scale is as below:
0 No increase in muscle tone
1 Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when the affected part(s) is moved in flexion or extension
1+ Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the ROM
2 More marked increase in muscle tone through most of the ROM, but affected part(s) easily moved
3 Considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult
4 Affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension</description>
