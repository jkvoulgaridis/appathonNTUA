  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) is the most common genetic disease leading to End Stage
      Kidney Disease (ESKD), affecting between 1 in 500-1000 individuals from every ethnic group.
      The autosomal dominant (ADPKD) form arises from a two-hit downregulation of proteins encoded
      by either PKD1 or PKD2. Although many potential therapies have been studied to slow
      progression of ADPKD, none to date have been proven to be both safe and effective in slowing
      disease progression. Cholesterol-lowering agents called statins have shown promise in the
      treatment of younger ADPKD patients, reducing inflammation and progression as assessed by
      kidney growth, but their utility appears to be limited in older populations and those with
      more advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recent evidence suggests that acidosis, as often
      seen in patients with worsening CKD and which may enhance CKD progression, limits the
      effectiveness of statins and enhances their potential toxicity. The investigators thus
      hypothesize that correction of acidosis along with statin treatment will be a safe and
      effective therapeutic regimen to slow CKD progression in the adult ADPKD population and
      improve overall quality of life in these patients. To test this hypothesis, the investigators
      will conduct a pilot open-label randomized clinical trial in ADPKD patients with estimated
      GFR &gt;45 min (Stage 1-3a CKD) comparing three treatment groups: control, pravastatin (40 mg po
      qd), and pravastatin plus sodium citrate solution (30 mL po total daily dose) over one year.
      During the study period, through study visits along with serial blood draws and urinary
      measurements, the investigators will evaluate safety and tolerability of these treatment
      regimens, follow renal function and investigate the role of these treatments on acidosis,
      inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers in patients enrolled at an outpatient facility. This
      study will establish the framework for larger clinical trials in ADPKD. Moreover, if the
      results of this study suggest safety/tolerability or potential benefits of statins and alkali
      therapy in this ADPKD population, the investigators will seek extramural funding for a larger
      clinical trial to test this therapeutic strategy in ADPKD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient voluntarily gives informed consent to participate in the study and signed
             study's IC and HIPAA.

          2. Patient is age 18 or older at the time of consent.

          3. If applicable, female of reproductive potential (Females who are successfully
             sterilized (surgical sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral tubal
             ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or are postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea for
             at least 12 consecutive months) are not considered to be of reproductive potential)
             must be non-pregnant (as confirmed by a urine pregnancy test at screening) and
             non-lactating, and agree:

               1. Either abstain from intercourse (when it is in line with their preferred and
                  usual lifestyle), or

               2. Use 2 medically acceptable, highly-effective forms of contraception for the
                  duration of study, and at least 30 days after discontinuing study drug
                  (highly-effective forms of contraception can include approved hormonal
                  contraceptives (oral, injectable, and implantable), and barrier methods (such as
                  a condom or diaphragm) when used with a spermicide.))

          4. Patients has ADPKD diagnosed by unified criteria using a combination of ultrasound
             results, genotyping and MRI as needed (1, 2). Kidney ultrasound is usually used for
             screening because it is safe, effective, and inexpensive. Diagnostic criteria are
             based upon whether the genotype is known. Disease severity varies between the
             different genotypes. The great majority of patients at risk for ADPKD are from
             families with an unknown genotype. This diagnosis will take place prior to recruitment
             / inclusion into the study.

             The following ultrasonographic criteria for the diagnosis of ADPKD are for at-risk
             patients from families of where the genotype is not known:

               1. If the patient is between 18 and 39 years of age, at least three unilateral or
                  bilateral kidney cysts. The specificity and positive predictive value at this
                  age-range is 100 percent. (sensitivity of 82 and 96 percent for individuals
                  between 15 and 29 years and between 30 to 39 years of age, respectively).

               2. If the patient is 40 to 59 years of age, at least two cysts in each kidney
                  (sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of 90, 100, and 100
                  percent, respectively).

               3. Among individuals 60 years or older, at least four cysts in each kidney. (100
                  percent sensitivity and specificity).

          5. The above patients with estimated GFR ≥30 ml/min i.e. with stage 1-3b CKD

          6. Plasma bicarbonate ≤ 25 mMol/L

          7. Metabolic acidosis

          8. The patient agrees to immediately inform Investigator and research coordinator of any
             changes or planned changes in concomitant medication

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Patients with known allergy or sensitive to Pravastatin or NaCitrate

          2. Acute coronary disease, liver disease, muscle disease, or a history of pulmonary edema

          3. Creatine Phospho Kinase (CPK) &gt; 2ULN (2.5 ULN in African Americans). Elevated creatine
             phosphokinase could be a marker of rhabdomyolysis, which is a potential side effect of
             pravastatin. In general, patients with African American ancestry can have higher
             normal level of CPK

          4. Patients with systemic disease that impacting kidney per Investigator's decision

          5. Patients with known unstable cerebral aneurysm per Investigator's decision

          6. Pregnancy or lactation, or patients who refuse to use recommended contraception
             methods

          7. Proteinuria &gt; 500 mg/day

          8. History of non-compliance of medication per Investigator's decision

          9. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension, edema, or development of severe MA as per
             Investigator's decision

         10. History of cancer

         11. History of liver disease: hepatic failure/shock, cirrhosis
