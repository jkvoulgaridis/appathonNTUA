  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson disease is a progressive neurologic disorder characterized by motor impairments
      which alter the walking capacity, and lead to reduced walking speed, decreased stride length
      and increased double support time. Physical therapy interventions are an important part of
      the non-pharmacological treatment for Parkinson disease. The purpose of this study is to
      assess whether there is a different outcome regarding improvement of gait parameters, when
      applying a physical therapy program in an individual or in a group manner.

      The study setting is the Clinical Rehabilitation Hospital in Cluj-Napoca, Cluj county,
      Romania. Patients will be randomly divided into 2 groups, and were prescribed either
      individual (1 patient and 1 physical therapist) or group physical therapy (6 patients and 1
      physical therapist). Treatment protocol includes 10 sessions of physical therapy, in the same
      room setting and performed the same routine of exercises, except for the 3 breaks during the
      sessions in the group therapy for informal socialization. Walking speed will be measured by
      two validated instruments, the 6-minute walk test and the 10-meter walk test, before and
      after treatment.

      The rehabilitation protocol for the individual physical therapy will consist of
      cardiovascular warm-up activities, stretching exercises, strengthening exercises, functional,
      gait and balance training, recreational games and ended with relaxation exercises. In
      addition, the group protocol will follow the exact same pattern, except for 5-10 minute
      breaks for informal socialization between participants, at the beginning of the session,
      mid-session and at the end of the session.

      Also, both groups will have access to external cues, which will be applied during a variety
      of tasks and environmental situations, like gait initiation and termination, heel strike and
      push-off, sideways and backwards stepping, walking while dual tasking, and walking over
      various surfaces and long distances.

      All patients will be evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the physical therapy
      program. The evaluation includes the 6-minute walking test and the 10-meter walking test.
      Gait speed for each participant will be calculated as the ratio between the walked distance
      and the time unit, and it was measured in meters/seconds.
