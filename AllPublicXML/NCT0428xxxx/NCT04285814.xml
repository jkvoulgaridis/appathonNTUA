  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amniocentesis (amnio) and chorionic villus sampling (CVS) can reliably detect many smaller
      DNA/genetic abnormalities that cannot be reliably diagnosed by cell-free noninvasive prenatal
      testing (NIPT) that is in widespread use. The investigators present evidence that a
      cell-based form of NIPT, here called Single Fetal Cell (SFC) testing, using a blood sample
      from the mother can detect most or all of the genetic abnormalities that are detected using
      amnio or CVS. This study proposes to compare the effectiveness of SFC testing in detecting
      abnormalities already detected by amnio or CVS in women already undergoing these tests as
      part of their clinical care because of fetal ultrasound abnormalities.

    <textblock>
      This is a revision to a project entitled &quot;Prenatal Genetic Diagnosis by Genomic Sequencing: A
      Prospective Evaluation.&quot; This study proposes to test the utility and accuracy of a new form
      of cell-based noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), here called noninvasive Single Fetal Cell
      (SFC) testing. After many years of development work, the researchers published evidence for
      the feasibility of SFC testing in 2016. Extensive recent preliminary data show considerable
      improvements in SFC testing. Current forms of cell-free NIPT testing do not provide reliable
      detection of medium to smaller size deletions and duplications that cause a variety of
      genetic disabilities. Preliminary data indicate that SFC testing using fetal trophoblasts
      from mother's blood can detect aneuploidy and subchromosomal deletions and emphasize the
      importance of analyzing single cells, since some fetal cells are apoptotic and some are in S
      phase of the cell cycle replicating their DNA. Both apoptosis and S phase interfere with copy
      number analysis in differing ways, and pooling cells prior to barcoding individual cells
      results in loss of data quality. Preliminary data from two pilot validation studies
      demonstrate that reliable data can be collected on the large majority of patients, although
      data on this point would be greatly expanded by this project.

      Preliminary data show very robust detection of all aneuploidies and clear definition of
      genomic deletions as small as 1 Mb and duplications as small as 1.5 Mb. The first aim is to
      perform blinded SFC testing on 50 cases per year with congenital anomalies with abnormal
      karyotype or chromosomal microarray (CMA) and 50 cases per year with congenital anomalies and
      normal CMA. This will provide a direct measure of success rate and the false positive and
      false negative rates for SFC testing compared to CMA. The second aim will be to use the WGA
      products and frozen unamplified cells available from aim 1 to further improve SFC testing to
      include targeted detection of inherited or de novo pathogenic point mutations in the cases
      undergoing WGS as part of the parent grant, confirmation of very small CNVs detected by WGS,
      restudy of false positive or false negative results from aim 1, and in the future could
      attempt to perform genome wide detection of de novo mutations. Capitalizing on the resources
      available through the parent grant, there is the opportunity to test whether SFC testing has
      the potential to transform genetic prenatal diagnosis so that all genetic changes, whether
      CNV or point mutation, and whether inherited or de novo, could be detected even in low risk
      pregnancies.

    <ipd_description>The project dataset and associated genomic data be widely shared with the scientific community for research through the controlled access dbGAP repository or comparable databases while carefully observing standards of patient privacy, confidentiality, and management of health information complying with the NIH Genomic Data Sharing policy. The data-sharing of genetic data will be in dbGaP. Data will be generated in all years of the study and submitted at study completion. Resources including study protocols, informed consent templates, result report templates and bioinformatic tools will also be made available through open access databases and public web sites. We will make datasets and informatics tools available through approved platforms for sharing with the larger scientific community. We will store remaining DNA samples with permission to use these samples for future research related to WFC. These specimens will be stored in a coded fashion.</ipd_description>
