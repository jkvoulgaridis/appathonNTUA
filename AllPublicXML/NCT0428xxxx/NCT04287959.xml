      Bronchiolitis is a common type of chest infection that tends to affect babies and young
      children under a year old. In older children and adults, the same viruses that cause
      bronchiolitis lead to the 'common cold'.

      The symptoms of bronchiolitis are like a common cold and include a blocked or runny nose, a
      cough and a mildly raised temperature.

      Bronchiolitis affects the bronchioles which are the smaller breathing tubes in the lungs.
      They produce more mucus than usual and become swollen, leading to a cough and a runny nose.
      In more severe cases, the tubes become clogged up with mucus which causes breathing problems.

      In some babies, the breathing problems may present as breathing fast, with in-drawing of the
      muscles around the rib cage, and in rare cases, very young babies with bronchiolitis may stop
      breathing for brief periods ('apnoea'). The illness usually starts with a mild runny nose or
      cough, gets worse over three to five days or so, and then slowly gets better, usually lasting
      about 10 to 14 days in total.

      Around 2 in 100 infants with bronchiolitis will need to spend some time in hospital during
      the course of their illness. This is usually for one of two reasons: they need oxygen
      treatment to keep their oxygen saturations within acceptable levels or they cannot manage to
      feed from the breast or a bottle because of a blocked nose or difficulty breathing.

      Here at the Children's Hospital for Wales we are using 'High flow' to deliver oxygen. This is
      a relatively new concept on the general paediatric wards, and more established in a setting
      such as High Dependency Unit (HDU). However, we have been using it successfully on the wards
      for the last 3 years.

      High flow device delivering a mixture of oxygen and air at high flow to help open the child's
      airways so that their lungs can add oxygen to their blood. It is given through a set of
      prongs (short plastic tubes) inserted just inside the nostrils.

      Research has shown that the early use of high flow can reduce the chances of the child
      needing escalation of care to a high dependency unit or paediatric intensive care unit.

      The investigators are interested in studying the process of weaning high flow support once
      the child is over the worst of their illness. This will enable the investigators to use the
      most effective method of weaning babies from their high flow, and ready for discharge. This
      has the potential to reduce the number of hours spent in hospital for babies and their
      parents or guardians.

    <textblock>
      Bronchiolitis is the commonest respiratory infection in infancy leading to hospital
      admission. 46 per 1000 infants were admitted to hospital with bronchiolitis in England in
      2011 and more recent studies suggest this number has remained static. This has a significant
      cost burden on the NHS. Respiratory support, mainly oxygenation, and keeping infants well
      hydrated are the mainstay of management in hospital.

      Respiratory support has traditionally been the domain of intensive care settings. This has
      been provided through an escalation of therapy from simple oxygen delivery by nasal cannula,
      to non-invasive ventilation with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) and finally to
      intubation with mechanical ventilation. These latter two strategies require highly skilled
      staff, so are costly, and are associated with a greater incidence of adverse events including
      ventilator-induced lung injury, barotrauma, and potential neurotoxicity associated with
      sedation. Over the last decade High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) therapy has emerged as a new
      method to provide respiratory support for bronchiolitis. HFNC therapy works by delivering an
      increased volume of air and oxygen into the nasal passages than standard sub-nasal oxygen
      therapy, using a higher flow of humidified and heated gas. These increased flow rates exceed
      peak inspiratory flow and thereby result in more efficient delivery of oxygen to the terminal
      airways. Physiological studies have demonstrated reduced work of breathing and improved gas
      exchange. The PARIS study has demonstrated that HFNC can be used in a ward setting to reduce
      admission rates to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). 12% of the study population
      receiving HFNC needed escalation to PICU compared to 23% receiving standard care (oxygen
      therapy). The safety data from the PARIS study shows no difference in adverse effects between
      HFNC and standard oxygen therapy. Numerous studies over the last three decades have
      investigated the role of various medications in managing infants with bronchiolitis including
      adrenaline, steroids, salbutamol, and hypertonic saline; none of these studies have
      definitively changed the outcome of the disease nor the length of stay in hospital. Although
      the PARIS study showed a reduction in number of patients requiring escalation of care, it did
      not demonstrate any difference to the total length of stay in hospital.

      Aim Since HFNC is a relatively new method of providing respiratory support in bronchiolitis,
      there is lack of evidence on weaning strategy. The investigators aim to identify the weaning
      strategy most effective for infants, up to 12 months of age, supported on HFNC for
      bronchiolitis. This may lead to shorter total length of stay in hospital, without
      compromising their care. Infants with bronchiolitis who are on HFNC (the devices used will be
      Airvo 2, Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare) will be on a flow of 2L/kg/min (maximum 20L/min) and
      variable oxygen concentration to maintain target oxygen saturations &gt;90%. The participants
      will be randomised into one of two arms for weaning a) titrating oxygen to FiO2 21% and then
      stopping HFNC b) titrating oxygen to FiO2 30% and switching HFNC to low flow oxygen.
