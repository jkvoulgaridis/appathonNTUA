  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonacog alfa is indicated for the control and prevention of hemorrhagic episodes and for
      routine and surgical prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia B. The current single country,
      multi-centric, open label, non-randomized clinical trial is a post-approval study to fulfill
      the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) request for supplementary information
      relating to the use of nonacog alfa in Indian subjects with hemophilia B.

    <measure>Proportion of subjects who develop FIX inhibitor (≥0.6 BU/mL), as confirmed by central laboratory testing, during the course of the study.</measure>
    <time_frame>16 Exposure Days or 8 weeks of treatment, whichever occurs first</time_frame>
    <description>FIX inhibitor analyses will be performed by the central laboratory. Only subjects with a confirmed positive FIX inhibitor will count towards the numerator of the derived proportion. The denominator will be the total number of subjects at risk for developing an inhibitor during the study, who received at least one dose of nonacog alfa.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number (%) of subjects with Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Safety assessments throughout the study will include collection of AEs, laboratory safety testing, vital signs, and physical examination at protocol specified time points, but can be conducted at other time points at the investigator's discretion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number (%) of subjects who experienced SAEs, including the medically important events of thrombotic events and hypersensitivity reactions</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>All SAEs in particular, medically important events (thrombotic events and hypersensitivity reactions) in subjects receiving a nonacog alfa prophylaxis will be detected, recorded and reported as per the regulatory requirements.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Annualized bleeding rate (ABR) during prophylaxis</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks of treatment, or sooner, once 16 EDs are achieved</time_frame>
    <description>The number of bleeds for each subject for the ABR calculation includes all bleeds requiring treatment with nonacog alfa during the treatment interval duration (up to 8 weeks of treatment, or sooner, once 16 EDs are achieved). Treatment interval duration is calculated as the number of days beginning on Visit 2 (&quot;Day 1&quot;, provided an infusion was given) up to Visit 4. Additionally, ABRs will be summarized by bleed type (eg, spontaneous or traumatic) and by bleed location (eg, joint, soft tissue/muscle).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Annualized total factor consumption (TFC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The total amount (IU) infused for each nonacog alfa infusion recorded in the investigational product eCRF will be summed to calculate the TFC for each subject. In addition, for each infusion, IU/kg will be calculated, using the most recently recorded weight measurement, and annualized TFC by weight (IU/kg) will be summarized similarly, by reason for infusion, and for the total.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Nonacog alfa infusions used to treat each bleed</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This will be calculated by adding the initial (on-demand) infusion to any subsequent (on-demand) infusions for the same bleed (same bleed start date/time). If there is more than one bleed location (eg, ankle and joint) with identical bleed start date and time, it will be treated as one bleed occurrence.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male subjects ≥12 years to ≤65 years with a diagnosis of congenital moderately-severe
             to severe hemophilia B (FIX activity ≤2%).

          2. Documented history of at least 50 exposure days (EDs) to FIX-containing products.

          3. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the subject (or a legally acceptable representative, parent(s)/legal guardian) has
