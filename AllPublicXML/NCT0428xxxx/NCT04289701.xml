  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is the leading preventable risk factor of cardiovascular disease globally and in
      China. Unparalleled to remarkable increase of hypertension burden in China, blood
      pressure(BP) control is inadequate. A political public health project, &quot;Hypertension
      Prevention and Control Initiative in China(Chronic Disease Demonstration District
      Construction)&quot;, was initiated in October 2019 for explore a feasible and reproducible
      archetype for hypertension management and to improve the registration, management, treatment
      and control rates of hypertension in China. The project is designed to consecutively
      implement health service strategies in 40 pilot counties covering 31 provinces and around
      200,000 hypertension patients in mainland China, via the National Medical Alliance for
      Hypertension(NMAH). The Hypertension Registry study aims to registry, follow up and observe
      the clinical features, treatment, blood pressure control and outcomes of all hypertension
      patients managed in the &quot;Hypertension Prevention and Control Initiative in China&quot; project.

      Objective: The study aims to investigate the clinical features, treatment, blood pressure
      control and outcomes of hypertension patients managed in the &quot;Hypertension Prevention and
      Control Initiative in China&quot; project.

      Study Type: A national, multicenter, observational, prospective cohort study.

      Study Design: The cardinal contents of this registry study are as follows:

      Introduce the Digital Information System and train in completing case report forms.

      Collect sociodemographic information, lifestyle behaviors, self-reported personal medical
      history, BP, anthropometric measurements, medication at registration, laboratory
      investigations of hypertension patients managed in the &quot;Hypertension Prevention and Control
      Initiative in China&quot; project. Build a baseline database of hypertension patients.

      Gather the follow up information including general, clinical, therapeutic, prognostic data of
      all recruits at 3-month intervals over 2 years and build up the follow-up database.

      Data management, quality control and statistic analysis: Digital Information Platform for
      data capture, document and cloud computing has been built and the investigators will manage
      and analyze data in align with key indicators. The investigators have invited professional
      statistic analysts to assist analyzing data and a third party to supervise data quality.

      Ethics: The Ethics Committee of Fuwai Hospital approved this study. Informed consents before
      patient enrollment are required.
