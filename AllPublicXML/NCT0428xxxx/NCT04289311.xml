  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether a web-based intervention using a mobile
      device is helpful for teens learning to care for and manage symptoms of sickle cell disease.
      The intervention lasts 12 weeks with a 3-month follow up period, and uses a smartphone or a
      tablet.

      The purpose of the proposed study is to test the feasibility of SMYLS, an mHealth
      intervention designed to facilitate self-management behaviors in children and adolescents
      with sickle cell disease (SCD). Specifically, the investigators propose to test the
      feasibility of the intervention for improving transition from parent-managed to adolescent
      self-managed care. In addition, the investigators will evaluate the communication that takes
      place via the intervention between adolescents, their parents/caregivers, and healthcare
      providers. The investigators will work with the MUSC Pediatric Sickle Cell Clinic to identify
      and recruit 5 healthcare providers of children with SCD and 30 dyads of adolescents ages 11 -
      17 SCD and their parent/caregiver (n = 60).

    <measure>Self-management behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of participant self-management behaviors, including symptom monitoring and tracking, adherence to clinic appointments, and medication adherence. Symptom monitoring and tracking measured through the application back-end database as number of times each participant accesses the symptom monitoring and symptom tracking components of the application. Adherence to appointments as assessed by study-specific questions asked during study visits at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months. Questions ask whether any appointments were scheduled and missed or attended since the last study visit. Medication adherence measured as number of scheduled medication doses marked as &quot;taken&quot; in the application back-end database out of the total number of possible doses</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using the following scales: PROMIS Pediatric Pain Interference SF, Pediatric and Adult PROMIS Fatigue SF, Pediatric and Adolescent PROMIS Depressive Symptoms SF, Pediatric and Adolescent Anxiety SF, Sickle Cell Disease Self-Efficacy Scale, Adult PROMIS Sleep Disturbances SF, Adolescent Sleep Wake Scale. For all PROMIS measures, higher scores indicate more of the concept being studied. For the Sickle Cell Self-efficacy Scale, a higher score indicates greater self-efficacy. For the Adolescent Sleep Wake Scale, higher scores indicate better sleep quality.</description>
