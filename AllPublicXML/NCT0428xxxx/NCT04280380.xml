    <textblock>
      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common member of the herpes viruses to infect humans. Its
      double-stranded linear DNA duplex contains 165 genes that encode viral proteins that mimic
      and interact with human cellular proteins and are related to its virulence and latency. CMV
      primary infection is usually acquired in the adolescence and follows a benign course; however
      it might reactivate in patients with immune suppression leading to a high mortality and
      morbidity in this group of patients. There is growing evidence that critically ill
      immunocompetent patients can develop CMV disease [Limaye et al. JAMA. 2008;300(4):413;
      Ziemann et al. Crit Care Med. 2008;36(12):3145]. However, results of the incidence of CMV
      disease in critically ill patients is unpredictable due to the wide range of these results,
      from a 0% to 98% [Al-Omari et al. Ann. Intensive Care (2016) 6:110]. This inconsistency could
      be explained by many factors such as (i) variation in the definition of CMV disease (old
      studies consider seropositivity as evidence of disease, while others use newer technologies
      like PCR and/or antigen detection), (ii) variation in inclusion criteria (some studies
      include only seropositive patients therefore assessing reactivation rate of CMV, others also
      include seronegative patients thus evaluating also new infections) or (iii) variation in
      studied populations (e.g. septic, surgical, burn or postcardiac surgery patients or patients
      under mechanical ventilation).

  <detailed_description>

      Evidence in the literature has demonstrated how different factors have been associated with
      CMV disease; however, the effect of new anticancer therapies (personalized chemotherapies,
      biological and immunological treatments, extreme surgery, etc.) on CMV disease is unknown.
      The investigators believe that studying this subgroup of patients should be one of the
      primary issues as the number of patients with these characteristics will increase
      significantly in the near future.

      Likewise, it is important to point out that in the real world diagnosing CMV disease is a
      real challenge for the intensive care physician (due to subclinical or not specific clinical
      presentations, confusion factors, low clinical suspicions, etc.) thus its diagnosis and
      eventual treatment could be improved. These undesired diagnostic and therapeutic flaws
      provide a unique opportunity to (i) describe the natural evolution of the disease, (ii)
      address the effect of the disease in the outcome of the patients and (iii) estimate the
      potential number of patients that could benefit from a new management.

      HM Hospitales (https://www.hmhospitales.com/) is a Spanish private group made up of five
      tertiary university hospitals in Madrid (HM Madrid, HM Torrelodones, HM Sanchinarro, HM
      Puerta del Sur y HM Monteprincipe). In addition, the group has a specialized center focused
      in cancer (&quot;Clara Campal&quot; oncologic center https://www.hmciocc.com/ ) with a phase I Unit
      (STAR-CIOCC
      http://startmadrid.com/index.php/en/2014-10-02-23-29-01/madrid-locations/2014-10-10-00-46-42)
      , five medical-surgical ICUs (one in each hospital) that assist 1200 patients/year (35% with
      cancer) and a surgical department specialized in robotic and laparoscopic procedures.

      To define the incidence of CMV reactivation and disease is of paramount importance as several
      studies have suggested an association between CMV disease and an increased mortality rate,
      prolonged mechanical ventilation as well as length of ICU and hospital stay. Furthermore, CMV
      disease increases the risk of acquiring a nosocomial infection that could also have an effect
      on the outcome of the patients [Ziemann et al. Crit Care Med. 2008;36(12):3145; Sinclair. J
      Clin Virol. 2008;41(3):180]. Likewise, as several anti-CMV treatments are (valacyclovir,
      valanciclovir, ganciclovir, foscarnet or cidofovir), or will be shortly (letermovir),
      available the increased morbidity and mortality associated to this infection in critically
      ill patients could be improved dramatically.

      This research proposal is seeking to answer four questions in a general ICU cohort of
      patients and in the subgroup of critically ill patients receiving anti-cancer therapy:

        1. Which is the incidence of CMV infection and disease?

        2. What is the natural evolution of CMV infections that do not receive anti-CMV treatment?

        3. What is the impact of anti-CMV treatment in the patient´s outcome (mortality, days under
           mechanical ventilation and days at ICU)?

        4. What are the risk and protective factors for developing CMV infection after ICU
           admission?

    <description>This observational, cohort, retrospective and multicenter study will be performed during a period of 16 months at the 5 medical/surgical ICUs from HM Hospitals group.
The recruitment will be performed by volume of patients: recruitment of the first 300 patients without cancer will start the 15th of January 2018 and will end once the last patient has been included; likewise, recruitment of the first patient with cancer will start on the same date and will end once the last patient (of 100) is recruited. Patients undergoing any type of anticancer therapy within the previous 3 month of ICU admission will be analyzed as part of the overall group but also as an independent subgroup of patients.
Inclusion criteria: (a) age &gt;=18 y.o., (b) admission to the intensive care unit with an expectancy to stay longer than 72 hours and requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.</description>

    <description>At inclusion, serum samples will be collected to determine CMV serological status. Plasma samples will be collected weekly for CMV PCR analysis. Antibodies for CMV will be assessed using a commercial enzyme immunoassay kit for detection of total antibodies to CMV (LIAISON CMV IgG assay, DiaSorin S.p.A). DNA will be extracted in 200 μL of plasma eluted in 60 μL of elution buffer using a NucliSENS easyMAG system (bioMérieux, Boxtel, The Netherlands). Samples will be amplified using Affigene CMV Trender diagnostic assay (Cepheid AB, Bromma, Sweden), according to the manufacturer instructions. Amplification will be performed on a MX3000P instrument (Stratagene Instruments Systems, La Jolla, CA, USA). Samples with &gt;500 copies/mL of plasma will be considered positive.</description>

      All eligible patients will be screened for CMV reactivation or primary infection until day 28
      of ICU admission, discharge or death. For all eligible patients, a blood sample will be drawn
      for CMV serology and PCR testing at ICU admission (day 0) and then once a week for PCR
      testing (every Monday for logistic reasons) until day 28th of ICU admission, ICU discharge or
