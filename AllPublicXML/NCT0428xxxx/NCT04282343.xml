  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well the DIScussion of COst (DISCO) application (app) works
      in improving financial outcomes in patients with hematologic cancer. The DISCO app is an
      electronic, highly scalable and tailorable education and communication intervention that may
      help researchers learn more about improving how patients and oncologists discuss cancer
      treatment costs

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the effectiveness of the DISCO app on prompting patient-oncologist treatment
      cost discussions during patient-physician interactions (as observed in video recordings),
      patient outcomes related to financial toxicity immediately after the patient-oncologist
      interaction, and at a 3-month follow up.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms: ARM I: Patients receive usual care consisting of general cancer treatment information on a sheet of paper before attending video-recorded meetings with their oncologist to discuss treatment plan; or ARM II: Patients use the DISCO education and communication app before attending video-recorded meetings with their oncologist to discuss treatment plans. After completion of study, patients are followed up at 3 months.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Observed during the video-recorded patient-physician interaction.</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participates who have a treatment cost discussion will be evaluated with a validated observational scale. This is an investigator-developed scale and its called the Discussion of Cost (DISCO) scale. A higher score means a better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Referrals for financial or psychological support</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the patient-physician interaction</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants who receive a referral for financial or psychological support will be evaluated with a self-report item. This an investigator-developed yes/no one-item response. A &quot;yes&quot; response is a better outcome than a &quot;no&quot; response.</description>

    <measure>Self-efficacy in managing treatment cost</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the patient-physician interaction</time_frame>
    <description>How efficacious each participant feels about managing treatment costs will be evaluated with an adapted validated self-report scale and its title is: Managing Treatment Cost Self-Efficacy scale. This an investigator-adapted scale, and a higher score means a better outcome (max =7; min = 1).</description>

    <description>How efficacious each participant feels about interacting with physicians will be evaluated with a validated self-report scale, and its title is: Perceived efficacy in patient-physician interactions (PEPPI). A higher score means a better outcome.(max =50; min = 10)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment cost distress</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the patient-physician interaction</time_frame>
    <description>How distress each participant feels about how much their treatment will cost them will be evaluated with an investigator-developed validated self-report scale, and its title is: Treatment Cost Distress Scale. A higher score means a worse outcome. (max =7; min = 1)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Anticipated material hardship</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the patient-physician interaction</time_frame>
    <description>How much anticipated material hardship each participant feels they may experienced due to treatment costs will be evaluated with a validated self-report scale, and its title is: Economic Hardship Scale. A higher score means a worse outcome. (max =7; min = 1)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Financial toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after the patient-physician interaction</time_frame>
    <description>How much material and psychological hardship the patients experiences due to treatment cost will be evaluated with a validated self-report scale, and its title is: Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity (COST).
