    <textblock>
      Patients suffering from Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) with a prone position (PP)
      indication will benefit from measurements of radiological and biological kidney injury
      markers, intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and ventilatory mechanics in supine position
      (baseline IAP), after 2 hours in PP at the current IAP value, thirty minutes after patients'
      abdomen suspension in order to resume baseline IAP and after patients' are turned back to
      supine position.
