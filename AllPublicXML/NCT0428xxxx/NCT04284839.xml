      The DANCE Trial is a multi-centre, randomized controlled trial comparing the safety of direct
      oral anticoagulants (DOAC) versus vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in the early period (30 days)
      after cardiac surgery in patients with an indication for oral anticoagulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 10% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery have a prior history of atrial fibrillation
      (AF). Additionally, in the early post-operative period after cardiac surgery, 30-60% of
      patients develop AF which is associated with a significantly higher risk of stroke, even when
      transient. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy is the preferred method of thromboembolic
      prevention in these patients. In the post-operative period, however, the balance of benefits
      and risks of OAC may differ and the most safe and effective OAC therapy in that patient
      population is uncertain.

      Until 2009, vitamin K antagonists were the only OAC agents available for patients with AF.
      Although effective, their use is limited by a narrow therapeutic index requiring frequent
      international normalized ratio (INR) measurements to ensure appropriate levels of
      anticoagulation. This key limitation leads to non-compliance and discontinuation. In the last
      decade, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) - inhibitors of factor Xa or thrombin- have become
      broadly used in patients with atrial fibrillation. Treatment with a DOAC in patients with AF
      has been demonstrated to yield similar rates of thromboembolism, and a lower risk of
      intracranial bleeding when compared to vitamin K antagonists during long-term follow-up.
      Moreover, DOACs are more convenient for both patients and clinicians. They have a rapid onset
      of effect, fixed dosage that obviates the need for regular monitoring, and few interactions
      with food and other medications

      The purpose of this study is to establish whether DOACs are as safe as VKAs in the first few
      weeks after heart surgery. The results of this study will impact the treatment of hundreds of
      thousands of patients in the world every year.
