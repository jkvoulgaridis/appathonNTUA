  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent ductus arteriosus (DA) is a common entity in the premature newborn and is
      associated with high morbidity and mortality. There is still controversy about which is the
      best treatment for its closure. Children with AD who receive pharmacological treatment
      present more frequently than other premature children, necrotizing enterocolitis or isolated
      intestinal perforation.

      At the present time, the conventional treatment of DA consists in the administration of
      intravenous ibuprofen, slow bolus in 3 daily doses 10-5-5 mg / kg / day. Recently, it has
      been observed that treatment with ibuprofen in continuous iv infusion for 3 days seems to be
      more effective in closing DA than conventional treatment for 3 days with the same dose but in
      slow iv bolus. This experimental treatment reduced the incidence of associated necrotizing
      enterocolitis. Our group demonstrated in a previous pilot trial that the guided treatment
      with echocardiography (EchoG) of DA with ibuprofen compared with conventional treatment,
      allows to reduce the number of doses to the patient. The EchoG treatment thus presents a
      potential reduction of side effects associated with medication, this resulted in a tendency
      to have a lower incidence of necrotising enterocolitis in the experimental group. This
      multicenter clinical trial aims to test the hypothesis that the combination of 2 experimental
      treatments, the use of ibuprofen in continuous perfusion and EchoG, reduces the incidence of
      digestive side effects (necrotising enterocolitis or isolated intestinal perforation)
      compared to the treatment also guided by echocardiography but slow bolus iv.

    <masking_description>A randomized system with closed envelopes will be designed in which patients will be assigned to one of the 2 treatment groups, stratified by gestational age (&lt;28 weeks and ≥28 weeks) and by hospital center. In each center and each stratum, they will be randomly assigned in a 1: 1 ratio to each group of study. The assignment will be sequential.
The doctors responsible for the patient will be blind to the intervention but will be responsible for the sealed envelopes, and at the time of patient randomization, will deliver the sealed envelope corresponding to the nurses responsible for the preparation of the medication.</masking_description>
