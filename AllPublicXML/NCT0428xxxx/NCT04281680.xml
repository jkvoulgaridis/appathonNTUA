  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Between 2000 and 2016 258 distal pancreatectomies were performed at our University Hospital
      which were included in our analysis. Pasireotide was used in between July 2014 and April
      2016. Patients received 900-ug pasireotide administered twice daily perioperatively. We
      analyzed patients who received octreotide treatment separately. Complications such as
      fistulas (POPF), delayed gas-tric emptying (DGE), postoperative hemorrhage (PPH),
      reoperations and mortality were recorded and analyzed 90 days postoperatively

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In total, between 2000 and 2016 in our University Hospital there were 276 elective distal
      pancreatectomies performed. In this retrospective cohort study, we included 258 of those
      distal pancreatectomy patients in the database in to our analysis. Pasireotide was
      administered preoperatively to all patients undergoing distal pancreatic resection between
      July 2014 to April 2016, as a part of a new practice in our clinic. One patient received both
      pasireotide and octreotide, for whom drug delivery was stopped after one day, and who was
      ex-cluded from analysis. We also excluded nine patients because insufficient data were found.
      Seven patients were excluded because they were recruited to another clinical study.

      In total, 47 patients (18%) received 900-ug pasireotide administered subcutaneously twice
      daily for a week or until discharged from the hospital. We analyzed separately 31 (12%)
      patients who re-ceived octreotide peri-operatively. All other 180 (70%) distal resection
      patients operated on beween 2000 and 2016 constituted the control group.

      The drug used in this study, pasireotide (Signifor), was supplied by Novartis Europharm Ltd.
      (Novartis, Basel, Switzerland). The drug manufacturer did not take part in the study nor did
      it cover any costs.

      We collected information about the patient age, gender, the American Society of
      Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Classification, tumor histology and grade and type of
      resection. In addition, we recorded postoperative information, the length of the hospital
      stay, fever following surgery (&gt;38 Â°C), complications and surgical and other re-operations.
