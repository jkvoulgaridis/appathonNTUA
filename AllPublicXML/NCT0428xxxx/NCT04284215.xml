  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-resectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer is recommended for concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy. Paclitaxel and platinum are commonly used in chemotherapy regimens. The
      aim of this study was to investigate whether paclitaxel albumin combined with cisplatin
      combined with three-dimensional primary radiotherapy could improve short-term efficacy, local
      progression-free survival, and reduce treatment-related toxicity. To determine whether
      paclitaxel albumin combined with cisplatin regimen can be used as a first-line treatment for
      stage III non-small cell lung cancer with concurrent primary thoracic radiotherapy

      Control group: Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 was injected into saline solution on the first day.
      Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 was given intravenously for 2-3 days (2-4 days), carboplatin 300 mg/m2 and
      2 days. (Because toxicity and heart problems can replace DDP)]Repeated every 3-4 weeks for 4
      consecutive cycles (21-28 days/cycle, minimum 2 cycles). In the experimental group, albumin
      paclitaxel 40 mg/m2/week was injected into saline at the same time as radiotherapy, once a
      week. Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 was given intravenously for 2-3 days (2-4 days), carboplatin 300
      mg/m2 and 2 days. (Because toxicity and heart problems can replace DDP)] Repeat every 3-4
      weeks for 4 consecutive cycles (21-28 days/cycle, minimum 2 cycles). Three-dimensional
      radiotherapy: intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or rotational intensity-modulated
      radiation therapy (VMAT) segmented dose: primary focus and mediastinal metastatic lymph
      nodes; segmented mode: continuous accelerated hypersegmentation Dose: DTGTV: &gt; 60Gy treatment
      sequence: Chemotherapy started within one week after completion of pre-treatment evaluation.
      Radiotherapy for primary thoracic tumors was performed simultaneously on the first day of
      chemotherapy. Chemotherapy effectiveness was evaluated by radiological examination within one
      week after the completion of the second cycle of chemotherapy.
