  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the progress free survival (PFS) of
      DCC-2618 in patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors who have progressed with
      prior anticancer therapies based on independent radiologic review.This study will enroll
      approximately 35 subjects in up to 10 sites in China mainland, and all subjects will be
      receiving DCC-2618 after enrollment as treatment.
