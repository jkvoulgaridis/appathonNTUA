  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LVA orientations such as lymphaticovenous end-to-end (LVEEA), end-to-side (LVESA), and
      side-to-end (LVSEA) are commonly performed. Each orientation has its own advantages and
      disadvantages. The key factors affecting the type of anastomotic orientation are the sizes of
      the LVs and the RVs, and the relative distance between them. Most published literatures have
      focused on LVSEA2-9, which is considered to be the most efficient. With one anastomosis in
      LVSEA, the RV is able to drain both the antegrade and retrograde lymphatic flow.
      Nevertheless, how to determine the anastomotic orientation has remained ambiguous. In this
      study, we aimed to establish the basis of selecting the proper anastomotic orientation, based
      on the size and comparative size discrepancy between LV and RV. To the best of our knowledge,
      this is the first report to focus on this subject.

        This retrospective observational study was approved by the institutional review board in
        our hospital. From March 2016 to October 2018, 100 patients with 103 lymphedematous lower
        limbs (International Society of Lymphology stage I-III) were included. All the patients
        underwent supermicrosurgical LVA performed by a single surgeon using a high-power
        microscope.
