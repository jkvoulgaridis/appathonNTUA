  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Steep Trendelenburg positioning and insufflation of the abdominal cavity have shown to
      increase intra ocular pressure. Different anesthetic techniques can alter intra ocular
      pressure and a small pilot study showed decrease in Intraocular Pressure (IOP) in robotic
      case in steep Trendelenburg with IV anesthetics (TIVA).

      We want to quantify the degree of change in Intraocular Pressure (IOP) in female patients
      undergoing robotic procedures for cancer. We want to detect the difference in increase of
      pressure with total IV anesthesia versus conventional balanced anesthesia

      During the day of surgery, the anesthesiologist trained by an ophthalmologist, will measure
      each eye's Intraocular Pressure (IOP) using a tonometer for both the Trendelenburg with IV
      anesthetics (TIVA) and propofol/fentanyl/rocuronium arms of the study. (The Tono-Pen XL
      Medtronic Solan, Jacksonville, FL) The Intraocular Pressure (IOP) for both eyes will be
      measured at seven time points:

      Time 1 induction after administration of sedative and local anesthesia in the eye. Both eyes
      of the patient will anesthetized using topical proparacaine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution
      0.5%.

      Time 2 Post induction table 0 degrees Time 3 Supine after pneumoperitoneum with 14 mmHg
      pressure Time 4 After docking robot at correct Trendelenburg positioned measured by a level
      Time 5 After undocking and before moving supine Time 6 Supine and before extubation. If the
      intraocular pressure remains elevated above 19 mmHg will require a 7th measurement in PACU
      with HOB at 30 degrees and if the pressure still at or above 19 ophthalmology consult
      initiated.

      Time 7 if needed, see above

      If the patient has any increased reading at the end of the procedure, the same attending
      anesthesiologist in the post-operative recovery area prior to discharge will do a post op
      measurement. Any abnormal readings will prompt an ophthalmology consult and follow up with
      ophthalmology department.

    <description>Induction with 1% propofol (2-3 mg/kg), fentanyl (1-3 mg/kg), and Rocuronium 1-1.5 mg/kg. Before the injection of propofol, 5 mL 1% lidocaine (50 mg) to limit any discomfort caused by the propofol injection. After endotracheal intubation, intravenous infusion of propofol, lidocaine, ketamine or narcotic as deemed appropriate by anesthesiologist. There will be no inhalation anesthetic used. Ventilation with oxygen and air mixture (50%/50%) and titrated to keep the mean arterial pressure within 20% of its preinduction value. Muscle relaxation maintain using Aliquots of rocuronium to 0 to 1 train-of-4 twitch response of adductor pollicis. During surgery, mechanical ventilation using pressure-controlled mode (peak inspiratory pressure 30 cm H2O). We aim for Tidal volume of 5-7 ml/Kg of ideal body weight with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm H2O, and a respiratory rate to maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide between 30 to 40 mm Hg.</description>

    <description>Induction with 1% propofol (2-3 mg/kg), fentanyl (1-3 mg/kg), and Rocuronium 1-1.5 mg/kg. Before the injection of propofol, 5 mL 1% lidocaine (50 mg) to limit any discomfort caused by the propofol injection. After endotracheal intubation, the depth of anesthesia will be maintained at a minimum alveolar concentration of 1 to 1.25 using isoflurane in oxygen and air mixture (50%/50%) and titrated to keep the mean arterial pressure within 20% of its preinduction value. Muscle relaxation maintain using Aliquots of rocuronium to 0 to 1 train-of-4 twitch response of adductor pollicis. During the surgery, subjects will be mechanically ventilated using pressure-controlled mode (peak inspiratory pressure 30 cm H2O). We aim for Tidal volume of 5-7 ml/Kg of ideal body weight with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm H2O, and a respiratory rate to maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide between 30 to 40 mm Hg.</description>
