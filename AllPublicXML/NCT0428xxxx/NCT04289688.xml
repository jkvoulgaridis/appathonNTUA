  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bloodstream infections are frequent in children admitted to the hospital for severe febrile
      illness in sub-Saharan Africa.Ongoing blood culture surveillance at Kisantu Hospital showed
      non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) as the first cause of bloodstream infections in children.
      Bloodstream infections have a high case fatality (15 - 20%). Outcome of bloodstream
      infections is dependent on timely diagnosis and treatment. However, observations at Kisantu
      Hospital showed that many children arrive late and die early after admission.

      By interviewing caregivers of severely ill children admitted to Kisantu Hospital, the
      investigators aim to study their health itinerary, i.e. the sequence of all actions of health
      care seeking and care provision between the onset of febrile illness and the admission at the
      hospital. The investigators aim to assess the health itinerary according to the &quot;three
      delays&quot; model. The three delays model studies delays and practices at the level of health
      care seeking, of transport and of start of antibiotic treatment.10 Visits to referring health
      centers will provide complementary information about diagnosis, treatment and referral
      practices. In hospital follow-up will allow to assess the outcome according to the duration
      of health itinerary. The results of routine laboratory tests upon hospital admission will
      allow to stratify the health itinerary according to fever etiology.

      The results of this study will allow to understand the duration of the health itinerary, its
      possible association with case-fatality, and factors explaining for delays at every level.
      This information is expected to orient local health policy makers towards interventions
      shortening the duration of the health itinerary and in that case improve and monitor the
      referral system. In addition, the study results are expected to orient towards further
      research to understand health seeking behavior (i.e. focus-group discussions and
      community-based studies).

      The study is designed as a hospital-based cohort study at the pediatric ward of Kisantu
      general referral hospital. The investigators foresee a study inclusion period of 5 months.
      The study period is currently determined as such that it includes approximately 2 months of
      the dry season and 3 months of the rainy season. Seasonality is taken into account, because
      the rain affects the condition of the road and local disease epidemiology and can thus
      influence the study results. Most data will be collected retrospectively, i.e. all data on
      the health itinerary collected from the questionnaire and referral letter and the data from
      the health records in the referring health centers. Only the data from the in-hospital
      laboratory tests and clinical outcome will be collected prospectively.

      The data from the health records at referring health centers will be consulted after
      termination of the five months study inclusion period to avoid any influence from the study
      in the patient management at health centers during the study.

        The study setting is the Kisantu health zone, which has a population of 202 451 people, of
        which 48 043 are under 5 years old. The health zone is subdivided in 17 health areas that
        are each served by at least one health center, by smaller health posts and by community
        health workers.

        The formal health care system is composed of 51 health care facilities. Next to the formal
        health care system of community health workers, health posts and health centers, many
        informal health care providers exist (Nurses and doctors provide care, private pharmacies
        or drug vendors exist and traditional healers).

        Local disease prevalence:

          -  High P. falciparum malaria endemicity: 24% of children between 6-59 months had a
             positive blood microscopy test in the last national demographic and health survey.

          -  High prevalence of malnutrition: 46% and 11% of children under five were respectively
             chronically and acutely malnourished in the last national demographic and health
             survey.
