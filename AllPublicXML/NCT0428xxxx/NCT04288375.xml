  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are doing this study to find out whether lowering the dose of postoperative
      radiation therapy and targeting a smaller area of tissue for treatment is as effective as the
      standard dose and volume of radiation therapy to control soft tissue sarcoma after surgery.
      They also want to find out whether the study approach causes fewer and less severe long-term
      side effects than the standard approach.

    <description>will be assessed via imaging of the primary tumor site (MRI preferred, CT for patients who cannot get or tolerate an MRI). Imaging must take place at least annually for the first two years post-radiation. Local failure is defined as a relapse in the primary tumor bed.</description>

    <description>Postoperative radiation therapy to the primary site with a reduction in radiation dose and volume. Specifically, the tumor bed plus a margin of 2cm craniocaudally and 1.5cm radially will be utilized to create the clinical target volume. The total dose will consist of 50 Gy in 25 fractions.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be diagnosed with a primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity,
             confirmed by MSKCC pathologic review

          -  Age at the time of enrollment of â‰¥18 years

          -  Patients must have undergone margin-negative oncologic resection of their primary
             tumor, as confirmed by MSKCC pathologic review

          -  Patients must be able to start radiation within 3 months from time of surgery

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             within 14 days of radiation start (or if urine test, within 24 hours of radiation
             start)

          -  Sexually active patients of childbearing potential must agree to use effective
             contraception.

          -  The use of chemotherapy will not be dictated by this trial. Patients are allowed to
             receive chemotherapy at the discretion of the disease management team (as is standard
             practice to make individualized decisions for each patient regarding the use of
             chemotherapy).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with positive margins after surgical resection as indicated by MSKCC
             pathologic review

          -  Patients with diagnosis of superficial myxofibrosarcoma with indistinct/infiltrative
             borders on preoperative MRI16 (see Appendix Figure 1 for reference figure) or &lt;70%
             myxoid component given the distinct failure pattern in these patients14

          -  Patients with multifocal disease in the extremity

          -  Patients who have received prior radiotherapy at or adjacent to the primary tumor bed

          -  Patients with a differentinvasive cancer requiring active treatment at the time of
             enrollment.

          -  Patients with any concurrent medical or psychiatric condition or disease which, in the
             investigator's judgment, would make them inappropriate candidates for entry into this
             study
