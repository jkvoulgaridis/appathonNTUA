      This study evaluate the Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy(HIPEC) in the treatment of
      Stage IIc-IV epithelial Ovarian Cancer after primary Cytoreductive Surgery (CRS).Half
      participants will receive HIPEC twice with one intravenous chemotherapy and 5 cycles of
      intravenous chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel after CRS. Half participants will
      receive 6 cycles of intravenous chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel after CRS.

      Advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, now recognized as the most effective treatment is
      maximizing tumor reduction (cytoreductice surgery, CRS) within the abdominal cavity with
      platinum-based chemotherapy (intraperitoneal chemotherapy, IPEC) or intravenous chemotherapy.

      Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) refers to the chemotherapy drugs will be
      diluted and heated to the specified temperature (usually the 42 degrees), then injected into
      the abdominal cavity, maintain a constant temperature, repeated perfusion filling, so as to
      achieve the purpose of prevention and treatment of intra-abdominal tumors of a way of
      treatment.

      CRS combined with HIPEC is the most effective treatment strategy for peritoneal cancer at
      present.

    <description>Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal chemotherapy was started immediately after CRS, or the first HIPEC was completed within 48 hours after surgery: temperature 43℃, duration 60 minutes, Paclitaxel (60mg/m2) was selected. The second HIEPC was completed 7 days after the first HIPEC: temperature 43℃, duration 60min, carboplatin AUC (5-6) was selected. 30 minutes before using Paclitaxel, 10ML saline + 10mg dexamethasone intravenous infusion, 20mg diphenhyramine intramuscular injection, and 100ML saline + 0.3g cimetidine intravenous infusion. On the eighth day, intravenous chemotherapy with Paclitaxel (135mg/m2) was finally completed. 5 courses of TC intravenous chemotherapy were performed after 3 weeks</description>
