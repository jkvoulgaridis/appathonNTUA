  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Xerostomia causes a difficulty in eating, have irritated oral tissues, and a poor quality of
      life. The new oral rinse was designed to reduce the symptoms and improve the patient's
      quality of life. The objectives of the clinical study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the
      oral rinse comparing to the placebo product and the control product in the market.

      This is a randomized double-blind placebo controlled crossover study with 39 patients
      receiving treatment. Patients will be randomly allocated to three treatment groups. Patients
      will use the assigned oral rinse four times a day for two weeks. Dry mouth symptoms and other
      endpoints will be assessed subjectively and objectively at baseline and Day 14. Patients will
      be assigned to another treatment after one week wash-out period.
