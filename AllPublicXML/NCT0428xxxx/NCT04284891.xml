  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature birth is the leading cause of death in children younger than 5 years old worldwide,
      especially in low- and middle-income countries. Premature infants who survive are at greater
      risk of a range of short-term and long-term health consequences. Common long-term health
      morbidities among children who are born prematurely include cerebral palsy, infections
      (particularly respiratory infections), bronchopulmonary dysplasia, feeding difficulties,
      hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, visual and hearing problems. Re-hospitalization occurs
      frequently during first few years of life among ex-premature infants with respiratory
      illness. This leads to increased financial burden for health care system and families. The
      impact of prematurity on the health care system, especially on pediatric intensive care units
      (PICUs) has mainly been evaluated in high income countries. Little is known about long term
      health outcomes of ex-premature infants and their impact on the cost to health care system in
      low- and middle-income countries. This pilot, single institution, observational study aims to
      determine the prevalence, course of the diseases, and outcomes of ex-premature infants with
      respiratory illnesses who are admitted to a PICU of a tertiary children's hospital in
      Vietnam. Investigators will determine the epidemiology of respiratory illness, and the
      resource utilization for these children in the PICU. To achieve these aims, the investigators
      will prospectively screen and recruit all children aged less than 2 years old admitted to the
      PICU with respiratory illness/failure and collect pertinent clinical data. The study
      participants will be follow-up until PICU discharge.
