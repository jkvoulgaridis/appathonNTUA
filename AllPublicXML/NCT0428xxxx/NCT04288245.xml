  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Texas Biomedical Device Center at UT Dallas has developed an innovative strategy to enhance
      recovery of motor and sensory function after neurological injury termed targeted plasticity
      therapy (TPT). This technique uses brief pulses of vagus nerve stimulation to engage
      pro-plasticity neuromodulatory circuits during rehabilitation exercises. Recovery is
      associated with neural plasticity in spared motor networks in the brain and spinal cord.
      Moreover, an early feasibility study and an independent, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study in chronic stroke participants indicate that VNS is safe in participants with upper
      limb deficits, and yields a clinically-significant three-fold increase in neural connections
      during rehabilitation exercises. Given the track record of safety and potential for VNS to
      enhance recovery of upper limb motor function in spinal cord injured individuals, the purpose
      of this double blind randomized placebo controlled optional open-label extension study is to
      assess the safety of using a new device to deliver vagus nerve stimulation to reduce symptom
      severity in participants with SCI. Additionally, the study will assess the prospective
      benefit of the system and garner an initial estimate of efficacy for a subsequent trial.

    <time_frame>Weeks 7-12, Weeks 14-19</time_frame>
    <description>If stimulation delivery is successful during the active portion of therapy sessions then the system is feasible to use. The primary endpoint will be: greater than 50% of the valid attempts to stimulate are successful per the ReStore system log.</description>

    <measure>Quantitative Force and Range of Motion Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, 6, 13, 20</time_frame>
    <description>This is a physical assessment of upper limb changes in force/torque as a result of VNS paired rehabilitation. The primary endpoints will be: 10% increase in finger pinch and flexion force following active VNS, 10% increase in wrist flexion and extension force following active VNS, and 10% increase in wrist pronation and supination force following active VNS. This will serve as an efficacy measurement to use as basis for estimate of sample size for a pivotal trial.</description>

    <measure>Graded Redefined Assessment of Strength, Sensibility, and Prehension (GRASSP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, 6, 13, 20</time_frame>
    <description>Graded Redefined Assessment of Strength, Sensibility, and Prehension (GRASSP) is a measure used for spinal cord injury patients. The measure includes five subsets of questions designed to quantitatively measure clinical upper limb impairment (Kalsi-Ryan et al., 2012). The primary endpoint will be: &gt;4 point shift in GRASSP assessment following active VNS. This will serve as an efficacy measurement to use as basis for estimate of sample size for a pivotal trial.</description>
