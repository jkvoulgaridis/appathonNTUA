  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to determine the effectiveness of a multicomponent intervention for
      caregivers, conducted by an expert psychologist to improve the quality of life of the people
      with Alzheimer's disease. Secondarily, will be analyzed the effectiveness of this program on
      improving anxiety and depressive symptoms, burden, happiness, social support and cognitive
      performance of the caregivers and alleviate the behavioural and psychological symptoms of
      dementia (BPSD). The investigators analyze the caregiver's and patient's personality as a
      possible moderator between dependent and independent variables, and the resources utilization
      before and after intervention.

      Methods: randomized study with parallel assignment in two groups: control and intervention
      group, six-month follow-up. The eligible participants will be 94 adult (≥18 years) caregivers
      of patients with Alzheimer's disease who follow-up by Osona Integrated Geriatric Unite
      (Catalonia, Spain).

      The intervention group will receive a multicomponent intervention that includes dementia
      psychoeducation and management, emotional and communication skills, mindfulness and healthy
      lifestyle. The control group will follow the standard management according to the primary and
      specialized care professionals' team.

      Main measurements: quality of life of the patients at baseline, after intervention and at
      six-month follow-up through QoL-AD. Secondary measures: they will be determined, at baseline,
      after the intervention and at six-month follow-up: depression (HDRS) and anxiety (HARS),
      burden (CBI), happiness (OHQ), quality of life (QoL-AD), social support (UCLA and DUKE-ANC),
      cognitive performance (neuropsychological assessment) of the caregivers, resources
      utilization (RUD), BPSD (NPI), cognitive status (MMSE), functional status (IADL) of the
      patients. Caregiver's personality at baseline and six-month follow-up and dementia
      characteristics at baseline will be measured. Other measures: sociodemographic and health
      characteristics of the caregivers and patients.
