  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no system in place to allow manual wheelchair users to know their
      quantities of movement activities and the intensity of effort to be provided during these
      propulsion movements. Based on recent work by Routhier et al. in 2017, and in light of the
      scientific literature related to wheelchair propulsion, it would seem appropriate to validate
      the use of inertial units as tools to quantify and categorize the intensity of manual
      wheelchair propulsion.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigator hypothesize that an inertial unit positioned on the wheelchair wheel has the
      same detection rate of the propulsion cycle as a dynamometric wheel (step 1). In addition,
      the investigator hypothesize that the categorization of the detected propulsion cycle as a
      function of force intensity is similar between the angular deceleration of the wheel during
      propulsion calculated from the inertial unit and the external mechanical power calculated
      from a dynamometric wheel (step 2).
