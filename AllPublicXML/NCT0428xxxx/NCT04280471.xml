    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects of using an investigational procedure (fecal
      microbiota transplantation [FMT]) in treating patients with severe acute gut
      graft-versus-host-disease. The purpose of a fecal microbiota transplantation is to use feces
      from a healthy human donor to replace the abnormal gut bacteria in the recipient. One of the
      side effects of a stem cell transplant is the development of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD)
      in several organs including gut. GvHD is caused by the donated bone marrow or peripheral
      blood cells recognizing the recipient's body as foreign and attacking it. Acute gut GvHD is
      one of the leading causes of death after transplant. Recently, studies have shown that
      patients with reduced intestinal bacterial diversity in their stool during acute gut GvHD
      have higher overall mortality rates. The information learned from this study may offer FMT as
      a promising therapy for the treatment of severe acute gut graft-versus-host-disease.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. For safety evaluation, episodes of microbial bloodstream infection attributed to fecal
      microbiota transplantation (FMT) within the first 7 days after start of each FMT
      administration.

      II. For tolerability evaluation, subject must ingest 50% of one dose of FMT product without
      grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) within the first 7 days post-FMT.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To collect stool, oral swabs and blood specimens for future studies to define bacterial
      taxa diversity, microbial translocation as well as metabolomic and proteomic changes
      associated with the development of graft versus host disease (GvHD).

      II. For clinical efficacy, &gt; 50% of subjects with at least 1 stage of gut GvHD improvement by
      8 weeks after the first dose of FMT.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients ingest OpenBiome FMT Capsule Dose Extended (DE) orally for two consecutive days. One
      dose is equivalent to the ingestion of 30 capsules and thus each day the patient will ingest
      15 capsules. If no response is noted after 7 days, patients may receive a second dose of FMT
      for an additional 2 days. Standard treatment for gut GvHD will continue during this time.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 6 months.

    <description>For safety evaluation, episodes of microbial bloodstream infection attributed to fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) within the first 7 days after start of each FMT administration. For tolerability evaluation, at least 60% of subjects able to ingest 50% of one dose of FMT without grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) within the first 7 days post-FMT. Subjects will be monitored via assessment of gut graft versus host disease (GvHD) staging and adverse events will be performed bi-weekly for the first 4 weeks after the first dose of FMT, weekly during the hospitalization and monthly up to six months after hospital discharge.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Alpha diversity metrics will be compared between time points mixed effect regression models. Multivariate differences will be calculated using permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). Differential abundance techniques will be used to compare taxa over time using DESeq2 package. DESeq2 models taxa counts with a negative binomial model. To look specifically at before and after FMT, we will apply multivariate techniques such as principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) to identify parameters that are affected positively by FMT and to determine whether these differences persist over time. The PERMNOVA technique will be applied to survey population-level differences before &amp; after FMT. We will use the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) to account for multiple hypothesis testing.</description>
