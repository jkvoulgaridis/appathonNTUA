      This phase II trial studies how well rituximab, venetoclax, and bortezomib work in treating
      patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond
      to treatment (refractory). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, may
      help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor
      cells to grow and spread. Venetoclax and bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the proteins needed for cell growth. Giving rituximab, venetoclax, and
      bortezomib may slow or stop the growth of cancer cells in patients with diffuse large B-cell
      lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) of rituximab, venetoclax, and bortezomib in
      relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the safety profile of rituximab, venetoclax, and bortezomib in diffuse large
      B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

      II. To describe the progression free survival of subjects enrolled to the study.

      III. To describe the median overall survival of subjects enrolled to the study. IV. To
      describe the complete remission (CR) rate, the partial remission (PR) rate and the duration
      of response (DoR) of rituximab, venetoclax, and bortezomib in relapsed/refractory DLBCL.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To describe the association of BCL2 expression status, measured by immunohistochemistry
      (IHC), with ORR, CR and PR rates.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) on day -1 of cycle 1, then on day 1 of cycles
      2-6. Patients also receive venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14 and bortezomib
      IV or subcutaneously (SC) on day -1 of cycle 1, then on days 1, 8, and 15 of subsequent
      cycles. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles for rituximab and up to 26 cycles
      for venetoclax and bortezomib in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases will be excluded from this clinical trial because
             of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events

          -  Serious concomitant systemic disorders (including active infections) that would
             compromise the safety of the patient or compromise the patient's ability to complete

          -  The effects of combination venetoclax and bortezomib may cause fetal harm. For this
             reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry, for the duration of study participation and for 12 weeks after. Should a woman
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she
