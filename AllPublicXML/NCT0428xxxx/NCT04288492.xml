  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blinded, and pararllel design
      study. A total of 106 patients were decided to be recruited considering a 10% dropout rate.
      Patients are randomizes to perform or not respiratory exercises using biofeedback
      device(ResCalm). The randomization numbers are generated using a computer-generated
      randomization code and are sealed in the opaque envelope until they are handed over to
      anesthesiligist in charge of patient management. Record patient preoperative tanxiety,
      postoperative pain, and pain medication use. Patienst aged 19-64 yr, ASA class 1 or 2, and
      are scheduled for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy are included. Patients who were
      unable to perform autologous breathing at regular intervals were excluded.

      1. Assignment of experimental groups

           Group A: Respiratory exercise using respiratory biofeedback device(ResCalm) is applied
           2-3 times / day for 3 minutes until discharge from hospital and once in the recovery
           room before surgery.

           Group B: General surgery schedule without control exercise.

           All patients measure STAI(state trait anxiety inventory) at the operating room entrance
           on the day of surgery.

        2. anesthesia methods Intravenous anesthesia is performed using the target injection
           concentration control method. As an anesthetic, propofol / remifentanil / rocuronium is
           used. The artificial ventilation method is a pressure-controlled ventilation method,
           which maintains an appropriate pressure and performs anesthesia.

        3. postoperative care After anesthesia, the patient wakes up and transfers to the recovery
           room to encourage self-breathing exercise. After entering the recovery room, the
           patient's vital signs (average blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation) and
           analgesic use are checked immediately before leaving.

      We check for the presence of pulmonary complications, visual analog scale (VAS), analgesic
      use, and hospital patient satisfaction for 24 hours after surgery.
