  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research focuses on top-down intervention approaches and more specifically on the
      Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational Performance (CO-OP) method in the rehabilitation
      of executive function disorders in adult post-stroke subjects in chronic phase. The main
      objective of this study is therefore to improve performance in significant activities of
      daily living for people with chronic post-stroke dysexecutive disorders.

    <textblock>
      Today, approaches to intervention with adults after stroke can be categorized into two
      groups: bottom-up approaches (neurodevelopmental, sensory integration, mental imagery,
      cognitive stimulation, perceptual-motor/kinesthetic training...) and top-down approaches
      (task-oriented approach, neuromotor task training, occupational performance coaching, the
      CO-OP approach). Although bottom-up intervention approaches have existed for several years
      longer than top-down approaches, in general, top-down intervention approaches have shown
      better results.

      In the latest work with post-stroke adults with objective cognitive impairment, the data
      indicate the relevance of CO-OP in improving performance and satisfaction, attention,
      inhibition and flexibility or apathy.

      This study aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of the CO-OP approach in adult post-stroke
      patients in chronic phase, specifically on planning function, through the Single Case
      Experimental Design methodology by randomized intervention (3 patients) over 6 weeks of
      treatment and 10 weeks of evaluation.

    <description>The Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational Performance (CO-OP) approach is described as &quot;a patient-centred, performance-oriented approach to activities and problem solving that allows skills to be acquired through a process of strategy use and guided discovery&quot;. The CO-OP protocol is composed of seven key characteristics: i) the goals chosen by the patient, ii) dynamic performance analysis, iii) the use of cognitive strategies, iv) guided discovery, v) the principles of empowerment, vi) the involvement of a relative, vii) the structure of the intervention (Polatajko and Mandich, 2004/2017). CO-OP is an evidence-based approach to intervention, including evidence of its effectiveness on a physical, cognitive and emotional dimension in adults with stroke</description>
