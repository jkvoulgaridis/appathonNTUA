  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The feasibility and efficacy of emergency curative resection of complicated colorectal cancer
      is still controversial. This prospective study aim is to assess surgical and oncologic
      outcomes after emergency compared to elective curative resection of colorectal cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      60 consecutive patients presented with complicated colorectal cancer managed by emergency
      surgery were included and compared to another 155 consecutive patients admitted during the
      same period with uncomplicated colorectal cancer managed by elective surgery. Both groups
      were compared regarding curative resection rate, early postoperative mortality and morbidity,
      3-years tumor recurrence and survival rates.

        This study included 60 consecutive patients presented by complicated colorectal cancer
        treated by emergency surgery at Alexandria University hospital between January 2015 and
        January 2017 (Group I). Another 155 patients with uncomplicated colorectal cancer treated
        by elective surgery during the same period were included (Group II).
