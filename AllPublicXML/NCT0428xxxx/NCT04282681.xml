      The primary objective of this study is to collect accelerometer data from subjects monitored
      in an EMU with concurrent video EEG.

      XLTCS (LNE-800) is an international multicenter prospective data collection study to gather
      accelerometer data. The population under the study comprises patients monitored in an
      Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) with concurrent video EEG and who are expected to have at
      least one seizure with tonic-clonic convulsive movement.

      A maximum of one hundred and fifty (150) patients will be enrolled and will wear an
      accelerometer, and up to 6 sites may participate in this study. The total enrollment period
      will take approximately 2 years.

      Once the accelerometer was adhered to the subject, subjects will be followed for a minimum of
      2 days and a maximum of 10 days.

      Subject participation will run concurrently with the EMU admission. Exit from the study
      occurs when the subject's stay in the EMU is completed or the subject is withdrawn or
      withdraws from the study.

    <description>The study will evaluate accelerometer data and tonic-clonic seizure data that was collected during the patients' EMU admission. The sample size is not based on a statistical power calculation, thus no primary endpoint is defined in the clinical investigation plan.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Four (4) years of age or older.

          2. Admitted to an Epilepsy Monitoring Unit for video EEG monitoring.

          3. Based on medical history, expected to have at least one seizure with tonic-clonic
             convulsive movement during the EMU stay as determined by the investigator.

          4. Capable of understanding and willing to comply with instructions and study procedures.

          5. Subject or guardian must be willing and able to complete informed consent/assent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Based on medical history, expected to have only non-epileptic events during the EMU
             stay as determined by the investigator.

          2. Based on medical history, known to have only absence seizures.

          3. Medical or psychiatric condition that in the investigator's judgment would prevent the
             subject's successful completion of the study.

          4. Participants with known hypersensitivity or skin sensitivity conditions that will
             preclude attachment of the accelerometer.

          5. Participants who are also taking part in another clinical trial that could confound
             the results of the studyÍ¾ these patients can be included into the study only if
             LivaNova has provided written approval.
