    <description>Patient screening phase - Patients diagnosed with aGvHD will be identified. Only patients with SR-aGvHD will be finally included in the study.
Treatment phase - Leukotac will be given up to D28
Primary Follow-up phase - Patient's response (CR and PR) will be evaluated at D29 post inclusion. Patients will then be followed for survival, long-term safety and chronic GvHD occurrence during 6 months after inclusion</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who develop a first episode of aGvHD stage ≥ II (Przepiorka et al., 1995),
             resistant to a first line therapy with steroids (lack of improvement after 5 days or
             progression after 3 days of treatment with corticosteroids at 2 mg/Kg
             methylprednisolone equivalent dose)

          -  Age 28 days to &lt; 18 years old

          -  Allo-HSCT with any type of donor, stem cell source, GVHD prophylaxis or conditioning
             regimen

          -  Patients receiving Allo-HSCT for any indication (i.e. malignant or non-malignant
             disease)

          -  Signature of informed and written consent by the patient and/or by the patient's
             legally acceptable representative(s)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Isolated stage 1 skin SR-aGvHD

          -  Overlap chronic GvHD as defined by the NIH Consensus Criteria (Jagasia MH, 2015)

          -  Acute GvHD after donor lymphocytes infusion (DLI)

          -  Relapsed/persistent malignancy requiring rapid immune suppression withdrawal

          -  Other systemic drugs than corticosteroids for GvHD treatment (including
             extra-corporeal photopheresis). Drugs already being used for GvHD prevention (e.g.
             calcineurin inhibitors) are allowed.

          -  Active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infection requiring systemic therapy

          -  Known allergy or intolerance to Leukotac of one of its ingredients

          -  Pregnancy: positive urinary or blood test in female of childbearing potential;
             lactation; absence of effective contraceptive method for female and male of
             childbearing potential
