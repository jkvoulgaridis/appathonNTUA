      This study evaluates if improvement of renal resistive index when mean arterial pressure
      increase (at 65 mmHg to 85 mmHg) in early phase of septic shock is predictive of better renal
      survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Learned societes (survival sepsis campaign and ESICM) are currently recommending a mean
      arterial pressure (MAP) target at 65 mmHg in septic shoc with a potential increase to 85 mmHg
      in patients with medical history of arterial hypertension.

      A high renal resistive index on the first day of septic shock was associated with acute renal
      failure more frequently on the 5th day. A decrease in the renal resistance index was also
      objectified during the increase in MAP.

      The main objective of this trial is to study the relationship between the improvement of the
      resistance index during a test of increase in average blood pressure during septic shock and
      the improvement of renal function

      In this interventional monocenter trial, we will measure the renal resistive index after
      stabilization of the MAP at 65 mmHg for two hours, then after 2 hours of stabilization at 85
      mmHg. This part allows us to define the patients &quot;responding&quot; to the renal resistive index
      (improvement of the resitive renal index when the MAP increases).

      Then, patients will be randomized into two groups :

        -  first group with a MAP target at 65 mmHg

        -  second group with a MAP target at 85 mmHg. There will be a stratification on the
           responder character to the renal resistance index.

      Finally, we will assess renal function on the 7th day (with the assessment of serum
      creatinine and the change of stage of the KDIGO classification)
