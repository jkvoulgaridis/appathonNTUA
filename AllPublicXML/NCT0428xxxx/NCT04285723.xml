    <textblock>
      The study is a site-based retrospective non-interventional medical chart review of pediatric
      and adult male and female patients with PIK3CA-Related Overgrowth Spectrum (PROS).
      Patient-level data are abstracted from medical charts of all eligible patients at all
      participating sites.

      Information from patients treated with alpelisib will be used to describe the efficacy and
      safety of alpelisib in PROS patients.
