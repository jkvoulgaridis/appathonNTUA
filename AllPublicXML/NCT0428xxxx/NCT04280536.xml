  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label, lead in phase Ib dose confirmation, followed by phase II
      study with 2 parallel study cohorts. The phase Ib segment will be carried out in a standard
      3+3 dose escalation design, with a projected enrolment of 3 to 18 patients to determine the
      RP2D. In the phase II portion, a total of 68 patients will be enrolled (39 patients in cohort
      A and 29 patients in cohort B), based on the Ahern's design for statistical considerations,
      accounting for a 10% attrition rate.

      Phase Ib

      Patients will be treated with twice-daily dosing of FTD/TPI in a 3+3 dose escalation design
      based on the following dose levels:

      Dose Level Dose

        1. 35mg/m2 BD, days 1-5, 8-12 every 4 weeks

             -  1 30mg/m2 BD, days 1-5, 8-12 every 4 weeks

             -  2 25mg/m2 BD, days 1-5, 8-12 every 4 weeks

                  -  calculated dose levels should be rounded up or down to the nearest 5mg
                     increment ** dose should not exceed 80mg BD, up to a maximum of 160mg/day ***
                     FTD/TPI should be taken within 1 hour of completion of morning and evening
                     meals to lessen negative effects on neutrophil counts

           If dose level -2 is found to be intolerable, the study team will review the safety and
           efficacy findings from all patients, then decide if the study should be terminated, or
           whether it will still be of interest to test at a level with further dose reduction.

           Phase II Oral FTD/TPI at RP2D will be administered until disease progression,
           intolerable toxicity or patient withdrawal.

        2. parallel cohorts of patients will be enrolled : Cohort A : patients with prior exposure
           to fluoropyrimidines Cohort B : patients without prior exposure to fluoropyrimidines
