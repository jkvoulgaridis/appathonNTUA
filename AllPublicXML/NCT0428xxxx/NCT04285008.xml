  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this multi-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial is to
      evaluate the bowel cleansing after Pure-Vu use in outpatient subjects at high risk for
      inadequate colon preparation as compare to standard of care.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total of 88 subjects (44 per arm) at high risk for inadequate colon preparation will be
      randomized and undergo procedure either in the Control arm (standard of care) or with the
      Pure-Vu System.

      Subjects will be enrolled at up to 4 clinical sites in the United States.

      primary endpoint- A comparison between the two study arms (i.e., Pure-Vu vs. standard
      colonoscopy) of the rate of overall cleansing as well as cleansing per segment will be
      evaluated by the BBPS scoring index (Bowel preparation adequacy defined as BBPS &gt;2 in each
      segment)

      The following secondary endpoints will be determined:

        1. Assess the willingness of consented subjects to pay for Pure-Vu prior to colonoscopy

        2. Colonoscopy procedural measures for Intervention and Control arms

        3. Endoscopists' experience

        4. Safety assessment for all subjects on the day of procedure per endoscopist

        5. Post-colonoscopy patient experience and safety check with scripted phone call 1-3 days
           after colonoscopy

        6. Assess the willingness of consented subjects to pay for the Pure-Vu System 1-3 days
           after colonoscopy

      Follow-up call will be conducted 1-3 business days after the procedure to verify that there
      has been no change in their clinical status and record their willingness to use the Pure-Vu
      System in the future.

    <intervention_model_description>Randomization to Intervention or Control arm will use stratification by site, endoscopist and blocking. Sites are expected to contribute approximately equal numbers of procedures, and no site will be allowed to contribute more than 50% of the target sample size. The randomization sequences will be provided in advance by the study's statistician using an online system to obtain the randomization assignment and the corresponding colonoscope will be prepared. Randomization assignment will be recorded for each subject.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Participant)</masking>
    <masking_description>The Colonoscope will be prepared as per normal routine and the research assistant will cover the colonoscope before the patient enters the endoscopy room to keep him/her blinded to the study arm. This is uncovered once the patient is sedated.</masking_description>

    <description>The Pure-Vu System is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved device (K191220), intended to connect to standard colonoscopes to help facilitate intra-procedural cleaning of a poorly prepared colon by irrigating or cleaning the colon and evacuating the irrigation fluid (water), feces and other bodily fluids and matter, e.g. blood.</description>
