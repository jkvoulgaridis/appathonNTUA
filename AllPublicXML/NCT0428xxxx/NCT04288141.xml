  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of breast cancer is determined by its 'receptor (or signal) status'. Receptors
      are signals present on all cells and if abnormal can drive cancer growth. One of the signals
      that can drive breast cancer growth is the HER2 receptor/signal. One quarter of all breast
      cancers are found to have too many HER2 signals i.e. HER2-positive breast cancer.

      HER2 is a member of the HER-family which constitutes HER1,HER2,HER3,and HER4 signals.
      Currently, tests can identify breast cancers with too much HER2, from a biopsy, so a cancer
      doctor can prescribe anti-HER2 treatment to block these signals. These drugs have improved
      survival rates in HER2-positive breast cancer. Members of the HER family can also 'pair' with
      each other to activate signals that encourage cancer growth. For example, HER3 naturally
      'pairs' with HER2. Though anti-cancer drugs have been developed to target this pairing, the
      current method of patient selection is not developed to detect pairing of signals in tissue
      biopsies. A specialist imaging technique called FLIM-FRET (FLIM- Fluorescence Lifetime
      Imaging Microscopy; FRET- Forster resonance energy transfer) can identify signal pairing on
      cancer cells from tissue, and potentially, from blood samples.

      This study involves having blood tests while participants receive anti-HER2 treatment. The
      investigators will also seek permission to take samples of cancer tissue from the biopsies
      that were already carried out, e.g. at diagnosis. Some participants may need an additional
      biopsy, which will be discussed with participants prior to consent. This study will use the
      specialist FLIM-FRET technique to measure the signal pairing in tumour samples and blood
      samples. Investigators will measure if the levels of signal pairing from blood are the same
      as that from tissue, which could lead to bloods tests being used to select patients for
      anti-HER2 treatments, instead of invasive tissue biopsies. Changes in signal pairing may also
      help to predict if a cancer is becoming resistant to treatment.

      The study will recruit 40 participants to two groups as outlined below:

      Group 1: Early HER2 positive breast cancer (20 patients) Group 2: Metastatic HER2 positive
      breast cancer (20 patients)

      The two groups represent the natural spectrum of breast cancer in its clinical presentation.

      GROUP 1: EARLY BREAST CANCER

      Group 1 will include patients with early HER2 positive breast cancer recommended to receive
      neo-adjuvant chemotherapy inclusive of HER2 directed therapy (trastuzumab + pertuzumab),
      prior to proceeding to curative surgery. All participants are expected to have had a
      diagnostic core biopsy and definitive breast surgery on completion of neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy as standard of care. Blood samples will be obtained for biomarker analysis in
      exosomes. Participants in Group 1 A will be requested to have a biopsy on completion of
      anthracycline based chemotherapy and prior to commencing on HER2-directed therapy.

      Group 1 A: Participants in Group 1 commencing treatment with anthracycline based chemotherapy
      for up to 4 cycles followed by a switch in treatment to taxane based chemotherapy in
      combination with HER2 directed therapy (trastuzumab + pertuzumab) for up to 4 cycles

      Group 1 B: Participants in Group 1 commencing treatment with taxane based systemic therapy in
      combination with HER2 directed therapy (trastuzumab + pertuzumab) for up to 6 cycles:

      GROUP 2: METASTATIC BREAST CANCER:

      Group 2 will include patients with metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer recommended to
      receive HER2 directed systemic therapy (trastuzumab + pertuzumab) in a palliative setting.
      All participants are expected to have had a diagnostic core biopsy. Blood samples will be
      obtained for biomarker analysis in exosomes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Female or Male aged 18 years or above.

          2. Histologically documented breast cancer. In participants with metastatic breast cancer
             (Group 2), the biopsy should have been obtained following or at the time of diagnosis
             of metastatic breast cancer. (refer to inclusion criteria 10 for group 2 specific
             criteria)

          3. HER2 positive breast cancer, to be established by immunohistochemistry and confirmed
             by fluorescence in situ hybridisation or dual in situ hybridisation in borderline
             cases as per standard of care guidelines.

          4. Confirmation of availability of sufficient tumour tissue (from diagnostic core biopsy)
             for biomarker analysis (Refer to study laboratory manual)

          5. Fit for treatment with chemotherapy in combination with HER2 targeted therapy as per
             investigator discretion

          6. Life expectancy of 12 weeks or more.

          7. Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the
             study and in the investigator's opinion, is able and willing to comply with all study
             requirements.

          8. Participant willing to undergo additional biopsies when required i.e. Group 1A and
             Group 2

          9. Willing to allow his or her general practitioner to be notified of participation in
             the study [optional].

         10. Group 2 specific criteria

               1. The pre-treatment tumour sample for biomarker analysis in group 2 will be
                  acquired from the diagnostic biopsy acquired when participants were first
                  diagnosed with metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer. The biopsy should have
                  been acquired following or at the time of the diagnosis of metastatic breast
                  cancer (i.e. cannot use tumour tissue acquired during a prior diagnosis of
                  early/locally advanced breast cancer for this study's biomarker analysis). The
                  biopsy may be acquired from a breast mass or a metastatic site. If a biopsy
                  following or at the time of the diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer has not
                  been carried out, a study specific biopsy will need to be organised.

               2. Only patients recommended first line treatment with a taxane, trastuzumab and
                  pertuzumab by their physician, are eligible. Potential participants being
                  considered for treatment with any other treatment combinations with HER2 targeted
                  therapies will not be considered eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Significant thrombocytopaenia or abnormal clotting screen or any other condition that
             would contraindicate a tissue biopsy if this were required, in the investigator's
             opinion.

          2. Participant unwilling to undergo study required tissue biopsies and blood sampling.

          3. Any other significant underlying condition or comorbidity which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may either put the participants at risk because of participation in the
             study, or may influence the result of the study or the participant's ability to
             participate in the study.

          4. Inability of participant to co-operate with study procedures as judged by the
             investigator.
