    <textblock>
      The study's research design is a randomized experiment. 50 emergency responders (emergency
      medical responders, emergency medical technicians, advanced emergency medical technicians,
      and paramedics) will be recruited for this research. All data collection will take place in
      Lab 14 of the Benson Bunker Fieldhouse or a professional, confidential location of the
      participant's choosing.

      Prior to CPR performance, participants will be given an informed consent form to sign. The
      form will be explained in detail by the researcher collecting data. After obtaining informed
      consent, participants will be asked to fill out a demographic questionnaire to collect
      information such as age, gender, years of emergency responder experience/employment, and
      years of CPR certification. Demographic information provided by participants will be utilized
      in data analysis. The demographics form should take approximately five minutes to complete.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to the four trials they will partake in and instructed
      via oral script (one for over and one for under football shoulder pads) to perform
      four-trials total of three-minute single-rescuer CPR on both a traditional CPR manikin and
      &quot;Fat Old Fred&quot; (bariatric) CPR manikin. CPR must be performed in accordance with the American
      Heart Association's 2015 CPR Guidelines and participants will use a CPRmeter 2 device to
      collect data to determine the quality of CPR components (chest compression depth/recoil,
      compression rate, CPR compression duration, mean depth, mean rate, and total number of
      compressions). The entire study session should take 25 to 30 minutes to complete.
