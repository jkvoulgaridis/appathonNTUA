    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of two approaches for improving
      long-term weight loss success among individuals with severe obesity. All participants will
      receive a 12-week, in-person standard behavioral weight loss program followed by either 8
      weeks of a mindfulness self-compassion intervention or 8 weeks of a nutrition and cooking
      education intervention (determined via randomization procedures). Assessments of weight,
      physical activity, and other weight-related and psychosocial factors will occur at baseline,
      3 months, 5 months, and 7.5 months.

    <description>Participants will receive a 12-week, group-based, behavioral weight loss program which teaches strategies for changing diet and exercise behaviors. This will be followed by an 8-week mindful self-compassion program which combines the skills of mindfulness and self-compassion as a means for improving emotional resilience, well-being, and weight control.</description>
