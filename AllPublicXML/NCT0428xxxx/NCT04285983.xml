      The drug being tested in this study is called trelagliptin tablet. This tablet is being
      tested to treat people who have type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated by severe renal
      impairment or end-stage renal failure.

      This study is an observational (non-interventional) study and will look at the long-term
      safety of the trelagliptin tablet in the routine clinical setting. The planned number of
      observed patients will be approximately 100.
