  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anesthesia is a drug induced, reversible, comatose state that facilitates surgery and it is
      widely assumed that cognition returns to baseline after anesthetics have been eliminated.
      However, many patients have persistent memory impairment for weeks to months after surgery.
      Cardiac surgery appears to carry the highest risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction
      (POCD). These cognitive deficits are associated with increased mortality, prolonged hospital
      stay and loss of independence. The investigators propose to investigate the role of
      Dexmedetomidine (DEX) in preventing long-term POCD after cardiac surgery and enhancing early
      postoperative recovery. It is anticipated that DEX will be the first effective preventative
      therapy for POCD, improve patient outcomes, and reduce length of stay and healthcare costs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dexmedetomidine (DEX), a highly potent and selective α2-adrenoceptors (α2R) agonist used in
      clinical practice for sedation, analgesia, and anxiolysis, was recently shown to have
      beneficial effects on early cognitive changes by reducing delirium in humans. It also reduced
      memory impairment after surgery and isoflurane anesthesia, both in elderly mice (20-22
      months) and in pups exposed to anesthesia in the early postnatal period. Importantly,
      co-treatment with DEX has been shown to restore learning and memory function in rats exposed
      to propofol in utero. Therefore, the investigators set out to investigate whether DEX has an
      effect on cognitive dysfunction months after surgery and whether it accelerates cognitive
      recovery from anesthesia and surgery.

      This is a multi-site trial facilitated by Clinical Trials Ontario (CTO). Participants will be
      randomized 1:1 in permuted blocks of 4 to 8. The randomization sequence will be computer
      generated and stratified by 2 factors, planned procedure (CABG/CABG + valve or valve only
      procedure) and study site.

      In hospital outcomes include delirium (assessed twice daily post-operative day (POD) 0-10,
      death, hemodynamic instability requiring vasopressors, time to extubation, re-intubation (and
      reason), length of stay (in Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit and total hospital), POCD,
      depressive symptoms between POD 4-10, post-operative complications (infection [surgical site,
      sepsis, pneumonia], myocardial infarction, renal replacement therapy, re-operation,
      cumulative opioid consumption (to POD 5), in-hospital mortality.

      Post-operative outcomes include POCD (3/6/12 months), depression (3/6/12 months), mild
      cognitive impairment (MCI) at 3/6/12 months (defined as 1-2 standard deviations below age
      matched controls), persistent surgical site pain at sternotomy/thoracotomy/graft harvest site
      (Brief Pain Inventory, 3/6/12 months), recovery (3,6, 12 months).
