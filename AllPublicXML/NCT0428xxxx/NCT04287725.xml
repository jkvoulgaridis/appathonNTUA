    <time_frame>Baseline; Immediately after the last intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The VAS evaluates pain intensity levels perceived by the patient on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no pain' and 10 'the worst possible pain'.</description>

    <description>Measured by the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of 24 items that describe situations that patients may have difficulty performing on a daily basis due to LBP. The greater the number of affirmative answers is, the higher the level of functional disability associated with LBP.</description>

    <description>Measured by the reduced version of the Anxiety, Depression and Stress Scale-21. It is a self-report instrument composed of three subscales with seven items each, to assess depression, anxiety and stress in the previous week. The variations in scores correspond to symptom levels, which vary between &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;very severe&quot;.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline; Immediately after the last intervention; 3 months after the last intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire. The scale consists of 10 questions with six alternatives, the value of which ranges from 0 to 5. It is classified into: minimum disability (0 - 20%), moderate disability (21- 40%), severe disability (41 - 60%) , a patient who is disabled (61 - 80%), and an individual restricted to bed (81 - 100%).</description>
