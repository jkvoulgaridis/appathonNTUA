    <textblock>
      Patients with painful diabethic peripheral neuropathy will be entered.. Participants will be
      randomized to one of three study arms: Arm 1: relaxatio; Arm 2:meditation Arm 3: Attention
      matched control Hypothesis: Progressive muscle relaxation and mindfullness meditation will
      decrease severity of neuropathc pain and fatigue and improve quality of life.

      Previous reports have revealed that progressive muscle relaxation and meditation are
      promising for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes patients. On the other hand, research
      examining effects of these approaches on painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy, fatigue and
      quality of life is limited. The present study investigates the effects of progressive muscle
      relaxation and mindfullness meditation in a single-site, 3-arm, assessor blinded randomized,
      controlled study of 77 type 2 diabetes patients with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
      Arm 1: relaxation; Arm 2: mindfulness meditation; Arm 3: Attention matched control. The
      investigators hypothesize that Progressive muscle relaxation and mindfulness meditation will
      decrease severity of neuropathic pain and fatigue and improve quality of life.
