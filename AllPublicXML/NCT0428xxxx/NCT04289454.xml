  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ketone ester (KE) drinks are sold commercially in the USA and elsewhere (the FDA has accepted
      a GRAS (generally regarded as safe) notification on the KEs we propose to study). KE drinks
      can have beneficial effects on metabolism. Unfortunately, KE drinks have a strongly
      unpleasant flavor which can trigger rejection. The current study will generate data to help
      inform KE drink formulations with improved flavor. First stage, trained subjects will rate
      the intensity of various sensation qualities (e.g., bitter, sour, metallic, and astringent)
      from KE drinks to help understand the nature of the unpleasant flavor and the particular
      sensory systems involved (e.g., taste vs. smell). Then, subjects will taste KE drinks with
      and without various flavor modifiers. Subjects will be healthy adults (aged 21-45) without
      known food allergies.

    <masking_description>Samples presented will not be identified (there will be no codes or visual cues regarding whether a model drink does or does not contain a flavor modifier). However, true blinding is impossible since flavor will differ between samples.
Investigators will not be blind to sample contents. However, responses will be collected and recorded using an automated computer program, which offers some protection against possible experimenter bias.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rated intensity profile</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion (up to a year for a given participant, depending on how many drink samples the participant agrees to evaluate). Participants will rate the intensity of about 12 model drink samples during each study visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Rated intensity of taste qualities (e.g., sour, bitter) and mouth-feel (astringent) of model drinks, measured using the general Labeled Magnitude Scale (gLMS). In this implementation of the gLMS, scores will range from 0 (or &quot;no sensation&quot;) up to 100 (&quot;strongest imaginable sensation&quot;), with higher scores indicating stronger perceived intensity for the sensation in question.</description>

    <measure>Rated pleasantness</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion (up to a year for a given participant, depending on how many drink samples the participant agrees to evaluate). Participants will rate the pleasantness of about 12 model drink samples during each study visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Rated pleasantness, using the Labeled Hedonic Scale (LHS). In this implementation of the LHS, rated pleasantness will range from -50 (most disliked sensation imaginable) to +50 (most liked sensation imaginable). Zero (0) represents &quot;neutral.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Rated upper GI symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion (up to a year for a given participant, depending on how many drink samples the participant agrees to evaluate). Participants will rate upper GI symptoms after tasting about 12 model drink samples during each study visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Rated intensity of nausea, bloating, and heartburn, using a nine-point category scale (some bitter liquids can trigger mild to moderate feelings of nausea). Scores for each symptom range from 0 (&quot;none&quot;) to 8 (&quot;Unbearable&quot;), with &quot;mild&quot; (2), &quot;moderate&quot; (4), and &quot;severe&quot; (6) as labeled intermediate categories.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Good general health (self report)

          2. Men and women

          3. Age from 21 to 45

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current (or within the last four weeks) acute illness, such as cold or flu

          2. Currently active allergies

          3. Regular use of medication (over the counter or prescription), except for birth
             control.

          4. Any history of food allergy or sensitivity (particularly to KE drinks or MSG). Any
             history of sensitivity to 6-Propylthiouracil (bitter compound frequently used to
             assess individual differences in sensitivity to bitterness).

          5. Pregnant, nursing, or trying to become pregnant during the study (pregnancy can affect
             flavor perception)

          6. Chronic illness (any ongoing condition that is serious or required medical
             monitoring), including kidney problems, liver problems, cardiovascular problems (e.g.,
             heart disease or high blood pressure), diabetes, HIV infection, or other ongoing
             illness). Diabetes or other metabolic issues could be important for safety as well as
             quality of data.

          7. History of taste problems (absent or abnormal sense of taste)

          8. Weigh less than 100 pounds (45.4 kilograms). This is to help ensure that the amount of
             KE drink consumed remains below the single serving in the GRAS (generally regarded as
             safe) notice which the FDA has accepted.
