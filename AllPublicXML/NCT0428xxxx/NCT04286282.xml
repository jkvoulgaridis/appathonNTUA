      Determine if depression, which persists after depression treatment at 26 weeks, is associated
      with increased innate inflammation in a prospective cohort of HIV-infected Ugandans receiving
      SSRIs in which group psychotherapy is initiated.

    <textblock>
      Depression in HIV is a complex co-morbidity with both social factors such as stigma as well
      as biologic components. Disruptions in neurotransmitters such as serotonin and catecholamines
      are known to cause depression. Inflammation caused by diseases such as stroke, diabetes, and
      HIV is associated with higher rates of depression. HIV causes inflammation throughout the
      body, but since the virus can cross the blood-brain-barrier, HIV can replicate in and target
      the brain causing neuroinflammation which predisposes depression. However the pathophysiology
      of the role of inflammation in comorbid depression and HIV is poorly understood.

        1. Among depressed HIV-infected Ugandans, determine if the resolution of depression at 26
           weeks of HIV therapy is improved with group psychotherapy.

        2. In the same population determine if persistent depression is associated with higher
           levels of innate inflammation. Also, compare baseline and follow up inflammation among
           depressed compared to non-depressed control group.

        3. Evaluate if viral suppression levels at 26 weeks are improved by group psychotherapy.

    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 is a 9-item survey measuring degree of depression severity over the previous 2 weeks. Items assess how often the patient has been bothered by specific symptoms and are rated on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Total score is an unweighted sum of the 9 item scores, with higher scores indicating greater depression severity.</description>
