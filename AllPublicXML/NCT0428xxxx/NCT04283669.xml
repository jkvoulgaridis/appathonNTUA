      Subjects with Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) and progressive vestibular schwannoma (VS) will
      be treated with crizotinib administered orally. Crizotinib will be taken continuously until
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, in continuous treatment cycles of 28 days each,

      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, in continuous treatment cycles of 28 days each,
      for a maximum of 12 cycles. Clinical response will be assessed by MRI (volumetrics, primary
      objective) and audiology at the end of every 3rd cycle. Subjects with volumetric tumor
      progression will be taken off protocol. Patients who complete 12 cycles of treatment without
      disease progression, but within the following 24 weeks show subsequent disease progression
      (defined as &gt;20% increase in target tumor volume compared to off-treatment volume), will be
      eligible for re-treatment on study for up to 48 additional weeks, provided they still meet
      study eligibility criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be eligible
        for admission into the study.

        Patients currently receiving medical anticancer therapies or who have received medical
        anticancer therapies within 4 weeks of the start of study drug (including chemotherapy and
        molecular targeted agents), as these may interfere with the study drug

        Monoclonal antibody treatment and/or agents with prolonged half-lives: At least three
        half-lives must have elapsed from the last dose prior to enrollment

        Radiation therapy to a study target tumor within 1 year prior to enrollment, or any
        radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to enrollment, as these may interfere with our
        ability to assess response to study drug

        Prior treatment with any investigational drug within the preceding 4 weeks, as they may
        interfere with the study drug

        Unstable or rapidly progressive disease, including patients who require glucocorticoids for
        symptomatic control of brain or spinal tumors, as this would represent a high risk for
        inability to comply with the study requirements

        Use of drugs or foods that are known potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, including but not limited to
        ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, ritonavir, indinavir,
        nelfinavir, saquinavir, amprenavir, delavirdine, nefazodone, diltiazem, verapamil, and
        grapefruit juice, as this would interfere with study drug metabolism

        Use of drugs that are known potent CYP3A4 inducers, including but not limited to
        carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampin, tipranavir, ritonavir, and
        St. John's wort, as this would interfere with study drug metabolism

        Use of drugs that are CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic indices, including but not
        limited to pimozide, aripiprazole, triazolam, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, astemizole,
        cisapride, terfenadine and halofantrine, as this would interfere with study drug metabolism

        Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias of CTCAE grade ≥2, uncontrolled atrial fibrillation of any
        grade or prolonged QTc interval (&gt;480 msec), as patients with these conditions would be
        expected to have an increased risk for cardiac toxicity related to study drug

        Patients who have any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other conditions
        that could affect their participation in the study such as:

          -  symptomatic congestive heart failure of New York heart Association Class III or IV

          -  unstable angina pectoris, symptomatic congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction
             within 6 months of start of study drug, serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia or any
             other clinically significant cardiac disease

          -  severely impaired lung function as defined as spirometry and DLCO that is 50% of the
             normal predicted value and/or O2 saturation that is 90% or less at rest on room air

          -  active (acute or chronic) or uncontrolled severe infections liver disease, such as
             cirrhosis or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C)

        Impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may significantly
        alter the absorption of crizotinib (e.g., ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea,
        vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome or small bowel resection)

        Female patients who are pregnant or breast feeding, or adults of reproductive potential who
        are not using effective birth control methods. Adequate contraception must be used
        throughout the trial and for 90 days after the last dose of study drug, as the effects of
        crizotinib on an unborn fetus are not known. Females of childbearing potential must have a
        negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to administration of crizotinib.

        Male patients whose sexual partner(s) are women of child bearing potential, who are not
        willing to use adequate contraception during the study and for 90 days after the last dose
        of study drug.

        History of significant noncompliance to medical regimens that would jeopardize compliance
        with study therapy

        Patients unwilling to or unable to comply with the study protocol
