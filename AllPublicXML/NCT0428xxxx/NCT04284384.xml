  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This PhD project is part of a larger project on potentially modifiable risk factors for
      dementia in a life course perspective, with an overarching aim to improve prevention of
      dementia and thereby potentially relieve patient and caregiver distress and decrease societal
      load. The present PhD project will concentrate on confirming knowledge of HI as an
      independent risk factor for dementia and exploring potentially causative factors to explain
      this relationship.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite a huge increase in the knowledge about disease mechanisms in various types of
      dementia in recent years, no curative treatment exists at present. Results from research on
      disease-modifying agents have been disappointing. This has led to an increased interest in
      other ways to reduce the prevalence of dementia. A recent report estimated that up to one
      third of dementia cases could be delayed or prevented by interventions directed at the most
      common risk factors. In the &quot;Lancet commission on dementia prevention, treatment, and care&quot;,
      hearing impairment (HI) was identified as the potentially most important modifiable risk
      factor. Even though HI is considered an important modifiable risk factor, the evidence
      regarding the association between HI and dementia risk is still limited.

        HUNT2 and HUNT4 hearing studies: Participants from 17 of the 24 municipalities in the
        county were offered and accepted a hearing examination, consisting of pure-tone audiometry
        and two questionnaires on hearing issues, such as use of hearing aids, noise exposure, and
        tinnitus.

        HUNT4 70+/HUNT Trondheim 70+: All participants 70 years of age or older are invited to
        participate in HUNT4 70+ including cognitive screening examinations.
