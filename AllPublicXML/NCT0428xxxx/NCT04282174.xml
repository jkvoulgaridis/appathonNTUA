  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II trial testing disease-specific myeloablative conditioning regimens for
      preparatory cytoreduction of patients receiving allogeneic HLA-compatible related or
      unrelated transplants of GCSF-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) depleted of
      T-cells by positive selection of CD34+ progenitor cells using the CliniMACS system. The
      CliniMACS Fractionation system is a method that positively selects CD34+ progenitor cells
      from PBSC by immunoadsorption of cells binding on anti CD34 monoclonal antibody to
      paramagnetic beads, which can then be isolated by passage through a magnetized column and
      released by agitation of beads. Two conditioning regimens have been used successfully with an
      alternative similar system, isolex, which is no longer being manufactured.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For this trial, patients will be put into one of two myeloablative conditioning regimens,
      based on their disease, stage of disease, and dose of radiation accumulated in the course of
      treatment. Approximately twenty-four to forty-eight hours after completion of each
      conditioning regimen, patients will receive a transplant of a CD34+ progenitor cell-enriched,
      T-cell depleted fraction of GCSF-mobilized PBSC after fractionation on the CliniMACS device,
      from his/her HLA compatible donor. Due to stringent T-cell depletion, no significant
      Graft-versus-host disease is anticipated. Should Graft-versus-host disease occur, standard
      treatment would be initiated per the Transplant Service guidelines.

      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the potential of T-cell depleted Haploidentical Stem
      Cell Transplant fractionated by the CliniMACS system, when administered for disease targeted
      cytoreductive regimens, to secure consistent engraftment and hematopoietic reconstitution in
      HLA-compatible related or unrelated hosts, and to prevent or abrogate acute and chronic forms
      of Graft-versus-host disease. This study seeks to validate that these pre-transplant
      conditioning regimens, when administered with a CD34+ progenitor cell enriched, T-cell
      depleted graft, fractionated in the CliniMACS system, will be associated with a low incidence
      of non-leukemic mortality.

      The sample size is as follows:

      Regimen A: Hyperfractionated Total Body Irradiation/Thiotepa/Cyclophosphamide: 100 patients
      Regimen B: Busulfan/Melphalan/Fludarabine: 100 patients It is anticipated that the accrual
      will last five years. Patients will be followed for two years following transplantation.
