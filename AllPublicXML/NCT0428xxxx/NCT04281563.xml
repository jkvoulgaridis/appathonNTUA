      Aim: To explore the effect of medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil massage on growth in
      preterm infants.

      Methods: This randomized controlled trial was conducted in the newborn center of a regional
      hospital in Taiwan. Preterm infants weighing between 1500 and 2000 g were recruited and
      randomly assigned to three groups: the MCT oil massage, massage alone and no massage groups.
      The massages were given three times per day for 7 consecutive days. Weight, length and head
      circumference were measured in the three groups at birth and on study days 1 to 7.

    <description>Two trained nurse took turns performing standardized massage techniques in group 1 and group 2. The difference was that in group 1, the neonates received massage with MCT oil, and in group 2, the neonates received massage without using the oil. The 10-min massage intervention consisted of two 5-min phases: tactile and kinesthetic stimulation (13), which were given three times a day for 7 consecutive days. The massage force was approximately 300 grams, and the massager practiced applying the pressure by using a food scale. The massage was given in the prone and supine positions, and the actions included gentle touching of the head, back and limbs for five 1-min periods, followed by six passive flexion/extension movements lasting 10 s apiece for each arm, then each leg, and finally both legs together for a total of five 1-min periods. Premature infants in the oil massage group received massage with 10 mL/kg/day of MCT oil divided equally into three applications.</description>
