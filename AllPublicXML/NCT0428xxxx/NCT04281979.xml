  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although rates of cigarette use are declining, the proportion of nondaily smokers is rising,
      particularly among young adults. Among young adults, nondaily smoking is associated with
      negative health consequences and, for some, may lead to the establishment of life-long
      smoking patterns. The goal of this project is to understand the behavioral, psychological and
      neurobiological factors that contribute to cigarette use in nondaily smokers to aid the
      development of tailored evidence-based interventions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms associated with
      cigarette use in young nondaily smokers (ages 21-25). Nondaily smokers experience fewer
      symptoms of cigarette withdrawal than daily smokers; however, they still experience
      difficulty quitting. Since smoking cessation before the age of 30 substantially attenuates
      the long-term health consequences associated with smoking, understanding the factors that
      motivate cigarette use in young nondaily smokers and developing tailored interventions will
      be critical for curbing cigarette use and improving public health. The proposed project will
      use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine how other substances (e.g.
      stimulates, sedatives, or analgesics) impact brain function and will assess the extent to
      which substance-induced changes in brain function correlate with impulsive choice, cigarette
      craving, and craving regulation in young adults. Furthermore, the investigators will assess
      how substance-induced changes in brain function, impulsivity, craving, and capacity for
      craving regulation predict cigarette use over the course of 1 year.
