  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study in Part 1, is to evaluate (under fasted conditions) the plasma
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of padsevonil (PSL) using 4 PSL product variants against a PSL
      reference tablet and in Part 2, to evaluate the PK of PSL using a PSL reference tablet under
      fed and fasted conditions at 200 mg and 400 mg.

  <why_stopped>
    Based on available data, UCB has decided to stop development of padsevonil as adjunctive
    treatment of focal-onset seizures

    <intervention_model_description>In Part 1 a single oral dose of padsevonil 200 mg for the 4 different product variants and the padsevonil reference tablet will be administered to all subjects in the fasted state in a randomized 5-way crossover design. In order to explore the food interaction with padsevonil, in Part 2 a single oral dose of a padsevonil reference tablet at dose levels of 200 mg and 400 mg (2x 200mg tablets) will be administered to all subjects in the fasted and fed state in a randomized 4-way crossover study.</intervention_model_description>
