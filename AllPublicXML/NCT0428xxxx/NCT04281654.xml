  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this community‐engaged project is to examine how taking part in different arts
      (dance &amp; music), compared to control (no arts) affects older adults' Health‐Related Quality
      of Life (HRQoL using the Short Form‐20(SF) form), physical performance (Short Physical
      Performance Battery-SPPB), cognition (using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment-MoCA), social
      engagement (National Social Life, Health, &amp; Aging Project‐NSHAP survey), and perceptions of
      self (focus interviews).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this Randomized‐Controlled‐Trial, 60 adults (20/condition) will take part in 20, 45-minute
      sessions (ballroom dance, ukulele/guitar playing, or control- i.e. social conversation), 2
      times/week for 10 weeks.

      While the investigators know that arts participation improves function in older adults, exact
      effects of different arts programs on health outcomes remains unclear.

      The investigators plan to fill this gap by studying how different arts participation affect
      health outcomes.

      The overall aim is to study how arts engagement helps older adults remain active and
      influences physical, psychological, and emotional functioning.

    <measure>Change in Health Related Quality of Life using Short Form-20 (SF-20) survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre (Week 0), Post 1 (Week 10) and Post 2 (Week 15) Intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form (SF)-20 is a 20 question multi-dimensional survey, which measures 6 domains of health status: physical functioning (6 items), role functioning (2 items), social function (1 item), mental health (5 items), general health perceptions (5 items), and bodily pain (1 item). Scores for this instrument are coded and calibrated so that each of the six dimensions is equally weighted. Each score is transformed to a scale from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating better health status.</description>

    <measure>Change in Physical Performance using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre (Week 0), Post 1 (Week 10) and Post 2 (Week 15) Intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) is an assessment tool for evaluation of lower extremity functioning in older persons. In this tool, participants will perform the 3 SPPB components: 1) Ability to stand for 10 sec with feet in 3 different positions (together side-by-side, semi-tandem, and tandem), 2) Two timed trials of a 4-m walk (fastest recorded), and 3) Time to rise from a chair five times. The subtests are scored from 0-4. The overall SPPB is scored from 0 (Minimum) to 12 (Maximum score) with higher scores indicating better lower extremity function</description>

    <measure>Change in Social Connections using the Social Connections Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre (Week 0), Post 1 (Week 10) and Post 2 (Week 15) Intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants complete questions from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) measure perceived social connection and isolation. These questions ask participants about 1) Support from partner (we are using 3 of the 6 questions); 2) Support from family (we are using 3 of the 5 questions); 3) Support from friends (we are using 3 of the 5 questions). All questions are on a 4-point frequency range from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;often&quot;, except for 2 questions. Question #1 construct one is on a 7-point scale from &quot;very unhappy to &quot;very happy&quot; and question #5 construct two is on a 6-point scale from &quot;none&quot; to &quot;more than 20&quot;. The 7 items with the same frequency anchors will be summed; the other two items will be analyzed as one-item indicators.</description>

    <measure>Change in Cognition using Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre (Week 0), Post 1 (Week 10) and Post 2 (Week 15) Intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Montreal Cognition Assessment (MoCA) is a brief, 30-question test designed as a rapid screening instrument for mild cognitive dysfunction. It assesses different cognitive domains: attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. MoCA scores range between 0-30. A score of 26 or over is considered normal.</description>

    <description>In these interviews participants discuss how they self-perceive any physical, mental, and social changes they underwent as a result of taking part in the interventions</description>
