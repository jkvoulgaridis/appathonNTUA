  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study (CAIT: Community-based Adaptive Autism Intervention for Toddlers) aims to
      determine the most optimal sequence of interventions for improving the social- communicative,
      language and cognitive outcomes of toddlers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The target
      population consists of 2-3 year-old children with ASD who receive community based, publicly
      funded early intervention in two authentic educational settings in East Harlem and the Bronx,
      NY known as New York Center for Infants &amp; Toddlers (NYCIT). An expected 300 toddlers with ASD
      will participate with their community-recruited paraprofessional teaching assistants (TAs)
      and group leaders (GLs). The study aims to construct the most effective one-year, two-phase,
      adaptive intervention, in which intervention is individualized based on a child's initial
      response to intervention. Phase 1, from program entry to either 6 or 12 weeks (randomized),
      involves 60 minutes daily of an evidence based social communication intervention, JASPER
      (Joint Attention, Symbolic Play, Engagement &amp; Regulation) delivered 1-on-1 to the child by
      the trained TA. At end of Phase 1, response to intervention is rated by the GLs for slow or
      fast improvements of joint engagement (a core deficit in the early development of children
      with ASD, and a significant indicator of good progress toward improving social communication
      and language). In Phase 2 (to week 24), toddlers responding slowly are re-randomized to
      continue with JASPER for 60 minutes per day or augment treatment with direct, structured
      teaching of social communication targets for 30 minutes and JASPER for another 30 minutes per
      day. Toddlers responding quickly are given 30 minutes of JASPER and 30 minutes of jasPEER
      (JASPER with a peer) to further improve socialization and social communication.

      This study will use a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design to
      assess when to examine initial response to treatment, as well as whether and how best to
      augment the current first line, standard of care intervention for children demonstrating a
      slower response.

      First, at program entry, the investigators will assess all toddlers using both standardized
      and experimental assessments as they enroll in the NYCIT program. After entry assessments,
      the investigators will randomize each child with equal probability to early response
      assessment at either six weeks or 12 weeks (timing). This early response assessment will be
      used to determine whether children are considered fast or slow responders to treatment.
      Children who are considered early responders will receive a splitting of one on one TA-child
      JASPER and JasPEER (JASPER including another child peer). Children responding slowly to the
      initial intervention will be randomized to continue JASPER or to add structured teaching to
      their JASPER sessions. Approximately 300 toddlers (24-36 months) with a diagnosis of ASD, as
      confirmed by clinical evaluation records required for placement at the NYCIT will
      participate. Children will be assessed prior to intervention, immediately after Stage 1(early
      response) at either six or twelve weeks, exit Stage 2 intervention, and follow up.

      If teacher/paraprofessional withdraws from the study, all reasonable efforts will be made to
      place the child with another consenting teacher/paraprofessional. Based on the first two
      years of trials working with this center, no teacher withdrew mid study. However, a small
      number of teachers did change positions or took leave (e.g., maternity leave, move for job in
      another district). In these cases, the child was transferred to another consenting teacher.

      SMART Design:

      Initial Randomize to Stage 1 Treatment

      Stage 1: JASPER (6 weeks)

      Early Responders/Slow Responders determined

      Stage 2: JASPER + JasPEER (Early Responders only)-A

      Slow Responders randomized to Stage 2: Structured Teaching + JASPER -B or Stage 2: JASPER
      (Randomized for slow responders)-C A, B, and C options occur during the following 18 weeks

      Exit assessments and Follow up assessments at 3 months post exit

      Initial Randomized to Stage 1 Treatment

      Stage 1: JASPER (12 weeks)

      Early Responders/Slow Responders determined

      Stage 2: JASPER + JasPEER (Early Responders only)- D Slow Responders randomized to Stage 2:
      Structured Teaching + JASPER - E or Stage 2: JASPER (Randomized for slow responders)- F D, E,
      and F options occur during the following 12 weeks

    <intervention_name>JASPER</intervention_name>
    <description>JASPER is a developmentally anchored behavioral intervention that assumes that communication develops from social interactions in which specific social engagement strategies, symbolic representations, and early communication forms are modeled and naturally reinforced by the adult's responses to the child. The adult referred in this condition is the TA.</description>
