    <textblock>
      The current research is aimed at using Transcutaneous Spinal Direct Current Stimulation
      (tSDCS) as complementary therapeutic tool in the treatment of spasticity in multiple
      sclerosis. Patients will be randomized into two groups (tSDCS-anode vs. tSDCS-sham) according
      to the detailed protocol. Main outcome will be measured by the change in walking speed using
      the Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW).

      A total of 40 patients ought to be enrolled as specified in methodology. Secondary outcomes
      will assess functional improvement through Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS) Short Form
      - 36 (SF-36), Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and Ashworth scale.

    <textblock>
      Spasticity is experienced in around 80 % of patients with multiple sclerosis resulting in
      quality of life impairment. Transcranial direct current stimulation has been proven effective
      for the treatment of spasticity in patients with chronic stroke or cerebral palsy. The effect
      of transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tSDCS) has been applied in spasticity
      but not in patients with spasticity due to multiple sclerosis. The study aims to assess the
      efficacy of anodal tSDCS on spasticity in multiple sclerosis patients through several
      assessment tools. The investigators hypothesize that anodal tSDCS will reduce spasticity in
      multiple sclerosis patients.

      The study will be double blind sham-controlled crossover. The patients will be examined by
      the described assessment tools (T25FW, MSWS, SF-36, Ashworth, EDSS) before receiving tSDCS.
      The sessions of tSDCS will be applied 1 session per day in 5 consecutive days. Assessment
      using the scales and questionnaires will be performed at the end of the 5 days of
      stimulation, 1 week after the last day of first block of sessions and 2 weeks later. The
      group will be crossed and another block of 5 consecutive days of stimulation will follow.
      Assessment will take place again on first day and last day of the stimulations followed as
      well by assessment 1 week after the last day of second block of stimulation and 2 weeks
      after.

    <description>Anodal tSDCS will be administered through a pair of conductive rubber electrodes covered by saline soaked sponges (35 cm2). The current will be delivered continuously at 2 mA for 30 min through a battery-driven constant-current stimulator (designed by Sooma). The anode will be positioned over the spinal cord area at the level of the spinous processes of 10th-11th thoracic vertebra.</description>
