    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended Phase
      2 dose(RP2D),safety &amp; tolerability of BGB-10188: as monotherapy in participants with mature
      B-cell malignancies; oin combination with zanubrutinib in participants with
      relapse/refractory follicular lymphoma (R/R FL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) or diffuse large
      B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL); and in combination with tislelizumab in participants with advanced
      solid tumors.

               -  Part B: R/R FL, MCL, or DLBCL

               -  Part C: R/R FL, MCL, or DLBCL

          2. Patients with MZL, FL, MCL, or DLBCL must have at least one bi- dimensionally
             measurable nodal lesion &gt;1.5 cm in longest diameter or extranodal lesion that is &gt; 1cm
             in longest diameter by computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging
             (MRI), as defined by the Lugano Classification.

             Part D and E

          3. Part D: Histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable locally advanced or

             treatment is not available or not tolerated. Enrollment will be limited to patients
             with advanced solid tumors for which there is clinical evidence of response to T-cell
             based immuno-oncology agents (eg, anti PD-1, non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC], small
             cell lung cancer [SCLC], head and neck squamous cell cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma,
             gastric or gastroesophageal junction carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, renal cell

             approval.

          4. Part E: Patients with NSCLC or metastatic melanoma that has progressed from PD 1/PD-L1

        Part A, B and C

          1. History of allogeneic stem-cell transplantation in Part A, Part B, and Part C

             Part A, B, C, D and E

          2. Prior exposure to PI3K inhibitor.

          3. Any approved anticancer therapy, including hormonal therapy, or any investigational
             agent or participation in another clinical study with therapeutic intent within 14
             days before first dose.

          4. Treatment with systemic immune-stimulatory agents (including, but not limited to,
             interferons and interleukin-2) within 2 weeks or 5 half-lives of the drug, whichever
             is later, before first dose.

          5. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, or serologic status reflecting
             active viral hepatitis B (HBV) or viral hepatitis C (HCV) infection as follows:

               -  HBsAg (+), or

               -  HBcAb (+) and HBV DNA detected, or

               -  Presence of HCV antibody. Patients with presence of HCV antibody are eligible if
                  HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) is undetectable
