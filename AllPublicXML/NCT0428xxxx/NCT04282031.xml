    <textblock>
      BPI-1178 is a novel, orally administered inhibitor of both cyclin-dependent kinase 4（CDK4）and
      CDK6 kinase activity. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and
      pharmacokinetics of BPI-1178 in subjects with advanced solid tumor, as well as the subjects
      with advanced hormone receptor-positive(HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
      negative (HER2-) breast cancer.

    <textblock>
      This is a study which consists of phase １study（dose escalation stage) and phase 2a study
      (expansion stage)．

      Phase 1 study will adopt the classical 3+3 dose escalation design, exploring the safety and
      tolerance of 5 dose cohorts (25mg, 75mg, 150mg, 250mg and 400mg) in subjects with advanced
      solid tumor and determining the maximum tolerated dose of BPI-1178 for phase 2a study.

      Phase 2a is an expansion study in subjects of HR+/HER2- breast cancer using 3+3 design, to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of BPI-1178 in combination with endocrine therapy. Cohort A
      is BPI-1178 in combination with fulvestrant for advanced or recurrent HR+/HER2- breast cancer
      after failure or intolerance of first-line standard therapy. Cohort B is BPI-1178 in
      combination with letrozole for advanced or recurrent HR+/HER2- breast cancer as first-line
      treatment.

      Phase 1 and 2a consist of screening period (28 days before enrollment), treatment period and
      follow up period (every 3 months until death or the end of study). Subjects will receive
      BPI-1178 daily for 3 weeks, followed by 1 week-off treatment. Once the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is reached in phase 1, phase 2a study will explore the dose of BPI-1178 from MTD to
      MTD-1 and MTD-2 level in combination with fulvestrant or letrozole.

      Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be recorded for the single dose period of 7 days and the
      multiple dose period up to 28 days in phase 1 study, as well as 28 days after the first dose
      of BPI-1178 in phase 2a. Efficacy will be evaluated by RECIST v1.1 and the Response
      Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases (RANO-BM) every 2 months. Adverse events will
      be monitored throughout the trial. Other exploration of pharmacokinetic information will be
      assessed throughout the trial.
