  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Research study is being done to characterize the safety, tolerability, and preliminary
      antitumor activity of the NEXI-001 T cell product (a new experimental therapy), which
      contains populations of CD8+ T cells targeting multiple leukemia associated antigen peptides
      in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) who have
      relapsed disease after an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT).

      The study will enroll AML or MDS patients who have either Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) or
      relapsed disease after a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched allogeneic HCT. Patients who
      have had an HLA-mismatched or haploidentical allogeneic HCT will not be eligible to
      participate in this study. Eligible patients for this study must also have ≥ 50% T-cell
      chimerism from the original donor at the time study entry.

      The enrolled patients will undergo bridging therapy for the purposes of disease control while
      the NEXI-001 T cell product is being manufactured. Choice of bridging therapy administered
      will be per the Investigator's discretion, but is limited to acceptable agents as specified
      in the protocol. Bridging therapy will be administered prior to lymphodepleting (LD) therapy,
      with the last dose of the bridging therapy administered ≥ 14 days prior to initiation of LD
      therapy. Within 72 hours after completing LD therapy, patients will receive a single IV
      infusion of the NEXI-001 T cell product.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The NEXI-001 is an adoptive cellular therapy product which contains populations of
      antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. The antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in the NEXI-001 T cell
      product are derived from Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) obtained from the original
      stem cell donor. During the manufacturing process, these cells are primed and expanded ex
      vivo using nano-size artificial Antigen Presenting Cells (aAPC) loaded with five leukemia
      associated antigen peptides in combination with a proprietary T cell enrichment and expansion
      process.

      The NEXI-001 T cell product is restricted to patients that are HLA-A2.01 allele positive for
      this study.

      There are two parts to this study, a Safety Evaluation Phase and a Dose Expansion Phase. The
      Safety Evaluation Phase will determine the safety and tolerability of a single dose of
      NEXI-001 T cell product, and will consist of Dose Escalation at two dose levels - each with
      cohorts of three patients.

      When all three patients at Dose Level 1 have dosed and cleared the DLT period, three
      additional patients will be enrolled at Dose Level 2. When three patients have cleared the
      DLT period at the highest dose level, that dose will be advanced to the Dose Expansion Phase.
      The Dose Expansion Phase will enroll up to 16 additional patients to further define the
      safety and evaluate the initial anti-tumor efficacy of the NEXI- 001 T cell product at the
      dose established from the Safety Evaluation Phase.

      All patients will enter a Post-Treatment Follow-Up period after infusion of the NEXI- 001 T
      cell product. During this phase, all patients will be monitored for AEs and followed for
      anti-leukemia response until the end of study visit is complete (up to one year).

      Additional assessments for safety, disease status, and other secondary and exploratory
      endpoints will also be monitored during the follow-up period.

      All patients will be followed for overall survival (OS) from time of disease progression
      until the last visit of the last patient. During this time, patients will be followed via
      telephone or other electronic contact at 12 week intervals for monitoring of OS.
