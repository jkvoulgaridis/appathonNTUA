  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While advancements in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) have improved image quality, it is
      unclear how these improvements are connected to the clinical evaluation of individuals with
      cardiovascular disease. The aim of this large prospective registry revolves around 4 key
      principles: 1) utilize CMR to gain additional pathophysiologic insights into cardiovascular
      disease, 2) understand how CMR compares to alternative cardiovascular diagnostic modalities,
      3) determine how CMR affects clinical management decisions, and 4) establish a link between
      CMR findings and long term prognosis in patients with known or suspected cardiovascular
      disease. The ultimate aim is to utilize CMR to improve patient outcomes.

      CMR techniques to be studies include function, fibrosis, and flow. Focus areas include
      valvular heart disease, ischemic heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and vascular disease.

      Patient Population, Recruitment, and Consent:

      Patients presenting to the Houston Methodist DeBakey CMR Laboratory will be enrolled from
      April 2008 to April 2038. It is expected that up to 100,000 patients may be enrolled during
      this period.

      Subjects will be identified based on their referral to the Houston Methodist DeBakey CMR
      Laboratory for MRI studies during the proposed study period.

      After enrollment, a registered nurse or physician will perform a thorough structured patient
      interview and/or review of electronic health records to document baseline medical history
      including cardiac risk factors, symptoms, medication usage, and prior procedure history. A
      small blood sample will be drawn and stored for future biomarker and/or genetic testing
      analysis. Annual follow up for clinical status will be performed via review of electronic
      health records; structured telephone interviews with the patients, relatives, and/or their
      health care providers; and/or the social security death index database.
