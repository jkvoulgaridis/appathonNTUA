  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, vehicle controlled, double-blind, repeat dose comparative study in
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) under management with DMARDs and with persistent
      disease activity. The goal of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of 6 weekly repeat doses of ORTD-1.

    <measure>Immunogenicity by measurement of anti-drug antibodies</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 3, 5, and 10</time_frame>
    <description>Immunogenicity is the measurement of anti-drug (ORTD-1) antibodies (ADA) in serum. ADA samples will be analyzed from the change in baseline (Visit 1) using descriptive statistics (mean, median, range and standard deviation).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serum concentration of ORTD-1 from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Serum concentration will be measured from the change in baseline (Visit 1) using descriptive statistics (mean, median, range and standard deviation).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cmax of ORTD-1</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 through week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Cmax (maximum plasma concentration) will be measured using the arithmetic mean, standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV) (%), median, minimum, and maximum.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tmax of ORTD-1</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 through week 6</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in disease activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 3, 5, and 10</time_frame>
    <description>Disease activity score with C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) and ESR (Erythrocyte sedimentation rate) will be evaluated from the change in baseline (Visit 1) to Visit 9 (last patient visit). 28 joints are evaluated in the DAS28-CRP (Proximal interphalangeal, metacarpophalangeal, wrists, elbows, shoulders, knees) for swelling and tenderness. The overall calculated value for DAS28-CRP uses the number of swollen and tender joints, the value recorded from the patient's CRP, and the Global Health patient assessment (0-100 mm; where 0 is very good and 100 is very bad health condition).</description>
