  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an adapted telehealth-based, health
      and wellness lifestyle program (POWERS-TBI) on promoting healthy lifestyle behaviors and
      improving self-efficacy for healthy activities such as amount of physical activity,
      dietary/food intake, mental stimulation and activity, substance use,
      mindfulness/spirituality, social relationships, and/or leisure activities among persons with
      TBI and their caregivers. The treatment program will be delivered via the internet, along
      with ongoing telephone health coaching calls designed to motivate, problem-solve challenges,
      reinforce skills learned, and prevent relapse. The goals are to evaluate the impact of the
      treatment program on improving health outcomes for people with TBI. The investigators plan to
      accomplish this by evaluating the impact of the program using a case-control crossover
      design.
