  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common chronic systemic autoimmune relapsing disease
      characterized by joint inflammation. Beside arthritis leading to progressive joint damage and
      loss of function, RA is also associated to extraarticular inflammatory conditions such as
      interstitial lung disease (ILD). This one develops in 30% of all RA patients with a median
      survival expectancy of 3 to 10 years once symptomatic. Unfortunately, there is no medical
      care recommendation so far as the pathophysiology is unknown. However, ILD share many
      similarities with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

      Autotaxin (ATX), due to its lysophospholipase activity, produces a bioactive lipid,
      lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) under inflammation. LPA has pleiotropic actions inducing cell
      proliferation, survival, motility and differentiation. Increased ATX and LPA levels have been
      detected in synovial fluid of RA patients and in IPF patients. ATX is also currently the
      target for a phase 3 clinical trial in IPF.

      Given the previous described role of ATX/LPA axis in arthritis and inflammation-induced bone
      loss in RA and the similarities between RA-ILD and IPF, the investigators hypothesized that
      ATX/LPA axis may be also an attractive drug target for this pulmonary condition in RA and
      therefore that ATX and LPA may be increased in sputum from RA patients with ILD in comparison
      with sputum from RA patients without ILD.

          -  Patient with RA with ACPA in the state phase, meeting ACR / EULAR 2010 criteria

          -  For female subjects:

               -  Likely to procreate: negative pregnancy test at the inclusion visit and use of an
                  effective method of contraception (hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine devices,
                  vasectomized partner, abstinence) started at least 1 month before inclusion and
                  continued during the entire study.
