  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The key purpose of this study is to understand the effectiveness of blue light phototherapy
      in reducing the bacterial population number within infected diabetic wounds, as well as
      determining how this reduction in bacterial number can improve the rate of healing of
      diabetic wounds. Our lab has recently discovered that a specific survival protein common in
      most types of bacteria can be destroyed through blue light exposure. We believe that the
      destruction of this protein through blue light phototherapy can improve the effectiveness of
      antimicrobial wound dressings commonly used to treat infected diabetic wounds, therefore
      further reducing the amount of bacteria within the wound area and increasing the rate of
      healing. In addition to measuring the changes in bacteria number and wound size reduction
      induced by the phototherapy treatment, this study is also intended to demonstrate the
      viability of using pulsed light laser for phototherapy treatments. Our lab group has found
      that pulsed light is able to destroy bacterial proteins more effectively then simple
      light-emitting diode (LED) light systems, and we hope to us this study to establish the
      potential usage of pulsed light for future phototherapy treatments.

    <description>Bacterial swabs will be collected from each subject's wound before and after weekly debridement. These weekly bacterial swabs, in addition to the homogenized debrided tissue, will be used to assess a patient's overall bacterial burden and bacterial population. Overall bacterial counts and population within each sample will be determined through the use of colony-forming unit (CFU) counting on agar plates or bacterial sequencing.</description>

    <description>Participants will have their diabetic wounds imaged and measured on a week-to-week basis, determining the changes in wound area and cellulitis afflicted area.</description>

    <description>An investigator developed questionnaires will be completed each week by the participants that asks questions about their overall satisfaction with the treatment regimen and whether changes will need to be made to the phototherapy treatment procedure to ensure a better patient experience.</description>

    <description>Subjects enrolled in the subject group will receive standard care treatment for infected diabetic wounds, including debridement surgery and wound dressings. However, in order to maintain consistency with the phototherapy arm, subjects within the control group will visit the clinic twice a week, with the first visit being for the debridement surgery, and the second visit being for clinical wound dressing redressing.</description>

    <description>For this intervention therapy, subjects enrolled in the experimental group will still receive standard care treatment for infected diabetic wounds. However, experiment group subjects will receive phototherapy treatments alongside standard care. A mobile pulsed laser device will be utilized to apply nanosecond pulsed 410 nm light onto both the cellulitis afflicted regions and open wound portions of a patient's infected diabetic ulcer wound twice a week over the course of the 3 month study. The device will be designed and produced by the Ji Xin Cheng Lab located at the Boston University Charles River Campus. Phototherapy sessions will occur twice a week, with the first session occurring after debridement surgery, and the second session occurring later in the week during clinical wound dressing redressing.</description>

    <description>The key intervention aspect of this study is the application of 15 J/cm2 of 410 nm pulsed light directly onto the infected diabetic wounds of subjects every week over the course of 3 months, allowing for the cumulative exposure of around 180 J/cm2 for the entire study. This 15 J/cm2 weekly dosage of blue light will split up into two sessions every week, with each session applying 7.5 J/cm2 of light treatment. Phototherapy will be applied twice per week, with one phototherapy session occurring directly following the debridement surgery during the first visit of the week and the other session occurring after the study clinician removes the subjects wound dressings at the second visit.</description>

    <description>All patients enrolled in the study will undergo standard care and treatment for infected diabetic wounds, which includes the weekly surgical removal of infected necrotic tissue from the diabetic wounds. In addition to debridement, both groups will utilize an antimicrobial wound dressing to cover and treat the infected diabetic wound. The subject's wounds will be dressed with Aquacel Ag Advantage Wound Dressings to protect and treat their diabetic wounds. These dressings will be changed twice a week by clinicians.</description>
