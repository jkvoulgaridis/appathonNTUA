  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      African Americans are twice as likely to have type 2 diabetes as non-Hispanic Whites and are
      less likely to engage in effective diabetes self-management. There is a critical need for
      intensive lifestyle interventions that address the distress inherent in having the disease
      and the unique stressors faced by African Americans that may worsen diabetes-related health
      outcomes. Our program, Resilience-Based Diabetes Self-Management Education, integrates
      resilience resources with diabetes self-management skills to enable African-American patients
      to manage the daily demands of the disease and improve long-term adherence to healthy
      lifestyle choices, thereby reducing the negative health burden of diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) costs the U.S. $327 billion annually, representing a 26%
      increase from 2012 to 2017. African Americans (AAs) are twice as likely to have T2DM as
      non-Hispanic Whites, have worse health outcomes, and are less likely to engage in
      self-management behaviors. Interventions addressing these disparities are urgently needed.
      Among AAs, T2DM-associated stress is often compounded by general life stress, which further
      constrains diabetes self-management and is associated with poor glucose control (A1C) and
      complications such as depression. The impact of stress on diabetes self-management and health
      outcomes may be attenuated by resilience: a resolve to succeed despite adversities. Even with
      evidence supporting resilience resources benefiting other health outcomes, there is a dearth
      of evidence-based T2DM resilience interventions. Building on our promising pilot work, this
      study uses our culturally tailored, theory-derived Resilience-Based Diabetes Self-Management
      Education (RB-DSME) intervention to help participants manage the psychosocial and behavioral
      demands of the disease. The study is designed as a 24-month, 2-arm, cluster randomized
      clinical trial and involves assigning AA churches to the RB-DSME or a standard DSME
      condition. Both groups receive a 10-month intervention: 8 weekly educational sessions,
      followed by 8 bimonthly support group sessions, followed by 2 booster sessions. To
      investigate the efficacy of RB-DSME, we compare RB-DSME to DSME on T2DM physical and mental
      health outcomes. To inform more targeted future interventions, we examine indirect effects of
      RB-DSME (vs DSME) on resilience resources, such as stress and coping. We also examine
      indirect effects of resilience resources on T2DM health outcomes through self-management
      behaviors, such as diet and exercise.

      The specific aims of the study are:

      Aim 1: To compare T2DM physical health outcomes (primary outcome: A1C) and T2DM mental health
      outcomes (primary outcome: depressive symptoms) in the RB-DSME group vs DSME group at 3, 6,
      12, and 24 months.

      H1: Compared with DSME, RB-DSME will have improved T2DM physical health outcomes.

      H2: Compared with DSME, RB-DSME will have improved T2DM mental health outcomes.

      Aim 2: To test indirect effects of RB-DSME (vs DSME) on T2DM physical and mental health
      outcomes via resilience resources, self-management behaviors, and HPA axis function.

      H3: RB-DSME (vs DSME) will improve resilience resources at 3, 6, and 12 months, which will
      improve T2DM physical and mental health outcomes at 6, 12, and 24 months.

      H4: RB-DSME (vs DSME) driven improvements in resilience resources at 3 and 6 months will
      improve self-management and HPA axis function at 6 and 12 months, which will improve T2DM
      outcomes at 12 and 24 months.

      The project will provide crucial guidance for addressing the T2DM burden among AAs by
      establishing the efficacy of the RB-DSME and identifying behavioral and biological mechanisms
      by which the program affects T2DM health outcomes. The long-term goal is to enable AAs to
      effectively manage T2DM and thus avoid its serious consequences, via RB-DSME interventions in
      a range of community settings.

    <intervention_model_description>The primary goal of the project is to test the efficacy of a resilience-based diabetes self-management education intervention (RB-DSME) using a longitudinal, randomized control group design. Thirty-two AA churches are randomly assigned to the RB-DSME experimental group or a standard diabetes self-management education (DSME) control group, run in 8 cohorts over a 5-year period. Each cohort includes 4 churches (2 intervention, 2 control) with 10 participants in each group, run concurrently. Experimental and control groups participate in 8 weekly 2-hour classes, followed by 8 bimonthly (every other week) 2-hour support group sessions, followed by 2 every other month 2-hour booster sessions. Data are collected at baseline and also at 3, 6, and 12 months post study entry; the specific diabetes-related outcomes are also measured at 24 months.</intervention_model_description>

All accelerometer data are immediately downloaded and wear time assessed. If the participant does not have at least 4 days with ≥8 hours of wear time, the accelerometer is re-issued to the participant. The following data from all acceptable days are available: minutes and percent time spent in light physical activity, moderate to vigorous physical activity, and sedentary behavior.

    <description>During the group sessions led by professional nurses, participants are provided information and group activities to enable them to more effectively manage their personal diabetes challenges. During the support group sessions, participants discuss personal challenges and solutions to diabetes self-management, using a more informal approach. Booster sessions are held to refresh participants' understanding of how resilience resources can sustain self-management behaviors and maintain improved T2DM health outcomes. The RB-DSME also incorporates cultural characteristics and preferences of African Americans (AAs), to include:
the location in community-based church settings,
recognition of cultural dietary preferences, and
emphasis on cultural/historical significance of resilience in AAs.</description>
