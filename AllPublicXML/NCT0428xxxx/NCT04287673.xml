  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gait abnormalities, which occur in Cerebral Palsy (CP), are characterized usually by a
      toe-to-floor or a plantar-to-floor initial contact (equinus gait), followed by an early
      braking of the tibia's forward progression (during ankle dorsiflexion). This causes
      consequently a trunk deceleration. Moreover, children with CP have difficulties to stabilize
      the trunk and the head in the space, and that could have impact on gait. If equinus gait is
      often attributed to the triceps surae spasticity, recent works suggest rather that this early
      braking of the dorsiflexion could be a motor adaptation to axial postural control
      difficulties. This thesis project aims firstly to attest that locomotor disorders are related
      to these difficulties in the stabilization of the axial body segments in children with CP
      and, secondly, to show that improving the trunk and head postural control with a specific
      rehabilitation protocol could reduce the early braking of the dorsiflexion and, consequently,
      the gait abnormalities observed in CP.
