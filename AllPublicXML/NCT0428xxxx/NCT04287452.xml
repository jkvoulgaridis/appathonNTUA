  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior literature demonstrates that human stress can be reduced with exposure to animals. This
      study challenges current dogma by introducing a widely available, low cost method of dog
      therapy to reduce patient and provider stress. The objectives of this study are to determine
      if interaction with a certified therapy dog and handler can;

        -  decrease reported anxiety levels in emergency department (ED) patients,

        -  decrease salivary cortisol in ED patients,

        -  decrease total morphine equivalent dosing in the emergency department or at discharge
           and/or,

        -  decrease reported stress levels in emergency department providers caring for
           participating patients

      when compared to usual care.
