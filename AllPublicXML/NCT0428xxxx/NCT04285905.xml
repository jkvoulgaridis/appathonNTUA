  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the mPATCH-TB Study is to identify potentially cost-effective, feasible
      and scalable interventions that could increase rates of completion of screening for
      tuberculosis and HIV among male partners of women attending primary health care in Blantyre,
      Malawi.

      Eligible women who consent to participate - and who have a primary male partner with cough at
      home -will be randomly allocated, by day of clinic attendance, into a standard of care group
      or one of up to four intervention groups. They will be asked to identify their primary male
      partner and will be offered interventions according to their allocated group.

      The primary outcome will compare the proportion of primary male partner that complete TB
      screening (defined as receipt of result of a sputum Xpert or smear result) within 14 days of
      recruitment in each intervention group compared to the enhanced standard of care group.
