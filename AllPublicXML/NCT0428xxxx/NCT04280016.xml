  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to establish the effect of adding exercise to off-loading interventions on
      the healing time for people with diabetes mellitus and a foot ulcer. Hypothesis: Consistent
      with the literature, results are expected to resemble the accelerated healing seen when older
      adults exercised in the presence of wounds.

      The purpose of this project is to establish the effect of the addition of exercise to an
      off-loading intervention on the healing time for people with diabetes mellitus and a foot
      ulcer.

      While benefits of physical activity and exercise are clear, the benefit of exercise on wound
      healing in individuals with diabetes has not been elucidated. It is critical to better
      understand how prescribed exercise effects the healing speed in patients receiving wound care
      with appropriate off-loading. If exercise does decrease healing time, the benefit to the
      patient may include lower cost, decreased risk of infection, decreased burden on a caregiver,
      and improved quality of life.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Wound measurement size</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurements of wound will be taken up to 12 weeks or until wound closure occurs, whichever is first.</time_frame>
    <description>Charts will be reviewed for normal wound measurements as is part of standard care. Measurements are expected to be reported as surface area (cm^2) and/or volume (cm^3). Wound closure will be defined as epithelialization across the entire wound bed and would be expected to correlate to no surface area or volume of wound being reported.</description>

    <measure>Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurement will be taken at baseline and at end of study (at 12 weeks or at wound closure, whichever occurs first).</time_frame>
    <description>Participation in exercise. Using two questions, this scale measures the number of days that an individual reports doing physical activity (question 1) or specific exercise (question 2). Scores on each question could range from 0 to 7 days. The higher the number, the more days the individual participates in the activity or exercise.</description>

    <description>Vibration sense will be measured using a Bio-Thesiometer to assess for degree of peripheral neuropathy. A higher score would indicate decreased sensory perception of vibration.</description>

    <description>Participants in this arm will participate in exercise at the healthcare facility one time a week (away from where wound care is provided) and be instructed in a home exercise program that they will be encouraged to perform at least three days per week with no more than two days between sessions. Wound care will continue at the facility as is standard, utilizing off-loading.</description>

    <intervention_name>Exercise</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will participate in an exercise session with non-weight-bearing exercise that the participant is able to perform with off-loading (e.g. total contact cast) intact. They will also be instructed in a home exercise program so that exercise can be performed three days per week with no more than two days between sessions. These participants will also receive standard wound care with off-loading.</description>
