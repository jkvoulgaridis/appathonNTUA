  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral Palsy (CP) is the most common motor dysfunction in childhood. Traditionally,
      diagnosis is set between 12 and 24 months of age. This study will evaluate feasibility of a
      new screening procedure for early detection of CP in high-risk infants and investigate how
      such a procedure can be implemented in the Central Norwegian Regional Health Authority
      (CNRHA).

      The most accurate method to detect and predict CP at an early age is the General Movement
      Assessment (GMA). GMA is based upon expert observations of infant spontaneous movements in a
      video. In Central-Norway such expertise is today only present at St. Olavs Hospital,
      Trondheim University Hospital. Video recordings by health personnel and parents will be used
      in follow-up programs within CNRHA for remote expert based GMA. In addition, machine learning
      models will be applied for automatic detection of CP.

      Early identification of CP will lead to improved function and increased possibility to direct
      health care resources to the patients who need it most, independent of geographical and
      expert based constraints.

        High-risk infants referred to high-risk follow-up at discharge from one of the
        participating Neonatal Intensive Care Units, are candidates for enrollment. Following
        review of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible subjects will be invited to
        participate. All subjects (parents) must give written informed consent prior to any study
        procedures being carried out.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  hospitalized at a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) within the Central Norway
             Regional Health Authority that is referred to follow-up in the Specialist Health
             Services containing a team of minimum a pediatrician and a physiotherapist.

          -  at high-risk for adverse neurological outcomes as considered by the pediatrician on
             the basis of clinical judgement (example: serious asphyxia, prematurity, stroke, brain
             hemorrhage)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Peripheral neuromotor disease e.g. brachial plexus injury

          -  iatrogenic restricted movements (e.g. cast for clubfoot)
