    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of remedial cognitive intervention using
      The Functional Brain Trainer VR (FBT, Intendo Â©) to improve cognitive functioning,
      participation in daily life occupations, and functional capacity in the field of IADL among
      people with affective disorders receiving inpatient and daycare mental-health services.

      This study is an experimental study, in a pre-post design with a control group, the sampling
      is convenience. The study will include 40 people aged 18-60 with a diagnosis of Affective
      disorder based on DSM-5.

      Inclusion criteria: age 18-60, Diagnosis of Major Depression or Bipolar disorder based on
      DSM-5; Mood stabilizing medication for at least 2 weeks, Exclusion criteria: Neurological
      disorders and neurodevelopmental conditions in addition to mental health diagnosis; Physical
      disability in addition to mental health conditions; Psychotic state; active substance abuse;
      custodian.

      They will be recruited from active inpatient and daycare wards of the &quot;Geha Mental Health
      Center&quot;, Israel and will be randomly allocated into two groups: experimental and control. An
      experimental group will attend 6 VR based cognitive remediation sessions of 30 minutes for
      training response inhibition, self-initiation, cognitive flexibility, sustained attention,
      divided attention, working memory, planning, persistence. The control group will complete 6
      sessions of 30 minutes of low-tech (paper and pencil tasks) remedial training of the same
      cognitive components. These in addition to routine care. The evaluation for symptoms
      severity, cognition, functional capacity and participation in daily life activities will be
      conducted at the beginning of the study and after about 4 weeks.

    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire for assessment of participation in daily life activities: number of participated activities (from 1 to 52, the higher number indicates higher number of participated activities) and frequency of the participation (range from 1 indicates low frequency of participation up to 7 - higher frequency of the participation)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Examination cognitive components of attention language, spatial skills, memory, calculations and reasoning. The score range for different sub-tests from 1 up to 4, 6, 8 or 12, with higher score indicates better cognitive functioning</description>
