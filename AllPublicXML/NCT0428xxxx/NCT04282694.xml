  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project from the University Hospital of Parma (AOUPR) aims to verify the feasibility of
      a prevention program in our district, relying on advanced technological resources and highly
      experienced team in lung cancer early diagnosis, in order to identify useful elements towards
      the applicability of such a prevention program on a large scale (regional, national).

      Uncontrolled, monocentric experimental study with dynamic enrollment and prospective data
      collection, aimed at implementing a prevention program based on scientific evidence. This
      study is set to verify the applicability and feasibility of a lung cancer prevention program
      in a real context, including a preliminary evaluation at the smoking cessation clinic and a
      LDCT assessment with subsequent LDCT follow-up for participants who show indeterminate
      findings at the first LDCT (LDCT baseline) exam.

      The main objective of the study is to verify the feasibility of a lung cancer prevention
      program according to internationally validated scientific methods.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To evaluate the use of local smoking cessation clinics and their effects in terms of
           smoking cessation (primary prevention)

        2. To evaluate the outcomes of the program in terms of number of patients with early
           (presymptomatic) lung cancer treated with minimally invasive surgery (secondary
           prevention)

        3. To evaluate the number of false positives and their diagnostic work-up (PET-CT,
           CT-guided biopsy, bronchoscopy)

      Primary endpoint:

      - Percentage of enrolled subjects to whom the program was offered within 60 days from the
      date of enrolment and percentage of those who stop smoking for at least 12 months

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  To describe the organizational model, human resources employed, difficulties encountered
           and elements that have favoured its realization

        -  To measure the variation in smoking habits in enrolled smokers

        -  To describe the effect of annual LDCT on lung cancer diagnosis rates, considering size,
           shape, histology and site

        -  To measure the consequent demand for further diagnostic investigations and treatment

        -  To measure the number of false positives

      Subjects at high risk of lung cancer screened by the medical team of the AOUPR or by GPs to
      join the prevention program.

      Inclusion criteria

        -  Age between 50 and 75 years

        -  Equivalent tobacco intoxication of ≥ 15 cigarettes per day for ≥25 years or ≥ 10
           cigarettes per day for ≥30 years

        -  Status of current smoker or ex-smoker for &lt;10 years.

      Exclusion criteria

      • Personal history of cancer within the prior 5 years

      We expect to recruit around 500 people in 1 year. This sample size is considered adequate
      based on the available resources, both human and economic.

      After closing and adjusting the database and before data analysis, a document called
      Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be drawn up. It will consist of the following
      paragraphs:

        -  Statistical methods planned in the study protocol;

        -  Size of the sample;

        -  Management of missing data;

        -  Evaluation of the endpoints;

        -  Statistical models that will be applied in the analysis. The socio-demographic
           characteristics of the enrolled subjects, the adopted organizational methods and the
           effects of the prevention program (endpoints) will be analyzed and described using
           tables and figures.

      The project &quot;PRogetto Salute Parma: Primary and secondary prevention of smoking-related lung
      cancer&quot; will be started once approved by the institutional Ethics Committee and authorized by
      the General Manager. The study is expected to be carried out over 2 years (from the inclusion
      of the first subject), with an expected period of 1 year for the enrolment and 1 further year
      for follow-up.
