  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, multicenter, non-randomized, single-arm Clinical trial aims to evaluate the
      safety and effectiveness of the use of paclitaxel-coated arteriovenous graft (AVG) on the
      inner wall of ePTFE graft, which is designed to reduce neointimal hyperplasia that causes
      stenosis and thrombosis after implantation of AVG.
