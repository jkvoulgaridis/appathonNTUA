  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting this research study to better understand how individuals
      with bipolar disorder regulate their emotions, and if transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
      can help improve emotion regulation for individuals with bipolar mood disorders.

      The objective of this study protocol is to test whether intermittent theta-burst transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (iTBS-TMS) to ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) can improve
      performance on emotion regulation tasks in patients with bipolar disorder. Individual VLPFC
      sites for stimulation will be identified through baseline, pre-TMS (Phase 1) functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans, collected during performance on implicit and
      explicit emotion regulation tasks. An additional dataset will be acquired in a cohort of
      healthy controls, in order to establish a normative sample from which to compare patient
      data.

      Data from individual patients will be analyzed to detect specific VLPFC subregions showing
      activation deviations from healthy controls. Patient-specific VLPFC subregions showing
      greater than two standard deviations from healthy controls will be used as individualized
      target sites for TMS stimulation. Patients will be randomized to receive low-dose iTBS-TMS
      (600 pulses), high-dose iTBS-TMS (1800 pulses), or sham TMS (Phase 2). Post-TMS fMRI scans
      will be acquired during performance on identical implicit and explicit emotion regulation
      tasks from baseline. Effects of iTBS-TMS on emotion regulation will be evaluated by comparing
      pre-TMS versus post-TMS behavior, neural activation, and functional connectivity patterns
      during performance on implicit and explicit emotion regulation tasks.

    <measure>Multisource Interference Task with International Affective Pictures Set (MSIT-IAPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Post-Treatment (1-3 Days)</time_frame>
    <description>The MSIT-IAPS task is a well-validated fMRI task designed to assess the effects of emotional distractors on cognitive control. During each trial, a three-digit number is presented. Each set contains two identical distractor numbers and a target number that differed from the distractors. Participants report via a button press the identity of the target number that differs from the two distractor numbers. Noninterference (control) trials: distractor numbers are always zeros, and the identity of the target number always corresponds to its position on the button response pad (100, 020, 003). Interference trials: distractor numbers are always numbers other than 0, and the identity of the target number is always incongruent with its position on the button response pad (e.g. 211, 232, 331, etc.). Each trial of the MSIT is overlaid on a negative, positive, or neutral IAPS image. Reaction time (ms) and accuracy (% correct) is calculated for each trial.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive Reappraisal Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Post-Treatment (1-3 Days)</time_frame>
    <description>The Cognitive Reappraisal task is a well-validated fMRI task designed to assess explicit emotion regulation. Participants are presented with photographs selected from the International Affective Picture Scale depicting either distressing or neutral scenes. Participants are then presented with instructions to either &quot;attend&quot; or simply view the photographs, or &quot;reappraise,&quot; in which participants ascribe a new, neutral or more positive meaning to the stimuli. They are then instructed to rate their current level of distress. Task metrics are ratings of distress on a scale from 1 (no distress) to 4 (extreme distress).</description>

    <description>TMS is a non-invasive tool for modulating patterns of brain activation and circuit connectivity. It uses electromagnetic pulses to induce electric currents over the cortex that serve to depolarize or hyperpolarize neurons, thereby changing patterns of synaptic activity. This study will use intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS), an efficient TMS protocol that uses high frequency (50Hz) triplets of TMS given every 200 milliseconds (i.e. at 5 Hz).</description>
