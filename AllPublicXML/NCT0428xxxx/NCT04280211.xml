      . The main question is whether the vestibular system is affected by COPD. If there is an
      influence, the second question is what is the relationship between balance and vestibular
      interaction in COPD patients. A total of 10 COPD patients and 10 healthy adults will include
      the study. Respiratory functions, vestibular functions and postural stability of participants
      will be assessed. This research is planned to be carried out as a cross-sectional/descriptive
      research. It's planned as a pilot study. Comparisons between study and control groups will be
      made with independent samples t-test for parametric values and Mann Whitney U for
      non-parametric values.

      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder (COPD) is a common preventable and treatable disease
      that is characterized by persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive and
      associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the airways and the lung to
      noxious particles or gases. Hypoxia caused by restrictive airflow is one of the symptoms of
      COPD. Hypoxia can affect the inner ear and vestibular nuclei. Also, balance impairment can be
      caused by hypoxia. Previous studies show that balance affected negatively in COPD patients.
      The aim of this study is to investigate of vestibular system influence in individuals with
      COPD. A total of 10 COPD patients and 10 healthy adults will include the study. This research
      is planned to be carried out as a cross-sectional/descriptive research. It's planned as a
      pilot study. Respiratory functions (respiratory function test), vestibular functions (head
      shake test, head trust test, unterberger test) and postural stability (sensory organization
      test) of participants will be assessed.Comparisons between study and control groups will be
      made with independent samples t-test for parametric values and Mann Whitney U for
      non-parametric values.

    <description>Head Shake Test:The head shake test is performed by shaking the head of the patient. The head is rotated at a comfortable range at a frequency of about 2 to 3 Hertz for 10- to 15 seconds. After shaking, the head remains in the center and the eyes of the patient are observed for nystagmus. The head shake test is used to look for signs of dynamic imbalance of vestibular function by evaluating the post-shaking nystagmus.</description>

Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)
Spirometry is the term given to the basic lung function -volume, time and flow- tests that measure the air that is expired and inspired. Spirometry is objective and noninvasive.
Before performing the forced expiration, tidal (normal) breaths can be taken first, then a deep breath taken in while still using the mouthpiece, followed by a further quick, full inspiration.</description>
