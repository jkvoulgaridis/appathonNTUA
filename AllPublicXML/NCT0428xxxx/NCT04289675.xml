  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chitinase 3-like 1 (Chi3L1) is a Human protein synthetized by inflammatory cells. Its serum
      level increases in case of autoimmune diseases, and especially during multiple sclerosis
      (MS). There is a need for biological markers predictive of treatment efficacy. MS outcomes
      one year from treatment initiation are predictive of long-term treatment efficacy. The
      hypothesis is that serum Chi3L1 level before treatment initiation could predict one year MS
      outcomes.

      Primary objective: to show an association between the serum Chi3L1 level at diagnostic
      assessment and the clinical and radiological efficacy one year from initiation of the first
      disease modifying treatment (interferon beta, dimethyl fumarate or teriflunomide) in
      relapsing-onset multiple sclerosis (MS).

      Secondary objectives: to determine the threshold value of the serum Chi3L1 level predicting
      the efficacy of treatment, and the added value of other potential biomarkers in cerebrospinal
      fluid collected at diagnostic assessment: Chi3L1, light chains of neurofilaments and
      interleukin 6.
