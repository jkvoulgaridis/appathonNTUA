  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PUFAs (poly-unsaturated fatty acids) represent a component of lipids that covers a relevant
      role in human diet and biological functions such as provision of energy, functionality of
      cell membranes and tissue metabolism. Fatty acids carbon chains can be saturated (with no
      presence of double bonds) or unsaturated (with one or more double bonds). PUFAs fall into the
      unsaturated group, and they can be divided into two classes: omega-3 (n-3) and omega-6 (n-6)
      fatty acids (FAs). PUFAs are relevant components of cellular membranes, phospholipids, and
      precursors of eicosanoids, which influence neuronal development and functioning, DHA
      (docosahexaenoic acid) and AA (arachidonic acid) in fact are involved in cell growth, neural
      signaling, and gene expression. The main natural dietary source for EPA and DHA is fish oil.
      It has also been shown how the Magnocellular system, which includes the retinal ganglion
      cells, the lateral geniculate nucleus (for the visual system, while the medial geniculate
      nucleus would be involved for the auditory system) of the thalamus, the posterior parietal
      cortex, various areas visual of the cortex and part of the cerebellum, is sensitive to the
      contribution of fatty acids through nutrition. A deficit related to the Magnocellular system,
      specialized in the processing of stimuli with high temporal frequencies and low spatial
      frequencies, in both the visual and auditory modalities, has been proposed as one of the
      causes of Developmental Dyslexia. According to this hypothesis, an alteration at the
      magnocellular level would affect reading by hampering temporal processing of the visual
      signal and would reduce the quality of the phonological representations due to imperfect
      acoustic analysis of the incoming phonemes. It is therefore possible to hypothesize that
      supplementation of PUFA in dyslexic children would improve the functions of the M-system and
      thus create better conditions to the remediation of reading difficulties, especially through
      remediation programs specifically tapping visual attention and rapid processing of visual
      stimuli. The remediation program currently used at IRCCS Medea, Tachidino, based on
      tachistoscopic, hemisphere-specific stimulation and on training of selective visual-spatial
      attention, has exactly these characteristics.

      Hence, the present study aims to test the efficacy of PUFA supplementation before and during
      treatment with Tachidino.
