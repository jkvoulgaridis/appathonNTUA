  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poststroke depression is seen with a frequency of up to 30%. Drug options for depression and
      accompanying sleep problems are limited; In addition, effective doses cannot be increased
      depending on the comorbidities of the patients and the side effect profiles and drug
      interactions of the drugs used. Acupuncture has been used in Chinese traditional medicine for
      more than 2000 years and there are findings that it has positive effects in post-stroke
      depression and anxiety disorders.

      The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness and reliability of acupuncture
      treatment in depression and anxiety disorders developing after stroke and to reduce the need
      for multiple drugs and / or high-dose medication in the treatment of these complications.

      The hypothesis of the study: Acupuncture is an effective and reliable treatment method for
      depression and anxiety disorders in stroke patients.

      Patients who receive inpatient stroke rehabilitation at SBU Istanbul Physical Therapy and
      Rehabilitation SUAM, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinic, will be included in the
      study considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Their consent will be received.
      Participants who volunteered for the study will be separated into the study group and control
      groups by stratified randomization. Initially, clinical and demographic data of all patients
      will be noted and Mini-Mental State Examination will be performed. Patients in the study
      group will be treated with acupuncture on the hemiplegic side's DU 20, EX HN 3 points and
      bilateral LR 3, LI 4 points twice a week for 4 weeks. During the application, the feeling of
      De Qi will be taken and the application will take 20 minutes. The control group will continue
      to receive inpatient stroke rehabilitation and no interventional procedures will be made.
      Measurements; Hamliton Depression and Hamilton Anxiety Scales, Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index,
      Barthel Index and change in psychiatric drug use will be assesed at baseline (week 0), week 4
      and 8 weeks post-treatment. The adverse events observed during the study will be noted and
      the compliance of patients to therapy in each application will be questioned by VAS.
