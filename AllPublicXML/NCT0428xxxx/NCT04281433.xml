    <description>Before cavity preparation and restoration, masticatory muscles activity will be evaluated by using electromyography. An electromyography detects the electrical potential generated by muscle cells. A total of 40 posterior teeth will be selected for this study and grouped into 2 main groups (20 for each group)) according to presence of caries in one or both side in patient (unilateral or bilateral). Split mouth technique will be used. The affected teeth will be treated by removing the caries and restored tooth with bulk fill composite material, after restoring the affected teeth. Masticatory muscles activity will be evaluated by using electromyography to detect any changes in masticatory muscles activity before and after restoration.</description>
