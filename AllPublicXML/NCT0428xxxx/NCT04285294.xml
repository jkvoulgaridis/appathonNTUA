  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a hereditary skin disease characterized
      by cutaneous and mucosa fragility. Blister formations and erosions, resulting in chronic
      wounds and dystrophic scars, lead development of aggressive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma
      (cSCC) in young subjects. cSCC in RDEB patients are often recurrent and sometimes aggressive.
      Although fibrotic and inflammatory microenvironment plays an important role in the tumoral
      process, specific mechanisms in cSCC of RDEB patients are still unknown. Actually, the only
      treatment is a wide surgical excision with poor prognostic (80% of death after the first
      occurrence of cSCC).

      The objective of the study is to describe the molecular signatures in the cSCC in RDEB
      patients
