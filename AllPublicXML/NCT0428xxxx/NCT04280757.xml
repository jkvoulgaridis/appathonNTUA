      As Pre Implantation Genetic Screening (PGS) becomes now a replacement modality and trend
      gaining popularity among physicians and patients on claiming its ability to settle on the
      simplest genetically normal embryo,so it had been logical to review if taking cells from the
      embryo in its early development will or won't affect its growth as compared to the previous
      standard technique of ICSI and in comparison to a normally conceived embryos the study also
      will question if the parameters of the prenatal biochemical standard parameters will have any
      differences if the embryo is already genetically tested embryo and compare these parameters
      with non PGS embryos and normally conceived embryos.

      The women will be included in the study after pregnancy confirmation by ultrasound at week 6
      of gestation either by normal pregnancy or ICSI. For women in their 1st trimester of
      pregnancy, early ultrasound assessment will be done. Measurement of yolk sac diameter (YS)
      and mean sac diameter (MSD) from 6 to 8 weeks ,crown-rump length (CRL), ductus venosus (DV),
      nuchal translucency (NT), presence of nasal bone and uterine artery Doppler and assessment of
      the existence of tricuspid regurge (TR) from 10 to 12 weeks. Combined tests will be done
      between 11weeks - 13 weeks+6 days (PAPP-A and free beta HCG). For women in their 2nd
      trimester of pregnancy, tests done will include the triple test (α-fetoprotein, free β HCG,
      and E3) will be done at 14 to 20 week .Routine anomaly scan , uterine artery doppler, middle
      cerebral artery Doppler, umbilical artery doppler and fetal ponderal index which is the
      inverse ratio of estimated foetal weight in grams to the third power of the femur length at
      weeks (20 to 24).. For women in their 3rd trimester of pregnancy, routine ultrasound
      assessment of fetal growth will be done including measurement of fetal ponderal index.at
      32,34 and 36 weeks of gestation.
