      of movement with the support of the spouse / partner is the birth dance.

      dance is started in the active phase of the first phase of the labor and continues until the
      end of the first phase. The woman is given the opportunity to act rhythmically with a
      relaxing light music with someone she prefers (spouse / partner, mother, midwife, etc.). The
      hands of the pregnant woman dance in the form of swinging from left to right, on the shoulder
      of his wife, with music; The partner is massaged by the sacrum area. It is aimed to increase
      the effectiveness of the method applied by adding spouse / partner support, upright posture
      and massage in addition to the music and body movements that dance includes, and also to
      provide emotional support to the woman. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the effect of

      the doctor and midwife responsible for the pregnancy during the tram, and the researcher will
      not be involved in tram follow-up of the pregnant woman (cervical dilation, pediatric heart
      sound, contraction follow-up, vital signs of the pregnant woman).
