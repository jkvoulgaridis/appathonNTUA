    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to translate, cross-cultural adapt and validate the Norwegian VISA-G
      (VISA-N-G) questionnaire. The study will test the psychometric properties for the VISA-N-G in
      terms of test-retest reliability, internal consistency, construct validity and
      responsiveness.

      The Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Gluteal Questionnaire (VISA-G) questionnaire have
      already been developed and used as a measurement tool in research on English speaking Greater
      trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) populations.

      The aim of this study is to translate, cross-cultural adapt and validate the Norwegian VISA-G
      (VISA-N-G) questionnaire.

      The translation of the original VISA-G into Norwegian has been done following the official
      guidelines.

      The patients will be recruited from the outpatient clinic at the Department of Physical
      Medicine and Rehabilitation, Oslo University Hospital and will follow the ordinary patient
      care.

      After given written consent, patients will be asked to fill out the following Norwegian
      questionnaires: VISA-N-G, Harris Hip Score (HHS), Oswestry disability index (ODI) and a
      numeric rating scale (NRS) for assessment of pain intensity. The aforementioned
      questionnaires will be used to test the construct validity with various hypothesis at
      baseline. Within one week the investigators will ask the patients to fill out the VISA-N-G
      once more to test the test-retest reliability.

      To investigate responsiveness the patient will be asked to fill out the VISA-N-G together
      With HHS, ODI, NRS and a 11-Point Global Rating of Change scale (GROC) after seven weeks.
      Responsiveness will be tested with various hypothesis and measured by the area under the
      receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC).

    <description>The Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Gluteal Questionnaire (VISA-G) questionnaire have already been developed and used as a measurement tool in research on English speaking GTPS populations.The VISA-G questionnaire is based on other Health-related patient-reported outcomes (HR-PROs) from Victorian Institute of Sports tendon study Group. The investigators will test the construct validity with two other HR-PROs (Harris Hip Score and Oswestry disability index). To investigate test-retest reliability, the patients will fill out a second VISA-N-G one week after baseline. To test responsiveness, the patients will fill out VISA-N-G 7 weeks after baseline together with the two other HR-PROs, and a Global Rating of Change scale.</description>

    <measure>Harris Hip Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Harris Hip Score (HHS) is an HR-PROs questionnaire used for assessing outcome after total hip replacement, femoral neck fractures and osteoarthritis. It is expected to take 5 minutes to complete and is based on 10 items. It is scored from 0 to 100, where 100 is the best outcome, &lt;70 is considered a poor result. HHS has shown to be a responsive measure and shows a strong correlation in the physical domain of The short form Health survey (SF36) and high correlation to the Nottingham Health Profile.</description>

    <measure>Oswestry disability index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Oswestry disability index (ODI) is a widely used HR-PROs used for spinal disorders. Its asking about the patients perceived disability and is scored from 0 to 100%, where 0% indicates no disability and 100% indicates most disability. ODI is cross-cultural adapted into Norwegian and psychometric properties was concluded acceptable for assessing self-reported functional status of Norwegian-speaking patients with low back pain.</description>

    <measure>Numeric rating scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In a Numeric rating scale (NRS) the patients rate their pain intensity between 0 and 10. Zero represents &quot;no pain at all&quot; and 10 represents &quot;the worst pain ever possible&quot;. NRS correlates highly to other pain assessment tools. A change of two points is detected as being clinically significant. In this project the investigator will ask for the patient's current pain, average pain the last week, worst pain last week, and least pain last week.</description>

    <measure>Global Rating of Change scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A Global Rating of Change scale (GROC) scale is designed to quantify a patient's improvement or worsening over time, the scale ask about the current and previous health status and then calculates the difference. The scale is &quot;global&quot; and allows the patient themselves to subjectively decide their health status. Scales between 7 and 11 seems to be the compromise between patient preference, adequate discriminative ability and test-retest reliability. The investigator will use an 11-point scale from - 5 to 5 where - 5 = worsening, 0 = unchanged and 5 = completely recovered. An 11-point scale has shown test-retest reliability with ICC 0.90, minimum detectable change of 0.45 points and minimally clinically important change 2 points.</description>

        Rehabilitation through a primary contact in the primary health care i.e. medical doctors,
        manual therapists or chiropractors, or from other doctors within the specialist healthcare
        settings for example a rheumatologists or orthopaedic surgeons. The investigators will
