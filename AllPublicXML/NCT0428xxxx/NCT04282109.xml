  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy for recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is palliative
      and usually platinum based, and the patients often present with poor physical condition.
      Consequently, many of them are not able to withstand a platinum-based chemotherapy. The
      addition of taxanes to the armamentarium of drugs improve the outcome in this group of
      patients. An alternative and better tolerated regimen for these patients is paclitaxel in
      combination with cetuximab, included the in guidelines of the Spanish Society of Medical
      Oncology.

      Recently, new treatments such as immune-checkpoint inhibitors have shown promising activity
      and good tolerability in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell
      carcinoma and has been included in the recently published guidelines from the Society for
      Immunotherapy of Cancer. Nivolumab (anti-PD1) has been approved for patients progressing on
      or after platinum-based therapy, as it clearly impacts on overall survival.

      This randomized phase II study will evaluate the efficacy of nivolumab plus paclitaxel for
      first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic HNSCC in the platinum ineligible and platinum
      refractory settings. Control arm will be paclitaxel in combination with cetuximab, treatment
      included in the guidelines of the Spanish Society of Medical Oncology.
