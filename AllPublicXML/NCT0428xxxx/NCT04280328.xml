  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b open-label study of CPI-444, an oral, small molecule inhibitor targeting
      adenosine-2A receptors (A2AR), on safety/tolerability and efficacy as a single agent and in
      combination with daratumumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD38, in relapsed or refractory
      multiple myeloma.
