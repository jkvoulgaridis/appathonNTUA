    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, observational study designed to explore the regulatory mechanism of
      palbociclib correlative pathways in therapeutic process of breast cancer, employing next
      generation sequencing (NGS) on DNA and RNA. This study also monitor the clonal evolution of
      genes by tracing the ctDNA.

    <description>100 cases of patients with ER+, HER2- breast cancer, experienced resistance after first line endocrinotherapy, will be assigned participants into treatment regimen, including palbociclib combined with fulvestrant.
FFPE blocks/sections or fresh tumor tissues/biopsies will be obtained from the hospitals on the points before administration and since resistance appearance. The tissue will be sequenced by a pan-cancer DNA panel (500+ genes) and whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS).
5-10 ml peripheral blood will be collected from each patient on the points before administration, 1 month after treatment, every subsequent visit and resistance appearance. The liquid biopsy will be sequenced by a pan-cancer ctDNA panel (300+ genes).
The genomic characteristics of patients received resistance will be analyzed. The relevant pathway mechanisms will be identified.</description>
