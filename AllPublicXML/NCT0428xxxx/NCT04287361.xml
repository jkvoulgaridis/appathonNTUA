      •Background: Intravenous clonazepam is the most widely used first-line benzodiazepine in
      Europe for the initial management of status epilepticus in children.

      The guidelines of the &quot;Société de reanimation de langue francaise&quot; (SRLF) and the &quot;société
      française de médecine d'urgence&quot; (SFMU) published in 2018 recommend an initial loading dose
      of 0.015 mg / kg of clonazepam in this situation (maximum 1.5 mg).

      To our knowledge, there is no specific study of the efficacy of clonazepam according to the
      dose used.

      Objective: To compare the effectiveness of the initial loading dose of clonazepam in children
      treated for status epilepticus

      •Methods: Monocentric retrospective study including children &lt; 16 years who have benefited
      from an initial loading dose of clonazepam in the context of status epilepticus treated at
      the Montpellier University Hospital between January 2016 and June 2019.

      The investigators collected data from medical records (clinic, treatment , evolution) and
      compared these according to the dosage of clonazepam used.

      •Discussion: Among the benzodiazepines used in the first-line treatment of pediatric status
      epileptic, lorazepam and midazolam are the most widely used drugs in the world.

      Lorazepam is not so much used in Europe because the injectable form is not available for a
      daily use. Conversely, clonazepam is used in a large number of European countries but is
      rarely used in the United States due to the lack of an injectable form.

      About the tolerance of treatment, except overdose situations, clonazepam is a drug well
      tolerated in the pediatric populatin. The main side effects of clonazepam are respiratory
      depression and impaired alertness.

      To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the efficacy depending on the initial
      loading dosage of clonazepam in children status epilepticus.
