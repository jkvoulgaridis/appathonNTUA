  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing stem cell transplantation for the first time will be entered.
      Participants will be randomized to one of two study arms: Arm 1: intervention (routine care+
      inhalation aromatherapy); Arm 2: Control (Routine care) Hypotheses: (1) Patients receiving
      inhalation aromatherapy will experience less severe nausea and less frequent vomiting
      episodes than those receiving only routine care; and (2) patients receiving inhalation
      aromatherapy will demonstrate lower anxiety levels just after AHSCT than those receiving only
      routine care.

      Earlier research indicates that aromatherapy is promising to relieve in DMSO related nausea
      and anxiety in autologous stem cell transplant patients. The current study seeks to confirm
      and extend these findings in a 2-arm, open-label randomized, controlled study of 70 cancer
      patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation. All patients will receive a
      standardized premedication. Arm 1: Intervention (inhalation aromatherapy with orange
      essential oil during stem cell infusion); Arm 2: Control (routine care). The researchers
      hypothesize that inhalation aromatherapy with orange essential oil will be effective in
      reducing DMSO related nausea and vomiting and demonstrate lower anxiety levels just after
      autologous stem cell transplantation.
