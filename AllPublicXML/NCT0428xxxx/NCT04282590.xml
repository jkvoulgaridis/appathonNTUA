  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is:

      • to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple oral (twice daily [BID]) doses of TRK-750
      in oxaliplatin-treated colorectal cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced peripheral
      neuropathy (CIPN).

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  to assess the efficacy of multiple oral (BID) doses of TRK-750 in reducing neuropathic
           symptoms, improving quality of life (QoL), and clinician-reported outcomes in
           oxaliplatin-treated colorectal cancer patients with CIPN.

        -  to study the relationship between plasma concentrations of TRK-750 and safety and
           efficacy variables in oxaliplatin-treated colorectal cancer patients with CIPN.

      The exploratory objective of this study is:

      • to assess the efficacy of multiple oral (BID) doses of TRK-750 on pharmacodynamic (PD)
      biomarker(s) in blood, psychophysical, electrophysiological, and histological parameters of
      neuropathy in oxaliplatin-treated colorectal cancer patients with CIPN.

         16. Use of any medication in the absence of appropriate washout periods that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, may influence the result of the study, or the patient's

         19. Plans to change current medications or any other intervention intended to treat or
             relieve CIPN signs or symptoms from Screening to end of study.
