  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effects of niraparib in those who have received neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy and subsequent interval debulking surgery, with or without hyperthermic
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy, and would also explore if there are any biomarkers, other than
      BRCA / HRD status and platinum sensitivity, that may help to identify those who may benefit
      from PARPi especially those who are HRD negative.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy, about 70% of patients with
      advanced ovarian cancer recur in the first 2 - 3 years. PARPi has been shown to be prolong
      survival in primary advanced ovarian cancer. However its role in neoadjuvant setting has not
      been fully evaluated.

             endometrioid, FIGO stage 3 or 4, ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal
             carcinoma before the start of NACT.

          3. Patients must have received 3 - 4 cycles of NACT containing either carboplatin or
             cisplatin, IDS with or without HIPEC, and 3 - 6 more cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy,
             prior to recruitment into the study.

          4. The patients should have only one cytoreductive surgery.

          5. The patients must show either complete (CR) or partial response (PR) to the
             platinum-based chemotherapy using RECIST 1.1 criteria.

          6. Patients should not be amenable to further surgery or radiotherapy except for the
             purpose of symptomatic relief.

          7. All surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy should finish more than 3 weeks prior to
