      study a quadruplet-based regimen with Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) 10-5 negative rate as
      primary end point in patients with early Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma.

      Therapeutic study, phase II, prospective, multicenter, open-label. The patients will be
      treated until progression. Each cycle of treatment lasts 28 days. Cycle 1 to 13 : treatment
      phase After cycle 13 : maintenance phase
