    <description>-Successful completion of the study imaging component will be defined as: (1) patient remains on scanner for at least 60 minutes of dynamic PET imaging and (2) automated scanner software is able to successfully generate valid parametric maps (requires at least three consecutive whole-body PET acquisitions without substantial motion between acquisitions).</description>

    <ipd_description>The investigators may share your images with other researchers. They may be doing research in areas similar to this research or in other unrelated areas. These researchers may be at Washington University, at other research centers and institutions, or industry sponsors of research. The investigators may also share your research data with large data repositories (a repository is a database of information) for broad sharing with the research community. If the individual research data is placed in one of these repositories only qualified researchers, who have received prior approval from individuals that monitor the use of the data, will be able to look at the information.</ipd_description>
