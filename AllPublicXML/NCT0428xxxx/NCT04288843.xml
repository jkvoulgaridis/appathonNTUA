  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the correlation between cycle day determination by clinical signs, study
      participant testimony, endometrium histopathology biopsy and ex-vivo imaging of the uterus
      endometrium.

  <detailed_description>

      In order to assess the efficacy of using ex-vivo endometrial imaging to determine optimal
      time for embryo transfer, two to four separate analyses, including imaging, and the current
      standard method of endometrial dating (ultrasound, histological and blood tests) will be
      performed as well as participant's testimony. Dating by hormonal profile (blood tests) will
      be contingent on availability of the tests for each subject. So shall be the ultrasound test.
      During the analysis data will be acquired for subsequent correlation analysis. In addition, a
      parallel in-vivo analysis, similar in methodology to the ex-vivo analysis, may be performed
      via imaging by hysteroscopy.

        The study will include up to 200 women between the ages of 18 - 40, to be recruited from
        the general population and medical center patient population, after determination that they
        are suited to the study according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and after having
        given informed consent to participate in the study.

        The sample size of the study will be determined such that adequate mapping of the 24 days
        of the menstrual cycle (putting more weight on luteal phase), excluding menstruation days
        (assuming a 28 day cycle), and dividing of the cohort into subgroups by age, can be
        achieved using the study methods described below, while adhering to financial constraints.
