      Critical to patient recovery, and can contribute to faster patient mobilization, shorter
      hospital stays and reduced health care costs. The administration of local anesthetics via
      wound infiltration is standard of care and an effective practice for post surgical pain
      management, However this method only provides relatively brief analgesia, usually lasting
      only 12 hours. Other FDA approved delivery systems using an indwelling fusion pump catheter
      (On-Q pump) are currently being used in our practice and may be used to extend the duration
      of action of locally administered analgesia by continuously infusing anesthetic into the
      wound. Alternatively, a depot form of bupivacaine has been FDA approved and currently used to
      deliver a single dose administered via wound infiltration for prolonged analgesia by allowing
      for the diffusion of the drug over an extended period of time. Both of these products are
      used as a standard practice during DIEP free flap reconstructions. However, no studies
      compare the efficacy of these two methods patients undergong unilateral DIEP flap
      reconstructions has been done in a prospective, randomized control manner.
