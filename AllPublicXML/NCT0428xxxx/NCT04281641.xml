  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to explore the markers in early prediction of the efficacy of pre-operative
      pertuzumab plus trastuzumab (PH) combined with chemotherapy for early stage or locally
      advanced human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) positive primary breast cancer.

      This study is to evaluate the correlation between early changes in multiple markers and
      pathological complete response in breast and lyphm nodes (tpCR) in patients with
      HER2-positive breast cancer receiving carboplatin, docetaxel and trastuzumab plus pertuzumab
      (TCHP) pre-operatively. The markers would be examined by gene expression assays,
      fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET), 68 Ga-Affibody HER-2 Imaging
      PET, and organoid drug sensitivity test. Approximately 94 patients were treated with PH-based
      neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery, and would complete 1 year of PH-based regimen in the
      adjuvant setting. The primary endpoint is the percent change of SUVmax from baseline to Day
      15 (after the first cycle of anti HER-2 targeting drug treatment) on FDG PET and HER-2
      imagining PET in correlation with pathological complete response (pCR) in patients treated
      with preoperative pertuzumab and trastuzumab. pCR was defined as no viable invasive cancer in
      breast and axilla by local pathology review.
