      Goal: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of low-level laser (LLL) after
      surgical removal of impacted lower third molars (ILTM), including pain level, postoperative
      facial swelling, trismus and non-stimulated saliva secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA).

    <description>Mark indelibly on the skin of points used to record the preoperative swelling level based on benchmarks A, B, C, D. A was the external canthus of the eye, B was the Gonion, C was the lip-commissure and D was the lowest point of the earlobe. The degree of face swelling was determined by using measuring tape (rounded to the nearest millimeter line): vertically from the external canthus of the eye to the Gonion (segment AB) and horizontally: from earlobe to the lip-commissure (CD segment). To evaluate generally face swelling, we computed the swelling area (mm2) approximately by the formula AB*CD/2</description>

    <description>Firstly, the saliva sample was centrifuged for 10 minutes, speed 3000 rpm, at 40 degrees Celsius. After eliminating oral mucosa cells, red blood cells, the 500 µl of the sample solution was added 5 µl proteolytic inhibitor to avoid cleavage of the sIgA antibodies in the sample to be investigated. The sample was vibrated with a vortex vibrator for 20 seconds and stored in -80°C. After collecting enough samples, the samples were performed the Elisa sandwich procedure according to the standard instructions of Kit Elisa Elabscience Human Secretory IgA (Elabscience Biotechnology, Houston, Texas, US) using Elisa IRE 96 SFRI Kit reader 450nm (SFRI, Saint-Jean-d'Illac, France)</description>

    <description>Subsequently to the suture, laser was applied in the right or left side randomly on each patient, according to a sheet of randomization. GaAlAs laser (AMD Picasso, Dentsply Sirona, York, Pennsylvania, USA) with a wavelength of 810 nm was placed intraorally, at a distance of 1 cm in the position of the extracted tooth socket and circling in a 2 cm - diameter area. The power applied was 0.5 ± 20% W, continuously for 30 s. The total real energy released was 12.8 J and the real energy density applied was 4 J/cm2.</description>
