  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hearing impairment is common in older adults, and recent research points to associations
      between hearing impairment and balance/mobility. The association may be due to more
      attentional resources being used to compensate for the sensory loss, with less resources
      available for maintaining balance. The aim of this projects is therefore to investigate
      whether an exercise program with focus on motor-cognitive tasks is feasible for older adults
      with hearing impairment. The study is meant as a proof-of-concept study, where trialling will
      be evaluated, and results will be used to inform the design of a larger and adequately
      powered study.

      Study design:

      This is an experimental (exercise) study with follow-ups three and twelve months after
      exercise completion.

      Participants:

      Participants will be recruited from two instances:

        -  &quot;Praksisnett&quot;, which is a collaboration between GPs and researchers in Bergen, Norway,
           where GPs recruit potential participants to research projects.

        -  The Ear, Nose, Throat department at Haukeland University Hospital (Bergen), who provide
           service to older adults with hearing impairment. The aim is to include 60 patients into
           three intervention arms: i) virtual reality exercises, ii) vestibular rehabilitation
           exercises and usual care

      Intervention arms:

        -  Virtual reality exercises: Participants will exercise in virtual environments twice
           weekly. The choice of environments/tasks will be individualized, and progress from
           sitting/standing exercises, to doing exercises while walking on a treadmill. The aim is
           to perform cognitive and motor tasks simultanously.

        -  Vestibular rehabilitation exercises: This is an exercise approach that has been used in
           clinical groups, such as patients with vestibular disorders and traumatic brain injury.
           The aim is to perform movements/exercises where the participant is exposed gradually to
           movements that may be provocative for the vestibular system.

      The exercises will be done in a movement lab at Western Norway University of Applied
      Sciences. Participants will be randomised to either of the three intervention arms using a
      computerized procedure. Neither participants, testers or deliverers of the intervention will
      be blinded. Testers and intervention deliverers will be physiotherapists, students enrolled
      in a master program in clinical physiotherapy and bachelor students in physiotherapy.

    <description>Participants will do exercises in a virtual environment, solving tasks that require cognitive efforts and motor/balance efforts. The virtual environment/tasks will be delivered through a head-mounted display (&quot;goggles&quot;). Difficulty will progress from standing/sitting, to walking on a treadmill. The environments that will be used will be both over-the-counter environments, as well as in-house designed environments.</description>

    <description>Vestibular rehabilitation exercises focus on head and eyes movements, as well as whole-body movements. The aim is to facilitate the use of other sensory organs than the vestibular organs, which will also be relevant to persons who are not receiving sufficient sensory information from the auditory system. The exercises will progress as tolerated, under careful supervision of trained therapists.</description>
