  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using mixed methods and triangulating multiples sources of data collected over the course of
      the parent and ancillary studies, to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, sustainability
      and impact of the ED-initiated BUP clinical program and implementation facilitation strategy
      and identify factors influencing diffusion and effectiveness.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ancillary study will use mixed-methods combining quantitative and qualitative inquiry
      (interview/focus group and field notes) with administrative and health record data with some
      analyses including data collected from the parent CTN-0079 study. CTN-0079-A1 is planned to
      be conducted at the same three sites of the parent study. Many of the methods, operating
      procedures, measures and forms will be retained or adapted from the parent study. However,
      CTN-0079-A1 is a new study in which lessons learned through the parent study have informed
      important design modifications necessary to improve study rigor and utility.
