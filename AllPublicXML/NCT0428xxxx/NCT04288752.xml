      This Clinical Investigation (CI03) is designed to validate the efficacy of the VR101
      lubricating Intravaginal Ring (IVR) as a personal lubricant device. In the proposed clinical
      investigation, participants will be randomized into two groups for the study, VR101 Active
      Ring and Inactive Ring. Participants will use VR101 active rings or inactive rings for 28
      days in a randomized, double-blind, parallel group design. The study also includes an
      optional two-week open-label extension with active rings, and a one-week follow-up.

      BACKGROUND This study will look at the use of a study device that is intended to provide
      moisture and lubrication to enhance the ease and comfort of intimate sexual activity and
      supplement the body's natural lubrication. To date, regarding human clinical testing, the
      study device has been tested and evaluated in a human study with 72 female subjects and
      another study with 21 female subjects.

      The purpose of this research study is to assess how safe and effective the study device (a
      vaginal ring referred to as VR101) is at providing personal lubrication. The study will
      compare the effectiveness of VR101 active ring compared to VR101 inactive ring, to enhance
      the ease and comfort of intimate sexual activity and supplement the body's natural
      lubrication. This is a research study to test a new investigational device. An
      investigational device is one that is not approved by the United States Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA). The study device is in the form of a clear, flexible ring that is
      placed in the vagina. Each ring is about 2 inches in diameter, or across the ring, from one
      side to the other.

      During the study, participants will receive either the VR101 active ring or a ring that looks
      exactly like the VR101 ring but is inactive. For the purposes of this document, both VR101
      active ring and the inactive ring will be referred to as the study ring, or study device.

      Because this is a research study, study rings will be given to participants only during this
      study and must only be used according to the schedule that will be described by study staff.
      Participants will not be allowed to use them once the study is complete.

      The results will be reported in a submission to the FDA to determine if the VR101 study
      device can be legally marketed in the United States.

      PROCEDURES

      Before any study-related tests and procedures are performed all subjects will read, sign, and
      date the consent document. Information will be collected after the consent document is signed
      and dated to determine eligibility to enroll in the study. This information includes
      demographic background, health, medical and social history, birth control method, prescribed
      medications, herbal or over the-counter drugs, use nonprescription drugs and alcohol. Women
      who are able to become pregnant will provide a urine sample for a pregnancy test. Potentially
      eligible subjects will complete the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) to assess sexual
      function in women who are sexually active. If all inclusion and exclusion criteria are
      satisfied, subjects will be enrolled and randomly assigned to the VR101 Active Ring or
      Inactive Ring treatment arm of the study.

      About 160 female subjects will participate in this study. Upon meeting all
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, subjects will be randomized (1:1) to one of the two treatment
      arms and given a 4 week supply of the randomly assigned study devices. They will be
      instructed on how to use the ring and how to replace the ring weekly. During the 4-week
      treatment period, subjects will receive weekly phone calls to ensure compliance and collect
      information about sexual activity, ring replacement, and experience with the device. At the
      end of four weeks, each subject will return to the study site to complete the final study
      measures. They will return all unused study devices and undergo a urine sample pregnancy test
      if appropriate. They will complete the (FSFI) to assess the effects of the study device on
      sexual function after 4 weeks, and any changes to medications and health will be documented.
      At that time all subjects will be given the option of receiving an additional 2 weeks of the
      active VR101 study device.

    <masking_description>The trial will be double-blind, meaning the subject and Investigator/staff will not have access to or knowledge of the subject's treatment assignment. Further, since the Sponsor will securely maintain the randomization schedules, the Sponsor and Sponsor's representatives will not be made aware of a given subject's randomization arm until the blind is broken. The Sponsor will ensure that the Study Monitor does not ever have access to the randomization assignments.</masking_description>

    <measure>Female Sexual Function Index Lubrication Domain (FSFI-LD)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) is a survey validated to assess sexual function in women. The FSFI contains 19 questions, divided in to 6 characteristic domains: Desire, Arousal, Lubrication, Orgasm, Satisfaction, and Pain. Although all of these characteristics may be improved by use of a personal lubricant, only the Lubrication Domain (FSFI-LD) is directly relevant to a lubricant's intended use. The other domains will be used to assess exploratory outcomes. The total/composite FSFI score can range from 2.0 to 36.0, with higher scores indicating improved sexual function, while the FSFI-LD has a score that can range from 0.0 to 6.0, with higher scores indicating increased lubrication during sexual activity or intercourse.</description>

        NOTE: IUD (Intrauterine Device) users may be enrolled provided they commit to exercising
        caution when removing VR101, as IUD strings have been noted to interfere with VR101
        removal.

        NOTE: Participants who have previously undergone anterior and/or posterior vaginal repair
        and have received a vaginal mesh implant may have difficulty placing VR101 but are not
