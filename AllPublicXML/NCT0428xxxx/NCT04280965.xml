  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pilot study to evaluate feasibility for a full-scale merit application. Specifically, for
      veterans considering prolonged exposure (PE) therapy, following the model established by Foa
      et al, we need to establish safety, and feasibility of quetiapine compared to treatment as
      usual (TAU) which employs multiple medications commonly used for PTSD in the VA system.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All treatment seeking adult (≥ 18 years)

          2. Veterans with mTBI who meet PTSD diagnosis and have a CAPS-5 score of 25 or greater.
             Diagnosis will be determined using the provisional PTSD diagnosis convention
             recommended by the National Center of PTSD which requires at least moderate ratings (2
             or more) on at least 1 B item (items #1-5), 1 C item (items #6-7), 2 D items (#8-14),
             and 2 E items (items #15-20) of the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5
             (CAPS-5).

        currently taking any typical or atypical antipsychotic medication or individuals using
        daily benzodiazepines including nonbenzodiazepine z-drugs for sleep as they have effects
        similar to benzodiazepines for sleep. (Note: benzodiazepine use is contraindicated as they
        may impair learning required for progress with PE) (4) Individuals with known intolerance
        to quetiapine or a history of clinically unstable heart, lung, liver, renal or
        endocrinological condition, diabetes mellitus, and/or seizure disorder. (5) Individuals
        with substance use disorder severe enough to require medical detoxification.

        (6) Individuals who report suicidal or homicidal ideations in the past month severe enough
        to warrant inpatient admission.

        (7) Individuals with current or known history of cardiac arrhythmia or QTc interval ≥ 450
        milliseconds. (Note) Patients requiring other anti-arousal medication for general medical
        conditions such as antihypertensive medications, beta blockers etc., for hypertension,
        anti-thyroid medications for hyperthyroidism, and/or anti-epileptic medications,
        divalproex, levetiracetam, or carbamazepine for seizure disorder may be included if stable
        for at least 1 month before the screening visit.
