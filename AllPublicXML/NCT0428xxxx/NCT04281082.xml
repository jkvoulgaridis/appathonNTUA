      Introduction: ICP is commolnly manifested in the 2nd and especially in the 3rd trimester of
      pregnancy. Pathogenesis of ICP is multifactorial implicating genetic, environmental and
      hormonologic factors. Prevalence of ICP varies. In certain populations in latin America
      occurrence of ICP is up to 15% of pregnancies. In Caucasian populations incidence of ICP is
      approximately 1% of pregnancies. Data for the Greek population are scarce. Genes ABCB4 and
      ABCB11 that are encoding transport proteins in the hepatocyte are implicated in the
      pathogenesis of ICP.

      Aim of the Study: To study the genetic polymorphisms in pregnant women with ICP and in their
      first degree relatives Patients and Methods: To recruit 100 women with ICP. Analyze the
      occurrence of 11 SNP's in ABCB11 and ABCB4 genes in women with ICP. As control group will be
      used pregnant women without ICP or known hepatic disease. In these women the same analysis
      for SNP's as in women with ICP will be performed. Exclusion criteria: women with known
      hepatic disease ( HBV, HCV, HIV, HEV, Autoimmune Hepatitis, Drug induced liver injury,
      cirrhosis) and women with pregnancy related liver disease (pre-eclampsia, acute fatty liver
      of pregnancy or HELLP syndrome) Inclusion criteria: pregnant women with ICP. Detailed report
      of medical history, laboratory and clinical data regarding women and the pregnancy. Follow up
      of laboratory values before and after the begging of treatment with UDCA.
