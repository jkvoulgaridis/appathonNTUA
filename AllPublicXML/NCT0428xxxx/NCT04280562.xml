      Randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness and patient perception of the benefit
      of the Sana Pain Reliever in individuals with chronic neuropathic pain.The study is fully
      remote with four study visits taking place over teleconferencing and the study devices mailed
      to the participants to use at home for 8-14 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic neuropathic pain (NP) is an extremely debilitating condition with few treatment
      options and many of which with multiple side effects. This will be a randomized,
      sham-controlled trial that will investigate the effectiveness of a novel wearable device
      called the Sana Pain Reliever (Sana PR) at reducing chronic neuropathic pain. The Sana PR is
      a device comprised of a Mask to be worn over the eyes with a pair of ear buds to be worn in
      ears. It displays light and sounds in a predetermined algorithm which runs for 16 minutes at
      a time. The underlying mechanism of action for the Sana PR is Audio Visual Stimulation (AVS),
      a form of non-pharmacological intervention that induces a brain wave response called
      Frequency Following Response (FFR), which has been used for both performance enhancement and
      symptom management. The device will be used with a compatible tablet application that will
      collect data from each session that the device is used. This data will be collected through
      user inputs of responses to several questionnaires. This will be an at-home trial and
      participants will be loaned the Sana Pain Reliever device and a tablet device to run the
      application for the duration of the study. The trial will last a total of 14 weeks and will
      involve four study visits, either in-person at the Abilities Research Center at Mount Sinai
      Hospital in New York City, or remotely using a video call. The trial includes two baseline
      sessions on weeks 0 and 2, 8 weeks of the at-home intervention, and post-intervention
      sessions at the end of weeks 10 and 14. Participants will be instructed to use the device at
      the end of the day prior to going to sleep as well as whenever they experience greater than
      typical pain during the day . Data during the at home portion of the trial will be recorded
      daily via the application. The application will also prompt participants to answer
      fortnightly weekly questionnaires and send out compliance reminders. Additionally, a series
      of pain, sleep and quality of life assessments will be completed by participants at both
      baseline visits, a post-intervention visit and a 4-week follow-up visit.

    <time_frame>Baseline 1(Week0); Baseline 2 (Week 2); Post-assessment (Week 10); Follow up (Week 14)</time_frame>
    <description>This scale was developed to assess both the quantitative and qualitative qualities of neuropathic pain (NP). It includes 12 items, assessing spontaneous pain, brief attacks of pain, provoked pain and abnormal sensations in the painful area. This is a sensitive tool for measuring changes in neuropathic pain after a therapeutic intervention. Full scale from 0-10 with higher score indicating more symptom. Change in score at Week 2, Week 10 and Week 14 as compared to Baseline.</description>

    <description>The Questionnaire Type 9 for Depression (PHQ-9) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the nine DSM-IV criteria as &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day). It has been validated for use in primary care and is used to monitor the severity of depression and response to treatment. Full scale from 0-27, with higher score indicating more severe symptoms. Change in score at Week 2, Week 10 and Week 14 as compared to Baseline.</description>

    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is an effective instrument used to measure the quality and patterns of sleep in adults. It differentiates &quot;poor&quot; from &quot;good&quot; sleep quality by measuring seven areas (components): subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction over the last month. Full score from 0-21, with higher score indicating worse sleep quality. Change in score at Week 2, Week 10 and Week 14 as compared to Baseline.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline 1(Week0); Baseline 2 (Week 2); Post-assessment (Week 10); Follow up (Week 14)</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is used to evaluate depression symptoms, which are estimated to be highly prevalent in chronic pain populations. This questionnaire is a 21-item, self-report rating inventory that measures characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression. Depression may be a major contributor to a lack of reduction of pain. Scoring is from 0 (minimal) to 3 (severe), with total score from 0-63. Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms. Change in score at Week 2, Week 10 and Week 14 as compared to Baseline.</description>

    <description>The General Anxiety Disorder 7-item questionnaire (GAD-7) is a 7-item questionnaire that asks user to rank how often they have been bothered by seven problems over the past two weeks from &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day). The items that users are asked to rank levels of nervousness, anxiousness, relaxing, restlessness, irritability and fearfulness. Full scale from 0-21, with higher score indicating more symptoms.

    <description>World Health Organization Quality of Life BREF(WHOQOL-BREF) &amp; World Health Organization Quality of Life Pain (WHOQOL-pain): The WOQOL-BREF is a used to produce a quality of life profile for an individual that is derived from four domains. There are 26 questions which ask users to respond to quality of life (Q.o.L) questions on a scale of 1-5 (1-Not at All, Very Poor, or Very Dissatisfied; 5- Completely, Very Good, or Very Satisfied). The WHOQOL-pain scale is to be used in addition to the WHOQOL-BREF which a specific focus on the impact of pain on Q.o.L.
