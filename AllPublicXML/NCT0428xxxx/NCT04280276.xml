  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intra-patient variability (IPV) in tacrolimus is associated with premature graft loss. The
      rate of acute rejection episodes is higher in these patients, and acute rejection impacts
      negatively on graft survival. The prevalence of patients with high IPV is higher in African
      American patients (1-5). At the kidney transplant program of the University of Maryland, our
      investigators follow over 2.800 patients, with approximately 50% of the patients being of
      African American heritage, thus an ideal setting for the study.

      Study Population: Kidney transplant recipients with stable renal function with regular
      follow-up at the University of Maryland post-transplant clinic with at least 3 levels deemed
      as appropriately 12-hour trough levels within 3-36 months post-transplant.

      Group 1 - patients with high IPV (designated as ≥ 30%). Group 2 - patients with normal IPV (&lt;
      30%). Will assess risk of subclinical acute rejection in patients with high IPV compared to
      normal IPV. All tacrolimus 12 h trough levels in patients with stable allograft function at
      least 3 months post-transplant.

      Calculation of IPV: CV (%) = (SD/mean Tac trough concentration) x 100 (if stable total daily
      dose). To take into account dose changes, obtained levels will be corrected for the
      corresponding daily dose of tacrolimus to help correctly calculate IPV (CV C0/D-IPV) (6-7).

      Patients will be tested with TruGraf one time during the study.

    <description>The TruGraf test is a non-invasive blood test that measures molecular gene expression profiles associated with clinical conditions previously only diagnosed by biopsy in kidney transplant recipients. The results of the TruGraf test provide additional information about the adequacy of immunosuppression and may be used to support decisions in patient management.</description>
