  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Red Spinach is a natural food which is a rich source of nitrates, which are beneficial in
      hemodynamics, cardiovascular function, and have natural hypotensive and antianginal effects .
      In recent research, Red spinach extract has been shown to be beneficial in acute exercise
      performance. However, currently it is unclear how these acute increases in performance may
      translate to long term training adaptations.

      This research study is designed to measure the effects of red spinach extract (RSE) on
      markers of physical performance, body composition, and health following chronic resistance
      training and anaerobic exercise.

      The investigators aim to measure muscle strength, athletic performance, body composition, and
      muscle size in two groups of adults before and after 11 weeks of intervention in a
      randomized, double blinded study. One group (n=15 ) will receive an intervention of
      resistance exercise and a Red Spinach Extract supplement, and the other group (n=15) will
      receive resistance exercise and a placebo (maltodextrin).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant that cannot take either the RSE or placebo supplement will be excluded, as
             this will be a double-blind study.

          -  Furthermore, participants that cannot participate in pre- and post-research testing,
             and/or those that cannot commit to regular training sessions will be excluded.

          -  Inability to perform physical exercise (determined by health and activity
             questionnaire)

          -  Taking any other nutritional supplement or performance enhancing drug.

          -  Any chronic illness that causes continuous medical care.
