      This is a pilot study designed to investigate the alterations in the gut microbiome that
      occur during the course of kidney transplantation, liver transplantation, allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells transplantation in association with the
      clinical outcomes.

      This is a pilot study designed to investigate the dynamic changes in the intestinal
      microbiome that occur during the course of kidney transplantation, liver transplantation,
      allogeneic HSCs and mesenchymal stem cells transplantation. Four patient cohorts will be
      followed. Cohort A: patients receiving kidney transplantation. Cohort B: patients receiving
      hematopoietic stem cells transplantation. Cohort C: patients receiving mesenchymal stem cells
      transplantation. Cohort D: patients receiving liver transplantation. Included participants
      are defined as patients with at least three analyzable stool samples including a baseline
      sample before the transplantation.

        Recruitment will include both patients with planned transplantations as well as recipients
        in urgent need of transplantation. The study coordinator may identify potential
        participants via direct referral from a treating physician, review of transplant lists and
        schedules.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants enrolled into kidney transplantation or HSCs transplantation or MSCs
             transplantation or liver transplantation programs with fecal samples collected over
             the course of their initial transplant hospitalization.

          -  Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             the start of transplantation procedure.

          -  Samples were excluded from the analysis if they were not aliquoted and stored frozen
             within 24 hours of collection.
