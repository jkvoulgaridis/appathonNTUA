  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endpoint implementation of reactions initiated by ischemia is the mitochondrial transition
      pore permeability. Mitochondria pores opening results in a release of factors triggering
      apoptosis primarily the cytochrome ะก Inhibition of the pores opening protects ischemic damage
      of the cells. The key enzyme regulating the mitochondrial permeability transition pore is
      GSK-3b: the phosphorylation of the enzyme inactivates the enzyme and prevents pore opening.
      Aim of studi is to determine content of the phosphorylatcd GS K-3b in neurons of rat brain in
      the model of total tschemia/reperfusion.

      Endpoint implementation of reactions initiated by ischemia is the mitochondrial transition
      pore permeability. Mitochondria pores opening results in a release of factors triggering
      apoptosis. primarily the cytochrome ะก Inhibition of the pores opening protects ischemic
      damage of the cells. The key enzyme regulating the mitochondrial permeability transition pore
      is glycogen synthase-kinase 3b (GSK-3b): the phosphorylation of the enzyme inactivates the
      enzyme and prevents pore opening. We have shown in previous study that preconditioning with
      sevoflurane increases the content of the phosphorylated form of 6SK-3b and protects the
      mitochondria of neurons in rats brain during ischemia/reperfusion. Aim of studi is to
      determine content of the phosphorylated GS K-3b in neurons of rat brain in the model of total
      ischemia/reperfusion influenced by: 1 MAC desflurane vs control group; 1 MAC desflurane vs 1
      MAC sevoflurane and 1 MAC desflurane vs training ischemia.

    <description>Induction of anesthesia: Chloralhydrat intraperitoneal 300 mg/kg. This provides complete suppression of animal responses to pain, fixation, tracheal intubation. After fixation of the animal in the supine position trachea is intubated and mechanic ventlation with air using an animal respirator is performed.</description>

    <description>Intervention. Drug: Desflurane. Desflurane 8 vol% anesthesia is introduced. This provides complete suppression of animal responses to pain, fixation, tracheal intubation and cardiac arrest. After fixation of the animal in the supine position trachea is intubated and mechanic ventlation with air using an animal respirator is performed. Surgery: Cardiac arrest is induced by intrathoracic clamping of the supracardiac bundle of vessels by means of a special hook. Period of cardiac arrest and absence of ventilation lasts 10 min. The animal is then resuscitated by means of chest compressions and mechanichal ventilation with air. Cardiac activity and systemic blood circulation recovers within 1 min; spontaneous respiration will be resumed after a period of 4-6 min.</description>
