      The study should evaluate the biological distribution of 99mTc-1-thio-D-glucose in patients
      with primary brain tumors and recurrence of brain tumors.

      The primary objective are:

        1. To assess the distribution of 99mTc-1-thio-D-glucose in normal tissues and tumors at
           different time intervals.

        2. To evaluate dosimetry of 99mTc-1-thio-D-glucose.

        3. To study the safety and tolerability of the drug 99mTc-1-thio-D-glucose after a single
           injection in a diagnostic dosage.

      The secondary objective are:

      1. To compare the obtained SPECT imaging results of brain tumors with the data of magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) and/or positron emission tomography (PET) and immunohistochemical
      (IHC) studies of postoperative material.

      The overall goal is to study the effectiveness of SPECT imaging of primary brain tumors and
      relapse of brain tumors using technetium-99m labeled glucose.

      Phase I of the study:

      Biodistribution of 99mTc-1-thio-D-glucose in patients with primary brain tumors and in
      patients with recurrence of a brain tumor.

      The main objectives of the study:

        1. To evaluate the distribution of 99mTc-1-thio-D-glucose in normal tissues and tumors in
           patients with brain tumors at different time intervals.

        2. To evaluate dosimetry 99mTc-1-thio-D-glucose based on the pharmacokinetic parameters of
           the drug after a single intravenous administration.

        3. To study the safety of use and tolerability of the drug 99mTc-1-thio-D-glucose after a
           single intravenous administration in a diagnostic dosage.

      Additional research tasks:

      1. To conduct a comparative analysis of the diagnostic information obtained in the
      visualization of brain tumors by SPECT using 99mTc-1-thio-D-glucose with data obtained by
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or positron emission tomography (PET) and
      immunohistochemical (IHC) research of postoperative material.

      Methodology:

      Open-label, exploratory, single centre study. The subjects will receive a single injection of
      the labelled tracer.
