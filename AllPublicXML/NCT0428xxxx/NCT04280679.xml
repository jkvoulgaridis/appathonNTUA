  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a one-arm, open label, prospective, single center study to evaluate clinical
      standardization with Theraclion's Sonovein 2 HIFU device.

      The original Sonovein device was tested in a clinical trial in 50 subjects and received CE
      Mark. That device has been updated yielding the current version of Sonovein 2. Based on the
      technical similarities between both devices in term of design, performance and principle of
      operation, the clinical data for Sonovein is sufficient to assure conformity of the Sonovein
      2 with the respected essential requirements. At the same time, the compagny wishes to pursue
      the standardisation of the clinical practice with the second generation device and is,
      therefore, conducting this limited trial in 20 evaluable cases (from the planned 22 patients
      to be included). A &quot;case&quot; is defined as procedure conducted on a distinct vein.

      The Sonovein 2 system provides high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) abaltion of soft
      tissue. The energy is delievered via an extra-corporeal treatment probe, which includes an
      imaging system. The high energy ultrasound waves propagate through the skin and are focused
      on a portion of the target tissue, generating intense heat and causing local cell apoptosis
      and progressive tissue volume reduction over the following months in the tissue within the
      focal area. The process is then repeated in a stepwize fashion to destroy the targeted
      tissues. The Sonovein 2 system is comprised of several components, including the console,
      treatment arm containing the visualization and treatment unit (VTU), a computer with
      touchscreen user interface. In addition, the Sonovein 2 system is intended to be used in
      conjunction with a disposable cooling and coupling system known as ePack.
