  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to characterize the patients who initiate treatment for
      asthma with DUPIXENT® in a real-world setting.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To characterize real-world use patterns of DUPIXENT® for asthma

        -  To assess the long-term effectiveness of DUPIXENT® in asthma patients in a real-world
           setting

        -  To assess effectiveness on comorbid type 2 inflammatory conditions in asthma patients
           treated with DUPIXENT®

        -  To collect long-term safety data on study participants in the real-world setting

    <time_frame>Baseline up to 3 Years</time_frame>
    <description>RQLQ(S)+12 is a self-administered questionnaire with standardized activities developed to measure health-related quality of life signs and symptoms that are most problematic in those 12 to 75 years of age, as a result of perennial or seasonal allergic rhinitis. There are 28 items on RQLQ(S) in 7 domains: activities (3 items), sleep (3 items), non-nose/eye symptoms (7 items), practical problems (3 items), nasal symptoms (4 items), eye symptoms (4 items) and emotional (4 items). RQLQ(S)+12 responses are based on 7-point likert scale with responses ranging from 0 (not troubled) to 6 (extremely troubled). Individual items within RQLQ(S)+12 are equally weighted. The overall score is calculated as the mean score of all items. Higher scores indicated more health-related quality of life impairment (lower scores better).</description>

    <description>There is no investigational product provided by the study sponsor and no therapeutic intervention regulated by this protocol. As a condition for eligibility, patients are required to initiate DUPIXENT® for asthma, according to the country-specific prescribing information, prescribed by their physician as part of their normal care (ie, not for the purpose of enrolling in the registry). Once patients enter the study, there are no protocol requirements regarding DUPIXENT® or any other treatments.</description>

             prescribing information

          -  Treatment with dupilumab within 6 months before the screening visit, or within 6
             months of the baseline visit if the screening and baseline occur on the same day

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with patient's
             ability to participate in the study or personal conditions and circumstances that can

             assessments.
