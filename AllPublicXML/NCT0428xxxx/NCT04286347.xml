    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the feasibility of HCV, HBV, HIV testing (according to the
      national guidelines) during consultation with Anesthesiologist before a planned surgery in
      Lariboisiere Hospital, Paris, France. The feasibility will be the number of tested patients
      divided by the number of patients who should have been tested according to the national
      guidelines (for each virus).

      The aim of the study is to assess the feasibility of HCV, HBV, HIV testing during
      consultation with Anesthesiologist before a planned surgery in Lariboisiere Hospital, Paris,
      France.

      The national guidelines recommend at least one HIV testing during life and, more recently,
      one HCV testing during life to eradicate HCV infection. HBV testing is recommended in
      patients coming from high prevalence countries, IVDU, prisoners, patients with multiple
      sexual partners.

      The feasibility will be the number of tested patients divided by the number of patients who
      should have been tested according to the national guidelines (for each virus).

      HIV testing will use finger-stick whole blood (FSB) INSTI® HIV-1 &amp; HIV-2 Rapid Antibody Test
      FSB (BioLytical TM Laboratories Inc., Richmond, B.C., Canada), with a sensitivity 99%
      [96.3-99.7] and a specificity 99.3%.

      HCV testing will use finger-stick whole blood (FSB) Oraquick® HCV test, with a sensitivity
      and a specificity 99.1 and 100% respectively.

      HBV testing will use finger-stick whole blood (FSB) Vikia® HBs Ag test, bioMérieux with a
      sensitivity and a specificity 96.5 and 99.9% respectively.
