      This is an open-label phase II study assessing the activity of cabozantinib combined with
      atezolizumab in patients with resectable muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma who are
      ineligible for cisplatin-based therapy or decline cisplatin-based therapy. Each cycle equals
      21 days. The dose of atezolizumab is 1200 mg IV flat dose every 3 weeks (Day 1) plus
      cabozantinib 40 mg orally daily (Day 1 through Day 21). Patients will receive three cycles of
      treatment prior to cystectomy unless they discontinue treatment for unacceptable toxicity or
      progressive disease by RECIST v1.1 or withdraw consent.
