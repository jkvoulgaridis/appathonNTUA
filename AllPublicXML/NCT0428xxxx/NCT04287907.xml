  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effective ventilation is the single most vital intervention to improve outcome of
      resuscitation in the neonatal population. Assessments of effective ventilations are based on
      clinical parameters, but may be difficult due to inexperienced personnel as well as observer
      variability. End tidal CO2 detectors (ETCO2) have been shown to improve effective ventilation
      in manikin model as well as in video recordings of selective infants where obstructive
      breaths were recognized objectively by means of lack of colour change.

      This is a trial evaluating the use of a qualitative end tidal CO2 monitor device during mask
      ventilation in the delivery room. The investigators hypothesize that using a colorimetric
      carbon dioxide detector during mask ventilation, it could facilitate recognition of
      obstructed breaths and reduce the duration of bradycardia and desaturations.
