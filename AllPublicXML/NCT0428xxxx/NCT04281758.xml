  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, double blind, randomized, controlled, cross-over trial.

      The primary outcome is to quantify the incremental area-under-the-concentration-curve (iAUC)
      for plasma caffeine after oral consumption of caffeinated beverages with various bioactive
      compounds vs. caffeine alone, in 16 healthy volunteers

      Secondary outcomes are caffeine concentration at each time point from pre-dose baseline to
      3.5 hrs post-dose, peak caffeine concentration (Cmax), time to maximum caffeine concentration
      (Tmax) and return to baseline concentration (TBR) for plasma caffeine

      Other outcomes are ratings of physiological symptoms and mood, assessed using visual analog
      scales (VAS).

      Polyphenol food frequency questionnaire data at screening will be collected as a possible
      co-variate.
