      Patients with pathologically proven stage III NSCLC will be treated with CIT-induction. In
      the feasibility phase, the first cohort (cohort 1A) will receive only 1 course of the
      immunotherapy doublet followed by a single dose of Durvalumab (Figure 1). The 2nd cohort
      (Figure 1, cohort 2A) will open for inclusion if 5 to 6 out of 6 patients complete CIT-CRT
      according to the safety rules (paragraph 6.1.3). In next cohort two courses of Tremelimumab
      and Durvalumab will be administered. The expansion cohort will be opened (Figure 1, cohort
      2B) if this is well tolerated. Patients will be enrolled for cohort 1B in case &lt; 5 out of 6
      patients complete CIT-CRT in cohort 2A.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provision of signed, written and dated informed consent prior to any study specific
             procedures.

             2. Male or female aged 18 years or older. 3. WHO performance status of 0 or 1. 4.
             Pathologically proven NSCLC stage III or inoperable stage II (cT1-3N0-1), according to
             the 8th edition of the AJCC staging, with a clinical indication for concurrent
             chemo-irradiation. Patients with locoregional recurrent lung tumour following surgery
             or a second primary cancer are eligible, unless a pneumonectomy was performed.

             5. Patients should be able to receive concurrent chemo radiotherapy treatment as
             approved by the MDM.

             6. Body weight &gt;30kg 7. Negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) for female patients
             with childbearing potential; 8. For women of childbearing potential: agreement to
             remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods
             that result in a failure rate of ≤ 1% per year, during the treatment period and for at
             least 180 days after the last dose of Durvalumab and Tremelimumab combination therapy
             or 1 month after the last dose of chemotherapy, whichever is later.

        A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal, has not
        reached a postmenopausal state (≥12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified
        cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of
        ovaries and/or uterus).

        Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of ≤ 1% per year include bilateral
        tubal ligation, male sterilization, established proper use of hormonal contraceptives that
        inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices (IUDs), and copper IUDs.

        The following age-specific requirements apply:

          -  Women &lt;50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been
             amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments
             and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the
             post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical sterilization
             (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).

          -  Women ≥50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been
             amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal
             treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses &gt;1 year ago, had
             chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses &gt;1 year ago, or underwent surgical
             sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy).

             9. Adequate organ function. Minimum required laboratory data. 10. No major
             contra-indications for undergoing EBUS and/or mediastinoscopy. 11. For patients
             included in the two feasibility cohorts a calculation for the mean lung dose (MLD) for
             radiotherapy will be performed: in both cohorts at least 2 out of 6 patients with a
             MLD ≥ 16 need to be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Patients with grade 3 dyspnoea or worse at baseline (according to CTCAE version
             4.03).

             2. Prior radiotherapy to the thorax. 3. Participation in another clinical study with
             an investigational product during the last 4 weeks.

             4. Concurrent enrolment in another clinical study, unless it is an observational
             (non-interventional) clinical study or the follow-up period of an interventional study
             5. Recent major surgery within 4 weeks prior to entry into the study (excluding the
             placement of vascular access) that would prevent administration of chemotherapy.

             6. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable
             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, interstitial lung disease, serious chronic
             gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements, substantially increase
             risk of incurring AEs or compromise the ability of the patient to give written
             informed consent.

             7. Presence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow‐up schedule; those
             conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial.

             8. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with
             evaluation of the CRT or interpretation of patient safety or study results.

             9. Patients with irreversible toxicity not reasonably expected to be exacerbated by
             treatment with Durvalumab or Tremelimumab may be included only after consultation with
             the Study Physician.

             10. Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (including
             inflammatory bowel disease [eg, colitis or Crohn's disease], diverticulitis [with the
             exception of diverticulosis], systemic lupus erythematosus, Sarcoidosis syndrome, or
             Wegener syndrome [granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Graves' disease, rheumatoid
             arthritis, hypophysitis, uveitis, etc]). The following are exceptions to this
             criterion:

               1. Patients with vitiligo or alopecia

               2. Patients with hypothyroidism (eg, following Hashimoto syndrome) stable on hormone
                  replacement

               3. Any chronic skin condition that does not require systemic therapy

               4. Patients without active disease in the last 5 years may be included but only
                  after consultation with the study physician

               5. Patients with celiac disease controlled by diet alone 11. Subject noncompliance
                  that, in the opinion of the investigator or sponsor, warrants withdrawal; eg,
                  refusal to adhere to scheduled visits 12. General contra-indications for
                  immunotherapy:

               1. Active infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that includes
                  clinical history, physical examination and radiographic findings, and TB testing
                  in line with local practice), hepatitis B (known positive HBV surface antigen
                  (HBsAg) result), hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (positive HIV 1/2
                  antibodies). Patients with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the
                  presence of hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) are
                  eligible. Patients positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if
                  polymerase chain reaction is negative for HCV RNA.

               2. Receipt of a live, attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to enrolment or
                  anticipation that such a live, attenuated vaccine will be required during the
                  study.

               3. Prior treatment with CD137 agonists or immune checkpoint blockade therapies,
                  including anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic antibodies.

               4. Treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents (including but not limited to
                  interferons or IL-2) within 14 days or five half-lives of the drug (whichever is
                  shorter) prior to enrolment. Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication
                  within 14 days before the first dose of Durvalumab or Tremelimumab. The following
                  are exceptions to this criterion:

                    -  Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injections (eg,

                       enrolled in the study. The use of inhaled corticosteroids for chronic
                       obstructive pulmonary disease, mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone)
                       for patients with orthostatic hypotension, and low-dose supplemental
                       corticosteroids for adrenocortical insufficiency are allowed.

                       13. History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (including bronchiolitis
                       obliterans with organizing pneumonia) or evidence of active pneumonitis on
                       screening chest computed tomography scan.
