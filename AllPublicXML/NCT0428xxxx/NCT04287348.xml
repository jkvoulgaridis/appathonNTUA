      The purpose of this investigator initiated study is to identify the effects of intravitreal
      brolucizumab on recurrence-free treatment intervals and morphological features in choroidal
      neovascularizations (CNV) due to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in which the Optical
      coherence tomography (OCT) guided treatment interval failed to be extended to 6, 8 or 10
      weeks intervals in a treat and extend regimen using aflibercept.

      Outcome Measures:

      The primary outcome is the mean maximum treatment interval with intravitreal brolucizumab at
      month 6 and 12.

      The secondary outcomes are:

        -  Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in letters and BCVA change (letters) from baseline
           (=switch to brolucizumab) to month 6 and 12.

        -  Number of brolucizumab intravitreal treatments applied during the 12 months study
           period.

        -  Central retinal thickness (CRT, in µm) as measured in the central ETDRS subfield
           Spectral-Domain Optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) at baseline, month 6 and 12.

        -  Presence of qualitative SD-OCT features like intraretinal fluid, subretinal fluid,
           pigment epithelial detachment and hyperreflective foci at baseline, month 6 and 12.

        -  Total CNV area and vessel density as measured by OCTangiography (OCTA) at baseline,
           month 6 and 12.

        -  Total area of leakage from CNV and the total lesion area as evaluated by Fluorescein
           angiography (FA) at baseline and month 12.

        -  VFQ-25 total and subscores as evaluated by quality of life questionnaire VFQ-25 at
           baseline and month 6 and 12.

        -  Rates of adverse events and serious adverse events at 6 and 12 months.
