  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proof-of-principle study aims to investigate the effects of a brief behavioural
      procedure including a computerized visuospatial task (the computer game &quot;Tetris&quot;) preceded by
      a reactivation of the traumatic memory of childbirth, on birth-related intrusive traumatic
      memories and other postpartum posttraumatic stress symptoms. Women who report birth-related
      intrusive memories after 6 weeks postpartum will monitor their intrusive traumatic memories
      in a daily diary. After two weeks of diary, they will meet a psychologist to briefly evoke
      the memory of their birth, and receive a brief behavioural procedure including playing
      Tetris. Participants will then continue to complete an intrusive traumatic memory diary
      during two weeks. It is predicted that they will report fewer intrusive memories in the two
      weeks following the intervention, compared to the two weeks before. This will inform the
      potential future development of a simple computerized intervention procedure to reduce
      distressing psychological symptoms after traumatic childbirth.
