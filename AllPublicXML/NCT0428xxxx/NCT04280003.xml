    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, doble blind, placebo controlled clinical trial to asses de safety and
      efficacy of intravenous administration of alogenic adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem
      cells in the first four days from acute ischemic stroke.

    <textblock>
      Two spanish hospitals with teams experienced in stroke management will participate in this
      study, recruiting a total of 30 patients between them both. After confirming that patients
      fulfill the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, informed consent will be
      signed and randomization will take place (1:1). There are two different groups of treatment;
      the first group will be treated with intravenous alogenic adipose tissue-derived stem cells
      (at a concentration of one million cells per kg) within the first four days from stroke
      onset, the second group will be treated will an intravenous placebo solution. Follow-up will
      last for 24 months during which safety issues such as adverse events and neurological and
      systemic complications will be assessed at 24 hours, 7 days and 3, 6, 12,18 and 24 months
      after treatment. Neurological disability using the modified Rankin Scale and National
      Institute of Health Stroke Scale will also be registered in every scheduled visit.
      Biochemical markers of tissue repair (GM-CSF, BDNF, VEGF, TGF-1, GFAP, MBP, MMP-3) as well as
      extracellular vesicles will be extracted on baseline visit as well as 7 days and 3 months
      after treatment.

             least two of these points in sections 5 and 6 (motor deficit) at the time of inclusion
             and in which a measurable focal neurologic deficit persists to the time of treatment.

          -  A prestroke score on the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤1 (no significant disability).

          -  Female subjects non-child bearing potential. Female subjects who are of
             non-childbearing potential are defined as meeting at least 1 of the following
             criteria:

        Have undergone a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy; Have medically

        of regular menses for at least 12 consecutive months with no alternative pathological or
        physiological cause.

          -  Female subjects of child-bearing potential need a negative pregnancy test and must
             agree to use adequate contraception for the duration of the study (from screening
             through the final of the study). The following types of contraception are considered
             adequate provided they are locally authorized for use: oral, transdermal, or
             injectable (depot) estrogen and/or progestogen, selective estrogen receptor modulator
             therapy, intrauterine contraceptive device, double barrier method (e.g., condom and
             diaphragm or spermicidal gel) or vasectomy.

          -  Signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Comatose patients; patients with a score of 2 or more on item 1a of the NIHSS related
             to the degree of awareness.

          -  Current drug or alcohol use or dependence

          -  Active infectious disease, including human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, and
             hepatitis C. A controlled infection is not an exclusion criterion.

          -  Pre-existing dementia.

          -  A health status, any clinical condition (eg, short life expectancy, and coexisting
             disease or a surgical or endovascular planned procedure) or other characteristic that
             precludes appropriate diagnosis, treatment, or follow-up in the trial.

          -  Patients who are participating in another clinical trial.

          -  Inability or unwillingness of the individual or their legal guardian/representative to
             provide written informed consent.
