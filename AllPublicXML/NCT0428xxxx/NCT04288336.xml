  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies the feasibility of a daily, long-term intermittent fasting
      routine in preventing or delaying a rise in prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels in
      patients with prostate cancer that has not spread to other parts of the body (localized) and
      who have undergone radical prostatectomy. PSA is a protein produced by both normal and cancer
      cells. Following a daily fasting routine after treatment for prostate cancer may lower the
      risk of patients' PSA level rising above 0.4 ng/mL, which is also called PSA-recurrence. A
      PSA-recurrence can sometimes mean that the disease has returned and/or progressed.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether men treated for localized prostate cancer adhere to a long-term
      (months-years) daily intermittent fasting regimen.

      II. To measure the levels of metabolic and prostate-cancer derived microparticles in the
      serum of men that practice a daily intermittent fasting regimen after treatment for
      localized, high-risk prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning when patients' PSA is detectable up to 24 months after surgery, patients follow a
      daily intermittent fasting routine consisting of restricting the daily eating period to 8
      hours (e.g. between 1PM-9PM) followed by 16 hours of prolonged nightly fasting for up to 1
      year or until secondary therapy commences.
