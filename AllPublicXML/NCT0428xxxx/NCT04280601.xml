  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective study will assess if 12 months of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol)
      supplementation, in patients with AAV (GPA, MPA, and EGPA) who have deficient or insufficient
      25(OH)D3 status at enrollment, correlates with improved disease activity and/or lower
      frequency of relapse (compared to historical data and a previously conducted cross sectional
      study (part I) that assessed vitamin D status in a cohort of similar patients).

      1. Subject cohorts: Patients with a diagnosis of AAV from the MSH Rheumatology clinic in a
           cohort of consecutive patients over a 3 month recruitment period.

        2. Study Design, Data Collection: Patients with insufficient and/or deficient vitamin D
           status at study enrolment will be instructed to take 12 months of vitamin D3
           (cholecalciferol) supplementation (1000 IU for those not on vitamin D, or to increase
           the dose up to 2000 IU per day for those already on vitamin D) vs. those with sufficient
           status who will be observed for 12-months.

        3. Study Duration: 12 months.

        4. Study Endpoints: Vitamin D status vs. disease activity.
