  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine a volunteer's gait objectively after surgery, when signed off
      from the consultant and physiotherapist. This will identify any gait deficiencies using
      simple traffic light coding, using GaitSmart, a CE Marked Class 1M Medical Device. Volunteers
      chosen for the intervention programme, a set of exercises to improve gait deficiencies
      identified in the report. All the exercises will be standard one already used within the NHS.
      The objectives are to compare the outcomes from the intervention group with the Standard of
      Care group, in terms of gait and PROMS and from this determine the clinical and economic
      benefits of the intervention.

      This study aims to determine a volunteer's gait objectively after surgery, when signed off
      from the consultant and physiotherapist. This will identify any gait deficiencies using
      simple traffic light coding, using GaitSmart, a CE Marked Class 1M Medical Device. All
      volunteers in the intervention group will be provided with a copy of their report. Protocol
      for SoC group SoC volunteers receive a GaitSmart test at their first appointment but are not
      given their report. Questionnaires to record Volunteer reported outcome measures (PROMS)
      include: Oxford hip score (OHS) or Oxford knee score (OKS) plus the Euroqol questionnaire
      (EQ5D-5D) are completed. SoC volunteers return at week 15 for a second test but are not given
      their report. Questionnaires to record Volunteer reported outcome measures (PROMS) include:
      Oxford hip score (OHS) or Oxford knee score (OKS) plus the Euroqol questionnaire (EQ5D-5D)
      are completed. Protocol for GaitSmart intervention group GaitSmart intervention group have
      the procedure explained to them at the first appointment. All exercises have the volunteer
      standing or sitting and are chosen from exercises already provided by the NHS. Each volunteer
      will get a subset of these. The nurse will ensure volunteers can perform the exercises before
      leaving the session. GaitSmart test performed at weeks 6, 9, 12 and 15. The report is
      provided plus six personalised exercises. The nurse will check they are able to perform the
      tests at each visit. Those not suitable will be struck off the list. Questionnaires to record
      Volunteer reported outcome measures (PROMS) will be completed at weeks 6 and 15.
