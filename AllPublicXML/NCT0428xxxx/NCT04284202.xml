    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evalute the efficacy and safety of PD-1 antibody combined
      with Dasatinib as third-line therapy for NSCLC patients with ARID1A mutation until disease
      progression or intolerable toxicity or patients withdrawal of consent. The target sample size
      is 30+individuals. The primary endpoint of this study is PFS、ORR、OS and the secondary
      endpoint is toxicity.
