  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Strength and proprioception exercises are used to improve the strength and unipodal balance
      of lower limbs in Taekwondo players. The moments of unipodal support in Taekwondo require a
      great demand that is necessary to adapt the athlete through the development of strength and
      proprioception.

      The main objective of the study is to assess the effectiveness of strength work with elastic
      bands and balance exercises in increasing strength and unipodal proprioception in
      taekwondists aged 18 to 30 years.

      Randomized, single blind clinical study 30 taekwondists will be randomized to the two study
      groups: experimental (strength training and proprioception) and control (without
      intervention). The intervention will last 4 weeks, with 2 weekly sessions each session will
      be approximately 15 minutes each. The study variables will be: unipodal muscle strength (jump
      test), and lower limb balance (Y-Balance test). The sample distribution will be calculated
      using a Kolmogorov-Smmirnof analysis. The changes after each evaluation will be analyzed with
      the t-student test and with an ANOVA of repeated measures the intra and intersubject effect
      will be observed. The effect size will be calculated using Cohen's formula.

      After the training period it is intended to obtain improvement in the strength of the lower
      limbs, as well as an increase in balance during unipodal support during the execution of a
      movement.

    <description>It will be done using the Hop test, measuring the single jump for distance The test will be done twice and the result will be the average of the two values to calculate the symmetry of the limbs. Before carrying out the test it is necessary to create a horizontal line as a starting point and six meters to there a horizontal line as an end point. A vertical 15 cm line will be placed as a reference point for the cross jump from the starting line to the finishing line. The simple jump of distance consists in realizing a jump starting from a monopodal support and falling of the jump with the same leg that realizes the impulse. The unit of measure is the centimeter, based on the distance traveled.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline stability after treatment and at month</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening visit, within the first seven days after treatment and after one month follow-up visit</time_frame>
    <description>It will be done by applying the Y-Balance test. With this test, the unipodal stability of each lower limb will be measured. To perform the test you must create a &quot;Y&quot; figure on the floor. The athlete will place one foot barefoot at the central point of the &quot;Y&quot;, while the other foot should be carried along the lines in the 3 directions: anterior, posterolateral and posteromedial. The players will be asked to stretch their foot as much as possible without losing their balance, then returning to the starting point. Three repetitions will be performed and the result will be the average of these measures. There will be a 15 second break between each unilateral take and 30 seconds between each foot.</description>

    <description>Strength and proprioception exercises will be performed with the athlete in different positions depending on the exercise. There will be 3 series with 30 repetitions and 10-second breaks between sets. Each exercise session will be held for 15 minutes. Theraband® exercises are: unipodal balancing on hard surface with open and closed eyes, unipodal balancing on soft surface, squats, lateral walk, isometric contractions with garter and dynamic leg opening, tiptoe, and eccentric hamstring curl with garter.</description>
