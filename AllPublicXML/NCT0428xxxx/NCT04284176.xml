  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with cerebral palsy hemiplegia present a restriction in the daily activities due to
      the limitation in the active movement of the affected upper extremity. The restriction of the
      function is also caused for the phenomenon of &quot;the development restriction&quot;, for which the
      child does not learn to use the affected extremity, producing an exclusive dominance of the
      not affected extremity and the development of corporal strategies of compensation.

      The treatments centred on the reduction of the spasticity do not improve the function of the
      extremity, since the improvement in the quality of the movement is not translated in an
      improvement of the activity. The mirror therapy (MT) in mirror in children with hemiparesis
      produces an improvement in the quality of movement and in the perception of the affected
      upper extremity, since the excitability of the ipsilateral motor cortex is increased,
      optimizes the congruity between the afferent feedback and favors the representation of the
      movements. The observation of actions in other individual can activate the same neuronal
      structures. The action-observation therapy (AOT) favors the motor behaviour of the affected
      upper extremity through the observation of sequences of systematic activities and their
      posterior execution. It also produces an increase in the excitability of the corticospinal
      tract, originating muscular pattern contraction similar to the observed ones and favoring the
      motor activity.

      The combination of both therapies, mirror therapy (MT) and action-observation therapy (AOT),
      might favor the quality of movement of the upper extremity and provide a major cortical
      activation and increase the spontaneous use on having created the only protocol of
      intervention which includes the benefits of both interventions. Nevertheless, there do not
      exist at present researches consider this possibility for affected children of spastic
      hemiplegia.

      The principal aim of this study is to analyze the influence of the quality of movement in the
      spontaneous use of the upper extremity affected in children with hemiparesis as well as the
      improvement of both variables across MTAO. Another specific aim will be to determine if &quot;the
      non-use&quot; is determined by the quality of the movement of the segment, if the MTAO reduces
      &quot;the non-use&quot; of this extremity as well as to obtain a protocol of intervention that
      increases the quality of movement and the spontaneous long-term use.

      A randomized controlled trial will be realized in children with hemiparesia between 6 and 12
      years, with a spontaneous use of the hand according to the scale HOUSE, a level Manual
      Ability Classification System (MASC) I-III and a good cooperation and cognition. Those with a
      severe spasticity, previous surgery of the upper extremity and the use of botox will be
      excluded. The children will be divided in two groups. The experimental group will receive for
      20 days a daily therapy of 15 minutes at home of MT and 45 of AOT, whereas the control group
      will receive 60 minutes of AOT.

      Four measurements will be obtained: basal situation, at the end of the treatment and measures
      of follow-up to 3 and 6 months after the end of the treatment. Despite the sociodemographic
      variables, measures of the quality of the movement, the spontaneous use of the upper
      extremity, the questionnaire CHEQ and the AHA scale.

      The combination of both therapies (MTAO) might favor the quality of movement of the upper
      extremity and provide motor activity as well as the increase of the spontaneous use. By this
      way, a new protocol of intervention which includes the benefits of both interventions will be
      obtained.
