    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well azacitidine and venetoclax chemotherapy with or without
      pembrolizumab works in treating older patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as azacitidine and venetoclax, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,
      or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as
      pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving azacitidine and venetoclax chemotherapy
      with pembrolizumab may increase the rate of deeper/better responses and reduce the chance of
      the leukemia coming back in patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia compared to
      conventional therapy of azacitidine and venetoclax alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Assess the percentage of patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) negative complete
      remission (CR) (MRD-CR) or complete remission with incomplete count recovery (MRD-CRi) with
      azacitadine (AZA) + venetoclax (VEN) with pembrolizumab during the first 6 cycles.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the investigator-assessed rates of CR/CRi/partial remission (PR)/morphological
      leukemia free state (MLFS) as defined per the modified International Working Group (IWG) 2003
      response criteria with AZA + VEN with pembrolizumab, as well as rates of MRD negative MLFS.

      II. Rates of complete remission with partial count recovery (CRh) and hematologic improvement
      (HI) to red blood cells and platelets.

      III. Assess time to MRD negativity and duration of MRD negative state, event free survival
      (EFS), relapse free survival (RFS), calculated as the time from initial treatment to either
      disease relapse or death, duration of response (DOR, defined as the time from first CR/CRi to
      the date of the first documented relapse or death, whichever occurs first) and overall
      survival (OS).

      IV. Assess the proportion of patients who develop severe toxicity.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. MRD assessment by duplex sequencing (DS) and comparing DS and multiparameter flow
      cytometry for MRD detection as an exploratory biomarker.

      II. Assessment of immune-checkpoint expression and dynamic change of immune cell subsets in
      response to the combination of checkpoint-inhibition and backbone combination in acute
      myeloid leukemia (AML).

      III. High-throughput sequencing of the T-cell receptor (TCR) Vb CDR3 regions on ï¬‚ow
      cytometrically sorted t-cell subsets to assess the effect of immunotherapy on the diversity
      of the t-cell repertoire and assess for correlation to clinical outcomes.

      IV. Investigation of protein signatures and ribonucleic acid (RNA) signatures associated with
      response and efficacy using O-link cytokine panel and RNA-sequencing (seq), respectively.

      V. Determination of mutational load by whole exome sequencing to assess for correlation with
      clinical outcomes, immune infiltrating profile, and T cell repertoire diversity and
      clonality.

      VI. Profiling of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation patterns before and after treatment
      to assess for correlation to response to treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (AZA + VEN):

      INDUCTION THERAPY PHASE: Patients receive azacitadine intravenously (IV) over 10-40 minutes
      or subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-7 and venetoclax orally (PO) on days 1-28 of cycle 1 and

      INDUCTION THERAPY PHASE: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 8 of cycle
      1 and every 3 weeks in cycle 2-6, azacitadine IV over 10-40 minutes or SC on days 1-7, and
      venetoclax PO on days 1-28 of cycle 1 and days 21-28 of subsequent cycles. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY PHASE: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 8 of
      cycle 1 and every 3 weeks in cycle 2-6, azacitadine IV over 10-40 minutes or SC on days 1-7,
      and venetoclax PO on days 1-28 of cycle 1 and days 21-28 of subsequent cycles. Cycles for
      azacitadine and venetoclax repeat every 28 days for 3 years and treatment with pembrolizumab
      repeats every 28 days for up to 24 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 3
      years.

               -  EXCEPTION: Low doses of steroids (e.g., &lt; 0.5 mg/kg/day, absolute maximum 40
                  mg/day of prednisone or equivalent dose of other steroid), inhaled
                  corticosteroids, or topical steroids are permitted

          -  Other active primary malignancy (other than non-melanomatous skin cancer or carcinoma
             in situ of the cervix) requiring treatment or limiting expected survival to =&lt; 2 years

               -  NOTE: If there is a history of prior malignancy, they must not be receiving other
                  specific treatment (other than hormonal therapy for their cancer)

          -  Patient with known active CNS disease and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Assessment of
             the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is not required to enroll in the study unless there is
             clinical suspicion for CNS involvement. However, if CSF assessment is performed for
             any reason, there should be no evidence of active leukemia in the CSF. Subjects with
             previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without
             evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks prior to the first dose of
             protocol treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no
             evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least
             7 days prior to protocol treatment. This exception does not include carcinomatous
             meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability

          -  Patients who received prior allogenic transplant

          -  Patient with a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory
             abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator

          -  Patient with a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or receiving high dose systemic steroid
             therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the
             first dose of treatment

          -  Patient with active autoimmune disease except for patients with hypothyroidism and
             vitiligo that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e., with use of
             disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement
             therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy
             for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic
             treatment

          -  Patient with a known history of non-infectious pneumonitis that required the use of
             steroids or current pneumonitis

          -  Patient with active uncontrolled infection

          -  Patient with a known history of active TB (Bacillus tuberculosis)

          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness

          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) is
             humanized antibody with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab), breastfeeding
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab). These
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study

          -  Patients with no bone marrow involvement (i.e., those with only extramedullary
             disease)

          -  Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia

          -  Patients that received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy

               -  NOTE: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu
                  vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist)
                  are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed

          -  Patients with active hemolytic anemia requiring immunosuppressive therapy or other
             pharmacologic treatment. Patients who have a positive Coombs test but no evidence of
             hemolysis are NOT excluded from participation
