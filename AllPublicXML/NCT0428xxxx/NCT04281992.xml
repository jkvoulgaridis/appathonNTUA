  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part phase 1/2A study performed in diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) patients with
      chronic non-healing wounds to investigate the safety and efficacy of AUP1602-C.

    <textblock>
      Study AP-W-CLI-2018-8 is the first clinical study of AUP1602-C in humans. It is a Phase 1/2A
      clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of a single and repeated
      doses of AUP-16 as topical treatment of DFU. The Phase 1 part will be a multicenter,
      open-label, non-randomized, uncontrolled dose-finding study with sequential dose escalations
      performed in dose cohorts comparing three doses of AUP-16 administered three times per week
      (low, medium, and high dose cohorts). This part will consist of four sequentially recruited
      cohorts. It is expected that a minimum of 15 patients may be required to determine the RP2D
      in phase 1 part.

      The Phase 2A part, an extension of the Phase 1, will be a multi-center, open-label,
      randomized, placebo-controlled study of the recommended AUP1602-C dose and administration
      schedule from Phase 1 to confirm safety and to assess efficacy of the selected recommended
      phase 2 dose and schedule in DFU patients.
