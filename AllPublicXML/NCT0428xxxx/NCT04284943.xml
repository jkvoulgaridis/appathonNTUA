      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled trial to compare Billroth II
      reconstruction versus conventional Roux-en-Y reconstruction versus long limb Roux-en-Y
      reconstruction for glycemic control in patients with concurrent type 2 diabetes and gastric
      cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Billroth I, Billroth II, or Roux-en-Y procedure follows gastrectomy to reconstruct the
      gastrointestinal tract. Billroth I procedure restores the normal configuration of the
      gastrointestinal tract and Billroth II and Roux-en-Y procedure involve the creation of
      duodenal switch which is thought to be responsible for metabolic effects by altering enteric
      hormones. Accordingly, several retrospective studies reported that Billroth I reconstruction
      has less effect on diabetes compared to Billroth II and Roux-en-Y reconstruction. While
      little is known about different effects of Billroth II and Roux-en-Y procedure, a study
      retrospectively showed that Roux-en-Y procedure has significantly higher rate of T2DM
      remission than Billroth II procedure. We conduct a randomized controlled trial to control
      possible confounders arising from diverse metabolic effects of cancer and minimize
      differences in treatment regimen among patients.
