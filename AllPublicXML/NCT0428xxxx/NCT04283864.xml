  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is 3 arms observational study with no intervention that aims to understand the link
      between Crohn's disease, microbiome and diet in children.

      150 children newly diagnosed with Crohn's disease will participate in the study and their
      data will be used to create an algorithm about their microbiome, disease, diet, etc.

      100 other children newly diagnosed will participate in the study and their data will be use
      to validate the algorithm.

      The investigators will be recruiting 50 healthy participants: 20 that are undergoing an
      endoscopy for abdominal pain and 30 that comes to the physician for different reasons.

      After parental consent, the participants will receive an explanation of the study and sign a
      consent form for colonoscopy. Before colonoscopy, participants will bring fecal samples, give
      blood samples, biopsies and biopsy brushes (superficial scraping of the tissue) will be taken
      during the operation. These samples will be retained until further consent is obtained for
      further study.

      After receiving the results of the colonoscopy, children who have been diagnosed with Crohn's
      disease will be offered to participate in the second part of the study, they will receive an
      explanation about the app, collection of fecal samples at home, diet logs and anthropometric
      measurements, demographic information, medical and family history will be registered.

      During the first 3 months: the participants will be asked to log data in the app and collect
      fecal samples at home. They will be asked to come for a follow up visit where anthropomorphic
      measurements and blood samples will be taken.

      Participants will be asked to log in every day to report in the app daily activity and food
      intake throughout the study period. Each week, the research coordinator will call on
      participants to make sure the app is correctly filled in, collect the stool samples correctly
      and answer questions. During the entire study participants will collect fecal samples, every
      first week of the month participants will enter information in the app.

      For children who have not been diagnosed with Crohn's disease by the colonoscopy, or children
      who visit the institute for reasons other than inflammatory bowel disease without a clear
      finding will participate in the study control group. If consent is given, fecal samples will
      be collected at the entrance of the study and after one year, blood samples, a food
      questionnaire and anthropometric indices, demographic information, medical and family history
      will be completed.

    <description>Using machine learning we will create a trained personalised decision-tree based predictor enabling a significant prediction of nutritional impacts on CD clinical and inflammatory features during the first year of follow-up. It will be based on information gathered from microbiome ( metagenomic and 16s sequencing of stool microbiome), nutritional questionnaire and disease states (via fecal calprotectin test) in children with Crohn's disease.</description>
