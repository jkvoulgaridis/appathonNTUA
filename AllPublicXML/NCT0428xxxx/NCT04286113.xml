    <textblock>
      For the sub-study, this digital navigation tool will both inform/educate, engage, support,
      and navigate participants and providers through the process of clinical trial participation
      via personalization (data profiling, adaptive and customized messaging, and tailored digital
      navigation) in a sample of 100 participants with diabetes and hypertension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To identify provider- and system-level facilitators (solutions) of clinical trial
      participation that can be in corporated in the digital navigation tool. We will pay special
      emphasis on the behavior research volunteerism and altruism and individuals who are at risk
      for cardio metabolic conditions. To develop solutions that will address patient-, provider
      and system-level barriers preventing clinical trial participation Objective 2: To test the
      adherence, feasibility, and efficacy of a research volunteerism and altruism component of a
      health and wellness web app. that provides personalized newsfeeds and curriculum about
      research and health-related volunteer and altruistic activities versus traditional patient
      navigation procedures and resources in clinical trial awareness.'awareness/knowledge,
      attitudes, willingness to participate in clinical trial, self-efficacy, and share knowledge
      about clinical trial opportunities to social network. To determine which elements of the
      digital tool and mobil app are associated with increased awareness/knowledge, intent to
      participate, and contagion
