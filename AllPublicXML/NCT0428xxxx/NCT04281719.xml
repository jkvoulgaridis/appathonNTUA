  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is exploring the ease and ability to integrate a mobile application in outpatient
      behavioral health treatment. There are two major aims to the study: 1) Determine feasibility
      and acceptability of integrating a mobile app into behavioral health treatment for
      adolescents with co-occurring substance use and mental health disorders, and 2) identify
      initial signal of effect on engagement and/or treatment outcomes among youth who use the
      mobile app.

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of the trial will be to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed methodology
      (rate of recruitment, retention at 4-month follow-up, study procedures) as well as estimates
      of effect on key variables (patient engagement, patient symptoms, use of e-tools, treatment
      efficiency) in preparation for future studies in this line evaluating the utility of the
      mobile app.

    <measure>Provider satisfaction assessed by Treatment Evaluation Inventory-Short Form (TEI-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Providers express high satisfaction with e-tools per published norms on the TEI-SF. The Treatment Evaluation Inventory Short Form (TEI-SF) is a 9-item questionnaire that is rated on a 5-point scale. Scores range from 9 to 45 for each treatment with higher scores indicating greater acceptability of the model.</description>

    <measure>Adolescent satisfaction assessed by the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Adolescents express high satisfaction with e-tools per published norms. The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8, an 8 question survey with ratings from 1 to 4 is used. Scores can range from 8 to 32 with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction.</description>

    <measure>Patient Engagement assessed by the Child Improvement Rating Scale (CIRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Provider-rated youth engagement in treatment process.This will be assessed by the Child Involvement Rating Scale (CIRS) which is a 6 item questionnaire with each item being rated on a 6 item scale ranging from 0 to 5. The questionnaire contains 4 items assessing positive involvement and 2 items assessing negative involvement. The positive items are scored according to the selected scale value while the negative involvement items are reverse scored. Higher scores correspond to greater perceived patient involvement.</description>

    <measure>Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Symptoms measured by CRAFFT</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Providers record a decrease in SUD symptoms for patients participating in the study and treatment. The CRAFFT, a 6-item questionnaire in which every &quot;yes&quot; scores 1 point is used to measure substance abuse and dependence. A score of 2 or higher indicates a positive screening.</description>

    <measure>Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Symptoms assessed by the Drug Abuse Screening Test for Adolescents (DAST-20-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Providers record a decrease in SUD symptoms for patients participating in the study and treatment. The Drug Abuse Screening Test-20 Adolescent Version (DAST-20-A) is a 20-item self-report questionnaire. Higher scores indicate a greater severity in substance use and can be broken down into the following ranges: 0 (n/a), 1-5 (low), 6-10 (intermediate, likely meets DSM criteria), 11-15 (substantial), 16-20 (severe).</description>

    <time_frame>4 months post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Providers record a decrease in PTSD symptoms for patients participating in the study and treatment. The PTSD Symptom Scale for DSM-5 (CPSS-5) is used for evaluation. The CPSS-5 is a 20-item symptom checklist in which symptom severity can be rated from 0 to 4. Higher scores indicate greater symptom severity and can be broken down into the following ranges: 0-10 (minimal), 11-20 (mild), 21-40 (moderate), 41-60 (severe), 61-80 (very severe)</description>

    <description>The Bright Path web-based mobile application is designed to target co-occurring problems, enhance patient treatment engagement, and contribute to lasting improvements in teens' mental health. The central hypothesis is that developmentally tailored mobile applications that incorporate evidence-based treatment principles can facilitate increased patient engagement in and between sessions, thus, improving the efficiency, efficacy, and reach of treatments for this highly vulnerable population.</description>
