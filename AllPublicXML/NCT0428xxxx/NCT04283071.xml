  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects more than a 120,000 people in the United Kingdom and is the
      commonest neurological condition in young adults. MS causes a number of symptoms including
      weakness, altered sensation, pain and memory difficulties. There are different forms of MS,
      including relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), primary progressive MS (PPMS) and secondary
      progressive MS (SPMS). Currently there are several effective treatments for RRMS, but no NICE
      approved treatment for SPMS. Patients with PPMS and SPMS experience a gradual progression in
      disability that affects individual patients differently. A number of clinical scores are used
      to quantify the disability in individual patients and some of these scores focus on the
      patients' lower limb function. In the progressive forms of MS, preservation of upper limb
      function becomes a more important concern for patients to maintain their quality of life.

      With the advent of new treatment trials for PPMS and SPMS, it is important that clinicians
      and researchers are able to use accurate and quantifiable measures of upper limb function to
      evaluate any changes with time or response to treatment. The use of motion tracking software
      provides a unique opportunity to accurately track movements in real time and space and give a
      tailored assessment of an individual's function.

      The overall aim of this study is to use established kinematic assessment tools to explore the
      extent and progression of upper limb dysfunction in patients with progressive MS. This aim
      will be achieved via the following objectives:

        -  Recruit a sample of participants with PPMS and SPMS from the local MS population

        -  Quantify the physical impairment in these participants using existing clinical scores as
           well the kinematic assessment tools that have been developed

        -  Follow-up the participants for a period of 12 months to identify and quantify any
           progression in their upper limb dysfunction

        -  Identify any factors that may influence upper limb dysfunction in this group

        -  Develop and evaluate the role of further kinematic techniques in this group of
           participants
