      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a medication, fluvastatin, can change
      melanoma to a state that is less likely to metastasize or recur.

      Fluvastatin is experimental in this setting because it is not approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for treatment or prevention of melanoma. However, fluvastatin has been
      approved by the FDA for treating high cholesterol.

      This is an open-label, single arm, study assessing the activity of fluvastatin in shifting
      the transcriptome in melanoma. Subjects with melanoma will be asked to participate and all
      subjects will receive the study drug, fluvastatin, for 2 weeks.

      The primary objective of this study to determine whether administration of fluvastatin
      changes the melanoma transcriptome

      The secondary objective of this study is to determine whether administration of fluvastatin
      changes the gene expression profile of Class 2 melanoma to Class 1 melanoma.

    <description>The study team will report which of the 28 genes had significant expression changes. A 2-fold change in the appropriate direction with a p-value of at least 0.05 will be considered significant for potential therapeutic value. P-values will be corrected for the false discovery rate using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed melanoma clinically staged as AJCC Stage
             1-3.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant having received a statin drug within 1 month of study enrollment.

          -  Participant receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  History of adverse reactions (eg. myalgias, transaminitis, or rhabdomyolysis)
             attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to fluvastatin or
             other agents used in this study.

          -  Participants with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to
             ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, liver disease, or psychiatric illness/social situations
             that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Participant currently pregnant (as assessed by positive pregnancy test prior to
             enrollment) or breastfeeding

             --Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because Fluvastatin has
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Women of childbearing
             potential will be asked to take a pregnancy test prior to enrollment (unless a
             pregnancy test administered within the last month is present in the medical record and
             is negative). A woman of childbearing potential is defined as a premenopausal female
             capable of becoming pregnant. Men do not need to use contraception while taking this
             medication.

          -  Participants currently receiving BRAF inhibitors, MEK inhibitors, immunotherapy, or
             any other non-surgical treatment for melanoma.

          -  Participants currently receiving nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. These
             participants are excluded because use of NRTIs may confound the transcriptome
             measurements used in this study since as described above they are predicted to modify
             melanoma gene expression.

          -  Any condition or situation that, in the investigator's opinion, may put the patient at
             significant risk, or may significantly interfere with the patient's participation in
             the study.

          -  Participants concurrently taking macrolide antibiotics (eg erythromycin,
             clarithromycin), azole antifungals (eg itraconazole, ketoconazole), protease
             inhibitors (eg ritonavir, telaprevir), gemfibrozil, cyclosporine, danazol, amiodarone,
             amlodipine, verapamil, diltiazem, azithromycin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, or rifampin
             are excluded.

          -  Participants with baseline ALT greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal.
