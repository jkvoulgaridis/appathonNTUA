    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomly assigned to either the cognitive training or waitlist control(WLC). In both conditions, they will receive the intervention, but the waitlist control will receive this later. Both groups will complete 6 weeks of the cognitive training game either immediately after 1 week baseline (cognitive training group) or after the week 8 assessments (WLC).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Inventory that asks respondents to rate how true 20 self-descriptive statements (e.g., I feel calm) are on a 4-point scale (1 = not at all, 4 = very much so). Typically, respondents are asked to rate statements according to how they generally feel (trait-anxiety scale) and how they feel in the current moment (state-anxiety scale). Total scores range from 20 to 80, with higher scores indicating greater maladjustment.</description>
