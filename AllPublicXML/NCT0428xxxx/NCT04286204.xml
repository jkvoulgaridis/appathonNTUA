  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the increase in life expectancy of the general population and advances in medicine,
      there is now a population with a higher amount of cardiovascular diseases that lead to an
      increased risk of sudden cardiac arrest. In most cases, this occurs in extra-hospital
      settings such as family homes, shopping centres, public transport and before people without
      any knowledge or training in basic life support. On the other hand, for every minute that
      passes without adequate attention of the victim, the probability of surviving or continuing
      to live with neurological severe sequelae decreases by 10%.

      In developed countries, public policies have been created to encourage basic life support
      education to the general population. In Colombia, because of the high prevalence of these
      diseases and the need for public health strategies, a law was issued to provide access to
      automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) in public places. However, it has not been developed
      strategies for education on this subject.

      For that reason, the investigators created an educational strategy of self-learning, which
      consists of a complete basic life support course based in new Information and Communication
      technologies with tools to manufacture a mannequin and a homemade DEA, which will allow
      continuous training, with a very low cost compared to traditional life support training.

      The clinical trial will compare that two educational strategies, evaluating as primary aid,
      which approach has higher knowledge retention of life support chain at 6 months in students
      after the workshop. As secondary objectives, the investigators would evaluate the efficient
      in terms of response times, costs and student satisfaction.

      This study will be carried out in high school students from two different high schools,
      without prior training in Life support. Both strategies will be distributed randomly. The
      experimental group will carry out the self-learning strategy based on ICT (Information and
      Communication Technologies), with which they will be retrained every month, and the control
      group will carry out the conventional training only once as usual. Subsequently, each of the
      objectives will be evaluated at six months.

      It is proposed that the self-learning strategy is superior compared to conventional training,
      requiring fewer resources to perform it and allows constant retraining, which improves
      retention and quality in a resuscitation process.

    <description>It will be a composed outcome of 6 aspects in a check list and the student must comply ALL item to consider as a positive result in good quality in basic life support, the items are:
I. Recognition of a person in cardiorespiratory arrest II. Activate the survival chain to survive III. Start chest compressions during or after activating the chain. IV. Chest compressions between 100-120 V. Proper use of AED VI. No interruptions should made during the thoracic compressions cycle. The result will be presented in proportion of students who completed ALL previous items.</description>

    <description>The satisfaction scale will be applied to all students. We will use a satisfaction scale developed and validated in Oviedo´s University, Asturias, Spain. It is a seven items scale. Each item is evaluated in 4 points Likert scale. The minimum value is 1, and the maximum value is 4 for each item.
We will evaluate these scale independently and present results in number and percentage en each item.</description>

    <description>This intervention is defined as a self-training course consisting of a 5-minute educational video in basic life support and a Kit with the elements to build the home dummy and the home DEA allowing integrally students to develop the steps as the video. The Kit will be delivered at the beginning of the study and every month the necessary materials will be complemented. The strategy will be carried out by the students every month and supervised by their teachers. Students will have constant access to an educational platform based on ICTs.</description>
