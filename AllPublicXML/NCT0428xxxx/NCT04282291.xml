      Background: The surgeries with upper abdominal wall incisions cause a severe pain and
      providing an adequate analgesia is an important challenge for the anesthesiologist. The
      serratus intercostal plane block (SIPB) has been already described as analgesic technique in
      open cholecystectomy.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate its analgesic efficacy in pain control, opioids
      consumption and recovery quality in upper abdominal surgeries.

      Methods: This blind, randomized controlled study was conducted on 102 patients undergoing
      open upper abdominal wall surgery under general anesthesia. All patients who received
      serratus intercostal plane block at the eighth rib as analgesic technique were included in
      group 0 (SIPB) and in Group 1 (control) those who received continuous intravenous morphine
      analgesia. In each group was evaluated pain scores in numeric verbal scale (NVS) and opioids
      consumption at 0,6,12,24 y 48h postoperative time. The quality of the postoperative recovery
      was evaluated with the modified Postoperative Quality of Recovery Score ( QoR-15
      questionnaire) at 24h.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The scientific evidence always supports the employment of a multimodal analgesic strategy,
      especially in procedures that generate a severe postoperative pain2, as media laparotomy or
      subcostal incision. The purpose is to not retard the patients' recovery and to avoid
      complications. The thoracic epidural analgesia is still the reference analgesic technique in
      open abdominal surgery7, although it is not exempt of limitations and complications. That is
      why, since the introduction of thoracic and abdominal fascial blocks, they have been part of
      the analgesic strategy, being an alternative to considerer instead the epidural.

    <description>In a questionnaire designed for the study the pain scores were registered as main outcome, using verbal numeric scale (VNS) from 0(no pain at all) to 10 (worst imaginable pain) both at rest and the dynamic component (cough, deep breath, movement, so on).

    <description>patients who underwent a modified BRILMA (intercostal rami block, middle axilary line) ultrasound-guided block with portable device with lineal probe and needle 80 mm. With the patient lying supine, the probe was placed in the sagittal plane of the middle axillary line to identify the aim thoracic structures. Under aseptic conditions, the needle was inserted in plane, caudo-craneal, to reach the fascial plane between the serratus anterior muscle and the external intercostal muscle at the eighth rib. A bolus dose of levobupivacaine 0.25% was administered, 3 ml of local anesthetic for each segment we want to block</description>

    <description>PCA (patient controlled analgesia) morphine was initiated immediately postoperatively using CADD Smith Medical pumps. All patients received PCA-morphine with the initial dose being 0.5-1 mg. The bolus dose was 0.01mg/kg mg morphine, with lockout time interval of 15 - 30 min, limiting of 8mg/hour, as the default program. The continuous (basal) dose was increased after 12-24 hours if using frequent demand doses or if pain not controlled and decreasing if no bolus was taken.</description>

    <description>The tissue damage induced by the surgery generates a nociceptive pain which is accompanied by inflammatory mechanism (somatic pain), visceral and neuropathic pain, and why the treatment must be adapted to each surgical procedure. As the innervation of the upper abdominal wall depends mainly on the last intercostal nerves, the block of these nerves should be considered a good analgesic strategy to avoid the somatic pain. The placement of the local anesthetic in the serratus intercostal plane at the eighth rib (serratus intercostal plane block, SIPB) in the middle axillary line, managed to block the lateral and anterior cutaneous branches of the last intercostal nerves (T7-11). The results were satisfactory in the postoperative pain control of the patients with open cholecystectomy.</description>
