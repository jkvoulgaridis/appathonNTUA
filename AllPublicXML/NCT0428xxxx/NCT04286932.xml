  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this project is to establish for the Republic of Ireland (ROI) a
      nationally representative database of food consumption in children aged 5-12 years to update
      2003-04 data for this group and to complement more recent data on preschool children and
      adults. The survey will be comparable with existing survey data in ROI and with surveys in UK
      (GB &amp; NI). The ROI database will be designed to address both nutrition and food safety issues
      of relevance to the development and implementation of public health policy, food safety risk
      assessment and to the needs of the food industry. In addition to detailed data on food
      consumption, data will be also be collected on body weight, lifestyle, including physical
      activity, determinants of food choice, urine, and composition of foods and food recipes. Food
      composition databases will be updated and restructured to facilitate future analyses of food
      ingredients, packaging materials, residues, contaminants, allergens, bioactives and
      microorganisms. Urine samples will be stored to facilitate future analyses nutrition and
      metabolic indicators, markers of food intake and for estimating exposure to food chemicals.
      Data will be analysed to estimate intakes of foods and nutrients and compliance with dietary
      recommendations, to establish the prevalence of overweight and obesity, to investigate
      physical activity patterns and compliance with guidelines, to identify psychological, social
      and attitudinal determinants of food choice and eating behaviour. Salt intake will be
      estimated from urine excretion. Findings will be disseminated to relevant stakeholders. The
      project will be carried out by a multi-disciplinary research team with strong linkages to
      related on-going research in food and health sciences.

    <measure>Food and nutrient intake of Irish children (5-12y)</measure>
    <time_frame>Jan 2017-Dec 2019</time_frame>
    <description>Participating families were asked to record detailed information on the amount and type of all foods, drinks and nutritional supplements consumed by the child over four consecutive days (including one weekend day) in a food diary. Participants were provided with digital food scales and asked to weigh as many foods as possible, including leftovers. Where foods were not weighed, researchers used age-appropriate photographic food atlases, standard portion sizes and household measures at subsequent visits to help with quantifying the amount of food consumed. Participants were encouraged to keep food packaging to provide further detail on the foods consumed. Nutrient intakes were estimated from food intakes using tables of food composition.</description>
