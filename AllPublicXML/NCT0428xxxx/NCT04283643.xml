    <textblock>
      Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and
      transcranial focused ultrasound (FUS), is be applied to healthy human subjects, acute pain
      patients, and chronic pain patients to investigate their uses for pain relief.

      The research team will be using non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial focused ultrasound (FUS) to investigate their
      uses for pain relief in humans: healthy human subjects, acute pain patients, and chronic pain
      patients. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings will be
      collected to achieve the following objectives:

      Objective 1 aims to determine the effects of noninvasive brain stimulation on the
      pain-related brain activities during pain processing. We hypothesize that noninvasive brain
      stimulation approaches will increase or decrease cortical activity upon processing painful
      input.

      Objective 2 aims to determine the effects of noninvasive brain stimulation on pain intensity
      and/or pain-related behavioral assessments. We hypothesize that noninvasive brain stimulation
      will influence pain-intensity and/or pain-related behavioral assessments.

      Objective 3 aims to investigate the correlation between brain activity and pain relief after
      noninvasive brain stimulation. We hypothesize that noninvasive brain stimulation will
      suppress cortical activity in pain-related brain areas, reduce pain intensity, and/or improve
      pain-related behavioral assessments.
