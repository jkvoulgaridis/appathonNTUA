      The purpose of this research study is to find out if Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) affects skeletal
      muscle health and if we can improve blood sugar control by improving muscle health.
      Participants in this study will have a blood sample and a urine sample collected after taking
      a single dose of anontoxic chemical called D3-creatine. Their body composition will be
      measured by a scale like device. Parents of participating children will also be asked to
      complete a food and activity questionnaire.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Type 1 diabetes for at least 3 months (defined by American Diabetes Association
             criteria, with glutamic acid decarboxylase, islet cell or insulin autoantibodies, and
             insulin requirement.

          -  Age â‰¥6 to 11 (inclusive) years of age

          -  Tanner stage 1 and 2 (pre-pubertal and early pubertal) to minimize pubertal effects

          -  Normal weight, overweight and obese children with weight maintenance (no recent
             significant weight loss or gain). Normal weight will be defined as a BMI between the
             5th and 85th percentile; overweight will be defined as a BMI at or above the 85th
             percentile and below the 95th percentile, obesity will be defined as a BMI at or above
             the 95th percentile for children of the same age and sex

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current or recent (within the past month) use of medications affecting IR (oral or
             inhaled steroids, metformin, thiazolidinediones, or atypical antipsychotics)

          -  Current or recent (within the past month) use of medications affecting IR (oral or
             inhaled steroids, metformin, thiazolidinediones, or atypical antipsychotics)

          -  Untreated hypothyroidism

          -  Proteinuria, which could affect the metabolomic profiling

          -  Anemia or hemoglobinopathies that could affect HbA1c levels

          -  Underweight or recent weight loss
