      Objective: The goal of this proposed research project is a quantitative analysis of a day
      hospital program designed to treat persons with emotional dysregulation.

      Background: The Short-term Assessment and Treatment (STAT) program has been operating at
      Health Sciences Center, Winnipeg, Manitoba for many decades. The STAT program is based on the
      principles of dialectical and cognitive behavior therapy. The STAT program is a five week day
      hospital program employing multi-modal treatment methods to treat patients with emotional
      dysregulation. The literature provides evidence of numerous treatment models with varying
      effectiveness for this population of patients. The STAT program hasn't had a quantitative
      analysis of its treatment model.

      Problem Statement: Is the 5 week day hospital treatment model developed and employed by the
      STAT program effective in improving the mental health of participants admitted to the
      program?

      Research on brief therapeutic interventions for those diagnosed with BPD have often involved
      a year or more of treatment in an outpatient, inpatient or partial hospitalization setting.
      The goal of this research proposal is to examine if a 5-week day hospital treatment program
      at a tertiary hospital within Shared Health can demonstrate effective amelioration of subject
      symptoms on a number of measures.

      As noted in the introduction there is significant public health considerations associated
      with persons living with borderline personality disorder pathology. &quot;Evidence-based public
      health should be informed by practice-based evidence stemming from the rigorous evaluation of
      relevant natural experiments&quot; (Leatherdale, 2019, p. 20). Due to logistic and ethical
      considerations a randomized control trial isn't feasible. Given these considerations, the
      proposed research design is a naturalistic pre- post-intervention with no control group.
      Although causality cannot be determined in a naturalistic design, methodological rigour
      employed will mitigate the impact of outside variable from invalidating the results obtained
      from the proposed research. Participants data will be collected at two times and the data
      from the same individual will be compared focusing on differences between pre- and
      post-intervention. The benefit in the longitudinal design is &quot;the potential to control for
      temporal or secular changes observed in the outcome&quot; (Leatherdale, 2019, p. 26). A challenge
      in interpreting randomized control trials is potential biases that impact external validity
      and reduce the ability of the researchers to generalize the outcomes associated with an
      intervention. Naturalistic studies can reduce the impact of confounding variable by
      identifying and controlling potential variables, such as socio-economic factors (Leatherdale,
      2019).

      Sample Characteristics and Selection Participants are referred to the STAT program through
      emergency room consultations, family physician referrals and from psychiatrists working in
      the community, outpatient department or during an inpatient admission. Participants are
      individuals 18 years and older.

      Although participants in the STAT program are primarily females there is no exclusion
      criteria based on gender. These participants are assigned a therapist who will complete a
      psychiatric interview and review a self-report each participant is required to complete prior
      to the initial interview. Potential participants will meet with a psychiatrist to review the
      information gathered in the therapist interview and determine if the client will be admitted
      to the STAT day hospital program. Participants are accepted if they meet admission criteria
      as determined by the psychiatrist. Participants are excluded if they have a diagnosis of
      antisocial personality disorder, criminal charges, or significant substance abuse.
      Participants are required to formulate behaviour-oriented goals to work on while
      participating in the STAT program. Participants are not admitted to the program if they do
      not formulate treatment goals. Potential participants referred from one of the above noted
      sources are assigned to a therapist each Tuesday at a weekly meeting of the STAT program
      staff. The therapist will contact the individual and arrange a date for an initial interview.
      If a therapist is unable to reach an individual by phone, a letter with the date for an
      appointment is mailed along with the self-report questionnaire each client is expected to
      complete for the first interview with the therapist. The self-report materials include a
      series of questions to elicit a social history of the individual along with current stressors
      and self-identified problems. The assessment process involves roughly two appointments with
      the therapist and an additional appointment with the psychiatrist requiring roughly three
      weeks to complete. Participants will be given a letter of invitation (see Appendix D)
      outlining the research project as well as the SCL-90-R and DERS psychometric questionnaires.
      Individuals will be asked to complete the SCL-90-R and DERS at the beginning of their first
      appointment if they agree to participate in the research project.

      Once an individual is accepted to the STAT Program, they are placed on the waiting list for a
      period of roughly four to six weeks. During that period, the therapist will meet with clients
      roughly two times to assist in formulating treatment goals and develop a therapeutic rapport.
      While a client is admitted to the program and participating in the groups, they are also seen
      by their assigned therapists on a weekly basis for an individual therapy session. Individual
      sessions with the therapist assist participants in understanding the psychoeducation group
      learning materials, assist with homework, and to process current stressors.

      The participants will complete the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) and Difficulties
      in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) prior to the first interview. Participants will be
      re-administered the SCL-90-R and DERS following completion of the 5-week treatment.

      Program Description The Short-term Assessment and Treatment (STAT) program is a day hospital
      program operated at Health Sciences Center in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The STAT program is similar
      to the program design described in Lothes, et al. (2014). The STAT program operates a 5 week
      continuously running treatment program. Clients are admitted to and complete the program
      weekly. Similarly, Lindenboim, Comtois and Linehan (2007) had participant entering the
      program at different points in the skill training and found no interaction effect and didn't
      significantly influence the participants' frequency or type of skills practised. The number
      of clients in the group is roughly 15 - 18. The STAT program employs a multidisciplinary team
      comprised of social workers, an occupational therapist, several nurses and psychiatrists.

      The STAT program is comprised of psychoeducation and psychotherapy groups, and individual
      therapy with an assigned therapist. Clients attend morning and afternoon groups daily for the
      5-week duration of the program. Groups are scheduled for 1 hr 30 min with an hour break for
      lunch. Two therapists lead each group and rotate through groups on a predetermined schedule.
      Psychoeducation groups are informed by the principles of DBT and CBT. Many of the skills
      taught are directly taken from Dr. M. Linehan's DBT skills training manual (Linehan, 1993).
      Psychoeducation is taught in the morning with the assigned module handed out at the beginning
      of the week. There are six psychoeducation topics that clients will be taught during the
      course of treatment. One of five topics is introduced on Monday and mindfulness is taught
      each Friday. These topics are: Distorted Thinking, Anger Being Effective, Communication and
      Assertiveness, Goal-Setting and Self-Esteem. A new skill related to the mindfulness
      psychoeducation module is introduced each Friday. Participants are given daily reading
      material and homework to complete related to the weekly topic. Participants are asked to
      share daily from their homework in the group.

      Many people with emotional struggles cope by engaging in self-injurious behaviours. Monday
      afternoon group focuses on the principles of Harm Reduction. Harm reduction groups teach the
      principles of stages of change, effective coping, and distress tolerance skills taught in
      DBT. Psychotherapy groups occur in the afternoon between Tuesday and Thursday. Participants
      are required to &quot;check-in&quot; at the beginning of group with a topic they would like to discuss.

      Procedure As outlined above, participants will be given a letter of invitation (Appendix C)
      outlining the research project a demographics questionnaire (Appendix D), the SCL-90-R and
      the DERS psychometric questionnaires. Individuals will be asked to complete the SCL-90-R and
      DERS at their first appointment if they agree to participate in the research project. The two
      questionnaires will be handed into the therapist along with the original copy of their signed
      Informed Consent (see Appendix E). Participants will retain a copy of the informed consent
      letter along with the letter of invitation. The therapists will have adhesive identifiers to
      correspond the pre- and post-intervention self-report questionnaire to the participant. The
      therapist will affix an identifier to the envelope indicating the anonymous participant
      envelop contains preintervention self-report data. The therapist will code if the patient
      participated in psychoeducation and psychotherapy groups or just the psychoeducation groups.
      The rationale for the distinction is to control the confounding variable of differences in
      the treatment a participant will receive. For the purposes of this research project only
      participants that attend both psychoeducation and psychotherapy groups will be examined.
      Attrition will be accounted for and those participants will be compared with treatment
      completers to examine potential significant differences between these groups. Attrition will
      be identified by only having a pre-intervention self-report surveys completed. The
      participant will be given a card with the identifier number and the therapist will affix the
      third adhesive identifier to an envelope for the post-intervention assessment. Participants
      will be re-administered the SCL-90-R and DERS following completion of the 5-week treatment.
      The participants will be given the two instruments on the last day in the program to
      complete. The therapist will ask the participants if they have the card given to them with
      identifier affixed when they completed the pre-intervention questionnaire. The participants
      will be given the corresponding post-intervention envelope containing the SCL-90-R and DERS
      surveys. The participants will hand in the completed questionnaires to their therapist. The
      goal will be to solicit 60 clients to the research project.

      Anticipated Outcomes The author expects that there will be an improvement in global severity
      index, improvement of emotion regulation, and a reduction hostility and improved
      interpersonal relationships as self-reported (Bech, et, al. 2014). Literature has reported
      attrition rates upwards of 30% for treatment programs with those who have borderline
      personality disorder attributed to a lack of motivation, interpersonal conflict, difficulties
      with emotional distress, substance use, suicide attempts and antisocial personality disorder
      (Kroger, et al. 2014). The STAT program model may reduce the attrition rate because potential
      participants with significant substance abuse and an antisocial personality disorder are
      excluded from participating in the program. Willberg, et al., (1998) noted attrition was
      related to treatment characteristics and life circumstances. The STAT program will not admit
      participants that don't have housing, stable finances such as employment insurance, and a
      family physician. Many treatments including standard DBT (Linehan, et al., 1991) and
      mentalization-based therapy (Bateman &amp; Fonagy, 1999) are also lengthier potentially making
      commitment for participants more difficult. Related to the admission criteria and the brief
      structure of STAT program the author expects the rate of attrition to be below the 30% rate
      noted above.

      Proposed Data Analysis A repeated measures t-test or an ANOVA data analysis will be used to
      determine if there is a predicted significant improvement in participants self-reports
      between pre- and post-intervention. An exploratory correlation data analysis will be used to
      examine if there are differences between participants that complete the STAT program versus
      those that don't complete the program.

    <description>The Symptom-Checklist-90-Revised is a psychometric measure used in research and clinical settings in measurement of outcomes related to treatment. It measures global severity of mental illness, positive symptom distress index, positive symptom total as well as nine dimensions of psychopathology on a 0 - 4 scale. Previous research studies on therapeutic interventions involving BPD participants have used the SCL-90-R to measure outcome. The SCL-90-R will be used to assess if the participants self-report a decrease in the severity of global indices of mental illness and nine specific psychopathology factors. Gratz and Roemer (2004) developed the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), a 36 item self-report survey to assess emotion dysregulation on six domains. DERS has good test-retest reliability and high internal consistency.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants are individuals 18 years and older. Although participants in the STAT
             program are primarily females there is no exclusion criteria based on gender. These
             participants are assigned a therapist who will complete a psychiatric interview and
             review a self-report each participant is required to complete prior to the initial
             interview. Potential participants will meet with a psychiatrist to review the
             information gathered in the therapist interview and determine if the client will be
             admitted to the STAT day hospital program. Participants are accepted if they meet
             admission criteria as determined by the psychiatrist.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  if a client has been declined by the STAT Program team.Participants are excluded if
             they have a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder, criminal charges, or
             significant substance abuse. Participants are required to formulate behaviour-oriented
             goals to work on while participating in the STAT program. Participants are not
             admitted to the program if they do not formulate treatment goals.

        The research project is not involved in the determination of inclusion or exclusion to the
        research project.
