  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Expectant mothers can give birth to their child either by vaginal delivery or by a caesarean
      section (the latter can be planned or necessary during an emergency). Among the
      pain-relieving options for vaginal delivery, they can choose to receive epidural analgesia.
      In case of a caesarean section, the three anaesthetic options are epidural, spinal, or
      general anaesthesia.

      The current Irish standard of care for the provision of information and consent for epidural
      and spinal anaesthesia entails a consultation with the anaesthesiologists at the request of
      the expectant mothers, shortly before the procedure. The uniformity of the information
      provided with this method is being debated. Moreover, there is a lack of consensus on the
      best timing and setting to informing patients.

      With the aim of standardising the provision of information on epidural and spinal
      anaesthesia, the Anaesthetic Department in Sligo University Hospital has created an
      informational video on such procedures, in which all benefits and possible complications are
      explained in detail.

      This video can be shown to expectant mothers at the antenatal classes or in the early stage
      of labour, as soon as they present to the labour ward.

      Importantly, this video is not aimed at promoting the use of the epidural catheter, rather at
      providing expectant mothers all the information on the technique, benefits, side effects and
      possible complications of the procedure.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate whether this informational video is effective
      in improving patient confidence and satisfaction regarding these pain-relieving options, and
      what is the optimal timing to show the video. Our hypothesis is that, compared to the control
      group, women who watch the informational video will feel more confident in choosing to
      receive or not these pain-relieving options and therefore have a more positive childbirth
      experience.

      This study is a randomised control trial. Randomisation will produce 4 groups in total.
      Depending on the group allocation, participants may or may not be shown the informational
      video in relation to spinal/epidural anaesthesia at various stages (antenatal classes or at
      the time of their arrival on the labour ward). The control group will receive the usual Irish
      standard of care.

      After delivery, the patients will be interviewed with a questionnaire that will explore:

        -  Their satisfaction with the information provided in relation to the epidural/spinal
           anaesthesia;

        -  Their confidence in choosing to receive/not to receive these pain relieving options;

        -  Their ability to recollect the information provided on these pain-relieving options.

      To the extent of our knowledge, this is the first study that aims at improving parturients'
      sense of confidence and satisfaction in relation to the information provided on epidural and
      spinal anaesthesia. Should patients find this means of information beneficial to their care
      and overall experience, there is potential for nationwide distribution.
