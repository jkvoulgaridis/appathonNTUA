  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ketamine is an antagonist of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor that not only abolishes
      peripheral afferent noxious stimulation, but it may also prevent central sensitization of
      nociceptors as shown in animal studies with excellent analgesic property even in
      subanesthetic doses. It is readily available and is being used currently, even by
      non-Anesthesiologists, to provide &quot;sedation&quot; for minor procedures.(.. Low-dose ketamine
      infusion in the perioperative period has shown to produce analgesia and decrease the
      requirements of opioid analgesics.. In obstetrics, it is being used as an adjunct to an
      inadequately functioning spinal anesthesia for caesarean section, as an induction agent for
      cesarean section and also to provide analgesia during labor in intermittent boluses.
