      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of VIS649 in participants
      with immunoglobulin A (IgA) Nephropathy (IgAN)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients aged 18
      years and above with biopsy confirmed diagnosis of IgAN. The study is designed to test the
      safety and effectiveness of multiple doses of VIS649. The main objectives are to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of VIS649 and to evaluate the dose response of different doses of
      VIS649 by measuring proteinuria.

      The study is comprised of three main periods, Screening, Treatment (12 months) and Follow-Up
      (4 months). Approximately 144 patients will be enrolled. The findings from this study will
      form the basis for subsequent clinical development of VIS649.

      VIS649 is a humanized immunoglobulin G (IgG2) monoclonal antibody that binds to and blocks
      the biological actions of the cytokine A PRoliferation Inducing Ligand (APRIL), a key factor
      in the production of aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 (a-g- IgA1), which is critical to the
      pathogenesis of IgAN.

             required systemic steroid therapy during the prior year.

         21. Participant has known cirrhosis or liver dysfunction, defined as presence of
             coagulopathy, platelet count &lt; 100,000/μL or alanine aminotransferase &gt; 3× upper limit
             of normal.

         22. Participant has active malignancy or is receiving chemotherapy for malignancy, except
             for nonmelanoma skin cancers and cervical carcinoma in situ. Participants with prior
             malignancy who have been documented to be cancer-free for ≥ 5 years may be enrolled.

         23. Participant is planning or scheduled to undergo a tonsillectomy. Prior tonsillectomy
             is acceptable (if greater than 6 months prior to screening).

             prior to initial screening.

         25. Participant with a pre-existing illness other than those listed above that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, would place the participant at increased risk through
             participation in this study.

         26. Participant is unable to comply with study protocol procedures and/or study visit
             schedules.
