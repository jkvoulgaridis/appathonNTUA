  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Wald Outreach Center will partner with Medicine for the Greater Good (MGG) to implement
      this pilot project called Wald Outreach for Wellness (WOW), a blood pressure outreach
      wellness intervention in a retail setting.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      WOW aims to provide community members with a digital blood pressure monitor, health
      education, and health care navigation as practical strategies to improve community members'
      management of pre-hypertension, and to reduce associated burdens and risks related to
      hypertension health disparities.

      This approach to reaching populations who use retail settings has the potential to implement
      a health promotion and wellness strategy aimed at populations with increased risk for
      hypertension related health disparities. The outreach strategy is aimed at reaching community
      members where community members gather for health care, provide the community members with
      practical, low-cost strategies for promoting health and wellness, increase community members'
      knowledge in hypertension management, help the community members navigate health care options
      and get the community members engaged in a medical home thereby reducing the burdens of
      hypertension health disparities.

      This research is important to continue to assess the best ways to reach and reduce
      hypertension health disparities in underserved communities with limited access to health
      care.
