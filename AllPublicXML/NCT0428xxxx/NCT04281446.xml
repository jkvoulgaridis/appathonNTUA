  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hormonal fluctuations present during the ovarian cycle may have a strong influence on
      physiological and psychological aspects on physical performance in women. The aspects
      surrounding performance and ovarian cycles in women, and the subsequent investigation of the
      influence of contraceptive use during different phases of the cycle, are still current and
      should be debated in the literature, as the available evidence has conflicting results. In
      addition to the above, new ergogenic methods have been studied to improve the sports scenario
      in different populations. Research on the use of ergogenic electrophysical resources so that
      hormonal effects may possibly be mitigated, allowing women to use this resource and improving
      their physical performance is still scarce in the current literature.

      Objective: To evaluate the physical performance of women during different phases of the
      ovarian cycle and the influence of photobiomodulation therapy in this setting. Methods: The
      research will be conducted in two subprojects - Subproject I is a cross-sectional study.
      Initially the participants will be evaluated in two days separately, being the first day
      within the ovarian cycle in the follicular phase (FF) and the second day in the luteal phase
      (FL). The aspects of body composition, body water volume by infrared thermography and skin
      temperature will be evaluated, and the physical performance evaluation will be constituted by
      the evaluation of the muscular performance by isokinetic dynamometer, and by a treadmill
      maximal effort test. , together with analysis of VO2max and blood lactate levels. Subproject
      II is a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial. After completion of
      subproject I, during the next ovarian cycle within the participants will return to conduct
      the second part of the study, which will analyze the influence of photobiomodulation therapy
      on the physical performance of women within their menstrual cycle, related to low hormone
      rate ( FF). 180 J of energy will be applied before each evaluation, which is muscle
      performance and endurance. The tests will be performed in the same order, following the same
      protocol in both phases of the study. For data analysis, a normality test will be used to
      verify the distribution and statistical tests consistent with the appropriate intra and
      intergroup comparisons, being considered two factors in the comparisons, time and group. A
      significance level of 5% will be adopted. The effect size will be calculated by Cohens'd.

Endogenous ovarian cycle Photobiomodulation Group(G-FBM-CEN);
Endogenous ovarian cycle Sham Group (G - Sham - CEN);
Exogenous ovarian cycle Photobiomodulation Group (G - FBM - CEX);

    <masking_description>The randomization and allocation of participants will be performed by a researcher who will not have access to evaluations and data collection. The interventions will be carried out by the researcher who made the allocation, and data collection by a second researcher, who is blinded to the allocation of the participants.
Participants will not know about their allocation during the collection process and during the intervention they will wear a mask covering their eyes.</masking_description>
