  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll children and adolescents (0 - 17 years) suspected of having concussion
      or mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). Samples of urine and saliva will be collected from the
      patients as well as from corresponding age- and gender-adjusted healthy controls.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The collected samples will be alienated to the Sponsor who will perform biochemical studies
      to identify and measure from the samples relative level of the brain injury-specific
      biomarkers.
