  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Admission into a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) is a highly stressful experience for
      child and family. High levels of stress can negatively impact outcomes, yet
      non-pharmacological interventions to decrease stress in the PICU are severely lacking. This
      is a prospective, single-arm feasibility trial that will explore the feasibility and
      acceptability of a music therapy intervention to decrease stress in the PICU among families
      of children receiving invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation.

      Objectives: The aims of this study are to: 1) Assess the feasibility of implementing a music
      therapy intervention in the PICU among children receiving invasive or non-invasive mechanical
      ventilation; 2) Determine the acceptability of the music therapy intervention in the ICU
      among caregivers, patients, and pediatric and cardiac ICU staff; 3) Explore the variability
      in child and caregiver stress outcomes throughout ICU admission. Hypothesis: The music
      therapy intervention will be feasible, as determined by recruitment, retention, protocol
      adherence, and data collection rates, and will be acceptable to participants and to PICU
      staff.

      Sample: This study will recruit 20 families that include children aged 2 months - 17 years
      old admitted with an expected length of ICU stay greater than 72 hours. Of these 20 families,
      the investigators will specifically recruit 10 families whose child is admitted for a hypoxic
      brain injury. Eligible children are receiving either noninvasive mechanical ventilation
      (i.e., continuous or bilevel positive airway pressure), invasive mechanical ventilation, or
      have an established tracheostomy tube and with escalated support settings. One primary
      caregiver will be enrolled along with the child admitted into the ICU. For aim 2, in addition
      to gathering acceptability information from enrolled families (N=20), N=10 pediatric ICU
      staff from various professional disciplines (physicians, nurses, rehabilitation therapists)
      will be recruited for focus group interviews regarding acceptability of the intervention.
