    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the intervention and can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to that medicinal product. A SAE defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product.</description>

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the intervention. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to that medicinal product. Unexpected AE event is considered unlisted if the nature or severity is not consistent with the applicable product reference safety information (Investigator's Brochure or local prescribing information). Adverse drug reactions are defined as adverse events which are in the investigator's opinion of causal relationship to the study treatment.</description>
