  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medication non-adherence is a major problem in kidney transplant recipients; young people
      12-24 years of age are at particularly high risk for non-adherence and graft failure compared
      to young children and adults. Given that poor medication contributes greatly to graft
      failure, clinically feasible and effective interventions are urgently needed to improve
      adherence, survival, and quality of life in this population. The broad aim of this
      prospective, 3-stage, sequential study is to improve medication adherence in adolescent
      kidney transplant recipients by: 1) adapting the successful Teen Adherence in Kidney
      transplant Effectiveness of Intervention Trial (TAKE-IT) intervention for use in 'real world'
      clinical care, 2) designing and testing a new portable electronic pillbox and companion
      tracking website interface, and 3) preliminary testing of the adapted intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This entry describes Stage 3 of the study. In Stage 3, we will conduct a pilot cluster
      randomized trial (CRT) to do preliminary testing of the adapted intervention and new
      electronic pillbox system in two groups of renal transplant recipients. Participating
      centers, rather than patients, will be randomized using a restricted randomization strategy
      with the Montreal Children's Hospital (MCH) assigned to the adherence intervention. This is
      necessary to ensure that the PI and lead site get sufficient experience with the intervention
      to guide other sites and to prepare for the full-scale CRT. All other sites will be
      randomized, stratified on center size, to the adherence intervention or healthy living
      education intervention. This will ensure adequate numbers of participants in each arm.

      Enrollment will be followed by a 4-week run-in period during which adherence will be
      monitored electronically, but no intervention will be applied. This will give participants
      time to become familiar with the e-pillbox and provide pre-intervention adherence data. All
      participants will receive a text message from a study staff 2 weeks after initiation of the
      run-in to check-in on how they are doing with the e-pillbox. If a participant is experiencing
      difficulties, the staff will offer assistance by phone.

      The intervention will begin at 4 weeks and be applied over 20 weeks. During the first 8 weeks
      of intervention, only the monitoring, feedback, and reminder components of the intervention
      will be delivered. This will be done because it would be impractical to require patients to
      return for a visit between regularly scheduled clinic visits. At 4 weeks, all participants
      will receive a phone call from the study coordinator. During this call, patients at adherence
      intervention sites will be given login information for the adherence tracking website, and
      will be allowed to set up any reminders and notifications that they wish. At 12 weeks
      post-enrollment, participants will meet in-person with the coach (adherence intervention) or
      RA (healthy living education intervention; control); adherence intervention participants will
      form an Adherence Support Team and initiate Action-focused problem-solving at 12 wks. Between
      12 wk. and study exit at 24 wk., patients at adherence intervention sites will carry out
      their action plans at home and will have access to the website to view their own adherence
      data. The healthcare team will provide the usual level of care to all participants.
      Healthcare professionals who consent to participate in the study will be trained to use the
      adherence tracking website within 2 weeks before to 1 week after the first participant at
      their site has completed the run-in.

      Participants at healthy living education sites (control) will have contact with study staff
      at the same frequency as participants at adherence intervention sites. At these contacts they
      will be provided with education on one of 3 topics of their choice: healthy sleep, safe and
      healthy social media use, and stress management. Educational sessions will be interactive.
      Participants may choose to review more than one of these topics if they wish. Participants at
      healthy living education sites will be offered extended use of the e-pillbox, with dose
      reminders enabled, and access for themselves and their HCP to the adherence-tracking website
      for an additional 20 weeks (24-44 weeks). This will serve as a limited 'waitlist control' to
      encourage participation at control sites and will allow estimation of the degree to which the
      adherence-tracking website is integrated into practice by HCP without support from a coach,
      as well as providing a sense of the impact of enhanced usual care (usual care plus dose
      reminders and possible feedback from HCP) on adherence. This period of extended use will also
      allow patients at control sites the opportunity to benefit from the e-pillbox component of
      the intervention, and to be able to express their opinions about the e-pillbox.

      Participants will have phone contact with coaches (adherence intervention sites) or RAs
      (healthy living education sites) at increasing intervals between initiation of the
      intervention at 12 weeks and exit at 24 weeks. The first phone check-in will occur at 14
      weeks, 2 weeks after initiation of the action-focused problem-solving and then second will
      occur at 18 weeks, 4 weeks after the last check-in. This will allow intervals of increasing
      frequency between contacts as participants become more comfortable with procedures.

The daily taking adherence score could take a value of 0%, 50%, or 100% for patients on twice-daily dosing, and 0% or 100% for patients on once-daily dosing. Each patient will have a taking adherence score for every day of observation (repeated measures). On days that the pillbox was not in use due to technical problems or participant non-use, no score will be given. To summarize adherence for each arm, we will calculate the total percentage of days of observation for which there was 100% taking adherence. The denominator for this calculation will be the total number of days of observation of each participant summed across all participants; the numerator will be the total number of days of observation of each participant for which taking adherence was 100% summed across all participants.</description>

    <description>The objective of the intervention is to improve medication adherence. Participants will use a multi-dose electronic pillbox and adherence tracking website which can provide dose reminders. Participants will form an Adherence Support Team (AST) including the participant, a parent (or other) and the &quot;Coach&quot;. The Coach will guide the AST to use Action-focused Problem-solving to address personal barriers to adherence. They will then generate concrete &quot;if-then&quot; plans for how they will behave in a given situation. Intervention participants with excellent adherence will be encouraged to work on building autonomy in medication-taking instead of adherence. Action plans will be able to be modified, if desired, at the 14-week and 18-week check-ins.
HCP at intervention sites will be given the option to login to the adherence tracking website to view the adherence data of their patients. HCP will also be alerted by study staff to critical non-adherence events.</description>

    <description>Control participants will receive 'healthy living education' intervention (attention-control) with the use of an e-pillbox (no dose reminders). Contacts with the research assistant (RA) will occur at the same intervals as at intervention sites. Participants will choose one of 3 healthy living topics on which they will receive education in an interactive format. The RA will engage the participant in a semi-scripted conversation on the selected topic. At check-ins, the RA will either continue the conversation on the topic selected at the outset or provide education on another topic. The RA will NOT engage in discussions about adherence and will NOT provide feedback on adherence data.
At 24 weeks, participants at control sites will be offered extended use of the e-pillbox, with dose reminders enabled, and access for themselves and their HCP to the adherence-tracking website for an additional 20 weeks. They will not receive coaching during this period.</description>
