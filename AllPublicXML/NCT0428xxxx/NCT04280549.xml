  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platelet activation has been associated with bad events like heart attack and stroke. There
      are a variety of platelet activators that regulate how active a platelet is. We are
      interested in Protease-activated receptors (PAR)-1. We are currently studying PAR-1
      activation in persons with severe peripheral artery disease. We seek, through this project,
      to understand PAR-1 activation in persons without peripheral artery disease. As many patients
      with peripheral artery disease have diabetes, we will also evaluate PAR-1 activation in
      persons with diabetes. In addition we will assess the impact of the glucagon-like peptide
      (GLP)-1 signaling pathway on platelet activation. Levels of platelet activation will be
      determined using platelet aggregation experiments and assessment of platelet-monocyte
      aggregates in peripheral blood.
