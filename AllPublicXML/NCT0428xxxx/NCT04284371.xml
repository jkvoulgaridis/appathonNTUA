      The prevalence of liver steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and hemosiderosis in overweight

      The purpose of this prospective study is to determine the prevalence NAFLD and of factors
      that have been associated with the diagnosis of fatty liver disease in overweight and obese
      children and adolescents and to determine the effectiveness of an intervention. In order to
      do this, we will also compare laboratory values and the ability/feasibility of new magnetic
      resonance technologies to first detect fatty liver disease and then to detect a difference in
      liver health between pediatric patients with a normal BMI and those with a BMI â‰¥85%. This
      study will consist of two phases and a reproducibility arm involving 19 voluntary subjects
      from Phase 1 and the control group.

      Phase I:

      Aim 1: To determine the prevalence and relative risk of liver fibrosis, steatosis,
      steatohepatitis and hemosiderosis in overweight and obese US Military dependents between ages
      10 and 17 compared with normal weight controls using specialized MRI (LMS).

      Aim 2: To compare results between MRI-LMS and MRE and to determine feasibility of one versus
      the other technology.

      Aim 3: To compare liver health of controls and overweight/obese subjects to determine if
      there is a difference between groups.

      Aim 4: To test for various biomarkers that have been shown to have an association with NASH

      Phase II:

      Aim 1: To evaluate the effectiveness of a nine month intervention consisting of diet and
      exercise education on the maintenance or reduction of liver steatosis, steatohepatitis, and
      fibrosis.

      Aim 2: To establish whether early imaging can predict short-term clinical outcomes (eg
      development of pre-diabetes, worsening NAFLD, development of NASH, or a change in liver
      stiffness or fibrosis as measured by MRE and LMS, respectively).

      Reproducibility Arm Aim 1: To evaluate the consistency of the LMS/MRE data.
