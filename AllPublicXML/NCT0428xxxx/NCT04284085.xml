    <textblock>
      Objective. The main objective is to determine the effectiveness of a psychoeducational
      program conducted by rehabilitation professionals to reduce the number of suicidal behaviors
      in prisons.

      Methodology. The design of the study will be a multicenter, randomized, two-group clinical
      trial with blind evaluation of response variables, one year follow-up. The study population
      will be a male and female prison population of a total of two Catalan prisons. As a dependent
      or outcome variable, the total number of suicidal behaviors recorded for 12 months after the
      intervention will be determined. As independent variables, socio-demographic, clinical and
      prison situation variables will be collected. The suicidal ideation will be measured with the
      Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). The anxiety and depression with Hamilton
      scale for assessing anxiety (HDRS) and the Hamilton scale for assessing severity of
      depressive symptoms (HAM-D). The EuroQoL-5D Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D) to measure quality
      of life. And a satisfaction survey of psychoeducational group intervention. Participants who
      meet the inclusion criteria will be divided into two groups, an intervention group that will
      conduct group sessions with a frequency of two per week and duration of 90 minutes for a
      total of 13 sessions, and a control group that will receive information on suicide
      counseling.

      Discussion. Mortality from suicide is higher in the prison population than in the general
      population. This project aims to evaluate the effect of a psychoeducational intervention on
      reducing the number of suicidal behaviors in prison, in order to evaluate their
      implementation at the level of the entire prison network.
