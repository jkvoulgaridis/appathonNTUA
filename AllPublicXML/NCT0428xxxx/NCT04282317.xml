      The study is to lay the groundwork for non invasive imaging of the GI tract and the brain gut
      interaction

  <detailed_description>

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) produces non-invasive exquisite spatial resolution of
      internal organs. However, its application to the GI tract has been limited by several
      challenges. The GI tract has a complex and convoluted geometry. The GI geometry changes
      slowly over the course of meal digestion, as well as rapidly due to contraction of various
      compartments of the GI tract. As a person takes natural breaths during MRI, the respiratory
      motion further complicates the acquisition and analysis of GI images. In addition, different
      types of meal or nutrients have variable property as image contrast in upper GI MRI. It is
      difficult to standardize the MRI analysis for accurate and quantitative assessment of gastric
      emptying, motility, absorption, and secretion, to name a few. In a recently published study
      by our research collaborators at Purdue University, they have addressed many of these
      challenges in rodents and are ready to refine and translate their technical solutions to
      human upper GI MRI.

      Functional MRI of the brain has been used to study afferent response in various GI disorders,
      such as dysphagia, functional dyspepsia, and irritable bowel syndrome.1-3 Brain activity is
      altered in the emotional response areas, and activity is reduced in the areas associated with
      top-down modulation of visceral afferent signals.4 However, direct correlation between
      regional brain activation by functional-MRI and GI motility by meal-contrast MRI is lacking.

      The outcome of the proposed research is expected to lay the groundwork for non-invasive
      imaging of GI anatomy and function and the brain-gut interaction towards better
      understanding, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of GI disorders.
