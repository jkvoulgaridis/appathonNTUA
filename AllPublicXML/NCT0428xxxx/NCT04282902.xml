  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The acute lung injury caused by SARS and 2003 were both related to the inflammatory cytokine
      storm in patients. The biochemical test showed abnormal increase in related indicators such
      as interleukin-8, and CT images showed a medical &quot;white&quot; lung&quot;. According to the experience
      of SARS treatment in 2003, the use of hormones will indeed help the patients to alleviate
      their illness, but patients who survived SARS either had too much hormone at that time and
      took too long. Although the lungs could recover, but the femoral head was necrotic Either the
      amount of hormones was very conservative at the time, which kept the lungs in the storm of
      inflammatory factors, leading to the emergence of irreversible pulmonary fibrosis. So is
      there a medicine that can anti-inflammatory, reduce the load of hormone use, and have the
      effect of treating and preventing pulmonary fibrosis complicated by severe viral lung? At
      present, pirfenidone has achieved encouraging results in the treatment of idiopathic
      Pulmonary Fibrosis (CTD-ILD) diseases. It is particularly encouraging that the values
      announced at the 2019 ATS Annual Conference suggest that pirfenidone has more
      anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects than its own outstanding anti-fibrotic ability.
      The data shows early use, Its strong anti-SOD activity can effectively inhibit IL-1beta and
      IL-4, and can open the prevention mode of pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. Based on the
      above, this project intends to make the following scientific assumptions: based on the
      homology of the pathogens of the new coronavirus-infected pneumonia and the coronavirus
      infection of pneumonia in 2003, the similarities in the occurrence and development of the
      disease, that is, the pulmonary inflammatory storm occurs first, and thereafter The progress
      of fibrosis and the progressive decline of lung function and mortality are higher than those
      of ordinary pneumonia. We hope that by adding pirfenidone as a treatment program in addition
      to standard treatment, it will be a new and severe type of coronavirus infection. Patient
      clinical treatment provides an effective and practical method.

      This study is a multi-center, randomized, open, blank-controlled, multi-stage clinical study.
      As there are no effective treatments, the project team will evaluate possible treatments
      (including but not limited to Pirfenidone) based on actual conditions. Ketone, Pirfenidone,
      lopinavir / ritonavir, remdesivir, single / polyclonal antibodies against coronavirus),
      explore the most effective treatment options.

      The first phase will assess the efficacy and safety of approximately 147 (primarily
      estimated) hospitalized adult patients diagnosed with Wuhan new coronavirus infection in the
      pirfenidone-treated group compared to standard treatment.

      Patients with influenza within 14 days of onset of symptoms were screened and randomly
      assigned as soon as possible after screening (within 4 day). Patients will be allocated in a
      1: 1 ratio and divided into the pirfenidone treatment group or the standard treatment group
      only. Patients who do not meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria are only allowed to be
      re-screened once, provided that the time from onset of symptoms to randomization remains
      within 14days.

      This study planned to randomize approximately 147 adult subjects. They will be stratified
      according to whether the onset time is ≤ 14 days and randomly divided into groups of 1: 1,
      receiving standard treatment or pirfenidone orally 3 times a day, 2 tablets each time. The
      course is 4 weeks or more. Subjects and all research center staff were not blinded.

      Study selection criteria: (1) Age ≥ 18 years. (2) Clinically diagnosed patients with new type
      of coronavirus pneumonia include: on the basis of meeting the criteria for suspected cases,
      one of the following pathogenic evidence: ① real-time fluorescent RT-PCR of respiratory
      specimens or blood specimens for detection of new coronavirus nucleic acid; Respiratory or
      blood specimens are genetically sequenced and highly homologous to known new coronaviruses.
      (3) The time interval between the suspected neocoronary pneumonia pneumonia case and the
      random enrollment is determined within 4 days to 7 days according to the history symptoms and
      chest CT imaging. Cough, diarrhea, or other related symptoms can be used. The imaging changes
      are mainly based on chest CT.

      Study exclusion criteria: (1) AST and ALT&gt; 1.5 x ULN at visit 1; (2) bilirubin&gt; 1.5 x ULN at
