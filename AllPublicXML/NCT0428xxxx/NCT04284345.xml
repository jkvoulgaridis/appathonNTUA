  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presence of inducible myocardial ischemia is considered as the prerequisite for the
      clinical benefit of coronary revascularization. In this regard, the introduction of invasive
      pressure-derived physiological indices to guide myocardial revascularization represented a
      major breakthrough for the treatment of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), by
      moving the focus of coronary revascularization from anatomy to physiology . The main premise
      of coronary physiology is to permit determination of the functional significance of
      individual stenoses on a per-vessel basis, measurable at the time of clinical decision-making
      process, thus providing an objective marker to identify ischemic lesions, and therefore
      patients, most likely to benefit from coronary revascularization .

      Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is the most widely used pressure-derived invasive physiological
      index for coronary lesion assessment in contemporary clinical practice. FFR is calculated as
      the ratio of the mean distal coronary pressure (Pd) to the mean proximal coronary pressure
      (Pa) across a stenosis during maximal hyperaemia, a condition that is commonly achieved by
      the intracoronary or intravenous administration of a potent vasodilator agent, such as
      adenosine. Based on the results of landmark clinical trials, most recent guidelines recommend
      the use of FFR to identify hemodynamically significant coronary lesions in patients with
      stable CAD. Despite this, the worldwide adoption of FFR into current clinical practice
      remains limited , accounting for only 9.8% of coronary procedures in Switzerland . Potential
      reasons for the low adoption rate of coronary physiology include technical challenges and
      time consumption related to FFR measurements, inadequate or lack of reimbursement, physician
      preferences, patient-related discomfort, contraindications and costs associated with
      adenosine, or in certain countries, no availability of adenosine.

      The low use of FFR in clinical practice provided a rationale for the development of new
      invasive physiology indices. By negating the need for administration of pharmacologic agents
      such as adenosine, saving time, and reducing costs and side effects, hyperaemia-free
      pressure-derived physiological indices were developed to increase adoption of
      physiology-guided coronary revascularization into routine clinical practice.
