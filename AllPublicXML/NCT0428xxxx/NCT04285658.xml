  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this study are to improve the ability of pediatric patients and their caregivers
      to select surgical treatment options for kidney stones and to enable urologists to use
      techniques that result in the best outcomes for these surgeries.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rapid increase in the incidence of kidney stones among youth has resulted in a large
      population of patients who require surgery to removes stones but for whom little evidence
      exists to guide clinical care. Proper selection of surgical treatment options, which is
      directed by patient-specific factors and individual treatment goals, is the greatest
      determinant of successful outcomes.

      This is a prospective cohort study. Investigators seek to compare stone clearance,
      re-treatment, and unplanned healthcare encounters for ureteroscopy, shockwave lithotripsy,
      and percutaneous nephrolithotomy.

      Additionally, Investigators also seek to compare patients' experiences after ureteroscopy,
      shockwave lithotripsy, and percutaneous nephrolithotomy.

      Setting/Participants:

      This study will be conducted by the Pediatric KIDney Stone (PKIDS) Care Improvement Network,
      which includes 20 pediatric healthcare systems (22 sites) in the United States.

      Patient participants include patients aged 8 to 21 years who undergo a surgical intervention
      for kidney stones as part of their clinical care. The surgical interventions include
      ureteroscopy, shockwave lithotripsy, and percutaneous nephrolithotomy, all of which would be
      performed as part of routine clinical care.

      Study Interventions and Measures:

      Stone clearance will be assessed with ultrasound (obtained as part of clinical care) 6 weeks
      after surgery, which is the standard of care at all PKIDS sites. Re-treatment and unplanned
      healthcare encounters will be assessed within the first 3 months after surgery. Patients'
      experiences will be measured through questionnaires administered pre-operatively and within 3
      months after surgery.

    <description>Patients' experiences before and after URS, SWL, and PCNL will be measured. Investigators will assess the immediate and delayed impact of surgery on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) selected by PKIDS patient partners. The patient reported outcomes (PROs) include the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), other questionnaires commonly used in studying the impact of kidney stone disease on health states, and urinary tract symptoms.</description>

    <description>An outpatient endoscopic surgery that accesses the ureters and kidneys per the urethra to fragment and remove the stones. Many patients who undergo ureteroscopy (URS), Shockwave lithotripsy (SWL), or percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) also have temporary tubes placed after the surgery to facilitate drainage, either internally (a stent) or externally (a nephrostomy tube).</description>

    <description>A minimally invasive surgery in which a ~1cm flank incision is made, and a scope is passed through a tubular sheath into the kidney to fragment and remove the stone. There is typically a 1- to 2-day hospital stay. Many patients who undergo URS, SWL, or PCNL also have temporary tubes placed after the surgery to facilitate drainage, either internally (a stent) or externally (a nephrostomy tube).</description>

    <description>A non-invasive outpatient procedure that targets stones in the kidney or ureter with x-ray or ultrasound and uses shockwaves generated outside the body to fragment them; the fragments pass down the ureter and the patient expels them in the urine. Many patients who undergo URS, SWL, or PCNL also have temporary tubes placed after the surgery to facilitate drainage, either internally (a stent) or externally (a nephrostomy tube).</description>

        guardian consents for study participation.

        2b. Individuals for whom native-language questionnaires are not available can also
        participate in stone clearance assessment and EHR surveillance.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients for whom conducting informed consent and baseline study procedures would
             confer additional risk (e.g. obstructing ureteral stone with fever requiring emergency
             surgery) and delay necessary immediate clinical care.

          2. Parent/guardians or patients, who, in the opinion of the Investigator, may be
             non-compliant with study schedules or procedures
