  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Septic shock is defined as a subset of sepsis with severe metabolism alterations, leading to
      organ failure. Septic shock is associated with a high mortality, around 40% according to the
      SEPSIS 3 definition.

      Metabolic alterations are responsible for lactic acidosis, and results in mitochondrial
      dysfunction.

      This study aims at evaluate the impact of exogenous metabolites on restoring mitochondrial
      function in septic shock patients with lactate acidosis.

      Mitochondrial metabolism (quantitative analysis, mitochondrial function) in intact Peripheral
      Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) will be isolate and analyse from patients at the early phase
      of septic shock (admission), at day 2 and 4. Participant's medical history will be recorded:
      renal and liver metabolism, severity scores and outcomes and the need for supportive care in
      the intensive care unit (ICU) until 28 days after admission.

      Furthermore, the investigators will evaluate wether selected metabolites added to the cell
      culture medium may improve mitochondrial metabolism.

      In this prospective study, the investigators will include patients admitted to the medical
      ICU of Angers University Hospital and meeting the SEPSIS-3 criteria for the definition of
      septic shock (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score &gt; 2, hyperlactatemia &gt; 2
      mmol/L and sepsis).

      Blood samples will be collected during the usual care of initial resuscitation and analyzed
      in the laboratory INSERM (Institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale) U1232
      (University Hospital of Angers).

      Mitochondrial metabolism will be analyzed in freshly isolated PBMC and after culture for 1-3
      days, with or without the addition of selected metabolites to the cell culture medium.

      The evolution of ketogenesis, mitochondrial function, acidobasic status will be assessed
      across the time (blood samples at day 2 and 4).

      Survival, renal and liver metabolism, severity scores and outcomes and the need for
      supportive care in the intensive care unit (ICU) until 28 days after admission will be
      recorded.
