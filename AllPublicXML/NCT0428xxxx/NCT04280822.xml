  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of neo-adjuvant immunochemotherapy on survival of patients with thoracic
      esophageal squamous cell carcinomas remains unknown. One of our objectives is to evaluate
      whether the neo-adjuvant immunochemotherapy Toripalimab (JS001) with cisplatin and paclitaxel
      followed by right thoracic approach esophagectomy with total 2-field lymph node dissection
      improves the overall survival of thoracic esophageal cancer patients versus neo-adjuvant
      chemotherapy.

      The effect of immunochemotherapy in second line treatment of esophageal cancer got a positive
      results in the world. We tried to apply the immunotheray in resectable esophageal cancer and
      have planed this phase III clinical trials. The optimal management of resectable esophageal
      squamous cell carcinomas may have a new chapter in the era of immunotherapy.
