  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gait enables individuals to move forward and is considered a natural skill. However, gait
      disturbances are very common in patients with burn injury. Major causes of functional
      impairment are pain and joint contractures. Recent studies focused on the application of
      robot-assisted gait training (RAGT). This study aimed to elucidate the efficacy and
      investigate the mechanism of motor recovery after RAGT on patients with lower extremity burn.

      This study aimed to elucidate the efficacy and investigate the mechanism of motor recovery
      after RAGT on patients with lower extremity burn.

      20 patients with burn were randomly divided into 2 groups. RAGT group received RAGT 5
      sessions per week at duration 30 minutes with 30 minutes conventional physical therapy in 12
      weeks. SUBAR® (CRETEM, Korea) is a wearable robot with a footplate that assists patients to
      perform voluntary muscle movements. The conventional group underwent conventional physical
      therapy twice a day, 5 times a week in 12 weeks. Main outcomes were functional ambulatory
      category(FAC), 6 minutes walking test(6MWT), visual analogue scale(VAS), isometric forces of
      bilateral knee and ankle muscles, and foot pressure analysis before and after 12 weeks
      training.
