  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 2010 Child Nutrition Reauthorization provided funding to test innovative strategies to
      end childhood hunger and food insecurity. Demonstration projects were funded in Chickasaw
      Nation, Kentucky, Navajo Nation, Nevada, and Virginia. This study focuses on Kentucky.

      Households in the treatment group received an extra monthly SNAP benefit amount through two
      new intervention-related deductions to the SNAP benefit formula: (1) a fixed deduction,
      depending on county of residence, for transportation costs for six round trips to the grocery
      store per month; and (2) an earnings deduction equal to 10 percent of earned income for
      households with at least one employed household member. Households in the control group
      continued to receive their regular monthly SNAP benefit amounts.

      Objective: To reduce child food insecurity in rural households by raising Supplemental
      Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits to offset higher transportation costs and
      further strengthen SNAP work incentives.

      Target Population: SNAP households with: (1) positive net income, (2) at least one child
      under the age of 18 by the end of the demonstration period, and (3) living in 17
      geographically isolated and poor counties in eastern Kentucky.

      Intervention: Households were randomly assigned to either a treatment or control group.
      Households in the treatment group received an extra monthly SNAP benefit amount through two
      new intervention-related deductions to the SNAP benefit formula: (1) a fixed deduction,
      depending on county of residence, for transportation costs for six round trips to the grocery
      store per month; and (2) an earnings deduction equal to 10 percent of earned income for
      households with at least one employed household member. Households in the control group
      continued to receive their regular monthly SNAP benefit amounts.
