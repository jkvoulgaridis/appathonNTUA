  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test if Baduanjin training can reduce the hyperactive-impulsive
      symptoms of children with Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) compared to routine
      excise. Investigators will also evaluate if the Baduanjin training will positively affect
      Chinese Traditional Medicine (TCM) symptoms compared to controls and if these impacts are
      related to the change of the executive function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ADHD is a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a persistent pattern of
      inattention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity, resulting in functional impairment in
      multiple settings. The prevalence in China is estimated to be 6.26%. From the point of
      Chinese Traditional Medicine (TCM), ADHD can be divided into 4 categories according to the
      symptom differentiation in TCM.

      Aerobic exercise is known to improve executive function (EF) performance, which is known as
      the core deficit of ADHD, therefore reduce ADHD symptoms. Aerobic exercise with the component
      of self-control and development of character is reported to improve EF.

      Baduanjin is one of the aerobic exercises that has been handed down since the northern song
      dynasty, serving as Chinese physical and breathing exercises. The eight movements of
      Baduanjin are required to be gentle, slow, elastic and appropriate which not only require the
      practitioner to control physical activity but also require a combination of cognitive
      activities. Researchers found that Baduanjin has a positive protective effect on cognitive
      function such as selective attention in patients with mild cognitive impairment adults.

      Therefore, investigators designed the Baduanjin training system. This is a combination of a
      physical and cognitive training program and a video game with a motivation system,
      interesting and engaging for children with ADHD to practice on.

    <masking_description>The medical treatment of participants will be given by a doctor who does not know the study group of the patient. The investigator of the primary outcome and secondary outcome will also be unaware of the grouping of the patient. One psychiatrist blind of grouping will ask parents about the ADHD Hyperactivity/Impulsivity symptom of their children and rate it with SNAP-IV Hyperactivity/Impulsivity score. Another Chinese traditional medical doctor blind of grouping will evaluate the severity of traditional Chinese medicine symptoms of children and rate it with TCM symptom scale.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Questionnaire (SNAP-IV) Rating Scale is a revised version of the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham (SNAP) Questionnaire that utilizes the DSM-IV criteria for ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder, rated by caregiver or professionals. It comprises three subscales: Inattention, Hyperactivity/Impulsivity, and Oppositional Defiant Disorder. The score of each item is rated with a 4-point Likert scale (0 = not at all, 3 = very much). We choose the 9-item-Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscale for the evaluation of change in ADHD Hyperactivity/Impulsivity symptom in children. The score of Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscale is calculated by adding the 9 items, the score will range from 0 to 27. The change of score is calculated by Hyperactivity/Impulsivity score at 3 months enrollment (both Baduanjin practice group and Regular physical exercise group went through 3 months of intervention at this point) minus Hyperactivity/Impulsivity score at baseline (enrollment).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The TCM symptom scale was developed from the guideline system for traditional Chinese medicine new drug clinical research to evaluate the severity of TCM symptoms of children. This scale include 23 items, each presents one common TCM symptom. Each symptom is rated 1-4 points according to its severity. The total score is calculated by adding the scores of all 23 items. The change of score is calculated by TCM symptoms score after 3 months of enrollment (both Baduanjin practice group and Regular physical exercise group went through 3 months of intervention at this point) minus TCM symptoms score at baseline (enrollment).</description>
