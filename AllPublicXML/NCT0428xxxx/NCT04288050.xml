  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, chronic end-stage renal disease affects more than 11,000 new patients each year
      who will require dialysis or renal transplantation, of whom approximately 22.6% of new cases
      are related to diabetes. Among them, about 94% are managed by hemodialysis (HD), the others
      by peritoneal dialysis (PD). In addition, nearly 42% of dialysis patients have diabetes.
      There are issues related to glycemic control during dialysis and specific to each dialysis
      technique. Thus, hypoglycemic risk is the main risk observed during hemodialysis sessions,
      linked in particular to the use of a 1g/L glucose free dialysate, a decrease in renal
      neoglucogenesis and alterations in metabolic pathways. In addition, long-term glycemic
      control is difficult to assess in dialysis patients, because of the limitations of HbA1c
      witch is frequently underestimated.

      This can be explained by 2 mechanisms:

        -  EPO treatment is associated with an increase in the proportion of young Ã©rythrocytes

        -  reduction in the lifetime of red blood cells reducing the duration of interaction
           between glucose and hemoglobin.

      The results of studies conducted using continuous glucose measurements over a short period of
      time (48 hours to 5 days) suggest a benefit in using continuous glucose measurement to detect
      glycemic fluctuations during dialysis. To our knowledge, no studies have been conducted to
      evaluate longer-term glycemic control with this technology. In addition, the investigators
      now have the Freestyle, which allows us to record the continuous measurement of interstitial
      glucose over a longer period of time and is reimbursed for people on insulin basal-bolus
      protocol.

      Thus, the investigators propose an observational study to evaluate glycemic control during
      dialysis sessions, but also to analyze the correlation between parameters measured with
      Freestyle and HbA1c measured routinely, according to the follow-up recommendations in
      diabetics.
