  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Health care legislation, management and administration&quot; is a basic subject offered in the
      physical therapy university degree. The juridical features of this subject usually provokes a
      lack of motivation between students. Although not commonly used in university teaching,
      gamification could provide further affordances for improving students' engagement which
      provokes better assistance and learning outcomes.
