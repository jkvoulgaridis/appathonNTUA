  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a growing public health problem that affects more
      than 5% of the population and can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. These
      patients are at greater risk of cardiovascular and hepatic death, and higher rates of
      neoplasms, both gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal. The standard treatment is weight loss
      with diet and physical exercise, which has shown a histological and analytical improvement in
      patients who achieve a 5-10% reduction in body weight. However, less than 25% of subjects
      achieve this goal. Restrictive surgical treatments and gastric bypass have achieved, in obese
      patients, an improvement in metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance and liver histology, but
      in patients with liver cirrhosis the morbidity-mortality of this surgery is high. Currently,
      endoscopic techniques are being developed, which are less invasive and have fewer
      complications, and which also achieve gastric restriction with similar characteristics to
      those obtained by the surgical method. Among them is the tubulization or vertical
      gastroplasty with the OverStitch system (Apollo Endosurgery, Austin, TX, USA). However, this
      method has not been evaluated in patients with obesity and/or metabolic syndrome and NASH
      cirrhosis. For this reason, the main objective of the investigators study is to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of endoscopic gastroplasty in improving metabolic factors and liver
      histology in patients with obesity with or without metabolic syndrome and NASH-compensated
      cirrhosis.

        Given the lack of previous studies on the efficacy of this technique in this type of
        patient, this proof-of-concept study will include a relatively small number of patients in
        order to obtain safety data and preliminary estimates of efficacy.

        Patients must present with obesity (BMI ≥ 30) associated or not with a metabolic syndrome
        according to NCEP ATP III criteria, which is already an indication for endoscopic
        treatment, and the diagnosis of cirrhosis by NASH according to histology (See inclusion
        criteria), which is a relative contraindication for the performance of bariatric surgery.

             estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] of less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2). If an
             abnormal value is obtained at the first screening visit, eGFR measurement may be
             repeated before randomisation within the following time frame: minimum 4 weeks after
             the initial test and maximum 2 weeks before the intended randomisation. Repeated
             abnormal eGFR (less than 60 ml/min/1,73 m2 ) leads to exclusion from the study.
