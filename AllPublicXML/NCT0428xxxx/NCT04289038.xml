      In this study, there will be three groups: intervention group 1 with training, counseling and
      autogenic relaxation (OR), intervention group 2 with training, counseling and virtual reality
      game application and control group with routine nursing care. The number of volunteers to be
      included in the study was determined by power analysis. Forty patients with itch symptoms
      will be included in each group. Preliminary application for all three groups will be
      performed in the patient group registered to the Dialysis Unit of the Nephrology Department
      of Hacettepe University and Baskent University Hospital. Socio-Demographic Form, 5-D Itch
      Scale, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Dermatology Life Quality Index, State and Trait Anxiety
      Scale, Pruritus Behavior and SGO / OR Application Log, Dietary Behavior of Hemodialysis
      Patients Scale, Hemodialysis Patients Diet Information Scale and Digital Skin Moisture
      Measurement Device will be used.
