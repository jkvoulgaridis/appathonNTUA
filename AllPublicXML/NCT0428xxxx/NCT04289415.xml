  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with substance use disorders have low employment rates and are to a large extent on
      the outside of the ordinary labor market. Individual Placement and Support (IPS) is an
      evidence based method developed to aid persons with severe mental disorders in obtaining
      ordinary work. IPS has been used clinically in the addiction field, but has been subject to
      little research. The trial &quot;From addiction to employment&quot; is a randomized controlled trial to
      investigate the effect of an IPS intervention on employment outcome among substance use
      disorder patients in specialized health care treatment in Oslo, Norway. The study is
      conducted at the Department for Substance Use Disorder Treatment at Oslo University Hospital.
      The trial begins to include patients March 1st 2020 and will include for two years, until
      February 28th 2022.

      The target population in this project is patients in SUD treatment who wish to gain
      employment. The goal of the study is to determine the effectiveness of IPS in helping persons
      with SUD obtain ordinary employment. A pragmatic, two-arm, parallel, superiority, randomized
      controlled trial will be conducted. The project is financed through innovation funding from
      the South Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority, the Norwegian Directorate of Health and
      internal resources from OUS. Participants will be allocated randomly to either an employment
      specialist whom they will have individual contact with for the coming 13 months or shorter
      (intervention), or to a self-help and four-sessions work shop intervention (control
      comparison). The intervention fidelity will be assessed by external evaluators according to
      the Norwegian translation of the IPS Fidelity Scale. Patients will be recruited to the study
      over a period of two years, and followed for 18 months my data collection and up until 10
      years in national registries.

    <description>The intervention used in this study will be a time-limited version of IPS. The employment specialist offers up until nine months job-search support and four months in-work support, giving a total of 13 months job-related support. If a participant succeeds in obtaining work before nine months has passed the remaining job-search support months may be transferred to in-work support time.
In the follow-up time while seeking employment, the employment specialists will work with the participants to identify skills and aspirations, establish contact with potential employers and ensure economic advice and help with benefits planning. The in-work support involves individual and regular contact with the participant and the employer.
All participants who receive this intervention will do so in addition to their clinical treatment. The treatment provider and the employment specialist should cooperate and clarify roles together with the patient.</description>
