  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ENTERPRISE 2 vascular
      reconstruction device and delivery system (hereinafter referred to as ENTERPRISE 2) to
      facilitate endovascular coil embolization of intracranial aneurysms.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm observational study, in which enrolled
      patients will be implanted with the ENTERPRISE 2 for evaluation of safety and effectiveness
      of ENTERPRISE 2 in real-world applications.

      The study population will consist of 164 patients with ruptured or unruptured intracranial
      aneurysms and a parent vessel diameter of ≥2.5 mm and ≤4 mm. All patients will be implanted
      with the study device.

      The enrolled patients will be followed at 30 days, 180 days, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4
      years and 5 years post procedure.

      The primary endpoint is the incidence of aneurysm recanalization (at 180 days) evaluated
      through digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Secondary effectiveness endpoints include
      incidence of aneurysm recanalization (at 1 year), successful stent/coil placement rate
      (immediately post procedure), aneurysm occlusion (immediately post procedure, at 180 days and
      1 year), incidence of retreatment (at 30 and 180 days, and 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years). Safety
      evaluation include: incidence of disabling stroke or neurological death (at 180 days and 1
      year), incidence of in-stent thrombosis (at 180 days and 1 year), and incidence of in-stent
      stenosis (at 180 days and 1 year). Exploratory endpoints include stent wall apposition
      performance (intra-procedure), first-time deployment success rate (intra-procedure) and
      duration of stent deployment (intra-procedure).

    <description>Incidence of aneurysm recanalization (at 180 days) = number of target aneurysm recanalization (at 180 days) ÷ total number of target aneurysms receiving follow-up × 100%. The results of aneurysm angiography at 180-day follow-up will be obtained through DSA, and the post-procedure immediate aneurysm recanalization shown in angiograms will be graded as per the Raymond-Roy Classification Scale.
The Raymond-Roy Classification at each follow-up time point increased by ≥ one class relative to that immediately after the procedure is defined as recanalization (e.g., Class I immediately after the procedure, Class II at 180-day follow-up).</description>

    <measure>Incidence of aneurysm recanalization</measure>
    <time_frame>at 1 year post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of aneurysm recanalization (at 1 year) = number of target aneurysm recanalization (at 1 year) ÷ total number of target aneurysms receiving follow-up × 100%. The results of aneurysm angiography at 1 year follow-ups will be obtained through DSA or MRA or CTA.</description>

    <measure>Successful stent/coil placement rate</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Successful stent/coil placement rate = number of target aneurysms with successful stent/coil placement ÷ total number of target aneurysms× 100%.
Successful stent/coil placement is defined as successful stent deployment and successful delivery and placement of the coil at the target aneurysm assessed immediately post procedure through angiography.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Aneurysm occlusion</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately post procedure, at 180 days and at 1 year post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Aneurysm occlusion rate = number of target aneurysms with Raymond-Roy Class I or II aneurysm occlusion÷ total number of target aneurysms× 100%.
The aneurysm occlusion will be assessed by classifying the post-procedure immediate aneurysm occlusion shown in angiograms based on the Raymond-Roy Classification.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of retreatment</measure>
    <time_frame>at 30 days, 180 days, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of retreatment = number of target aneurysms receiving retreatment during the follow-up ÷ total number of target aneurysms receiving follow-up ×100%.
Retreatment refers to any intervention to the target aneurysm after completing first stent-assisted coil embolization for the target aneurysm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of disabling stroke or neurological death</measure>
    <time_frame>at 180 days, at 1 year post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of disabling stroke or neurological death = number of patients with disabling stroke or neurological death ÷ total number of patients receiving follow-up × 100%.
Stroke is defined as rapidly developing clinical signs of focal (or global) disturbance of cerebral function lasting more than 24 hours with no apparent cause other than of vascular origin, including ischemic stroke or hemorrhagic stroke (i.e., intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH), SAH, subdural hemorrhage (SDH), epidural hemorrhage (EDH)).
Disabling stroke is defined as mRS score ≥ 3 assessed at a minimum of 90 days (+/- 30 days) post-stroke event.
Neurological death, also called brain death, refers to irreversible loss of the capacity for consciousness combined with the irreversible loss of all brainstem functions, including the capacity to breathe.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of in-stent thrombosis</measure>
    <time_frame>at 180 days, at 1 year post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of in-stent thrombosis = number of target aneurysms with parent vessel (in-stent) thrombosis during follow-up ÷ total number of target aneurysms receiving follow-up ×100%.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of in-stent stenosis</measure>

    <description>Incidence of in-stent stenosis = number of target aneurysms with parent vessel (in-stent) stenosis during follow-up ÷ total number of target aneurysms receiving follow-up ×100%.
Mild, moderate, and severe in-stent stenosis is clinically defined as a stenosis of &lt;33%, 33-67%, and ≥67%, respectively, comparing with non-stented parent vessel [43, 44]. In this study, moderate and severe in-stent stenoses (with a stenosis of ≥33%) of the parent vessel are defined as in-stent stenosis.</description>
