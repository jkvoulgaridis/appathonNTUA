  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Calcium dobesilate has been recommended to treat diabetic retinopathy due to its potential in
      protecting against retinal vascular damage. However, there was limited evidence exploring its
      efficacy in combating diabetic retinopathy progression. This study, a single-blind,
      multicenter, cluster-randomized, controlled superiority trial, was designed to evaluate
      whether calcium dobesilate could prevent diabetic retinopathy progression into an advanced
      stage among Chinese patients with mild to moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

      A total of 1,200 patients with mild to moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy will
      be enrolled and randomly assigned at a ratio of 1:1 into the control group (that is,
      conventional treatment group) and the intervention group (that is, conventional treatment
      plus calcium dobesilate [500 mg, 3 times per day] for 12 months). The severity of diabetic
      retinopathy will be assessed by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study scale.
