  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      OTL-200 is a cryopreserved dispersion for infusion containing autologous CD34+ cell enriched
      population that contains haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) transduced ex vivo
      using a lentiviral vector encoding the human arylsulfatase A (ARSA) gene. MLD is an autosomal
      recessive lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) characterized by severe and progressive
      demyelination affecting the central and peripheral nervous system. The aim of this clinical
      study is to assess the pharmacodynamic effect and long-term clinical efficacy and safety of
      OTL-200 in Late Juvenile MLD patients.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        All the following criteria need to be met:

          -  Documented biochemical and molecular diagnosis of MLD, based on ARSA activity below
             the normal range and identification of two disease-causing ARSA alleles.

          -  0/R or R/R genotype or a genotype recognized as associated with the LJ variant of MLD.

          -  a) If symptomatic: age at disease onset between ≥7 and &lt;17 years of age (i.e. before
             their 17th birthday). OR

          -  b) If pre-symptomatic: participant must be &lt;17 years of age at treatment (i.e. before
             their 17th birthday) AND must have a sibling with a diagnosis of late-juvenile MLD
             variant based on age at disease onset (≥7 and &lt;17 years of age i.e. before sibling's
             17th birthday), with biochemical and molecular diagnosis.

          -  Normal cognitive function as defined by an IQ≥85 on age appropriate cognitive scales.

          -  a) If the participant is &lt;7 years (i.e. before their 7th birthday): normal motor
             milestones achievement, normal gross motor function according to chronological age and
             normal neurological examination (if applicable based on the age of the subject,
             GMFC-MLD = 0) OR b) If participant is ≥7 years: normal gross motor function or mild
             gross motor function impairment, defined by a GMFC-MLD 0 or 1 (i.e. patient is able to
             walk independently).

          -  If applicable, participant willing and capable of compliance with contraceptive use
             requirements.

          -  Participant (or if applicable, parent/legal guardian) providing signed informed
             consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented HIV infection (positive HIV RNA and/or anti-p24 antibodies).

          -  Malignant neoplasia (except localised skin cancer) or a documented history of
             hereditary cancer syndrome

          -  Myelodysplasia, cytogenetic alterations characteristic of myelodysplastic syndrome
             (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or other serious haematological disorders.

          -  Patients currently enrolled in other interventional trials

          -  Has previously undergone allogeneic HSPC gene therapy (HSPC-GT) and has evidence of
             residual cells of donor origin.

          -  Previous gene therapy.

          -  Has symptomatic herpes zoster, not responsive to specific treatment.

          -  Evidence of active tuberculosis (TB) based upon medical examination, chest imaging and
             TB testing

          -  Acute or chronic stable Hepatitis B (HBV) as evidenced by positive Hepatitis B surface
             antigen (HBsAg) test result at screening or within 3 months prior to onset of
             conditioning and/or positive HBV DNA

          -  Presence of positive Hepatitis C RNA test result at screening

          -  End-organ dysfunction, severe active infection not responsive to treatment, or other
             severe disease or clinical condition which, in the judgment of the investigator, would
             make the participant inappropriate for entry into this study.

          -  In addition to the potential infections tested per protocol, the PI should consider
             testing for other transmissible infectious agents listed in the European Union (EU)
             Cell and Tissue Directive as clinically appropriate and results must be discussed with
             the Orchard medical monitor prior to stem cell harvest.

          -  Participants with alanine transferase (ALT) &gt;2x upper limit of normal (ULN) or total
             bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN may be included only after discussed and agreed with the Orchard
             medical monitor and considered in the context of the criterion for excluding
             participants with other severe disease. Isolated elevation of total bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN
             is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35% of total.
