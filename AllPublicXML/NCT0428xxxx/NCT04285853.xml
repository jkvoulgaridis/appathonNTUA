      As the public health sector continues to confront the opioid epidemic, orthopaedic surgeons
      must revisit pain management protocols to reduce unnecessary opioid prescriptions. The
      long-term goal is to reduce opioid use and residual opioids in circulation. The purposes are
      to 1) conduct a double-blinded randomized controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of
      opioid versus non-opioid medications on post-surgical pain, and 2) examine predictors of
      opioid usage in individuals following Anterior Cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.
      Patients will use an innovative Smartphone application to track pain and medication usage.
      Additionally, patients will complete quality of life and pain catastrophizing questionnaires,
      as well as undergo pain threshold testing, to be used in a model to determine predictors of
      greater post-surgical opioid use. This study will provide information on non-opioid
      alternatives and specific predictors of post-surgical opioid use that can be used to develop
      prescribing protocols. These findings will help orthopaedic surgeons make informed decisions
      when tailoring individualized prescriptions for patients following ACL reconstruction.
      Importantly, findings will be readily translatable into research to reduce opioid use in
      other orthopaedic surgical cohorts as well. Our ultimate goal is to lessen the burden of the
      opioid epidemic on not only our orthopaedic patients, but also society, by minimizing the
      number of opioids left in circulation.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain level: Numeric Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperative days 0-6</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will record pain levels on Numeric Rating Scale 1-10, where 1 is minimal pain and 10 is associated with highest level of pain (worse outcome).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Quality of life: Euro Quality of Life Index (Euro QoL 5-D 5-L) EQ-5D</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperative days 0-6, 6 weeks post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be measured with the instrument Euro Quality of Life Index (Euro QoL 5-D 5-L) EQ-5D is a standardized measure of health status that measures five dimensions, Mobility, Self-care, Daily activities, Pain/Discomfort, Anxiety/ Depression. Each dimension can be rated at five levels: from no problems to major problems. The five dimensions can be summed into a descriptive health state with 11111 representing no problems in any of the five health dimensions and 55555 indicating major problems in any of the five health dimensions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain catastrophizing scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperative days 0-6, 6 weeks post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>It will be determined with the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS). Pain catastrophizing is described as &quot;an exaggerated negative mental set brought to bear during actual or anticipated painful experience.&quot; In other words, it is a feeling of helplessness. The PCS is a 13-item questionnaire that inquires about thoughts and feelings a patient experiences when in pain. Responses are recorded on a 5-point Likert scale (&quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;all the time&quot;). A total score is yielded ranging from 0-52. Higher score is associated with worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain threshold testing</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperative days 0-6, 6 weeks post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>will be conducted with digital pressure dolorimeter (Wagner Force One Model FDIX 50TM, Wagner Instruments). Pressure dolorimeters are devices that measure pressure/pain threshold. The device will be held perpendicular to the areas to be tested. The force will be increased at a constant rate of 1 kg/cm2. Patients will be instructed to express pain either by saying &quot;ouch&quot; or raising their hand when pain is felt. The force read on the digital dolorimeters will be recorded. This procedure will be repeated 3 times. Both right and left sides will be tested.</description>
