  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm pilot study to evaluate the use of web-based video conferencing as a
      method of exercise training delivery. This study will include 10 female breast cancer
      survivors and 10 male prostate cancer survivors. For the first 12 weeks on study (Part 1),
      participants will train with an exercise physiologist (EP) for 150 minutes/week. This
      training will be delivered by web-based video conferencing. For the next 12 weeks (Part 2),
      participants will be instructed to do patient-directed exercise.
