    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, 2-part, Phase 1 study to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics, and preliminary clinical activity of TAS1440 administered as a single agent
      and in combination with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in participants with acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML) who have relapsed or are refractory (r/r) to prior treatment. The study
      duration is expected to be approximately 30 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Have a projected life expectancy of at least 12 weeks and be in stable condition to
             complete 1 full cycle (4 weeks) of treatment.

          2. Have histological confirmation of AML by World Health Organization (WHO) 2016 criteria
             and who have failed all other available conventional therapies.

          3. Have a peripheral blood or bone marrow blast count &gt;5% at the time of enrollment.

          4. Have disease that:

               1. is refractory to standard induction chemotherapy, including but not limited to
                  anthracycline and cytarabine combination therapy, or

               2. has relapsed after anthracycline and cytarabine therapy or stem cell transplant
                  (SCT), or

               3. is refractory to or has relapsed after a front-line regimen containing a
                  hypomethylating agent, alone or in combination.

          5. Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status of 0 to 1.

          6. Have adequate renal function as demonstrated by a serum creatinine ≤1.5 × upper limit
             of normal (ULN) or calculated creatinine clearance (by the standard Cockcroft-Gault
             formula) of ≥60 mL/min.

          7. Have adequate liver function as demonstrated by the following:

                  limit of normal (ULN)

               2. AST and ALT &lt;5 × ULN (if considered due to leukemic organ involvement).

          8. Women of child-bearing potential (according to recommendations of the Clinical Trial
             Facilitation Group [CTFG]) must not be pregnant or breastfeeding and must have a
             negative pregnancy test at screening.

         11. Active, uncontrolled infection. Participants with an infection receiving treatment
             (antibiotic, antifungal, or antiviral treatment) must be afebrile and hemodynamically
             stable for ≥72 hours before enrollment.

         14. Any other condition that puts the participant at an imminent risk of death.

         15. Treated with any investigational therapy within 2 weeks of the first dose of study
             treatment.

         16. Inability to swallow oral medication.
