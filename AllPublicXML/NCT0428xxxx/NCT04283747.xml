  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      B cells are considered major contributors to multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis, a role
      that has taken on renewed importance with the advent of B-cell-depleting therapies. Rituximab
      is being increasingly utilized as an off-label treatment option across MS patients .

      In addition, there have been increasing reports of rituximab causing hypogammaglobulinaemia
      and antibody deficiency across a variety of conditions including MS and related
      neuroinflammatory disorders.

      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the rate of hypogammaglobulinemia in
      rituximab-treated MS adult patients and to assess the correlation with vaccination response
      during the treatment.

      This is a prospective study which will be conducted in an educational medical hospitals in
      Sari, Iran.Adult patients with diagnosis of multiple sclerosis compatible with 2017 McDonald
      criteria and history of treatment with rituximab at least 3 times( 18 month) , enrolled to
      this study.Demographic patients' characteristics, including age, sex, vital sign, past
      medical history, drug history, will be recorded. Disease duration prior to rituximab, total
      rituximab dose, prior immunomodulatory drugs, Adverse drug reactions, the time interval
      between the last rituximab infusion and need for intravenous immunoglobulin replacement
      therapy and infections are recorded. Moreover, we will assess IgG and IgM levels, VZV titer
      at before rituximab administration and 6, 12, 18, months following the initiation of next
      dose of rituximab.
