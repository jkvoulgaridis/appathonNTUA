      To establish risk rating criteria of biological protein marker, determine the role and
      consistency of aGVHD biomarkers in aGVHD diagnosis and aGVHD prognosis, and evaluate the the
      impact on non-relapse mortality and relapse and disease free survival, the multicenter study
      on aGVHD biomarkers detection in the patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation was performed.
