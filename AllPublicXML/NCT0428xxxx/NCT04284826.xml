  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intralesional Mitomycin-C (MMC) injection has recently been introduced to resolve refractory
      benign esophageal stricture mostly in children. The investigators aimed to evaluate the
      clinical efficacy of endoscopic postdilation intralesional injection of MMC in adults with
      refractory benign esophageal stricture.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participnts who have refractory benign esophageal stricture even after five or more
      sessions of bougination are prospectively enrolled. A submucosal needle injection of 4mL of a
      MMC preparation (0.5mg/mL) is endoscopically done with a 0.5mL of eight each injection mainly
      into the tearing esophageal wall, after esophageal bougie dilation is done upto 14mm in
      diameter. And then, repeated bouginations combined with MMC injection are done with the
      interval of eight weeks upto 3 times, if dysphagia symptoms recurr with dysphagis score 3 or
      more. Initial and overall clinical success rates are evaluated with drug and
      procedure-related complication rates during the follow-up period of at least 1 year.
