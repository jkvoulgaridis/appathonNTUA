  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resting metabolic rate (RMR) is the amount of energy the body uses at rest, and accounts for
      60%-70% of daily energy expenditure. Although measured at rest, RMR is strongly influenced by
      physical activity because the increased metabolic rate during exercise is partially carried
      over even when exercise stops. Therefore, persons who are physically active maintain higher
      RMR and less body fat than do sedentary controls. It is well known that high energy intake
      stimulates whereas caloric restriction reduces RMR. Food thermogenesis corresponds to
      approximately 10% of daily energy expenditure. Diet-induced thermogenesis is greater on a
      high protein and carbohydrate diet than on a fat diet. Other factors the affect RMR are age
      (RMR tends to decline progressively over the life span) and body composition (lean body mass
      is regarded as the main determinant of RMR). However, the research regarding the effect of a
      specific combination of macronutrients and exercise on RMR is scarce.

      Therefore, the aim of the current study is to assess the combined effect of a meal
      composition and physical activity on RMR in normal weight and overweight children,
      adolescents and adults.

      One hundred (100) healthy volunteers, 50 normal weight (NW) and 50 overweight (OW), age 6-30
      will be recruited for the current study. All participants and/or their parents will sign
      informed consent prior to their participation. Participants will visit the clinic 4 times,
      with a week's difference between them. Participants will arrive at the clinic after 12 hours
      of fasting and avoiding physical activity for 14 hours. During the first visit, their RMR
      will be measured, and 15min later they will perform 60 min of aerobic training, and 15
      minutes later they will be asked to drink 300ml of water, followed by a second RMR test. In
      the consecutive visits they will follow the same routine without the first RMR test, and
      drink either carbohydrate enriched shake, protein enriched shake or fat enriched shake; in a
      random order.
