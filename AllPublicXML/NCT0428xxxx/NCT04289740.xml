  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emotional disorders such as anxiety and depression are highly prevalent during adolescence
      and associated with functional impairment that commonly extends into adulthood. In the
      primary care (PC) setting, these disorders are frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated.
      Objective: To carry out a prospective, randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy
      of a new transdiagnostic cognitive behavioural group therapy (TD-CBT) protocol for
      adolescents (age 12 to 18 years) compared to group relaxation therapy (RT). Methods: Two-arm,
      single-blind, RCT (expected N=160) to compare group TD-CBT for emotional disorders to group
      RT. The group TD-CBT will be administered in seven sessions (90 min/session) over 12 weeks.
      Psychological assessments will be carried out at baseline, post-treatment, and at months 3,
      6, and 12 after treatment. The assessments will include measures of depression, anxiety,
      somatization, quality of life, disability, and cognitive-emotional factors. The study will be
      conducted in two PC centres located in Cantabria, Spain. Discussion: This is the first RCT to
      evaluate the efficacy of group TD-CBT for emotional disorders in adolescents in the PC
      setting in Spain. If, as expected, the results confirm the superiority of TD-CBT to
      conventional RT, the widespread implementation of this new approach—based on scientific
      evidence obtained in a real-world, primary care setting—could improve treatment outcomes and
      quality of life in adolescents suffering from anxiety or depression.
