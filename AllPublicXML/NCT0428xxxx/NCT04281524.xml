  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters (PICCs) are commonly used in patients with cancer to
      administer chemotherapy and supportive care medication. However, PICCs and other medical
      devices that come into contact with blood increase the risk of blood clots (thrombosis)
      inside the blood vessels. Conventional blood thinners (anticoagulants) may reduce the risk of
      thrombosis but they also increase the risk of bleeding. CSL312, a monoclonal antibody that
      inhibits the activated blood clotting factor 12 (FXIIa) will be assessed for its potential to
      prevent thrombus formation in subjects with cancer at risk of PICC-associated thrombosis.
