  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel radiotracer 99mTc-RWY targeting Integrin α6 was developed, and the pilot
      first-in-human study for SPECT imaging of breast cancer was performed in seven healthy
      volunteers and two breast cancer patients to assess the safety and potential clinical
      applications of 99mTc-RWY.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Integrin α6 associates with the survival and migration of breast cancer cells, which emerges
      as a predictor of reduced overall survival and worse prognosis. In this study, we developed
      an integrin α6-targeted radiotracer 99mTc-RWY for SPECT imaging of breast cancer. The safety,
      biodistribution and radiation dosimetry were studied in seven healthy volunteers, and the
      clinical potential of 99mTc-RWY was examined in two breast cancer patients. A single dose of
      11.1 MBq/kg 99mTc-RWY was injected intravenously. Visual and semiquantitative methods were
      used to assess the SPECT/CT images. The routine Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) staining and
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining were subsequently carried out to confirm the Integrin α6
      expression of tumors.
