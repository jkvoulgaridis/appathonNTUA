    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to validate the G-walk for several gait parameters, tested against a
      gold standard three dimensional camera system. This research will inform researchers and
      practitioners as to whether the G-Walk is a suitable and valid tool to easily assess walking
      ability in people with chronic stroke.

      Twenty chronic stroke survivors will be recruited for this study from an independent
      neuro-physiotherapy practice and community exercise programme.Gait analysis will be used to
      look at several gait parameters through the use of a three-dimensional visual analysis system
      based in our Biomechanics Lab at the University of Winchester. Participants will attend
      testing one testing session of approximately 1 hour. During this testing session functional
      measures and walking trials will be assessed. Participants will first be asked to complete a
      set of simple movements that will contribute towards Fugl Meyer questionnaire. Twenty eight
      reflective markers will then be attached to specified joints and segments of the body, such
      as the thigh, with double sided sticky tape to allow for data collection through the camera
      system to collect kinematic data. The belt mounted accelerometer (G-Walk) will be positioned
      around the waist over the L5 vertebrae. Participants will be asked to perform 6 walking
      trials of 10m to collect 3D kinematic and accelerometer gait data.

        Chronic stroke (&lt;3month post stroke) will be recruited from a neuro-physiotherapy practice,
        community-based stroke support groups and community exercise programme. All participants
        would have been diagnosed with stroke by a specialist neurologist/stroke consultant from a
        UK National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust, and have undertaken normal inpatient and
        outpatient rehabilitation in accordance with NICE guidelines (National Institute of Health
        and CARE
