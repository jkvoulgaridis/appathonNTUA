  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of BIIB078 in
      participants with chromosome 9 open reading frame 72-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
      (C9ORF72-ALS).

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the pharmacokinectic (PK) of BIIB078 in participants
      with C9ORF72-ALS.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have completed study NCT03626012 through the first follow-up clinic
             visit that follows the final dosing visit without missing more than 1 dose of study
             treatment.

          -  Participants taking concomitant riluzole at study entry must be on a stable dose for
             ≥30 days prior to the first dose of study treatment (Day 1). Participants taking
             concomitant riluzole must be willing to continue with the same dose regimen throughout
             the study, unless the Investigator determines that riluzole should be discontinued for
             medical reasons, in which case it may not be restarted during the study.

          -  Participants taking concomitant edaravone at study entry must be on a stable dose for
             ≥60 days prior to the first dose of study treatment (Day 1). Participants taking
             concomitant edaravone must be willing to continue with the same dose regimen
             throughout the study, unless the Investigator determines that edaravone should be
             discontinued for medical reasons, in which case it may not be restarted during the
             study. Edaravone may not be administered on dosing days of this study.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of drug abuse or alcoholism ≤6 months before study enrollment that would limit
             participation in the study, as determined by the Investigator.

          -  Presence of an implanted shunt for the drainage of CSF or an implanted central nervous
             system (CNS) catheter.

          -  History of or positive test result at Screening for human immunodeficiency virus. The
             requirement for testing at Screening may be omitted if it is not permitted by local
             regulations.

          -  Treatment with another investigational drug (including investigational drugs for ALS
             through compassionate use programs) or biological agent within 1 month of Screening or
             5 half-lives of study agent, whichever is longer.

        Note: Other protocol-specific inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
