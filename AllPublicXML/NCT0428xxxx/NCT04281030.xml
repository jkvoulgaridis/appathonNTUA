  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot feasibility acceptability study to examine the impact of smartphone-based
      progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) on migraine quality of life, frequency, intensity, and
      disability. Feasibility is measured by: a) Proportion of patients who enrolled in the
      study/were recruited for the study, b) Number of days PMR practiced/week as determined with
      the backend analytics in the RELAXaHEAD app, c) Minutes/day spent doing PMR, d) Reasons for
      non-adherence. Acceptability is measured by: a) Satisfaction using Likert scale questions on
      RELAXaHEAD usability, content, and functionality b) Willingness to repeat a similar treatment
      intervention in the future (Definitely No/Probably No/Unsure/Probably Yes/ Definitely Yes) c)
      Attrition. In addition, whether use of electronically based PMR introduced in the ED improves
      migraine quality of life (MSQv2) at 3 months post ED-discharge (or post enrollment date if
      recruited post ED discharge) compared to those who are not introduced to PMR will be
      assessed. All participants (N=85) will complete a migraine quality of life assessment and
      track their headache frequency and intensity using our smartphone application (app).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While explaining the study, potential participants will be assured that they will receive all
      of the medication for their acute headache that they would otherwise receive. Once consented,
      participants will be randomized to PMR therapy or monitored usual care (MUC). Participants
      will be told that either group is being tested as an enhancement to the care they typically
      get in the ED for headache. (At the end, they will be informed which group they were in.) The
      study team will collect participants' health histories (biologic variables) and baseline data
      in REDCap, download the app onto subjects' smartphones, and conduct the sessions.

Any migraine treatment decisions on discharge will be left up to the ED attending. The RC will load the APP onto the subjects' smart phones but the PMR component will be blocked on the version of the APP that the MUC subjects receive. All subjects will be asked to keep records of headache occurrence, side effects, compliance, and medication changes on the APP.</description>
