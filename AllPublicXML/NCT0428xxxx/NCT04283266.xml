  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of a synbiotic containing
      fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) and Bifidobacteria (VES002 LMG P-28149) on intestinal transit
      in middle-aged subjects characterized by a low number of defecations per week.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Middle-aged subjects, who met ROME III criteria for constipation, received daily two sachets
      of either synbiotic or for 5 days, then they received daily 1 sachet for the next 25 days.

      The primary endpoint of this trial is to evaluate the effect of supplementation in synbiotic
      containing fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) and Bifidobacteria (VES002 LMG P-28149) on
      intestinal transit in middle-aged subjects characterized by a few bowel movements per week.
      The secondary endpoints are to evaluate both clinical criteria such as changes in stool
      appearance, quality of life and mood, relief and satisfaction of participants; and biological
      criteria such as changes in markers of gut function, low-grade chronic inflammation markers
      and gut microbiota composition. The safety of product use and compliance are also evaluated

      Synbiotic group. The dietary supplement under study was composed of fructo-oligosaccharides -
      FOS: 4.95 gr / sachet and Bifidobacterium animalis lactis: VES002 (LMG P-28149): 5 billion /
      sachet. Sachets of powder were diluted in a in 200 ml of water at room temperature to be
      taken before breakfast. Doses were 2 sachets per day for the first 5 days and then 1 sachet
      per day for the next 25 days.

      Placebo group. The placebo looked strictly identical to the synbiotic and contained only
      excipients (60% maltodextrin / 40% sucrose). Sachets of powder were diluted in a in 200 ml of
      water at room temperature to be taken before breakfast. Doses were 2 sachets per day for the
      first 5 days and then 1 sachet per day for the next 25 days.

    <description>stool frequency and consistency were investigated through daily self-assessment using the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS). The BSFS classifies stools into 7 categories, including type 1, separate hard lumps, like nuts; type 2, sausage-shaped, but lumpy; type 3, like a sausage but with cracks on the surface; type 4, like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft; type 5, soft blobs with clear-cut edges; type 6, fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool; type 7, watery, no solid pieces</description>
