    <textblock>
      In vitro maturation is a valid option for PCO(S) patients in the daily ART clinic, however
      maturation and embryologic development are not yet matching the efficiency levels obtained by
      standard COS treatment. To further enhance embryo quality after IVM, it was hypothesized to
      keep the connection and communication between oocyte and cumulus cells intact for a prolonged
      pre-maturation culture before IVM was initiated. This has been investigated and established
      using a meiotic blocker C-type Natriuretic peptide (CNP).

      The CNP peptide is present in high concentrations in the growing follicle, is produced by the
      mural granulosa cell compartment and binds to the Natriuretic peptide receptor 2 (NRP2)
      present in the cumulus cells. Binding of CNP on NRP2 leads to intracellular cGMP increase in
      cumulus cells, which travels through the transzonal projections to the oocyte. In the oocyte,
      cGMP will block the resumption of meiosis.

      Using CNP as natural inhibitor of meiosis, a new medium was designed to allow oocyte and
      surrounding cumulus cells to communicate and hence gain in competence for an additional
      culture period: the pre-maturation phase or Capacitation phase (CAPA). This system was
      devel-oped in mouse, tested in human in UZ Brussel on research material (toelating federaal
      EC: CFE-FCE ADV_073_ZUBrussel, toelating lokaal EC: 2016/411 BUN 143201630723) and used in a
      clinical setting in Vietnam.

    <textblock>
      The current IVM system in use in the clinic has a single step approach and seems to be less
      efficient compared to research and literature findings using a biphasic CAPA-IVM system in
      terms of maturation.

      To ascertain the efficiency of the biphasic CAPA-IVM system, both standard IVM and CAPA-IVM
      will be performed on sibling oocytes: maturation in standard IVM in the investigator's center
      is on average 47.5%, where CAPA-IVM reaches 62% maturation in literature.

      The investigators aim to prove superiority of the CAPA-IVM system in terms of maturation.
      Also fertilization and embryo development will be compared.

      The participants admitted to the study will be receiving both the standard IVM treatment for
      part of the participant's oocytes and the biphasic CAPA IVM system for the second part of the
      participant's oocytes.

      In one ovary a regular oocyte pick up (OPU) will take place with oocytes assigned to the
      standard IVM treatment, in the other ovary the CAPA IVM system will be applied. This means
      oocytes that are liberated from the follicular environment need to be exposed immediately to
      the inhibiting CNP peptide and herefore the tubes to collect the follicle fluid from the
      punctured follicles are prefilled with CNP supplemented medium. The OPU procedure is
      identical for both ovaries and according to our standard OPU IVM procedure with the sole
      difference of empty or prefilled tubes to collect follicle fluid.

      Oocytes from the 2 ovaries are separately processed in the lab according to attributed
      protocol.

      After IVM of oocytes, mature oocytes are subjected to ICSI with partner's sperm or donor
      sperm. Partner's sperm sample will be frozen at the latest the day of egg retrieval and will
      be thawed the day of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI): due to the use of 2 different
      IVM protocols with 2 different time lines (30 hours maturation versus 24 hours+30 hours
      maturation), ICSI will take place on two consecutive days with a freshly thawed straw of
      sperm cells for each day.

      Embryo development is followed until day 3 (cleavage stage) after ICSI. All embryos of
      sufficient quality will be vitrified for a deferred embryo transfer in a hormone replacement
      therapy (HRT) cycle. One embryo will be selected for embryo transfer based on the
      morphological quality assessment parameters, with the better quality as first choice for
      transfer, regardless the preceding IVM method. Frozen single embryo transfer cycles are
      repeated until pregnancy.

    <description>CAPA IVM is a 2-step In vitro Maturation system in which an additional culture step, in which the oocytes are kept in meiotic arrest by the presence of the C-type Natriuretic peptide (CNP) for 22-24 hours, is preceding the in vitro maturation step in which maturation medium is supplemented with amphiregulin (AREG). The 'IVM System' of Medicult-Origio is used as a base medium.</description>

This is the current standard procedure in the clinical practice using the commercially available 'IVM System' of Medicult-Origio.

    <description>CAPA medium keeps oocytes in meiotic arrest for 22-24 hours. IVM medium allows oocytes to resume meiosis.
CAPA medium: 10% human serum albumin (HSA) + 10nM estradiol (E2) + 25nM CNP + 5ng/ml Insulin + 1mIU/ml follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) IVM medium: 10% HSA + 10nM E2 + 5ng/ml Insulin + 101mIU/ml FSH + 100ng/ml AREG CNP: peptide naturally occurring in follicles to maintain meiotic arrest, E2: estrogen, enhances effects of CNP, Insulin: basic growth factor used in cell cultures and component of commercially available LAG medium of the standard IVM system, AREG: downstream effector of the LHCG receptor which helps meiotic resumption. HSA, FSH and hCG are CE labeled. CAPA IVM medium is currently not yet available as CE marked commercially available medium and needs to be prepared in house.</description>
