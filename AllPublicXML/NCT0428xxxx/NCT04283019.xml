  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of oral Cannabidiol
      (with or without low levels of THC), under acute and chronic dosing conditions.

    <textblock>
      Participants (N=60), will be randomized to 1 of 3 oral dosing conditions that include: 100mg
      CBD/3.7mg THC (0.39% THC), 100mg CBD/2.8mg THC (0.3% THC), or 100mg CBD/0mg THC (0.0% THC).
      Participants will first complete an 8-hour drug administration session and after this initial
      session, participants will take participants' assigned study drug for the next 14 days at
      home, twice daily (participants will visit the lab on days 2, 7, and 14). Participants will
      return on day 21 (after 1 week washout) for a final visit. During the 8-hour session and
      visits occurring during the following 21 days, participants will provide biospecimens (urine,
      blood, oral fluid, hair) which will be tested for cannabinoid concentrations. Pharmacodynamic
      assessments (subjective and cognitive effects) will also be assessed during these visits.

          2. History of or current evidence of significant medical or psychiatric illness judged by
             the investigator to put the participant at greater risk of experiencing an adverse
             event due to exposure or completion of other study procedures.

          3. Use of an over-the-counter (OTC), systemic or topical drug(s), herbal supplement(s),
             or vitamin(s) within 14 days of study entry; which, in the opinion of the investigator
             or sponsor, will interfere with the study result or the safety of the subject.

             medication metabolized via CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2B10, or which induce/inhibit CYP3A4
             enzymes.

          5. Use of hemp seeds or hemp oil in any form in the past 3 months.

             bleeding, or other significant oral cavity disease or disorder that in the
             investigator's opinion may affect the collection of oral fluid samples.

          8. History of clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias or vasospastic disease (e.g.,
             Prinzmetal's angina).

          9. Enrolled in another clinical trial or have received any drug as part of a research
             study within 30 days prior to dosing.
