  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of gene therapy in boys with DMD. It is a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with two thirds of participants assigned
      to gene therapy. The one third of participants who are randomized to the placebo arm will
      have an opportunity for treatment with gene therapy at the beginning of the second year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the efficacy of PF-06939926 gene therapy on ambulatory function while
      also monitoring its safety. Approximately 99 boys with DMD will be enrolled and randomly
      assigned to one of two groups: approximately two thirds will be in Cohort 1 and receive gene
      therapy at the start of the study; approximately one third will be in Cohort 2 and receive
      placebo at the start of the study and receive gene therapy after one year, as long as it
      remains safe to do so. The treatment (PF-06939926 gene therapy or placebo) will be given as
      an intravenous infusion lasting up to 2 hours.

      The study includes boys who are at least 4 years old and less than 8 years old (including 7
      year olds up until their 8th birthday). All boys will need to be on a daily dose of
      glucocorticoids (prednisone, prednisolone, or deflazacort) for at least 3 months prior to
      enrolling and to stay on daily glucocorticoids for the first 2 years of the study. All boys
      will need to be negative for neutralizing antibodies against AAV9, as measured by the test
      done for the study as part of screening.

      The primary outcome of the study will be assessed at 52 weeks. All participants will be
      followed in the study for 5 years after treatment with gene therapy.

      The study medication, all medical tests associated with the study, and the visits to the
      study sites are free of charge. Participants will also be supported for travel costs
      associated with study visits.
