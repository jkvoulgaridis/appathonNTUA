  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ureteric stents are used often following ureteroscopy for prevention of obstruction from
      edema and/or stone fragments.

      Up to 75% of patients experience pain following stenting, as well as lower urinary tract
      symptoms (LUTS) such as finding blood in the urine, voiding often, the need to urinate
      quickly resulting in a significant source of morbidity. The negative impact of stents results
      in a significant impact on health related quality of life.

      There is no standard of care for managing ureteric stent pain and lower urinary tract
      symptoms following surgery. A combination of Î±-blockers, antimuscarinics, acetaminophen,
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids are currently the mainstay for treatment of
      post-operative pain and LUTS following stenting.

      Mirabegron is a beta-agonist that mediate relaxation of the detrusor muscle and has been
      useful in treating overactive bladder (OAB) which has similar symptoms to patients with an
      ureteric stent in place. Our goal is to assess if mirabegron can improve symptoms and
      decrease the need for additional pain medications.

      The investigators hypothesize that Mirabegron is effective in decreasing ureteral stent
      related LUTS and pain.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary outcome of this trial is to assess ureteral stent pain related using a visual analog scale (VAS) and the cumulative score of the 8 pain questions from the Ureteral Stent Symptom Questionnaire (USSQ).</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of the study is to determine if Mirabegron is effective in decreasing ureteral stent related pain following ureteroscopy when compared to placebo. The visual analog scale (VAS) is a validated, subjective method for measuring pain. The patient makes daily a handwritten mark on a 10-cm line that represents a continuum between 0 (&quot;no pain&quot;) and 10 (&quot;worst pain&quot;) based on his/her perception of their current state. The VAS score is determined by measuring in millimeters from the left hand end of the line to the point marked by the patient. Pain will also be measured utilizing the &quot;Body Pain&quot; section (questions P1-P9) from the Ureteral Stent Symptoms Questionnaire (USSQ). This is a self-administered questionnaire for patients to report their symptoms for comparison, enabling the comparison between the two treatment arms. Higher scores are associated with greater intensity of symptoms reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Opioid consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>This secondary objective is to determine if Mirabegron is effective in decreasing the opioid consumption in order to tolerate stent pain related. The total opioid consumption will be calculated by counting the number of Hydromorphone tablets used per patient plus the opioid equivalence for the Tylenol ES tablets used.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life impact of Mirabegron for stent symptoms as measured with the Ureteral Stent Symptoms Questionnaire - USSQ.</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>This secondary objective is to determine if Mirabegron is effective in improving the urinary symptom score utilizing the Ureteral Stent Symptom Questionnaire - USSQ questions U1-U11 from the USSQ. This is a self-administered questionnaire for patients to report their symptoms for comparison, enabling the comparison between the two treatment arms. Higher scores are associated with greater intensity of symptoms reported. (Time Frame: Measured twice, once at the time of surgery when stent is inserted and secondly at the time the stent is removed occurring 7days later.)</description>

This is a self-administered questionnaire for patients to report their symptoms for comparison, enabling the comparison between the two treatment arms. Higher scores are associated with greater intensity of symptoms reported.
