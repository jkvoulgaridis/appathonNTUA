      The purpose of this study is; determine whether sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP)
      measurement is a useful method for assessing respiratory muscle strength in multiple system
      atrophy patients and correlate it with standard maximal inspiratory mouth pressure
      measurement.

      Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a sporadic, neurodegenerative disease that begins in
      adulthood, progressive, unexplained. Brain stem degeneration is thought to play a role in
      respiratory symptoms such as stridor, sleep-related respiratory disturbances and respiratory
      failure in MSA patients. Respiratory disorders were emphasized and evaluated in MSA during
      the studies. However, the pattern of pulmonary anomalies or the performance of the
      inspiratory muscles is not well defined in the MSA.

      Inspiratory muscle strength is assessed by voluntary or involuntary tests. The most commonly
      used reference values are the known maximal inspiratory mouth pressure (PImax) measurement
      for ease of use. In people with neuromuscular disease, the influence of the orofacial muscles
      can cause air leakage from the mouth. As a result, low values may be due to air escape which
      caused by true respiratory muscle weakness, submaximal effort or weakness of the facial
      muscles.

      The purpose of this study is; determine whether sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP)
      measurement is a useful method for assessing respiratory muscle strength in multisystem
      atrophy patients and correlate it with standard maximal inspiratory mouth pressure
      measurement.

      For this purpose; demographic information (sex, age, occupation, height, body weight ...),
      clinical and medical status, diagnosis date and Mini Mental Status Scale data of all
      participants will be recorded at the visit. Inspiratory muscle strength will be evaluated
      with sniff nasal inspiratory pressure and maximal inspiratory mouth pressure.

    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum inspiratory pressure (PImax) is the classic volitional test of inspiratory muscle strength. It is measured as the highest mouth pressure (cmH2O) sustained for 1 s during a maximum inspiratory effort against a quasi occlusion. Evaluation is carried out according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) / European Respiratory Society (ERS) criteria.</description>

    <measure>Sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP) measurement is a volitional noninvasive assessment of inspiratory muscle strength. A maximum of 10 sniffs is generally used. It is a simple procedure consisting of measuring peak nasal pressure (cmH2O) as a result of maximal sniff performance through from the end of expiration with the open nostril while the other one is closed.</description>

    <measure>Forced vital capacity (FVC)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Forced vital capacity (FVC) is the volume of air that can forcibly be blown out after full inspiration, measured in liters. FVC is the most basic maneuver in spirometry tests. Pulmonary function test is performed to determine FVC.</description>

    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) is the volume of air that can forcibly be blown out in first 1 second, after full inspiration. Pulmonary function test is performed to determine FEV1.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>FEV1/FVC</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1/FVC is the ratio of FEV1 to FVC. In healthy adults, this should be approximately 70-80% (declining with age).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak expiratory flow (PEF)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Peak expiratory flow (PEF) is the maximal flow (or speed) achieved during the maximally forced expiration initiated at full inspiration, measured in liters per minute or in liters per second. Pulmonary function test is performed to determine PEF.</description>
