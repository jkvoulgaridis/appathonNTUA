  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women are recommended to be physically active ≥150 min/week, but &lt;15% of Norwegian
      women attain this goal. Several well-designed studies on lifestyle interventions focusing
      primarily on exercise training in overweight/obese pregnant women have reported disappointing
      outcomes with regard to maternal glycemic control, gestational weight gain and infant
      outcomes. Low adherence to the training program was found to be a problem; the participants
      did not enjoy the exercise program and had difficulties scheduling time to exercise. Pregnant
      women also report that they are not sure what exercises are safe during pregnancy.

      High intensity interval training (HIT), defined as short periods of intense activity
      separated by low-intensity breaks, has proved to induce superior improvements in insulin
      sensitivity and fitness compared with continuous moderate intensity training in individuals
      at increased risk for cardiometabolic diseases. Even short-term (6 weeks) HIT with brief
      (15-60 sec) work-bouts and a total time commitment of &lt;45 min per week, improves insulin
      sensitivity similar to that attained after 6 months of traditional endurance training.

      HIT is feasible and enjoyable for individuals with low fitness level and with obesity.

      HIT is therefore a highly potent intervention that elicits important changes in a range of
      clinically relevant health outcomes in reproductive-aged women.

      This study will investigate fetal responses to a single bout of HIT. Preliminary data of the
      investigators suggest that HIT does not negatively influence fetal heart rate. Others have
      reported that uterine and umbilical blood flow are not changed during or following acute
      exercise. However, no previous study has determined the acute effect of HIT on uterine blood
      flow and there are no studies investigating the fetal blood flow distribution in response to
      exercise. Since the relative distribution of blood to the fetal liver is associated with
      newborn adiposity, fetal blood flow distribution in response to exercise can provide insight
      about the effect of maternal exercise on offspring health.
