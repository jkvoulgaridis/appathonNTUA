  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on barriers identified in a systematic literature search, a self-report questionnaire
      called &quot;BIOTICA&quot; has been developed by the research team to assess medication adherence
      barriers to oral AB. The purpose of the BIOTICA-questionnaire is to detect individual
      barriers that prevent the optimal intake of oral AB and thus, lead to inadequate adherence or
      persistence to the regimen. A study is now needed to establish construct validity.
      Correlation between the answers to the BIOTICA-questionnaire and the electronically monitored
      intake of the oral AB will be analyzed in the general population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Global consumption of oral antibiotics (AB) is increasing, with 80% of all prescriptions in
      Europe stemming from primary care, mostly against respiratory tract infections. Adequate
      intake behavior (i.e. adherence) to oral AB is vital to prevent therapeutic failure, to
      reduce the risk of microbial resistance, to reduce health care consumption, medication waste
      and environmental pollution. However, non-adherence among oral AB users reaches rates of
      21%-38% during an AB treatment course. To improve medication adherence, understanding patient
      barriers to treatment is crucial. Based on barriers identified in a systematic literature
      search, a self-report questionnaire called &quot;BIOTICA&quot; has been developed by the research team
      to assess medication adherence barriers to oral AB. The purpose of the BIOTICA-questionnaire
      is to detect individual barriers that prevent the optimal intake of oral AB and thus, lead to
      inadequate adherence or persistence to the regimen. A study is now needed to establish
      construct validity (also called criterion, convergent or concurrent validity) that is, to
      generate evidence that the questionnaire measures what it is intended to. Thus, the
      instrument under investigation (i.e. BIOTICA-questionnaire) will be distributed at the same
      time as the targeted attribute (i.e. adherence to oral AB) will be electronically monitored
      in the general population. The correlation between the two measurements will be analyzed.
