      A Multicenter Study Conducted to Evaluate the Performance of the LumiraDx Influenza A/B + RSV
      Test at Point of Care Testing Sites
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The LumiraDx Influenza A/B + RSV Test is a rapid microfluidic immunofluorescence assay for
      use with the LumiraDx instrument for the qualitative detection and differentiation of
      Influenza type A, Influenza type B and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) viral antigens. The
      test is not intended to detect influenza C antigens. The LumiraDx Influenza A/B + RSV assay
      uses nasal swabs or nasopharyngeal swab specimens, collected from symptomatic patients.

      Approximately 2000 subjects will be enrolled in this study. 120 influenza A positive, 120
      influenza B positive and 120 RSV positive samples are required, in addition to at least 120
      samples negative for influenza and 120 negative RSV samples, representing four (4) age
      groups: ≤ 5 years, 6 to 21 years, 22 to 59 years, and ≥ 60 years. Depending on the prevalence
      of influenza A, influenza B or RSV, it will be necessary to collect a significantly higher
      number of total samples to obtain the required number of positives. Banked specimens may be
      used to supplement the data set.

      The objectives of this clinical study are twofold:

        -  Evaluate the performance of the LumiraDx Influenza A/B + RSV Test in detecting and
           differentiating influenza A, influenza B and RSV in fresh nasal or nasopharyngeal swab
           specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of influenza and or RSV-like illness, as
           compared with an FDA-cleared comparative method.

        -  Evaluate LumiraDx Influenza A/B + RSV Test performance when the test is run by
           non-laboratory users in point-of-care (POC) locations representative of sites who
           perform testing under a CLIA certificate of waiver.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject may be of any age and either sex.

          -  Preliminary assessment of the subject by the Investigator/designee should be
             suggestive of influenza and/or RSV at the time of the study visit. The subject must
             exhibit two (2) or more of the following signs and symptoms for eligibility: stuffy or
             runny nose, sneezing, cough, sore throat, dyspnea (labored, difficult breathing),
             wheezing, fatigue, weakness and/or malaise, arthralgia (joint pain), myalgia (deep
             muscle aches), anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or headache. The onset of these symptoms
             must not have begun more than four (4) days prior to study enrollment.
