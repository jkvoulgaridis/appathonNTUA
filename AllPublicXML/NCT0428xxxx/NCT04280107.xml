  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to evaluate any relation between elongated styloid process (ESP) and
      type of Temporomandibular Joint Disorders (TMD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The styloid process (SP) of the temporal bone is a long conical cartilaginous projection lies
      anterior to the mastoid process. Patients who have ESP or styloid chain calcification are
      usually asymptomatic, only 4% are symptomatic. Symptoms vary as different syndromes which
      related affected anatomic structures by calcified process or ligament. Temporomandibular
      Dysfunction (TMD) describe the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disfunction that divided three
      branches according to temporomandibular joint's disc status: non-displacement (ND),
      displacement with reduction (DWR) and displacement without reduction (DWoR). Since orofacial
      pain shows similar features in both ESP or styloid chain calcification and TMD, it is
      possible to confuse and misdiagnosis both of these clinical conditions. This study aimed to
      investigate the length and calcification pattern of the styloid process in patients with TMD
      diagnosis.

    <description>For this study, 154 patient files who were admitted to the radiology department of the faculty of dentistry between 2013 and 2019 with complaints such as TMJ pain, mouth opening restriction, joint sound, joint function disorder were scanned retrospectively. Inclusion criteria: TMD patients with MR and CBCT images recorded in the digital archive. Exclusion criteria: Patients who have been operated or treated from TMJ, patients with head and neck trauma, patients with orthodontic treatment.</description>
