  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>PROMIS SF - Physical Function</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS Physical Function instruments measure self-reported capability rather than actual performance of physical activities. This includes the functioning of one's upper extremities (dexterity), lower extremities (walking or mobility), and central regions (neck, back), as well as instrumental activities of daily living, such as running errands. A single Physical Function capability score is obtained from a short form.Each question usually has five response options ranging in value from one to five. To find the total raw score for a short form with all questions answered, sum the values of the response to each question.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>SANE</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) is a simple, one-question patient-reported outcome measure. A SANE score requires the patient to rate their knee function on a scale of 0 to 100.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-op to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Reported Outcome Measure - pain Scale: 0-10. 0 being no pain and 10 being unbearable pain</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>PROMIS SF - Pain Interference</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS(r) Pain Interference instruments (adult and child) measure the self-reported consequences of pain on relevant aspects of a person's life. Each question usually has five response options ranging in value from one to five. To find the total raw score for a short form with all questions answered, sum the values of the response to each question.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>MRI of the shoulder</measure>

    <description>MRI of the shoulder of the first 5 patients in each group will be obtained at 2 weeks post-op for evaluation of bone marrow edema pattern in the proximal humerus</description>
