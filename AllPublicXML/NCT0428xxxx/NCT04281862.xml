      To determine patient preference and treatment outcomes with an intracanalicular dexamethasone
      (0.4mg) insert compared to standard steroid drop regimen in the contralateral eye following
      bilateral LASIK surgery.

    <textblock>
      This prospective, open-label, single-center, randomized, investigator-sponsored clinical
      study seeks to investigate the outcomes of patients undergoing bilateral LASIK surgery with
      the treatment of a dexamethasone intracanalicular insert compared to standard of care topical
      prednisolone. All eyes will receive treatment. Additionally, all eyes will receive topical
      moxifloxacin QID for 1 week.

      Twenty patient eyes undergoing bilateral LASIK surgery will be randomized to receive either
      Dextenza (Group A) OR standard of care prednisolone acetate 1% QID for 1 week, BID for 1 week
      (Group B). The contralateral eye will receive treatment with either DEXTENZA or topical
      prednisolone as a comparator based on randomization of first eye to Group A or Group B.
      Post-operative evaluations will be performed on Day 1, Day 7, and Month 1 following surgery.

    <description>The insert, containing 0.4 mg of active pharmaceutical product, is placed within the canaliculus to provide a sustained and tapered delivery of drug to the ocular surface over 30 days after a one-time insertion. The attributes of the insert reduce the risks for improper corticosteroid tapering and unwanted peaks and troughs in drug concentration.</description>
