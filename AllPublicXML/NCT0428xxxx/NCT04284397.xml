  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates critical environmental limits (temperature and humidity) above which
      older adults are unable to effectively thermoregulate. Participants will exercise in a series
      of different environmental conditions to identify combinations of temperature and humidity
      above which age-related physiological changes cause uncompensable heat stress, resulting in
      increased risk of heat illness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The earth's climate is warming well above historical averages, and there is an increased
      frequency, duration, and severity of heat waves. At the same time, the world's population is
      rapidly aging. Aging is associated with reductions in thermoregulatory capacity due to
      reductions in sweating and skin blood flow. For this reason, people â‰¥65 years exhibit
      exponentially larger increases in morbidity and mortality during heat waves than younger
      individuals, with the large majority of excess deaths during heat waves occurring in the
      elderly.

      Compounding the physiological effects of primary aging, co-morbidities and common classes of
      drugs taken by older adults can further compromise their thermoregulatory function. One such
      class of medications is cyclooxygenase inhibitors, including aspirin (ASA) and other platelet
      inhibitors. Provocative data published by our lab indicate that platelet inhibitors including
      ASA increase the rate of heat storage during passive heat stress by ~25%. Following current
      clinical guidelines, nearly 40% of US adults over the age of 50 engage in an aspirin therapy
      regiment for the primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

      Although there is compelling evidence that aging is associated with decreased heat
      dissipation and elevated risk of heat illness in hot ambient conditions, the significant
      question remains: In what specific environments does this age disparity begin to occur? The
      goal of the current study is to identify and model ambient conditions that are unsafe for
      older adults. A second aim of the study is to determine the effects of the commonly used
      platelet inhibitor, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), on age-specific critical environmental
      limits.

    <intervention_model_description>Two groups of subjects (young, older) participate in twelve experiments; experimental conditions consist of six different combinations of temperature and humidity and are performed at two different exercise intensities. The experiments are conducted in randomized order and are separated by a minimum of three days. A subgroup of older adults will be asked to complete all trials after taking daily low-dose aspirin for seven days, and aspirin will be continued until all trials are complete.</intervention_model_description>
