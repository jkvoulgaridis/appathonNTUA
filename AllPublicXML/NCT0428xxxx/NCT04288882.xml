      Overall Aim:

      This study is designed to assess the role of ballon-assisted enteroscopy in the management of
      obscure small intestinal disorders in a tertiary-care center in Upper Eygpt.

      Specific objectives:

        1. Evaluate the technical success rate and causes of the procedure in our locality

        2. Explore the value and safety of BAE in the diagnose and treatment of suspected small
           bowel diseases.

        3. Assess patients' and endoscopists' satisfaction related to the procedure.

        4. Define the indications, diagnostic yield and appropriatness of BAE in our center.

        5. Determine the value of enteroscopy-obtained biopsy samples in the diagnosis.

        6. Perform a cost analysis of BAE in relation to its diagnostic value/yield.

        7. Report the therapeutic role of BAE in different small intestinal disorders.

    <textblock>
      The small intestine is very essential for digestion and absorption and is presented between
      the stomach and large intestine. Because of its anatomical position, the small intestine was
      named as a &quot;blind area&quot; leading to difficulty in diagnosis of small bowel disease. The advant
      of ballon-assisted enteroscopy facilitates the management of the small bowel diseases. There
      are several causes of obscure small intestinal disorders, which are Angioectasia (20-55%),
      small bowel tumours (10-20%), Cameron erosions (5-15%), NSAID enteropathy (5%), Dieulafoy
      lesion (2-3%), Crohn's disease (2-10%), Coeliac disease( 2-5 %), Meckel's diverticulum
      (2-5%), duodenal varices (1-5%), gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) (1-2%), Ectopic
      varices (1-2%), Portal hypertensive enteropathy 1-2% (but 60-70% in those with portal
      hypertension), Radiation enteritis (&lt;1% ). Obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB) was the
      most common indication for enteroscopry and is defined as a bleeding from an unknown site
      after a negative evaluation of the GI tract with esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and
      ileocolonoscopy. OGIB represents about 5% of patients presenting with GI bleeding. OGIB isthe
      most common indication for enteroscopry, whatever the age groups, but the proportion of
      patients performing enteroscopy for OGIB was higher in elderly patients. Young patients were
      indicated for enteroscopy for other complains, such as abdominal pain, or suspicious
      small-bowel tumor. Egyptian study was done and identified that the source of OGIB in the
      small intestine represents 69.2%, with negative DBE ﬁndings in 30.8% and the most common
      lesions were angioectasias followed by GI tumours (30.8%, 19.2%, respectively).

        After obtaining the appropriate consents, data pertaining to clinical history, physical
        examination and baseline laboratory investigations (complete blood count, kidney function,
        coagulation profile) for all cases of obscure small intestinal disorders. CT abdomen,
        conventional upper GI endoscopy and colonoscopy in addition to other modalities as the CT
        scan and angiography will be done for every patient as appropriate.

        All patients will be subjected to the BAE if these modalities are negative. BAE will be
        performed in an outpatient or inpatient setting under general anesthesia, although some
        patients may require only conscious sedation. Most procedures will be performed through the
        mouth (antegrade), although the (retrograde) approach, through the rectum, may be done
        resorted to allow better access to suspected lesions in the lower part of the small bowel.
