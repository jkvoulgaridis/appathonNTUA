  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is an open-label, phase 1, dose-escalation study to determine the safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of CRX100 in adult subjects with advanced
      solid tumors. Patients will be screened and evaluated to determine whether or not they meet
      stated inclusion criteria. Enrolled subjects will undergo leukapheresis to enable the ex vivo
      generation of autologous cytokine induced killer (CIK) cells. Patients with triple-negative
      breast cancer, colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, osteosarcoma, epithelial ovarian
      cancer, and gastric cancer will be considered.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed written informed consent obtained prior to any study procedures

          -  Subjects must have histologically-confirmed diagnosis of one of the following tumors:
             triple negative adenocarcinoma of the breast (human epidermal growth factor receptor
             2- estrogen receptor- and progesterone receptor- negative [HER2-/ER-/PR-]),
             adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum (CRC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),
             osteosarcoma, epithelial ovarian cancer, or gastric cancer. Documentation of the
             diagnosis with the original pathology report, or a recent biopsy, is required.

          -  Subjects must have relapsed or be refractory or intolerant to standard care, or
             refusing standard therapies.

          -  Subjects must have RECIST-evaluable disease using computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI), with at least one measurable target lesion.

          -  Subjects must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of
             0-2.

          -  Subjects must have recovered from the effects of recent surgery, radiation therapy, or
             chemotherapy.

          -  Subjects must be free of active infections requiring treatment doses of antibiotics,
             antifungals, or antiviral medications.

          -  No cellular therapy to be administered for at least 12 weeks prior to apheresis.

          -  Adequate hematologic function at the time of screening

          -  Adequate organ function

          -  Women of childbearing potential (defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant) must have negative serum ß-human chorionic gonadotropin (ß-HCG) or
             urine pregnancy test.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must agree to use highly effective methods of
             contraception throughout the study and for 6 months after the last dose of CRX100.

          -  Males who have partners of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective
             barrier contraceptive method throughout the study and for 6 months after the last dose
             of CRX100.

          -  Subjects must be willing to comply with all study procedures and follow-up
             examinations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with new or progressive brain metastasis. Subjects with treated brain
             metastases are eligible if there is no evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks
             after central nervous system-directed treatment, as ascertained by clinical
             examination and brain imaging (MRI or CT) during the screening period.

          -  Active or history of autoimmune disease (known or suspected). Exceptions are permitted
             for vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune
             condition requiring only hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic
             treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger.

          -  Have a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg
             daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days
             prior to apheresis, and within 14 days prior to infusion. Inhaled or topical steroids
             and adrenal replacement doses (≤10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) are permitted in
             the absence of active autoimmune disease. Short-term (&lt;48 hr) steroid pretreatment for
             contrast allergy for imaging is permitted.

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, active chronic hepatitis B or C,
             life-threatening illnesses unrelated to cancer, or any serious medical or psychiatric
             illness that could, in the Investigator's opinion, interfere with participation in
             this study.

          -  Pregnant or nursing an infant (subject or household contacts).

          -  Clinically significant immunodeficiency (e.g., due to underlying illness and/or
             medication) in a subject or household contacts.

          -  Have any underlying medical condition (including, but not limited to, ongoing or
             active infection requiring treatment, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable
             angina pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmia), psychiatric condition, or social situation
             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise study administration as per
             protocol or compromise the assessment of AEs.

          -  Have a history of another invasive malignancy, except for the following circumstance:
             individuals with a history of invasive malignancy are eligible if they have been
             disease free and off treatment for at least 2 years or are deemed by the Investigator
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy; individuals with the following
             cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated: carcinoma in situ of the breast, oral
             cavity, or cervix, localized prostate cancer, or basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma
             of the skin. When enrolling a subject with another malignancy, the Investigator should
             consider discussing the subject with the Medical Monitor.

          -  Subjects who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Participation in any investigational drug study or immunotherapy within 4 weeks of
