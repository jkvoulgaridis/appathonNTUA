      This study compares gadolinium contrast-enhanced Abbreviated MRI (AMRI) to standard
      ultrasound for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) screening and surveillance in subjects with
      liver cirrhosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound (US) is currently used for HCC surveillance. However, US has certain limitations,
      so physicians use contrast CT or MRI. However, these are expensive and time-consuming
      procedures. We introduced an abbreviated MRI (AMRI) exam, which works well in cirrhotic and
      obese patients (unlike US), involves no ionizing radiation (unlike CT), and is rapid (unlike
      multi-phasic MRI) with total scanner times of less than ten minutes, and can be performed at
      about the same cost as US. This study in adult patients with cirrhosis will compare the
      performance of AMRI vs. US for detection of early-stage disease, and will help to define and
      validate a novel, rapid, accurate, and potentially cost-effective imaging protocol for HCC
      screening in high-risk individuals.
