      This study is conducted at the level 3 NICU of the Children's Hospital of Fudan University,
      Shanghai, People's Republic of China, a tertiary medical center. Infants admitted to the NICU
      are all outborn infants.

      The study is approved by the Ethics Committee of the Children's Hospital of Fudan University.
      Signed parental consent is obtained before participants'entry into the study. The RCT is
      conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of skin-to-skin combined with breastfeeding reduce
      the transition time from tube feeding to independent oral feeding.

      The recruited infants are assigned to intervention group and control group.

      Data are presented as means ± sds for continuous variables with normal distribution and
      percentages (%) for categorical variables. One-way analysis of variance and Fisher exact test
      is used to compare infants' baseline characteristics among the two groups. All statistical
      analyses are conducted using SPSS. A p value of less than 0.05 is regarded as statistically
      significant.

    <measure>Exclusive breastfeeding at discharge</measure>
    <time_frame>During the hospitalization, an average of 2 to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Exclusive breastfeeding at discharge is defined as through breastfeeding without bottle feeding at discharge.On the day of discharge, newborns are weighed before regular feeding and then breastfed by their mothers. After breastfeeding, the baby is weighed again and the amount of breast milk obtained by sucking the mother's breast is assessed. If the two weight subtractions are greater than or equal to the amount required for once bottle feeding, the baby is considered exclusively breastfeding at discharge.</description>

During the skin-to-skin period,the breastfeeding is encouraged for about 5-10 minutes. The whole intervention stop until the baby achieve the full oral feeding.</description>
