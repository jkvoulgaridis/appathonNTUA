  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Diagnostic accuracy of a wearable system for atrial fibrillation detection</measure>
    <time_frame>PPG will be assessed in 2 minutes. ECG will be assessed in up to 10 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The wearable system comprises of two integrated components: a photoplethysmography (PPG) and a 6-lead ECG of the device. It works as described below.
First, an automatic PPG algorithm will indicate whether atrial fibrillation is suspected. The rhythm assessment of PPG algorithm is based on pulse regularity.
Next, a 6-lead ECG is acquired by the wearable. The rhythm assessment of ECG is based on P waves and regularity of QRS complexes. A diagnosis is made by independent cardiologists.
The conclusion of a whole system comprising of both described methods will be compared with a gold standard multi-lead Holter ECG. This standard ECG is also evaluated by independent cardiologists.</description>
