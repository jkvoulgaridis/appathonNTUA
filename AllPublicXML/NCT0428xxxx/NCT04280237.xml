      This study describes Cefazolin pharmacokinetics variation to target levels during liver
      transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cefazolin is one of the many drugs used in antibiotic prophylaxis during liver
      transplantation. However there are no study describing its pharmacokinetics during liver
      transplantation.

      Due to the severe pharmacokinetics interactions caused by both prior hepatopathy and surgical
      techniques we suppose that Cefazolin blood levels are very different from those targeted for
      antibiotic prophylaxis.

      This study aim to describe pharmacokinetics of Cefazolin during liver transplantation in
      order to adapt antibiotic prophylaxis strategy in case of unadapted measured levels.
