  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are different types of casein on the market, which differ according to their chemical
      or physical process of obtaining. The processes will impact structural differences in the
      macromolecular assembly.

      The majority of caseins marketed in nutrition are casein in the form of Na caseinate or Ca
      caseinate.

      The micellar caseins obtained by membrane filtration (physical process) are more and more
      used in the nutrition market.

      The development of casein extraction with different structures on an industrial scale opens
      up other perspectives for these proteins, particularly in terms of health.

      The main objective of this project is to study the postprandial kinetics of the plasma
      concentrations of the essential amino acids of three structurally different types of caseins.

      The secondary objective is to study the speed of gastric emptying and the nutritional
      properties of different proteins.

      All the participants will give freely their written informed consent before their selection
      in the study.

      Each subject will participate in 3 kinetics of 5 hours with a different product test each
      time, in a randomized order. A wash-out period of at least 7 days will be respected between
      each kinetics. The products to be tested will be in the form of a powder (25g individual
      sachet, including 20.1g of protein) which will be reconstituted in 250ml of water and to
      which 100mg of 13C sodium acetate will be added.

      For each of the kinetics, blood samples, expires gasses, will be collected at different time
      during the kinetics. A urinary collection throughout the day of kinetics will also be
      performed to allow the determination of urinary nitrogen Indirect calorimetry measurements
      will be performed 45 minutes every hour in the postprandial period and a measurement of 45
      minutes will be made when the subject is fasting. Six measurements of indirect calorimetry
      will be performed for each kinetic.

      Finally subjects will be asked to evaluate their satiety on a visual analog scale, 15' before
      taking the product, then every 15' the first hour in the postprandial period and every 30
      'from the 2nd hour.

      The subjects will also have a tolerance questionnaire to complete with each kinetic.

      At the end of the kinetics, a standardized meal, single menu, consumption ad libitum measured
      in double weighing will be proposed to the volunteers to evaluate their satiety

      During the 3 days preceding each kinetics, the protein intake of the subjects will be
      controlled. The meal of each night in the evening of kinetics will be standardized and
      identical for each kinetics. The volunteers will complete a food survey on the 3 days of
      control of their diet that precede each kinetics.
