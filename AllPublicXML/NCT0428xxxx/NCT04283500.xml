  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Buprenorphine (BUP) is FDA-approved for the treatment of opioid withdrawal and opioid use
      disorder. Few ED providers have received the necessary DEA registration (aka X waiver)
      required to prescribe BUP, and urgent appointments to continue ongoing BUP treatment may not
      be readily available, thus leading to medication discontinuity. A loading dose induction
      strategy with 32mg of BUP may help effectively link ED patients to outpatient treatment while
      minimizing known barriers to ED uptake. Administering a &quot;loading dose&quot; of BUP to saturate
      mu-opioid receptors would extend the duration of action and provide additional time to secure
      ongoing treatment. Further, BUP's ceiling effect on respiratory depression makes it a
      remarkably safe drug even at high doses. In recent years, ED providers have begun to
      incorporate this approach into clinical protocols, however, it has not been formally studied
      in this clinical setting. The investigator's study represents the necessary step of studying
      this novel approach in the ED setting to define the parameters for clinical protocols and
      large-scale studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A novel induction strategy, in which a loading dose of Buprenorphine (BUP) 32mg is
      administered, has the potential to mitigate barriers to treatment initiation. ED providers
      can treat patients with BUP for opioid withdrawal since DEA registration (X-waiver) is not
      required unless they wish to issue a prescription. Current BUP induction protocols, developed
      for inpatient and ambulatory care settings as well as for unobserved self- administration via
      prescription, usually recommend a first day dose of 8mg given in divided doses of 2- 4mg.
      However, patients discharged with â‰¤ 8mg SL total dose may experience return of withdrawal
      symptoms and/or opioid craving within only 4 hours.Treatment with a loading dose of 32mg in
      the ED may provide the necessary bridge treatment, relieving symptoms of withdrawal until a
      patient is able to attend a follow up appointment for further treatment.

    <description>This will be measured by the proportion of participants who report Successful Rapid Induction. Participants will receive a loading dose of BUP SL 32mg in the ED without experiencing a clinically significant serious and/or severe adverse event (AE) related to the intervention - specifically, the receipt of a dose of BUP SL greater than 8mg during the Index ED visit. Successful rapid induction is defined only by the outcome of the participant's visit, and not by any following research visits.</description>

    <description>The Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) is an 11-item scale designed to be administered by a clinician. The tool can be used in both inpatient and outpatient settings to reproducibly rate common signs and symptoms of withdrawal and monitor these symptoms over time. The summed score can be used to help clinicians determine the stage or severity of withdrawal and assess the level of physical dependence on opioids. The change in withdrawal and craving symptoms will be measured using COWS during the index visit, as well as during the research visits on days 1, 2, and 3.</description>

    <description>The Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) is a self-administered scale for grading opioid withdrawal symptoms. It contains 16 symptoms whose intensity the patient rates on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Similar to COWS, the score is used to assess stage and severity of withdrawal and level of physical dependence on opioids. SOWS will be assessed during the index visit, as well as research visits on days 1, 2, and 3.</description>

    <description>Participants will asked to report the date and time of the next dose of BUP following the loading dose given during their index visit. If needed for treatment of withdrawal, this dose may be administered or prescribed by the study team during a research visit.</description>

    <description>Participants will be asked to report any use of opioids as well as other illicit drugs during the study period. Usage patterns of opioids and other substances will be compared from before and after administration of the 32 mg loading dose of BUP. Substance use will be reported at each research visit, as well as during the 30 day follow up phone call. During the phone call, the Timeline Follow-Back method (TLFB) will be used to report usage during the past 30 days.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive the BUP SL 32mg in divided doses rather than all at once. If after the initial 8mg dose a participant experiences over-sedation or another adverse event that would preclude further dosing, such as an allergic reaction, the subsequent dose will not be administered and the patient will be withdrawn from the study. The participant will be reassessed for other possible etiologies for these symptoms.</description>
