  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breathlessness is a symptom of asthma that occurs in relation with lower airway obstruction.
      However, this sensation is not specific of asthma and may be the expression of other
      disorders. In particular, it can testify to anxiety or hyperventilation, two disorders
      frequently associated with asthma. The systematic interpretation of dyspnea as a
      manifestation of asthma in asthmatic patients may lead to an inappropriate increase in asthma
      controllers.

      Identifying the cause of dyspnea in asthmatic patients (airway obstruction, anxiety or
      hyperventilation) is therefore crucial for the clinician.

      This could be facilitated by a multidimensional assessment of dyspnea, evaluating the kind of
      sensation felt by the patient (for example chest tightness, air hunger etc.) and emotions
      associated to respiratory sensations (for example anxiety, fear etc.).

      The objectives of this project are to assess: (1) the sensory and affective dimensions of
      dyspnea in asthma and, (2) their connection to asthma control, anxiety and depression.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of asthma confirmed by:

               -  A history of symptoms compatible with asthma

               -  AND a history of airway obstruction, according to the GINA definition (2017):
                  FEV1/FVC ratio lower than the lower limit of the predicted value at baseline or
                  after a bronchial provocation test

               -  AND a variability of airway obstruction defined by at least one of the following
                  criteria:

             oReversibility of airway obstruction after bronchodilators (400 µg of salbutamol): FEV
             1 increases by&gt; 200 mL and&gt; 12% compared to baseline

               -  OR delta peak-flow over the day / average peak-flow averaged over 2 weeks&gt; 10%

               -  OR variability in FEV1 between two visits&gt; 200 mL and&gt; 12%
