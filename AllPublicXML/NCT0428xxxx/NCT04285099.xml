  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to confirm the effect for FOG by changing the frequency through the dual-system
      approach in PD patients after STN-DBS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators set two values of frequency (130, 60Hz) in IPG and allow the patients to
      change the frequencies freely using the patient controller. After four weeks, the
      investigators will check the UPDRS part I, II, IV, FOG-Q, and PDQ-39 values at each
      frequency, including the proportion of use of two frequencies.
