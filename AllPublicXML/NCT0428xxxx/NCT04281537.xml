  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an international, non-interventional research study of adult patients with Fabry
      Disease and their caregivers. The study will comprise a prospective time and motion
      evaluation and a cross-sectional evaluation of patient and caregiver-reported outcomes. The
      study will evaluate the time associated with the preparation and administration of a single
      dose of ERT in patients by health care providers as well as the impact on Fabry patients and
      caregivers time and costs associated with an ERT treatment. The study will also evaluate the
      patients' quality of life wellbeing, fatigue and work productivity.

    <time_frame>up to 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Health Related Quality of Life measured by the 12 Item Short Form Survey [SF-12]). SF-12v2 component summary measure and health domain scale is described in terms of scale or item composition, number of score levels, lowest and highest possible T scores for the standard and acute forms, and the health states associated with the lowest and highest observable scores. These descriptions are based on the general content of the scales and measures and the pattern of responses necessary to achieve these extreme scores. This information can be used to summarize what each component summary measure and health domain scale measures and can serve as a basis for broad-level interpretation of SF-12v2 results.
These 8 domains form 2 subscales: physical component summary and mental component summary. The low scores indicate limitations in the domain measured. The high scores indicate less limitations in the domain measured.</description>

    <description>World Health Organization-5 Wellbeing Index [WHO-5] consists of 5 items and the timeframe for responses is based on the previous 2 weeks. The 5 items relate to feeling cheerful, calm, active, rested and being interested in life. The raw score is calculated by totaling the figures of the five answers. The raw score ranges from 0 to 25, 0 representing worst possible and 25 representing best possible quality of life.</description>
