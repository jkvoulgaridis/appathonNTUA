  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rhinitis, or inflammation of the nasal mucosa, can present with nasal obstruction, nasal
      discharge, itch or sneezing. If the sinusal mucosa is involved as well, it is called
      rhinosinusitis and facial pain or loss of smell is possible. Several causes are known, such
      as an underlying allergy (&quot;allergic rhinitis&quot;, AR). If at least 2 symptoms are present for at
      least 12 weeks, it is called &quot;chronic rhinosinusitis&quot; (CRS).

      Up to 2/3 of the AR and CRS patients have symptoms upon exposure to triggers such as sudden
      temperature changes, smoke, fragrances… a phenomenon called &quot;nasal hyperreactivity&quot; (NHR). It
      is currently not clear why some patients suffer NHR while others do not.

      In this study, the investigators want to identify the mediators associated with NHR in
      patients with allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis and healthy control subjects.To do
      so, participants will be provoked with cold, dry air in order to objectively diagnose NHR.
      Before and after provocation, the peak nasal inspiratory flow will be measured and samples
      will be collected (nasal secretions, biopsies).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with perennial allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and
      healthy control subjects will be recruited. At baseline, nasal secretions and mucosal
      biopsies will be collected. After 3 weeks, participants will be provoked with cold, dry air,
      and samples will be harvested again. A decrease in the peak nasal inspiratory flow of &gt;20%
      will be used as a cutoff to define nasal hyperreactivity.

      Nasal secretions will be analysed for various mediators using a multiplex assay. The biopsies
      will be used for RT-q-PCR and immunohistochemistry of various transient receptor potential
      (TRP) channels.
