  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to assess, by using a simple algorithm combining FIB-4 and
      Fibroscan, the prevalence of NASH with advanced fibrosis in outpatients followed in various
      hospital specialty clinics other than hepato/gastroenterology and to examine risk factors
      associated with this condition. The prevalence of NASH will be investigated among 6 cohorts
      of outpatients followed in different hospital specialty clinics at Hôpitaux Universitaires de
      Strasbourg.
