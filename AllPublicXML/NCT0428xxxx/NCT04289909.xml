  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using a technique called adaptive optics imaging applied on retina, investigators aim to gain
      access to vascular changes that could occur early in the course of Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
      and which could reflect vascular changes occurring along the optic nerve of the brain
      parenchyma. Indeed, our team has been able to develop a quantitative method to measure the
      perivascular infiltrate in the retina of patients with various inflammatory retinal disease.
      It has been observed in MS patients that this perivascular infiltrate can also be detected in
      the retina. However, its distribution across MS phenotypes (relapsing or progressive MS, with
      and without optic neuritis) is still unknown.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a monocentric pathophysiological, interventional, prospective, open label,
      non-randomized pilot study which aims to identify in patients with MS at different stages if
      the presence of retinal perivascular inflammation can be detected and quantified using
      adaptive optics, which is a non-invasive examination.

      Investigators will recruit MS patients in 3 subgroups, depending on their phenotype
      (Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) without optic neuritis, RRMS with optic
      neuritis, progressive MS), with 15 patients in each group.

      15 healthy volunteers (HV) will also be enrolled.

      The comparison of these groups is necessary to determine if there are significant
      differences, allowing us to highlight biomarkers in MS patients in order to enable highly
      efficient and robust trials designs in the future.

      To test the hypothesis, the study has 3 visits over 6 months (M0, M3 and M6). Neurological
      evaluation, blood sample, imaging, ophthalmologic evaluation and Adaptive optics
      ophthalmoscopy assessments will be performed.
