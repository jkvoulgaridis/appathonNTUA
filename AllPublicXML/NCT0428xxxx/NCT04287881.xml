  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult onset epileptic seizures is rare and often associated with metabolic disorders, drugs
      and intracranial pathologies such as ischemia, hemorrhage or space-occupying lesions.
      Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) deficiency is one of the reasons that cause
      epileptic seizures in adults and can be ignored. MTHFR deficiency is an autosomal recessive
      disorder that results in hyperhomocysteinemia and causes a predisposition to venous and
      arterial thrombosis. The incidence of the polymorphism is around 40% in some countries. The
      aim of the retrospective study is to investigate the incidence of MTHFR deficiency in
      patients with adult-onset epileptic seizures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epileptic seizures that begin in adulthood seriously affect patients, their relatives and the
      society in which they live financially and psychologically. The etiology of epileptic
      seizures starting at adult age includes head trauma, central nervous system infections,
      intracranial lesions, cerebrovascular events, metabolic diseases and drugs. While the causes
      of childhood epileptic seizures are generally considered idiopathic, adult-onset epileptic
      seizures are almost always due to a pathological process. Epileptic seizures in adults may be
      a symptom of ischemic stroke. MTHFR deficiency is associated with raised homocysteine
      concentration in the body and increased risk of stroke (1). Studies have demonstrated that
      hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for stroke (2).

      MTHFR is the key enzyme in remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. MTHFR deficiency is
      an autosomal-recessive disease characterized by high homocysteine and low or normal
      methionine. MTHFR deficiency can cause vascular thrombosis in adults at early age; increased
      osteoporosis in elderly people; deep vein thrombosis, abortus during pregnancy; and
      infertility in adult males. In children, it is associated with intrauterine growth
      retardation, congenital heart diseases, neural tube defects, chromosome anomalies and
      hematologic tumors. In any age group, it might cause convulsions, increased thrombosis risk
      with some anticonvulsants and with the use of nitrogen protoxide in surgeries, and neuromotor
      retardation (3).

      The aim of this retrospective study is to investigate the incidence of MTHFR deficiency in
      patients presenting with adult-onset epileptic seizures and diagnosed as ischemic
      cerebrovascular disease as a result of diagnostic tests.
