  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project forms a multi-site research collaboration to carry out verbal and spatial memory
      experiments in patient volunteers to better understand the neural bases of human memory,
      employing direct electrical brain stimulation as a tool to study those dynamics and their
      relationship to memory performance.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study protocol outlines fundamental experiments to understand the neural dynamics
      underlying human memory and use direct brain stimulation as a tool (intervention) to study
      the relationship between those dynamics and memory performance. The investigators will
      collect recording and stimulation data from 250 patient volunteers as they perform
      carefully-matched verbal and spatial memory tasks. During non-stimulation sessions, the
      investigators will measure correlative neural biomarkers of memory encoding and retrieval
      using standard clinical depth electrodes and micro-wire recordings. To test the causal role
      of these biomarkers, the investigators will employ direct brain stimulation to briefly
      modulate neural activity, and measure ensuing changes in behavioral performance. With a set
      of causal biomarkers and predictive models in hand, the investigators will finally ask
      whether model-driven stimulation paradigms offer the investigators the ability to reliably
      modulate neural activity, and consequent behavior, in real-time.

    <description>To measure memory performance, participants will perform a custom episodic memory task (verbal, spatial), with performance compared between sham and stimulation trials to identify if stimulation modulates memory. The primary outcome measure is memory performance, such as the percentage of recalled items.</description>

    <ipd_description>De-identified data will be shared in a public repository at regular intervals during the project. De-identified data sets will be anonymized prior to posting on the public repository. These de-identified data are likely to be analyzed for secondary purposes other than those described in this protocol (e.g. seizure prediction). Shared data will include, at a minimum, digital spreadsheets used to summarize all participant behavioral data. De-identified electrophysiology data, demographic information, electrode localization information, and task information (e.g. timing of each trial, timing of responses) will be shared in a central repository. Descriptions of the tasks and stimuli will be shared. De-identified references to individual participant data may also appear in scientific journal publications or presented at scientific meetings.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_time_frame>Study data will become available within six months of publication of the relevant results, with no planned expiration.</ipd_time_frame>
