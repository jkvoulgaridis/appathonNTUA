  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with schizophrenia are faced with social problems such as repeated hospitalizations,
      stigma with lack of social skills, unemployment, lack of necessary and adequate health care
      and education due to lack of adequate care in the community they live in. It is known that
      psychoeducation practices aimed at developing social skills in schizophrenia give patients
      new skills and these skills continue for many years. This study aimed to determine the effect
      of group psychoeducation that focused on social skill development on treatment adaptation,
      quality of life and well-being in schizophrenia patients and the interaction between these
      variables over time.

      The aim is to determine the effect of group psychoeducation that focused on social skill
      development on treatment adaptation, quality of life and well-being in schizophrenia patients
      and the interaction between these variables over time.

      The study was conducted with 42 schizophrenia patients (n=21 intervention group; n=21 control
      group) using a quasi-experimental research design. Patients were evaluated using a pre-test,
      post-test, monitoring test, &quot;Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS)&quot;, &quot;Quality of Life
      Scale for Schizophrenia (QLSS)&quot; and &quot;Flourishing Scale&quot; (FS). The measurements were taken 3
      times: pre test, post-test and 3-months post-test.

    <description>It evaluates the quality of life of schizophrenic patients receiving maintenance treatment. QLSS provides information about ongoing symptoms and functionality. It is a 7-degree Likert type scale applied in a semi-structured interview format.
