  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the prognostic value of Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) in
      stroke rehabilitation with serial measurements.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Serial measurements (immediately after being transferred to rehabilitation department [T0],
      at discharge from inpatient rehabilitation [T1], and follow up at one to three months from
      stroke onset [T3]) using Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) was done in all
      participants. The primary outcome was the outcome prediction rate using fNIRS parameter and
      clinical parameters. Secondary outcomes were as follows: fNIRS activation pattern, Laterality
      Index, Functional Connectivity, Fugl-Meyer Score, Modified Barthel Index, , Brunnstrom Stage,
      Box and Block Test, Grip Strength (handgrip, pinch grip, lateral prehension, three-jaw
      chuck), Modified Ashworth Scale (wrist flexor and extensor spasticity, elbow flexor, and
      extensor spasticity, long finger flexor spasticity), modified Rankin Scale score, Functional
      Ambulation Category, Glasgow Coma Scale, Neglect Evaluation Battery, Korean Version Western
      Aphasia Battery, and Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia.

      The changes in the fNIRS measurements and clinical parameters will be analyzed and also the
      correlation between the two will be analyzed to identify the prognostic value of fNIRS.
