  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a new educational video to help patients and doctors
      talk about CAR-T cell therapy, a treatment being used in cancer.

      - Educational video tool for patients receiving CAR-T cell therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Feasibility Study, which is the first-time investigators are
      examining this educational video tool for patients receiving CAR-T cell therapy.

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, randomization and a series
      of questionnaires

      Participants will be randomized to one of 2 groups:

        -  Group A: Educational video tool

        -  Group B: Standard care

      Participants will be in the research study for a month after consent

      It is expected that about 60 participants will take part in this research study.

    <measure>Feasibility (enrollment and retention rates)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is feasibility. The proposed video intervention will be deemed feasible if at least 60% of eligible patients are enrolled in the study and complete at least 60% of the intervention sessions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knowledge about CAR-T cell therapy (CAR-T cell Knowledge Questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>To compare patient's knowledge about CAR-T cell therapy between groups as measured by the CAR-T cell therapy Knowledge Questionnaire (Score range 0-10). Higher scores indicating higher knowledge.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>To compare patient's psychological distress between groups as measured by the HADS. HADS subscale ranges from 0-21, with higher scores indicating worse psychological distress.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient's self-efficacy (CASE)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>To compare patient's self-efficacy between the groups as measured by the Communication and Attitudinal Self-Efficacy Scale-Cancer (CASE-cancer). The CASE ranges from 0-170 with higher scores indicating higher self-efficacy</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Preferences for CAR T-cell therapy (single-item preference for CAR-T cell therapy)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>To compare patient's preferences for CAR-T cell therapy between groups as measured by a single-item &quot;Do you prefer to receive CAR-T cell therapy&quot;. We will compare proportion of patients stating &quot;yes&quot; to receiving CAR-T cell therapy between groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decision Satisfaction around receipt of CAR-T cell therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>To compare patient's satisfaction around the decision to receive CAR-T cell therapy between groups as measured by a six-item Likert scale ranging from &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; to &quot;Strongly Agree&quot; with statements about satisfaction regarding the decision to receive CAR-T cell therapy, with &quot;Strongly Agree&quot; indicating the highest decision satisfaction. We will compare the proportion of patients stating &quot;Agree&quot; or &quot;Strongly Agree&quot; to the six items between groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of the video (intervention arm only)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>To assess, in the intervention group, patients' comfort with watching the video, whether they find the video helpful in their understanding of CAR T-cell therapy, and whether they would recommend it to others as measured by a 3-item survey. Each of the three items ranges from 0-3 with lower scores indicating higher acceptability of the video.</description>
