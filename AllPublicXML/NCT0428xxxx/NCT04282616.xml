  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low physical activity levels and progressive poor functional capacity affect quality of life
      and clinical outcomes of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients. Interventions to prevent the
      functional decline associated with a sedentary lifestyle or to relief from deconditioning are
      crucial, considering the significant beneficial effects of exercise in all CKD patients,
      especially in End-stage Kidney Disease patients (ESKD). Unfortunately, physical and
      psychological barriers to exercise are present and physical activity management is not
      routinely addressed in the patient's care.

      For the first time the project aims to test the impact of the regular presence of an exercise
      specialist in the Nephrology Unit.

      This facilitator, evaluating capacity, motivation and preferences of each patient, will
      design tailored solutions and assess the related outcomes. Several design of training
      programs will be proposed to dialysis patients, that can choose the exercise option that best
      fits their needing.

      The study will determine the feasibility of the project, the patients' adherence and the
      effectiveness of the programs proposed to improve the patients' lifestyle.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The assumption underlying the project is that a wider participation to physical activity
      programs (PAPs) of ESKD patients may be facilitated by the presence in the Renal Unit of an
      exercise specialist able to design tailored programs and that this intervention may lead to
      measurable benefits on physical fitness, quality of life and general health.

      The possible different solutions offered by an expert of exercise in chronic diseases might
      reduce most of the barriers to exercise responsible of the sedentary behavior of the ESKD
      patients. Aim of the project is to test the impact of the regular presence of this
      facilitator in a Nephrology Unit in terms of applicability and feasibility as well to
      identify the preferred and the most effective pathways for the patients.

      The identification of a novel cost-effective intervention may represent an important step to
      manage the change of lifestyle of ESKD patients, to slow down their physical and QoL decline
      and to reduce hospitalizations and negative outcomes affecting this population.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>According to each patient's baseline physical activity level, the facilitator will advise patients to start or to increase their spontaneous activity by giving counselling on total exercise time, mode, intensity and frequency as suggested by the American College of Sport Medicine guidelines. Every patient will be provided with a log-book and a wearable physical activity monitor, which has to be returned in the subsequent controls, to favor adherence and objectively measure the exercise activities</description>

    <arm_group_label>Home-based structured low-intensity physical activity program</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>According to each patient's baseline physical activity level, a semi-personalized walking program, will be provided. This program, derived from previous experience on renal patients, includes a 10-min session/day of intermittent walking (1- or 2-min work and 1-min seated rest) to be performed at home at prescribed speed. The speed, converted into walking cadence and followed by a metronome, is weekly increased. Patients will be provided with a daily log containing the detailed exercise prescription and spaces to give a feedback on training execution and related symptoms.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>In-hospital structured supervised physical activity program</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients will join the room properly equipped for the exercise program in groups of maximum four subjects for a 2-time/week thirty minutes training sessions, to be performed for dialysis patients immediately before or after the dialysis treatment, or in non-dialysis according to their preferences.
Each sessions will include low-intensity walking exercises (similar to the structured home-based training), resistance and power exercises with elastic bands and light weights. Each sessions will begin and end with a warm-up and cool-down period of stretching. The total duration of the session will be about 30 minutes. Rate of perceived exertion will be collected and the training intensity will be set according to the patient's baseline capacity and weekly increased.</description>
