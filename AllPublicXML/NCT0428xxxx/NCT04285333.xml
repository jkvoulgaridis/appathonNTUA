  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal anesthesia (SA) is a widely accepted anesthetic technique for hip fracture repair
      among elderly. Positioning for SA can be extremely painful. Effective management of pain is
      important for these patients comfort.

      Fascia Iliaca block (FIB) and Femoral nerve blocks are commonly used for analgesia in hip
      fracture patients. However, they often provide a modest reduction in pain.

      The Percapsular Nerve Group block (PENG Block) has the advantage that it covers the accessory
      obturator nerve.

      Aim of the study: compare FIB with PENG prior to positioning hip fracture patients for
      standardized SA.

      In a prospective randomized double blind we included 80 patients aged more than 65 years old,
      for whom pain was felt when raising the affected limb to 15 degrees. Patients were assigned
      to receive either ultrasound guided Fascia Iliaca block or Percapsular Nerve Group block
      using 20 mL Lidocaine 1.5% in both groups. We compared pain on positioning for spinal
      anesthesia using Verbal Rating Scale (VRS 0 = no pain , VRS 1 = mild pain, t 2= severe pain)
      for both groups. We also recorded different times to perfom block.

      The purpose of the study was to compare analgesis effect of Percapsula nerve group block to
      fascia iliaca block prior to positioning hip fracture patients for standardized SA. We
      included 80 patients reporting pain with Verbal Rating Scale at 2 when raising the affected
      limb to 15 degrees. All patients admitted to induction room, were given standard monitoring
      and we randomized to receive either: ultrasound fascia iliaca block using linear high
      frequency ultrasound probe (10-15MHz) placed in a transverse direction over the anterior
      thigh below the inguinal ligament. A 50 mm needle was advanced until the tips placed
      underneath the fascia iliaca and 20 mL 1.5% Lidocaine was injected or ultrasound Percapsula
      nerve group block A curvilinear using low-frequency ultrasound probe (2-5MHz) that was
      initially placed in a transverse plane over the anterior inferior iliac spine and then
      aligned with the pubic ramus by rotating the probe counter clockwise approximately 45
      degrees. In this view, the iliopubic eminence , the iliopsoas muscle and tendon, the femoral
      artery, and pectineus muscle were observed and than a 100 mm needle was advanced to place the
      tip in the musculofascial plane between the psoas tendon anteriorly and the pubic ramus
      posteriorly and 20 mL 1.5% Lidocaine.We compared pain on positioning for spinal anesthesia
      and also different time to realise both blocks.

    <description>: A linear high frequency ultrasound probe (10-15MHz) was placed in a transverse direction over the anterior thigh below the inguinal ligament. We identified the femoral artery and the iliacus muscle lateral to it, covered by the fascia iliaca. The needle was inserted in plane and a 22 gauge, 50 mm needle was advanced until the tips placed underneath the fascia iliaca. Following negative aspiration, the local anesthetic solution was injected in 5mL increments while observing for adequate fluid spread in this plane for a total volume of 20 mL of 1.5% Lidocaine</description>

In this view, the iliopubic eminence (IPE), the iliopsoas muscle and tendon, the femoral artery, and pectineus muscle were observed. A 22-gauge, 100-mm needle was inserted from lateral to medial in an in-plane approach to place the tip in the musculofascial plane between the psoas tendon anteriorly and the pubic ramus posteriorly. Following negative aspiration, the local anesthetic solution was injected in 5 mL increments while observing for adequate fluid spread in this plane for a total volume of 20 mL of 1.5% Lidocaine.</description>
