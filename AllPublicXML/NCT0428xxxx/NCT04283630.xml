  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to examine whether the co-administration of dietary nitrate
      combined with vitamin C for 4 weeks in patients at risk for CVD would yield robust effects on
      endothelial function using blood measures and a non-invasive technique (Peripheral Artery
      Tonometry) compared to dietary nitrate supplementation alone.

      This is a 10 week randomized, cross-over, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study. This
      study was designed to compare the magnitude changes in RHI (primary outcome), plasma NO
      metabolites (nitrate and nitrite), and plasma vitamin C, plasma oxidized LDL, and blood
      (secondary outcome) following treatment with inorganic nitrate and vitamin C placebo (N) and
      inorganic nitrate combined with vitamin C (NC). Following baseline testing, eligible subjects
      were randomized to receive either treatment (N) or treatment (NC) for 4 weeks (period1), and
      participants were then crossed over to the alternate treatment for another 4 weeks (period
      2). There was a 2-week washout at crossover.

    <description>The dietary nitrate supplement was provided in the form of commercial beetroot juice (Sport Beet IT shot, Heartbeet Ltd) for all participants, whereas vitamin C and the placebo were provided as supplement capsules. Participants were asked to consume one dose/shot of sport Beet IT (70ml) that delivers on average 300-400mg of inorganic nitrate every day in the morning during the four-week study period, except for the test days and washout weeks. Accordingly, the participant were asked to consume the concentrated beetroot juice with breakfast meals, and then the vitamin C supplement (1000 mg)or placebo at the same time one-hour post beetroot juice supplementation</description>
