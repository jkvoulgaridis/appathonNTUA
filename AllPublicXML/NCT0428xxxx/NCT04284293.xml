  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator is examining the safety of transplanting cells into the subretinal space of
      patients with Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP). The cells are called neural progenitor cells, which
      are a type of stem cell that can become several different types of cells in the nervous
      system. These cells have been derived to specifically become astrocytes, which is a type of
      neuronal cell. The cells are called &quot;CNS10-NPC.&quot; The investigational treatment has been
      tested in animals, but it has not yet been tested in people. In this study, the investigators
      want to learn if CNS10-NPC cells are safe to transplant into the subretinal space of people.

      This study will be the first to use a human progenitor cell line to treat retinitis
      pigmentosa in people. This is a Phase 1/2a, single-center, open label, safety study of two
      escalating doses of human neural progenitor cells (CNS10-NPC) delivered unilaterally to the
      subretinal space of subjects with RP.

      Subjects meeting all Eligibility Criteria and providing Informed Consent will be enrolled in
      one of two sequential dosing groups. Subjects will be treated sequentially with a minimum of
      one month interval between surgeries for the first three subjects in each dosing cohort. The
      remaining subjects in the cohort will be treated with a minimum interval of at least one week
      between surgeries.

      Primary objective. To assess the safety and tolerability of two escalating doses of clinical
      grade human fetal cortical-derived neural progenitor cells (CNS10-NPC) administered in the
      subretinal space of one eye (unilaterally) in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP).

      Secondary objectives. Within constraints of a small first in-human study focused on safety:

        1. Determine if CNS10-NPC can engraft and survive long-term in the retina of transiently
           immunosuppressed subjects,

        2. Obtain evidence that subretinal injection of CNS10-NPC can favorably impact the
           progression of vision loss in subjects with moderate RP.

             longer than 7 days).

         21. Current treatment with immunosuppressant therapies or any contraindications to use of
             the immunosuppressants in this protocol.

         22. A history of malignancy within a five-year period or a positive cancer screening test
             within a one-year period of the screening visit.

             travel to and from the study center or provide informed consent/assent or effective
             safety assessments as specified by the protocol. Any mental or psychiatric disorders
             that prevent the patient from having full authority to do so (i.e. the subject cannot
