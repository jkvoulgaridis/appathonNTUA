    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 3 multi-site, randomized, evaluator-masked, study of endurance
      treadmill exercise on changes in the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson Disease
      Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III score at 12 months among persons with early stage Parkinson
      disease. 370 participants will be randomly assigned to 2 groups: 1)60-65% HRmax or 2)80-85%
      HRmax 4 times per week. The primary objective is to test whether the progression of the signs
      of Parkinson's disease is attenuated at 12 months in among persons who have not initiated
      medication for Parkinson Disease (PD) when they perform high-intensity endurance treadmill
      exercise.

      This study is a Phase 3 multi-site, randomized, evaluator-masked, study of endurance
      treadmill exercise on changes in the MDS-UPDRS Part III score at 12 months. 370 persons
      diagnosed with Parkinson's disease who have not yet initiated dopaminergic therapy, age
      40-80, will be randomly assigned to 2 groups: 1)60-65% HRmax or 2)80-85% HRmax 4 times per
      week. Secondary objectives will test hypotheses related to striatal specific binding ratio
      (SSBR) at 12 months, MDS-UPDRS Part III score, ambulatory mobility (6-minute walk), daily
      walking activity (steps), cognition, quality of life, cardiorespiratory fitness,
      blood-derived biomarkers of inflammation and neurotrophic factors at 12 and 18 months.
      Exploratory objectives will test hypotheses related to the effects of removing the study
      support that was provided over 18 months on the sustainability and durability of the exercise
      effects at 24 months. Approximately 29 sites will enroll participants: 27 sites that cover
      all geographic regions of the USA and 2 sites in Canada. All sites will have a collaboration
      between movement disorders and exercise specialist.

The PDQ-39 is a 39-item self-report questionnaire, which assesses Parkinson's disease-specific health related quality over the last month covering 8 dimensions scored on a 5 point ordinal system (0=never, 4=always). Dimension score = sum of scores of each item in the dimension divided by the maximum possible score of all the items in the dimension, multiplied by 100. Each dimension total score range from 0 (never have difficulty) to 100 (always have difficulty). Lower scores reflect better QoL. Overall score can be summarized in the Parkinson's Disease Summary Index (PDSI) or PDQ-39 Summary Index (PDQ-39 SI).PDSI or PDQ-39 SI = sum of dimension total scores divided by 8.</description>

          -  Positive DaTscan™ SPECT by quantitative readout for idiopathic Parkinson disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently being treated with PD medications such as levodopa or dopamine receptor
             agonists, monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitors, amantadine, or anticholinergics.

          -  Expected to require treatment with medication for PD in the first 6 months of the
             study.

          -  Use of any PD medication 60 days prior to the baseline visit including but not limited
             to levodopa, direct dopamine agonists, amantadine, Rasagiline (Azilect), Selegiline
             (Eldepryl), Artane (trihexyphenidyl).

          -  Duration of previous use of medications for PD exceeds 30 days.

          -  Use of neuroleptics/dopamine receptor blockers for more than 30 days in the year prior
             to baseline visit, or any use within 30 days of baseline visit

          -  Presence of known cardiovascular, metabolic, or renal disease or individuals with
             major signs or symptoms suggestive of cardiovascular, metabolic, or renal disease
             without medical clearance to participate in the exercise program.

          -  Complete Blood Count (CBC) out of range and physician's judgment that abnormal value
             is clinically significant.

          -  Recent use of psychotropic medications (e.g., anxiolytics, hypnotics, benzodiazepines,
             antidepressants) where dosage has not been stable for 28 days prior to screening.

          -  Serious illness (requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization) within the last
             4 weeks.

          -  Any other clinically significant medical condition, psychiatric condition, drug or
             alcohol abuse, or laboratory abnormality that would, in the judgment of the
             investigator, interfere with the subject's ability to participate in the study.

          -  Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of &lt;26 to rule out mild cognitive
             impairment (MCI).

          -  Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI) score &gt; 16, indicating depression that precludes

          -  &quot;Vigorous athletes&quot; participating in any endurance exercise program 3x/week or more
             will be excluded. Vigorous is defined as endurance exercise in a range greater than
             60-65% HRmax. These individuals are excluded since their exercise activities are
             similar to the activities they would experience if they were assigned to the 60-65%
             treatment group.

          -  Use of the following within 90 days prior to the dopamine transporter (DAT)
             neuroimaging screening evaluation: bupropion, modafinil, armodafinil, metoclopramide,
             alpha-methyldopa, methylphenidate, reserpine, any amphetamine or amphetamine
             derivative. These can compromise DaTscan™ SPECT.

          -  Known allergy to iodinated products.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to DaTscan™ SPECT (either to the active substance of
             123I-ioflupane or any of the excipients.

          -  Prior SPECT scan within 6 months of baseline scan. Recruitment will be delayed for
             individuals who have had a previous SPECT scan within 6 months of the baseline scan.

          -  (For women only) Pregnant, or plan to become pregnant in the next 12 months.

          -  Other disorders, injuries, diseases, or conditions that might interfere with ability
             to perform endurance exercises (e.g. history of stroke, respiratory problems,
             traumatic brain injury, orthopedic injury, or neuromuscular disease).
