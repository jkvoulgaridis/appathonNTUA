      This is a non-randomized, open-label, single-arm, multicenter Phase I clinical trial which
      will evaluate the Safety, Efficacy, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of RC48-ADC in
      combinaton with Anti-PD1 Monoclonal Antibody in Treatment of HER2-Positive Advanced Malignant
      Solid Tumors.

      The study has 2 parts which include dose escalation phase and dose extension phase.

      Dose escalation will use a 3+3 design and will enroll cohorts of 3-6 patients with
      HER2-Positive Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors sequentially at escalating doses of 2.0mg/kg
      and 2.5mg/kg to RC48-ADC and JS001 is fixed dose of 3.0mg/mg . Escalation will continue until
      identification of a MTD.

      Dose of phase II and extenstion stage which based-results of escalation phase will be
      recommend.
