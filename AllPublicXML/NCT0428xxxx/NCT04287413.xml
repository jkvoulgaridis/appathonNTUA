      This study aims to evaluate the individual health outcomes and health system impacts of
      implementing a new physiotherapist-led primary care model for people with low back pain
      (LBP).

      The overarching goal of this study is to determine the impact of integrating a
      physiotherapist (PT) within primary care teams for people with LBP and making them available
      to patients as the first point of contact. The specific aims of the research are to
      determine:

        1. Whether a PT-led primary care model for LBP is effective at improving function (primary
           outcome), pain intensity, quality of life, global rating of change, and adverse events
           in comparison to usual physician led primary care.

        2. The impact of a PT led primary care model for LBP on the healthcare system and society
           (healthcare access, primary care physician workload, healthcare utilization, missed
           work, and cost-effectiveness). A process evaluation will assess the healthcare
           delivered, potential mechanisms, context of implementation, and perspectives of patients
           and primary care providers towards the PT-led primary care model.

    <description>The PT-led primary care model for back pain will involve incorporating a PT within the primary care team at the first point of contact for people with back pain at no cost to the patient. Patients in this model will be given the choice of seeing the PT or family doctor. They will be encouraged to book with the PT except when the primary reason for visit is for medication renewals or when the patient has additional health concerns that need attention from their physician in the same visit. There will be 4 key components of the PT led primary care intervention: 1) Initial assessment and screening; 2) Brief individualized intervention at the first visit; 3) Health services navigation; 4) Providing additional PT care for people with an unmet need.</description>

    <description>The physician-led primary care intervention will be unstandardized to best reflect standard clinical practice in Canada. This usually includes a visit to a primary care physician, who would perform a history and physical examination, provide LBP education, order diagnostic imaging, prescribe medications and/or refer based on their assessment findings and patient preferences.</description>

    <intervention_name>Physiotherapist-led primary care model for back pain</intervention_name>
    <description>Assessment and screening: taking a history; screening for red flags, comorbidities, and risk factors of ongoing pain and disability; physical examination.
Brief individualized intervention at the first visit: effective communication, cognitive reassurance, a few exercises, and advice/strategies to stay active.
Health services navigation: PT assistance with navigating healthcare services based on the assessment findings. First, red-flags requiring emergency or urgent referrals. Next, comorbid conditions that would benefit from care from other healthcare providers. Finally, referral to PT (if appropriate).
Providing additional physiotherapy care to people with an unmet need: Additional physiotherapy care will be provided to patients who have an identified need for physiotherapy but no physiotherapy coverage through private or government health insurance plans.</description>
