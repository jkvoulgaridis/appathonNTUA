  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares &quot;contrast specific imaging setting&quot; images with &quot;left ventricular
      opacification (LVO)&quot; images taken on the same group of patients at different points in time,
      to see if one is more effective at assessing the function of the heart.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound testing of the heart using a &quot;dye&quot; or contrast is often used to get clear pictures
      of the heart in many heart conditions. When this test is done when the heart is working hard,
      such as when exercising, this is called contrast stress echocardiography.

      Current guidelines recommend the method called &quot;contrast specific imaging setting,&quot; as the
      best way of looking at the main pumping part of the heart. However, it is not known if it
      provides better pictures when compared to a different method called &quot;left ventricular
      opacification (LVO).&quot;

      This study will compare pictures in patients who have had tests done using both ways of
      looking at the heart and will compare; LVO; enhanced and unenhanced LVEBD; LVO imaging with
      contrast specific imaging Wall Motion Classification and LVO to contrast specific imaging
      Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF). The comparison will be done by a group of experts
      in cardiac ultrasound.

        From the 120 patients enrolled in the Luminity 422 clinical trial a cohort of participants
        underwent independent contrast specific imaging as part of their clinical management,
        during the time of recruitment for the trial. The contrast specific imaging data of these
        patients will be used.

        Sixty participants from the total of one hundred twenty patients that participated in the
        Luminity 422 clinical trial are planned to be enrolled in the study. They will have
        undergone further clinical echocardiographic assessment for other clinical reasons using
        the recommended contrast specific imaging setting by the same vendor.
