      The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic inflammatory disorders of the
      gastrointestinal tract that manifests as Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC),
      clinically characterized by periods of remission interrupted by episodes of clinical disease
      activity (Zallot et al., 2013). Patients with IBD display some common symptoms such as severe
      diarrhea, pain, fatigue and weight loss , but the localization is slightly different: whereas
      CD affects the whole gastrointestinal tract, UC primarily affects the distal intestine and
      ileum (De Lange et al., 2015).

      Lennard-Jones et al. have defined macroscopic and microscopic criteria to establish the
      diagnosis of Crohn's disease. The macroscopic diagnostic tools include physical examination,
      endoscopy and radiology. Microscopic features can be assessed on mucosal biopsy and/or
      operative specimen. The diagnosis depends on the finding of discontinuous and often
      granulomatous intestinal inflammation (Lennard-Jones et al., 1997). Diagnosis of ulcerative
      colitis is based on history, endoscopic appearances, histopathology of multiple mucosal
      biopsies and appropriate radiology (Silverberg et al., 2005, Satsangi et al., 2006).

      The incidence pattern of UC has changed over the last two decades, with incidence continuing
      to rise in the West and rising incidence in previously low incidence areas such as Asia and
      the Middle East (0.15- 6.5 per 100,000)(Ng et al., 2017). Marked increase in UC diagnoses was
      noted over a 15-year period (1995-2009). In Cairo University, 17 cases were recorded in
      1995-1999 and 76 cases were recorded in 2005-2009 (Esmat et al., 2014).

      Both CD and UC are complex diseases genetically, in which hundreds of independent genetic
      loci contribute to disease susceptibility (Norouzinia et al., 2015) . Nevertheless, the
      molecular mechanisms and functions of many IBD associated genes remain unknown. In addition
      to genetics, IBDs are powerfully influenced by microbiological and environmental aspect
      (Norouzinia et al., 2017).

      Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have allowed a better understanding of IBD thus,
      several genetic susceptibility loci have been identified for UC and CD (Yamamoto-Furusho et
      al., 2015). Among the genetic factors involved, there are several polymorphisms in molecules
      of the Immune system associated with either susceptibility or protective effects to IBD
      progression, but even with contradictory associations, mainly depending on the onset (adult
      or pediatric), sample size differences and on the ethnicity-dependent genetic background
      (Neuman et al., 2012, Ng et al., 2012, Peng et al., 2017, Girardelli et al., 2018).

      PTPN22 protein contains three domains, including: an N-terminal PTP catalytic domain; an
      interdomain region; and a C-terminal domain with four proline-rich regions that function as
      motifs for interaction with other protein (Stanford et al., 2014).Tyrosine phosphatase is
      involved in maintaining intestinal epithelial barrier function, regulating autophagosome
      function and immune responses to invading bacteria in intestinal cells, limiting
      pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in the intestine as well as controlling differentiation
      and function of CD4+ T-cells in vivo (Spalinger et al., 2015). The lymphoid tyrosine
      phosphatase (Lyp) encoded by PTPN22 plays a critical role as a negative regulator of T-cell
      activation by dephosphorylating T-cell receptor activation dependent kinases (Csk kinase)
      (Cloutier et al., 1999). PTPN22 is a critical regulator of the (Nod Like Receptor Family
      Pyrine Domain Containing 3 ) NLRP3 inflammasome by controlling NLRP3 tyrosine phosphorylation
      . Further, PTPN22 controls NLRP3-mediated IL-1beta secretion in an autophagy dependent manner
      (Yilmaz et al., 2018) .

      PTPN22 gene is located on the short arm of Chromosome 1 (1p13.2). There are 24 exons in the
      gene (NCBI website).About 21 SNPs were found in PTPN22 gene (rs1310182, rs3789604,
      rs33996649, rs1217414, rs2476601, rs12760457, rs2488457,,,,etc).SNP rs2476601 (C1858&gt;T) in
      exon 14 results in the substitution of arginine 620 with a tryptophan residue in the protein
      product (referred to as 620W variant) (Spalinger et al., 2016). SNP rs33996649 (G788&gt;A) in
      exon 10 mediates substitution of arginine 263 with a glutamine residue (referred to as 263Q
      variant) and affects the ability of Lyp to interact with the Csk kinase, thus avoiding the
      formation of the complex and the resulting suppression of T-cell activation(Hedjoudje et al.,
      2017) . SNP rs2488457 (G -1123&gt;C) is located in the promoter region (Chen et al., 2013).A
      transcription factor binding site for activator protein 4 (AP-4) at position −1123 is
      predicted in the presence of the G allele rather than the C allele (Jüliger et al., 2003).

      Contradictory results have been published regarding the association of PTPN22 gene SNPs with
      IBD (Bank et al., 2014, Sfar et al., 2010, Chen et al., 2013, Latiano et al., 2007,
      Diaz-Gallo et al., 2011, Wagenleiter et al., 2005, Zaid et al., 2018, Sadr et al., 2019).

      In Egypt studies were done regarding the association of PTPN22 gene SNPs with{ Type1 DM
      (El-Kafoury et al., 2014), ITP (Anis et al., 2011) ,SLE (Elghzaly et al., 2015) , Alopecia
      Areata (El-Zawahry et al., 2013) and RA (Salama et al., 2014) }.

      Uptodate , no studies were published regarding the association of PTPN22 gene SNPs with IBD
      in egyptians.
