  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter hospital-based prospective cohort study conducted in institutions with
      known expertise in performing oocytes/embryo freezing for fertility preservation. The study
      aims at refining the understanding of the efficacy and safety of controlled ovarian
      stimulation with or without letrozole in young women with newly diagnosed breast cancer who
      are candidates to receive (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients enrolled in this study undergo standard or &quot;random start&quot; ovarian stimulation with
      Gonadotropins using antagonist protocol before the beginning of chemotherapy. Ovulation is
      triggered in all patients with a GnRH agonist.

      After retrieval, oocytes are denuded and matured oocytes are subjected to fertilization
      before embryo freezing or direct vitrification.

      Primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of performing a controlled ovarian stimulation
      with or without letrozole in young women with newly diagnosed breast cancer who are
      candidates to receive (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy in terms of mature oocytes collected.

    <description>Patients start ovarian stimulation protocol according to their menstrual cycle phase at enrollment (standard or &quot;random start&quot;). Ovarian stimulation includes gonadotropins administration in a GnRH antagonist protocol.
&quot;Standard Protocol&quot;: letrozole is orally administered (5mg/d) from cycle day 2-3 throughout the ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins protocol until ovulation triggering.
&quot;Random start&quot; protocol: letrozole is administered throughout the stimulation together with gonadotropins.
GnRH antagonist is administered at cycle day 7 or as soon as at least one follicle reaches 12-14 mm.
Oocytes are collected 36h after ovulation triggering with GnRH agonist.</description>
