      This protocol is an open-label, single-arm, multisite protocol to provide IV ribavirin
      treatment to patients with probable or suspected case of HFRS. Individuals with a tentative
      diagnosis of HFRS will be admitted to the MTF and treated for up to 7 days with doses of IV
      ribavirin.

             II CHF or greater includes CHF resulting in mild symptoms with ordinary physical
             activity, or marked or severe limitations of activity [See Appendix B for New York
             Heart Association Functional Classification of Angina and CHF].

          -  Has known cardiac conduction defects that may predispose the patient to arrhythmias
