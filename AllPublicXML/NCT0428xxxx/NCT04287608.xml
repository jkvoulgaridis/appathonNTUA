  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to characterize the clinical phenotype(s) of
      DUPIXENT®-associated conjunctivitis events.

      The secondary objectives of the study are to characterize the course of conjunctivitis events
      during the observation period and collect and assess data on treatment for conjunctivitis
      events and its effectiveness.

        This study will enroll DUPIXENT®-treated patients with protocol-specified conjunctivitis
        events as well as reference patients with no clinical signs of conjunctivitis. Study
        participants will be recruited from patients being treated with DUPIXENT® for AD according
        to US Prescribing Information in the real-world setting, who develop conjunctivitis on
        treatment. These patients will be recruited with the help of a referral network of
        dermatologists and other physicians who treat patients with moderate-to-severe AD.

    <criteria>

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Treated with DUPIXENT® for AD continuously for at least 8 weeks per the current US
             Prescribing Information.

          -  Patients with protocol-specified conjunctivitis events must present with active
             bilateral conjunctivitis (with or without cornea or eyelid involvement) diagnosed by
             the ophthalmologist (investigator) which meets all of the following criteria:

          -  Developed (or significantly worsened) while receiving treatment with DUPIXENT® for AD

          -  Is clinically significant (eg, moderate-to-severe, extensive, persistent, etc) as
             determined by the investigator

          -  There is a suspected causal relationship between DUPIXENT® and conjunctivitis because:

          -  Conjunctivitis is a new-onset condition or an unusual worsening of a preexisting
             condition (eg, significantly more severe, more extensive, or more protracted than ever
             before) AND

          -  No alternative explanation is more plausible, in the opinion of the investigator

          -  Reference patients must have AD currently treated with DUPIXENT®, which has been
             administered continuously for equal or longer duration as compared to group 1, with no
             clinical signs of ocular inflammation noted during the entire DUPIXENT® treatment;

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any known medical, social, or personal limitations that are likely to restrict the
             patient's ability to undergo study visits and complete study procedures (as assessed
             by the investigator), including hypersensitivity or other contraindications to
             fluorescein dye or to the anesthetic eye drops used during the ophthalmological
             examination.

        NOTE: Other protocol defined inclusion/exclusion criteria apply.
