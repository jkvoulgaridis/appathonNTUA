    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate a greater proportion of patients with
      significant improvement, according to ASAS20 definition, after 12 weeks of vagus nerve
      stimulation (VNS) treatment than with placebo non-specific stimulation (control group).

      The secondary objectives of the study are to show differences in improvement between the
      active and placebo periods of treatment with active SNV and SNV placebo of the following
      items:

        1. Improvement according to &quot;ASAS40&quot; criteria

        2. Obtaining a partial remission according to the ASAS definition

        3. Improvement of BASFI

        4. Decrease of C-reactive protein (CRP) serum level and erythrocytes sedimentation rate
           (ESR),

        5. Improvement of ASDAS_CRP and ASDAS_ESR

        6. Difference in levels of circulating cytokines: IL-6, IL-23, IL-17, IL-33 and of matrix
           metallopeptidases (MMP3-8-9)

        7. Improvement of quality of life: assessment according to the following indexes: SF-36, AS
           Quality of Life (ASQOL)

        8. Improvement of Health Index of patient with SpA (ASAS HI) and of the Productivity at
           Work Index (WPI)

        9. Improvement of fatigue (BASDAI 1st question) and global pain

       10. Improvement of Anxiety and Depression Assessment (HAD)

       11. Improvement of BASMI

       12. Decrease of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) intake score.

  <detailed_description>

      The efficacy of non-invasive VNS therapy in patients with axial SpA has never been studied.
      This study will assess the benefit-risk balance of the therapy through a randomized
      double-blind cross over clinical trial.

      This multi-center study will be conducted in rheumatology departments of 17 public hospitals
      in France.

      A transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulator Tens Eco 2 SCHWA MEDICO™ France will be used in this
      study. Before the beginning of the study, a VNS practical training seminar will be organized
      in order for all future investigators.

      All patients eligible for this study must have been previously treated according to national
      and international guidelines for patients with axial SpA. Adult patients with axial SpA
      diagnosed and followed for at least one year, insufficiently relieved despite optimal drug
      management, including at least two lines of biotherapies tested for at least 6 months, will
      be enrolled in this study.

      The duration of participation (treatment + follow-up) for each patient: 7 months.
