  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an extension trial of a prior trial (NCT02213458). Both persons with dementia (PWD)
      and their caregivers were enrolled as dyads. The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is
      to evaluate the benefits of a program that supports model care for PWD and their caregivers.
      Whereas the prior trial only delivered care and examined outcomes up to 12-months, this trial
      extends care and outcome measurement for 5 years or until death, and includes all dyads where
      the caregiver reported high caregiver burden (Zarit-12 greater than or equal to 17) at
      pre-randomization baseline for the original trial. Participants were recruited from
      California, Nebraska and Iowa. Participants determined to be eligible were consented and
      randomized into one of two groups. Two thirds of dyads were enrolled into Navigated Care that
      provided them with phone-based assistance in meeting important benchmarks in their care, for
      example completion of legal and financial planning and strategies for minimizing caregiver
      burden. One third of dyads were enrolled to a control group, entitled Survey of Care.
      Outcomes were unchanged from the original trial except for the addition of time to long term
      care placement and are detailed below.
