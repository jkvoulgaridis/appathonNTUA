  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well decitabine with ruxolitinib or fedratinib works before
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant in treating patients with accelerated/blast phase
      myeloproliferative neoplasms (tumors). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as decitabine, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Ruxolitinib and fedratinib may stop
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving
      chemotherapy before a donor hematopoietic stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cells
      in the bone marrow, including normal blood-forming cells (stem cells) and cancer cells. When
      the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's
      bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The donated
      stem cells may also replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer
      cells. Decitabine, with ruxolitinib or fedratinib, may work better than multi-agent
      chemotherapy or no pre-transplant therapy, in treating patients with accelerated/blast phase
      myeloproliferative neoplasms.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive decitabine intravenously (IV) once daily (QD) over 1 hour on days 1-10, and
      either ruxolitinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) or fedratinib daily on days 1-28. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 5 years.
