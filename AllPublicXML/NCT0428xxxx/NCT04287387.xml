    <textblock>
      Intestinal microflora refers to the trillions of microorganisms living in our gut, which is
      considered as an independent endocrine organ of human body. Intestinal microbiota plays a
      very important role in human health. The composition of human intestinal microbiota is
      affected by a variety of factors, including age, living region, eating habits, nutrition,
      probiotics, antibiotics and so on. It is found that the imbalance of intestinal microbiota is
      closely related to the occurrence and development of metabolic diseases including type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM). There are great differences in the structure and function of
      intestinal microbiota between healthy people and T2DM patients, and recently changes of
      intestinal microbiota have been observed in pre-diabetes. In recent years, it has been found
      that some commonly used hypoglycemic drugs may regulate and improve the imbalance of
      intestinal flora of T2DM patients, including metformin, α - glucosidase inhibitor, and
      Glucagon-like peptide-1(GLP-1) receptor agonist, which have a positive impact on the short
      chain fatty acid (SCFAs) producing bacteria. However, on the one hand, subjects of those
      studies were mostly western population and there were just a few studies on the influence of
      anti-diabetic drug on human gut microbiota in Chinese population, on the other hand, the
      study of influence of Dipeptidyl peptidase-4(DPP-4) inhibitors, sulfonylureas,
      sodium-dependent glucose transporters-2(SGLT-2) inhibitors or thiazolidinediones on
      intestinal microbiota is rare or even absent. This study aims to explore the effect of
      different hypoglycemic drugs on intestinal flora and find the potential intestinal target of
      drug action in Chinese population.

      In this study, T2DM patients who were free of anti-diabetic drugs or those have taken
      hypoglycemic drugs and ready to add a new drug were recruited, they were treated with
      metformin, α - glucosidase inhibitor, DPP-4 inhibitors, sulfonylureas, SGLT-2 inhibitors, or
      thiazolidinediones according to their state of illness. Faecal specimen will be collected for
      test of composition of gut microbiota at baseline and 4-week, 8-week，12-week after taking
      medication. At baseline, patients will take physical examination and blood test, every
      patient will complete the questionnaire under the direction of doctors to get their general
      information and diet habits. Physical examination and blood test will repeat at 4-week,
      8-week，12-week after treatment.
