  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with JDM are weak and get tired because their muscles aren't able to work like
      healthy muscles. This can make it hard for them to do normal everyday things and can make
      them less happy about their lives compared to children without the disease. There are two
      nutritional supplements that help muscles use energy and recover after exercise: creatine and
      coenzyme Q10. If the muscle has more energy, it may not be as weak and may not feel as tired
      or sore after exercise. Because of this we want to see if having children with JDM take
      creatine and coenzyme Q10 can make them stronger and less tired. If this works, we hope it
      will let them be able to do the things that healthy children can do, and make them feel
      better about their lives.

    <measure>Change in muscle function</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in muscle function will be determined by the change in peak power achieved on the wingate anaerobic cycling test between the active supplement phase and the placebo phase</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in muscle fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in muscle fatigue will be determined by the change in the fatigue index during the wingate test. Fatigue index is a percentage, and is calculated as follows: [(Peak Power - End Power)/Peak Power] x100</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in general fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in fatigue will be determined by the change in the Pediatric Quality of Life - Fatigue Module scores (PedsQL-Fatigue). This measure is scored on a scale of 0-100 with 100 representing the least amount of fatigue.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in quality of life will be determined by the change in the Quality of My Life questionnaire scores. Quality of my Life consists of 3 visual analog scales each scored out of 10. Higher scores indicate better quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in physical function</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in physical function will be determined by the change in the hand grip strength, measured using a hand dynamometer. Three attempts will be given per hand, and the maximum grip strength achieved (in kg displaced) will be recorded for each hand.</description>
