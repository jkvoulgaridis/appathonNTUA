      An observational study to determine outcomes of older adults who are under naturopathic
      medical care for cognitive complaints at a specific clinic in Southern California.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective observational study will examine patient outcomes associated with
      individualized, whole-system integrative medical care, provided by a naturopathic physician
      at a specific clinic in the state of California. Participants will be older adult patients of
      the clinic who present with objectively measurable cognitive dysfunction, and who elect to
      voluntarily participate in the study.

      Participants' cognitive function will be assessed using validated objective (NIH Toolbox) and
      subjective (NIH Neuro-Quality of Life questionnaires) instruments. The primary outcomes are
      change from baseline to six months post-baseline in these two instruments.

      Additionally, physical activity and sleep data will be tracked using wearable telemetry, and
      neurophysiological parameters will be measured with electroencephalography. Detailed
      treatment descriptions and adverse events will be tracked.
