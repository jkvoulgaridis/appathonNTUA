  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomly allocated to one of two experimental conditions: social
      exclusion or social inclusion. Participants, but not experimenters will be blind to the
      assignment. Pre- and post-tests will be administered. Participants will be offered 7 euros in
      compensation for participating.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Anger State from baseline to end of the experiment</measure>
    <time_frame>The STAXI-2 will be administered twice: at Baseline and at the same day of Baseline assessment just after the experimental task (end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>The STAXI-2 includes a measure of anger state (15 items) with responses ranging from 1=&quot;Absolutely not&quot; to 3=&quot;A lot&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Trait Injustice</measure>
    <time_frame>This measure will be administered at Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Trait Injustice Experiences Questionnaire is a measure of perceived trait injustice beliefs that has 12 items, with responses ranging from 0=&quot;never&quot; to 4=&quot;always&quot;. This measure will be used as moderator of the effects of the experiment on anger</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frustration Discomfort Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>This measure will be administered at Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This is a measure of frustration intolerance. The scale has 28 items that are gouped in 4 subscales. Items have a 1-to-5 response scale ranging from &quot;nothing&quot; to &quot;a lot&quot;. In addition to trait injustice, this measure will also be used in secondary analyses as a moderator of the effects of the experiment on anger</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in State Injustice from baseline to end of the experiment</measure>
    <time_frame>This measure will be administered twice: at Baseline and at the same day of Baseline assessment just after the experimental task (end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>The State Injustice Experiences Questionnaire is a measure of perceived state injustice beliefs that has 12 items, with responses ranging from 0=&quot;never&quot; to 4=&quot;always&quot;. This measure will be used as an experimental check (whether exclusion in the experiment effectively increased the sense of injustice in the short term)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in State Anxiety from baseline to end of the experiment</measure>
    <time_frame>This measure will be administered twice: at Baseline and at the same day of Baseline assessment just after the experimental task (end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>The STAI-S is a measure of perceived state anxiety that has 20 items, with responses ranging from 0=&quot;not at all&quot; to 3=&quot;a lot&quot;. This measure will be used as an experimental check (whether exclusion in the experiment effectively increased anxiety in the short term)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cyberball Experiences post-experimental check Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>This measure will be administered at the same day of Baseline assessment just after the experimental task (end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>In addition to exploring the effects of the experimental task on anxiety and anger, the Cyberball includes a measure of impact of the task on perceived inclusion and related concepts (isolation, belonging, perceived number of passes received, etc.). This will also be used as an experimental check</description>
