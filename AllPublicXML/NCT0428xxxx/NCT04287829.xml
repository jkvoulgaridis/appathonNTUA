  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no standard second line treatment in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM).
      Pembrolizumab has shown to be active in in small phase II studies in MPM. Its activity
      however, is limited, with a response rate up to 20%. So, there is a need for new treatment
      combinations with drugs that might exhibit a synergistic interaction with pembrolizumab.

      There is no standard second line treatment in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM).
      Pembrolizumab has shown to be active in in small phase II studies in MPM. Its activity
      however, is limited, with a response rate up to 20%. So, there is a need for new treatment
      combinations with drugs that might exhibit a synergistic interaction with pembrolizumab. The
      mechanisms of actions of lenvatinib, which has a broad spectrum of activities, predicts many
      synergistic interactions with PD-1 blocking. The aim of this study is to characterize the
      potential clinical activity, toxicity and biomarkers of outcome of pembrolizumab - lenvatinib
      in patients with recurrent MPM.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologically diagnosed malignant pleural mesothelioma, age at least
             18 years

          2. Progressive disease after at least 1 and maximal 2 prior systemic treatment lines, in
             which one of the lines contains a platinum-based doublet (both cisplatin and
             carboplatin are allowed) for unresectable MPM

          3. Measurable disease. At least one measurable lesion according to Modified (i)RECIST for
             pleural mesothelioma. Lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered
             measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions

          4. WHO-ECOG performance status of 0 to 1. Evaluation of ECOG is to be performed within 7
             days prior to date of allocation

          5. Adequate organ function

          6. Ability to understand the study and give signed informed consent (or legally
             acceptable representative if applicable) prior to beginning of protocol specific
             procedures including the approval of the thoracoscopy or transthoracic pleural biopsy
             before the first treatment cycle and an optional biopsy before the third treatment
             cycle

          7. No presence of clinically relevant treatment-related toxicity from previous
             chemotherapy, targeted therapy and/or radiotherapy. Note: Participates must have

             history of myocardial infarction within the past 12 months prior to screening,
             congestive heart failure &gt; NYHA II, serious cardiac arrhythmia), unstable peptic
             ulcer, unstable diabetes mellitus or other seriously disabling condition

          9. Adequately controlled blood pressure (BP) with or without antihypertensive
             medications, defined as BP ≤150/90 mmHg at screening ad no change in hypertensive
             medication within 1 week before the cycle 1/day1.

         10. No prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti PD L2 agent or with another
             agent agents direct to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (eg
             CTLA-4, OC-40, CD137) or TKI or antibody targeting angiogenesis. Patients who have
             been treated with autologous tumor cell vaccination (eg. Dendritic cell-based
             immunotherapy) will be eligible

             must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require corticosteroids
             as therapy for radiation induced toxicities. A 1-week washout is permitted for
             palliative radiation (≤2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-CNS disease.

         13. No major injuries and/or surgery within the past 4 weeks prior to first study dose
             with incomplete wound healing
