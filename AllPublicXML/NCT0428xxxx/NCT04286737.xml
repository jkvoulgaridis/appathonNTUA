    <textblock>
      Aim: The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of therapeutic touch applied to
      infants with infantile colic on infant colic scale score, crying and sleep time.

      Method: The study will be conducted as a single-blind, randomized controlled trial. The
      population of the study will be infants who come to the Pediatrics Outpatient Clinic and are
      diagnosed as infantile colic according to the evaluation of the pediatrician and have no
      other health problems. The infants will be divided into two groups as intervention and
      control groups according to stratified block randomization in the computer environment. After
      the randomization, therapeutic touch will be applied to the intervention group. No method
      will be applied to the control group.

      The research will be carried out with two groups as intervention and control groups. Sample
      size of the study has been determined by the power analysis, in line with the results
      obtained from the studies which have been conducted using a similar research method.
      According to the analysis results, it has been calculated as 27 for each group and 54 in
      total. Considering the possible case losses, 20% of the sample was increased. The sample
      consisted of 64 babies, 32 intervention and 32 control. Mothers of the infants meeting the
      study inclusion criteria will be informed both in written and verbally. Written consent will
      be obtained. The infants will be divided into two groups according to stratified block
      randomization in the computer environment. The infants will be stratified by gender and age.
      After the randomization, therapeutic touch will be applied to the intervention group. No
      method will be applied to the control group by the researcher. In obtaining research data, 4
      tools will be used: &quot;Mother-infant Information Form&quot;, &quot;Infantile Colic Scale&quot;, Crying Time
      Registration Form and Sleep Time Registration Form.

    <description>Ellet et al. (2002) developed a Likert-type scale to determine the factors causing colic and to diagnose colic. Cetinkaya and Başbakkal (2007) tested the validity and reliability of the scale for the Turkish population. The scale consists of 5 sub-dimensions and 19 items.The low total score average from the scale indicates that the colic decreases, and the high average score indicates that the colic increases.</description>
