  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the investigator's institute there is ongoing treatment of different patients with
      cognitive deficits using Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). These patients undergo
      neuro-cognitive function computerized tests before and after treatment.

      The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the cognitive changes before and after
      HBOT in different patients populations.

      Retrospective analysis of patients suffering from chronic neuro-cognitive deficits due to
      different conditions, treated at Sagol center for hyperbaric medicine and research, Shamir
      (Assaf Harofeh) Medical Center, Israel

      Patients included if they had at least two neurocognitive tests, before and after Hyperbaric
      Oxygen Therapy (HBOT). The study was approved by the institutional review board of the
      hospital.

      Patients were treated with 40-60 daily hyperbaric sessions, 5 days per week. Each session
      consists of 90 minutes exposure to 100% oxygen at 1.5-2 ATA.
