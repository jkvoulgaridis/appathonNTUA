      This study aims to examine the effectiveness of Experience Sampling Method (ESM) derived
      personalised feedback for women at risk of depressive disorder in Hong Kong, in reducing
      individuals depressive symptoms.

      Women who are at-risk for depressive disorder and have completed the online screening for
      Jockey Club Mental Wellness Project for Women (JCWow) will be recruited. This study aims to
      test the effectiveness of ESM-derived personalized feedback in reducing symptoms of
      depressive disorder using a randomised controlled trial. After given written consent, the
      participants will be required to undergo a 5 days baseline ESM data collection (week 0). Upon
      completion of baseline data collection, they will be randomly assigned to the intervention
      (ESM-F), active reference (ESM) or control (CON) group. The participants in the intervention
      group will participate in an ESM procedure (three days per week over a 6-week period) using a
      smartphone APP (week 1 - 6). This group will receive weekly standardised feedback on
      personalised patterns of positive affect. The active reference group will also participate in
      the same ESM procedure without a weekly feedback. The control group will not be required to
      undergo this 6-week data collection procedure. At week 7, all three groups will undergo
      another 5 days of post-intervention ESM data collection in order to examine the naturalistic
      and interventional changes on the depressive symptoms. From week 8 onwards, the participants
      will be contacted 5 times (week 8, 12, 16, 20 and 32) via telephone to follow-up their
      condition. After 32 weeks, both active reference and control group will receive the report.

    <description>Participants will be required to participate in an ESM data collection procedure. Participants will be required to complete a beep-questionnaire 3 days a week, over a 6-week period. The mobile app will be programmed to emit a beep 10 times per day at random intervals between 7.30 and 22.30. At each beep, participants will use the app to digitally complete a brief beep-questionnaire, which covers current affect, current context and activities. Moreover, participants will receive weekly standardized feedback on personalized patterns of positive affect.</description>

    <description>The ESM-F group will receive standardised ESM-derived feedback immediately followed the weekly ESM data collection procedure, totalling 6 times in the entire intervention period. The feedback will be provided by the researcher in the format of written report and verbal explanation. The feedback on participants' momentary affective state in specific daily life contexts and the association with depressive symptoms will be given. The changes in positive affect level and the number of depressive complaints over the course of the ESM intervention will be shown.</description>
