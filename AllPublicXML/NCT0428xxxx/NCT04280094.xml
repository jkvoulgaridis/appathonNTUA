  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two hundred consecutive unilateral inguinal hernia patients will be included in the study.
      Patients will be recorded by measuring the distance between the pubic tubercle and the deep
      inguinal ring, the distance between the inguinal ligament and the internal oblique
      aponeurosis, the distance between the deep and superficial inguinal ring diameters and their
      anterior superior iliac spine. The contribution of these measures to the determination of the
      ideal mesh size will be analyzed.

      This prospective study includes 200 consecutive male patients who underwent unilateral open
      inguinal hernia repair since March 2020. Under-18 hernias, complicated hernias, recurrent
      hernias, and those with laparoscopic hernia repair will be excluded. Initially, the distance
      between the pubic tubercle and the medial edge of the deep inguinal ring will be measured.
      Next, the distance between the inner edge of the inguinal ligament and the upper level of the
      internal oblique aponeurosis will be measured at the Hesselbach triangle. Hesselbach triangle
      area will be calculated. The diameter of the superficial and deep inguinal ring and their
      spina iliaca anterior superior (SIAS) distance will be measured. The contribution of these
      measures to the determination of the ideal mesh size will be analyzed.

    <description>Patients will be recorded by measuring the distance between the pubic tubercle and the deep inguinal ring, the distance between the inguinal ligament and the internal oblique aponeurosis, the distances between the deep and superficial inguinal ring diameters and the anterior superior iliac spine. Then the data will be analyzed in the SPSS statistics program. Average, maximum, and minimum values of anatomical dimensions will be subtracted. Relationships with age, body length, and body mass index will be analyzed statistically, and the ideal mesh size detectability will be investigated. When the analysis is completed, the study will be terminated.</description>
