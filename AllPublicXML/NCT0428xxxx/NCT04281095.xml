          -  Subjects assigned a glabellar line severity grade of 2 or greater (moderate) at
             maximum frown assessed by the Investigator

          -  Subjects who provide written consent to voluntarily participate in the study after
             receiving and understanding a detailed explanation of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with diseases that may affect neuromuscular function, such as Myasthenia

          -  Subjects with significant facial asymmetry

          -  Individuals whose glabellar lines cannot be satisfactorily improved with physical
             methods since lines are not flattened even using hands

          -  Subjects who have received medication that inhibits neuromuscular function within the
             4 weeks prior to screening such as muscle relaxants, anticholinergics, benzodiazepines
             and similar drugs, benzamides, tetracycline antibiotics, lincomycin antibiotics, and
             aminoglycoside antibiotics

          -  Subjects taking anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents (Use of low-dose aspirin (325
             mg/day or less) to prevent blood clotting is allowed)

          -  Subjects who have received aspirin or NSAIDs within 7 days prior to administration of
             the IP.

          -  Subjects with skin abnormalities such as infection at the injection site,
             dermatopathy, or scars.

          -  Subjects with the history of treatment of the glabellar region (including the
             forehead) such as face lifting, permanent implants, or fillers

          -  Subjects who have received other procedures that may affect the assessment of the
             glabellar or forehead lines during the following periods:

               -  Within 6 months of screening: facial plastic surgery such as tissue augmentation,
                  brow lift, or dermal resurfacing.

               -  Within 6 months of screening: injection of dermal fillers with hyaluronic acid as
                  the main ingredient.

               -  Within 12 months of screening: injection of dermal fillers with ingredients other
                  than hyaluronic acid as the main ingredient.

          -  Individuals planning a facial cosmetic procedure (skin fillers, photorejuvenation,
             chemical/mechanical peeling, etc.) during the study period.

          -  Individuals who have received a botulinum toxin preparation within 5 months prior to
             screening or those who are expected to receive a botulinum toxin preparation for any
             other purpose than the indication of this study (glabellar lines).

          -  Subjects with the history of excessive alcohol consumption or drug addiction

          -  Individuals with an anxiety disorder or other significant psychiatric disorders (e.g.,

          -  Individuals who answered &quot;yes&quot; to any of the questions on the Columbia University
             Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) regarding a case within the past 12 months at
             the screening

          -  Female subjects of childbearing age who do not agree to practice contraception using
             medically allowed contraceptive methods during the study period (hormonal
             contraception, IUD (intrauterine device) or IUS (intrauterine system), tubal ligation,
             dual protection (using a combination of male condom, female condom, cervical cap,
             contraceptive diaphragm, or contraceptive sponge)

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  Subjects who are allergic or sensitive to the IP or its components

          -  Individuals with concomitant illnesses that make them unsuitable for participation in

             deficiency), kidney disease, liver disease, or lung disease

          -  Individuals who have participated in other clinical trials within 3 months prior to
