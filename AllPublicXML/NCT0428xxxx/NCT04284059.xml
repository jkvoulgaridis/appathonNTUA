  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Around 7.2% of children around the world are suffering from ADHD. On account of current
      medical treatment, a high remission rate can be reached for ADHD. Nevertheless, patients have
      to face a number of side effects associated with the treatment. It was informed that patients
      of ADHD have a tendency to vitamin A and vitamin D deficiency. The aim of the study is to
      determine the effect of vitamin A and vitamin D supplementation as adjunctive therapy to
      methylphenidate on symptoms of ADHD. 504 subjects aged 6-12 years with a diagnosis of ADHD
      based on DSM-5 criteria are randomly assigned into three groups to receive vitamin A 6000
      IU/day and vitamin D 2100 IU/day, or vitamin D 2100 IU/day or placebo adding to
      methylphenidate for 8 weeks. Symptoms severity is assessed by Vanderbilt Assessment Scales
      and Questionnaire - Children with Difficulties at weeks 0, 4, and 8. Serum levels of retinol
      and 25(OH)D are measured at baseline and after 8 weeks. All the other sociodemographic data
      are assessed. The study can give more references on the application of vitamin A and vitamin
      D in addition to methylphenidate to ADHD. Future research is needed to clarify mechanism of
      vitamin A and vitamin D on ADHD.

      1. Procedures The patients showed deficiency or insufficiency in vitamin A (≤1.05 umol/ L)
           and vitamin D (≤50 nmol/L) are stratified by gender and randomly assigned in
           double-blind fashion in a 1:1:1 ratio to the vitamin AD supplementation group, vitamin D
           supplementation group or the placebo group. The participants will be given the related
           interventions. Placebo constituents by oily liquids without vitamin A and vitamin D.
           Placebo, vitamin AD and vitamin D are identical in the appearance to guarantee blind.
           These patients will be followed up at weeks 4 and 8 to evaluate the changes of ADHD
           symptoms after adding the adjunctive therapy to methylphenidate. And serum concentration
           of retinol and 25(OH)D are measured at weeks 8. Accordingly, the placebo group and
           vitamin D group will be prescribed with vitamin A and vitamin D supplementation on the
           grounds of retinol and 25 (OH)D concentration after the study. All the groups are
           intervened by behavior.

        2. Demographic questionnaire and clinical data The demographic questionnaire is completed
           by the child's primary caregiver, detailing child's name, gender, and date of birth;
           supplementation of vitamin A/D products or vitamin A/D-containing products; the exposure
           time and body part to sun and using of sunscreen cream. Clinical data will be
           ascertained from the medical records, including information about DSM-5 diagnosis,
           disease classification, current treatment, and comorbid conditions.

        3. Sample size This study is a randomized double-blind controlled trial. Intervention
           groups are vitamin AD group and vitamin D group, control group is placebo group. The
           primary outcome index is changes in ADHD symptoms evaluated by Vanderbilt Assessment
           Scales and Questionnaire - Children with Difficulties (QCD) in the last 4 weeks or 8
           weeks. The second outcome is the serum concentration of vitamin A and vitamin D.
           Conner's Parent Rating Scale (CPRS) was considered as the main outcome in the previous
           literature, the mean ± SD of ADHD index was 55.84 ± 10.2, 56.79 ± 9.6 for vitamin D +
           methylphenidate(n = 25), placebo + methylphenidate (n = 29) respectively. The
           investigators cautiously presume that the mean ± SD for vitamin AD + methylphenidate is
           54 ± 9.88. Considering 0.05 of the alpha and 0.80 of power, a sample of 453 subjects
           divided among 3 groups are calculated by PASS 2020. And 504 subjects are enrolled in the
           study based on the dropout rate of 10%.

        4. Statistical analysis All the data are analyzed using SPSS 19.0. The normality of
           variables are assessed by Kolmogorov Smirnov test. Comparison of parametric and
           nonparametric variables between groups are examined by F test and Kruskal-Wallis test,
           respectively. Paired t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test are used to investigate
           within-group differences. Confounding factors are adjusted by the analysis of
           covariance.

        5. Bias control the investigators will describe both responders and non-responders on
           demographic questionnaire and clinical data in detail to assess the selection bias. And
           in order to decrease the dropout rate, the investigators will contact with the patient's
           parents about compliance to therapy by Wechat, E-mail, sometimes telephone contact is
           necessary.

        6. Ethical matters and data protection The patients participated in the study will sign the
           informed consent (obtained from the guardian). And this study was approved by the local
           ethics committee . Patient's name will be abbreviated and the research data will be
           assigned a code then to provide to the researcher. The authorization from parents on the
           patient's health information remains valid until the study is completed. After that,
           researchers will delete private information from the study record.

    <masking_description>The participants and care providers don't know which group they are enrolled in. And the investigators just play a roll in recruiting the patients, inform the patients about the study, and then stratify the patients by gender and randomly assign the patients in a 1:1:1 ratio to the A group, B group or C group. The drugs are dispensed by a third party, and the third party will take notes about the patients' basic information and medication records. After the study, the third party will give the notes to investigators and outcomes assessor. The investigators will provide the compensatory therapy for the patients. The outcomes assessor will do the statistic analysis.</masking_description>

    <description>The Vanderbilt parent assessment scale is designed to measure the severity of ADHD symptoms for children aged 6 to 12. It has 2 components: symptom assessment and impairment in performance. The symptom assessment screens for symptoms relevant to inattentive (items 1-9) and hyperactive (items 10-18) ADHD. The items 49-56 are performance measures. The symptom measures in the scale, scored 0 to 3. A positive response in symptom assessment part is a 2 or 3 (often, very often). The performance measures in the scale, scored 1 to 5, with 4 and 5 being somewhat of a problem/problematic.
The scoring standard for Predominantly Inattentive subtype: Must score a 2 or 3 on 6 out of 9 items on questions 1-9 AND Score a 4 or 5 on any of the Performance questions 49-56. The higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>The Questionnaire - Children with Difficulties (QCD) measures the daily-life problems in children aged 6-18 years during the special time of the day, including in the morning, during school, after school, in the evening, and overall difficulties over the entire day and night. It has been proved the Chinese version of QCD has good validity and reliability. Filled in by the parents, the scale consists of 20 questions with regard to ADHD-related difficulties. Each question is scored on a four-point scale: 0 = completely disagree, 1 = somewhat (partially) agree, 2 = mostly agree, and 3 = completely agree. Score of 30 - 35 is considered as cut-off value for functional impairment and score of less than 30 is considered as functional impairment (Full marks: 57). The lower scores indicate lower life functioning and more difficulty in children's daily activities.</description>
