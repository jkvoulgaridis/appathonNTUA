    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an infection prevention bundle on surgical
      site infections in patients undergone brain tumor surgery. The patients were divided into 2
      groups: infection prevention bundle group and control group

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In cranial neurosurgery, surgical site infections (SSIs) occur in 0.5%-7.2% of patients,
      frequently require reoperations and long-lasting antibiotic treatment, and are often life
      threatening.

      Patients with malignant brain tumors often harbor several potential risk factors for SSI such
      as advanced age, poor nutritional state owing to appetite loss, poor sanitary condition of
      the head skin due to low performance status, immunosuppression caused by steroid or
      chemotherapeutic agents, and surgical site skin problems caused by post-operative
      irradiation. Therefore, patients with malignant brain tumors theoretically are a high-risk
      group for SSI.

      A care bundle technique, which is an aggregate of evidence-based practices expected to
      improve patient outcomes, has been introduced to reduce the incidence of SSI.

      The infection prevention bundle (IPB) implemented items:

        1. Preoperative counseling and questionnaire: patient counseling and preparation
           instructions, screening questions for signs of infection, and presence of open or
           nonhealing wounds.

        2. Nasal methicillin-resistant and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus
           decolonization: preoperative 24 hours ago twice-daily application of 2% mupirocin
           ointment to bilateral nares with final application on the morning of surgery.

        3. Body decolonization: Cleansing with 4% chlorhexidine gluconate shower the evening before
           surgery and the morning of surgery.

        4. Preoperative weight-based antibiotics within 60 minutes of incision

        5. Strict draping and surgical techniques the standardization

        6. Irrigation of the surgical site with warm Isotonic NaCl solution before skin closure

        7. Postoperative wound care education to patient and family

      Care bundle in preventing surgical site infections is an approach that requires team-based
      service delivery and physician-nurse cooperation. Although it is known abroad and use of
      existing care bundle is not a new concept in Turkey, much is unknown, it is determined that
      widespread and effective use. Experimental studies on the care bundles are needed especially
      in our country to prevent surgical site infections.

Patient's case doctor will be responsible to document in date collection form, if there are surgical site infection occur. A research team is responsible for the data collection. The definition of surgical site infection will be according to CDC definitions of nosocomial surgical site infections: a modification of CDC definitions of surgical wound infection.</description>

    <description>During the outpatient clinic visit, an information leaflet will be given about the subjects that should be considered for prevention of SSI before surgery. 2% mupirocin ointment will be applied to the nostrils with the swab twice-daily before surgery and once on the morning of surgery. Body cleaning will be done with 4% chlorhexidine gluconate shower the night before the surgery. Prophylactic antibiotics by weight will be administered within 60 minutes of anesthesia induction. The planned aseptic technique will be applied and a strict draping will be used in the incision site. Body temperature, blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate and O2 saturation of the patients will be monitored every 1 hour during the operation and data will be recorded on the data collection form. Before the skin closes, the surgical site will be washed with warm Isotonic NaCl solution. Wound care education will be provided to the patient and family before discharge.</description>
