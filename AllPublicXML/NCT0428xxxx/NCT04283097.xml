  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics(PK), and preliminary
      clinical activity of KPG-818 as a single agent in adult subjects with selected hematological
      malignancies, including multiple myeloma (MM), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), follicular
      lymphoma (FL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), indolent lymphoma, adult T-cell
      leukemia-lymphoma (ATL), or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This study will assist in
      identifying appropriate, well tolerated doses that can be administered in subsequent studies
      in subjects with selected hematological malignancies.

      This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, multiple-ascending dose study to evaluate the
      safety, PK, and preliminary clinical activity of KPG-818 as a single agent in adult subjects
      with selected hematological malignancies. The study center(s) will be in the US.

      After providing informed consent, subjects will be assessed for study eligibility at the
      Screening visit (Days -28 to -1). Cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects per dose level will be given
      escalating doses of KPG-818 during Days 1 to 21 of each 28-day cycle orally until progressive
      disease (PD), unacceptable toxicity, the subject withdraws, or any other study withdrawal
      criterion is met. The 5 planned dose escalation cohorts will be 2, 5, 10, 20, and 30 mg
      followed by dose expansion. The dose of KPG-818 for the first cohort will be 2 mg/day. The
      highest dose level which may be tested is 30 mg KPG-818. Dose escalation will follow a 3+3
      design and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) will be assessed during the 28-day DLT evaluation
      period. The Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will be responsible for dose escalation
      decisions, including whether to modify the dose escalation based on the DLT observations or
      determine RP2D. Escalation to the Maximal Tolerated Dose (MTD) is not appropriate if activity
      plateaus at a lower dose.

    <description>KPG-818 is a novel lenalidomide analog and a next generation of immunomodulatory agents. KPG-818 is structurally similar to Celgene's new investigational drug, CC-220, but with much greater cereblon (CRBN) binding affinity. KPG-818 is potent in inhibiting proliferation of hematological cancer cells growth both in vitro and in vivo. The First-in-Human phase I clinical study of KPG-818 has demonstrated that KPG-818 has a good PK profile and a broad safety window.</description>
