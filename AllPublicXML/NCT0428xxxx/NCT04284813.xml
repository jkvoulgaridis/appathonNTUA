  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate an intervention that adapts Community
      Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT) for families experiencing first episode psychosis
      and substance use delivered via telemedicine (video conferencing). The intervention aims to
      improve treatment engagement and reduce distress, and it will be delivered in-person
      (CRAFT-F) and/or via telemedicine (CRAFT-FT). To assess feasibility of the intervention,
      first, a pilot group of family members will complete the first half of sessions in-person and
      the second half via telemedicine in a counterbalanced order. Participants will provide
      feedback to refine the treatment manual.
