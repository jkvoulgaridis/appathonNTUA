    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Ability to understand the requirements of the trial, provide written informed consent
             (including consent for the use and disclosure of research-related health information),
             willingness and ability to comply with the trial protocol procedures (including
             required trial visits) of this trial.

          2. Male or female patient with one of the following options:

               -  Have completed the Week-48 visit of Stage B of the ARGX-113-1802 trial and are
                  considered to be eligible for treatment with efgartigimod PH20 SC; or

               -  Have deteriorated during Stage B of the ARGX-113-1802 trial and are considered to
                  be eligible for treatment with efgartigimod PH20 SC, or

               -  Have been offered the participation in the OLE trial due to early termination of
                  the ARGX-113-1802 trial (because sufficient events for the primary endpoint
                  analysis of the that trial have been reached and it is stopped) and are
                  considered to be eligible for treatment with efgartigimod PH20 SC treatment; or

               -  Have completed the Week-48 visit of the previous cycle of the OLE trial and are
                  considered to be eligible to continue with efgartigimod PH20 SC treatment.

          3. Women of childbearing potential who have a negative urine pregnancy test at baseline
             before IMP administration.

          4. Women of childbearing potential must use a highly effective method of contraception
             (failure rate of less than 1% per year) from baseline to 90 days after the last
             administration of IMP

          5. Non-sterilized male patients who are sexually active with a female partner of
             childbearing potential must use a condom and his partner must use a highly effective
             method of contraception (failure rate of less than 1% per year) from baseline to 90
             days after the last administration of IMP. Male patients practicing true sexual
             abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual life style of the
             participant) can be included. Sterilized male patients who have had vasectomy with
             documented aspermia post-procedure can be included. In addition, male patients are not
             allowed to donate sperm from baseline to 90 days after the last administration of IMP.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Week-48/ED visit in the ARGX-113-1802 trial or the Week-48 visit of the previous OLE
             participation occurred more than 14 days prior to SD1 of the OLE trial or the start of
             a new treatment cycle in the OLE trial and more than 21 days since the last dose of
             IMP.

          2. Pregnant and lactating women and those intending to become pregnant during the trial
             or within 90 days after last IMP administration.

          3. Patients with clinical evidence of other significant serious disease or patients who
             underwent a recent or have a planned major surgery, or any other reason which could
             confound the results of the trial or put the patient at undue risk.
