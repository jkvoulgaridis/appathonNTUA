      This is an open label, phase Ib Study of SHR-1701 in patients with recurrent/metastatic
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma(R/M NPC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of SHR-1701 in
      patients with R/M NPC. The secondary purpose is to assess the anti-tumor activity and
      immunogenicity of SHR-1210 in R/M NPC.
