  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study the effects of organ transplantation and immunosuppression on the human microbiome,
      and to understand the interlinkage of changes in the microbiome with clinical events
      surrounding transplantation, and graft and patient clinical outcomes.

      This study will involve the collection of oral swabs, saliva, urine and rectal swabs, blood
      and skin scrapings from patients before and after kidney and pancreas transplantation. At Day
      0 and day 1, week 1, and at 3, 6, and 12 months.

      These samples will be collected longitudinally over a period of one year after
      transplantation and will be analysed using 16s rRNA gene sequencing in order to capture the
      dynamics of the microbiome after exposure to surgery, immunosuppression and the specific
      medication necessary during the process of transplantation.

      Two groups of recipients will be recruited, the first one includes kidney and/or pancreas
      transplant recipients from both deceased and living donors.

      This study will involve the collection of oral swabs, saliva, urine and faeces samples, blood
      and skin scrapings from 50 patients (phase 1) and up to 300 patients (phase 2) before (day of
      arrival in hospital day 0 and after kidney and pancreas transplantation day 1, week 1, 3,
      6,12 months.

      In addition duodenal fluid from the donor duodenum which is opened at the time of pancreas
      transplantation will also be taken in theatre for analysis.

      Similar samples will be obtained from deceased multi-organ donors who have consent for
      research.

      Similar samples will also be taken from living kidney donors
