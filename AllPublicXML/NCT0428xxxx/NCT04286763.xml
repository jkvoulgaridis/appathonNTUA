  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The bile duct injury is a complication that occurs mainly after the cholecystectomy. Bile
      duct stricture is one of complications of this unwitting iatrogenic injury, the outcomes of
      surgery in this case are worse when the level of the stricture is above the helium.

      So what are factors influencing the occurrence of this high level bile duct obstruction ?

      The objective of this study was to answer a simple question, what are the factors influencing
      the occurrence of high level -called hilar biliary stricture? To answer this question, a
      retrospective study was carried out on the files of patients operated for biliary stenosis
      after operative trauma of the bile ducts in our department over a period from January 2010 to
      May 2018. Only patients operated in biliary stricture (Grade E Strasberg) was included.

      A univariate and muntivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the
      factors influencing the occurrence of hilar stenosis. data entry and analysis was done using
      SPSS V20.0 software.
