      This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of trastuzumab and necitumumab
      together with osimertinib, and to see how well they work for the treatment of stage IV
      non-small cell lung cancer that is EGFR-mutated, resistant to osimertinib, and has not
      responded to previous treatment (refractory). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such
      as trastuzumab and necitumumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Osimertinib may stop the growth
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving trastuzumab and
      necitumumab together with osimertinib may work better than osimertinib alone in treating
      patients with stage IV EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of osimertinib and necitumumab in
      combination with trastuzumab. (Phase Ib) II. Evaluate the efficacy of osimertinib,
      necitumumab, and trastuzumab (ONT) as measured by objective response rate (ORR), which is
      defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of ONT as measured progression free survival (PFS), duration of
      response (DoR), and overall survival (OS).

      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ONT as measured by adverse events (AEs)
      defined by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE V 5.0).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess patient-reported outcomes on health-related quality of life and adverse events.

      II. Assess potential biomarkers associated with response from liquid biopsies and optional
      but recommended baseline tissue biopsy.

      IIa. Correlate pre-and post-treatment biopsies molecular changes with response. III.
      Correlate mutant allele fraction in circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) via
      liquid biopsy with response.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study of osimertinib and necitumumab followed by
      a phase II study.

      Patients receive necitumumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and trastuzumab IV over 30-90
      minutes on days 1 and 15. Patients also receive osimertinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on
      days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 8 weeks
      through week 24, then every 12 weeks up to 1 year.
