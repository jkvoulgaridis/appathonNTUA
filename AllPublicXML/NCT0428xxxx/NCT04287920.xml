        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Aged 21 or over

          -  Diagnosis of alcohol-related liver disease and AUD.

               -  The diagnosis of alcohol-related liver disease will be determined by a
                  hepatologist based on history of regular and excessive alcohol consumption in the
                  absence of other causes of liver cirrhosis or acute hepatitis, compatible
                  clinical, imaging and laboratory findings and typical histology on liver biopsy,
                  if performed. Underlying liver disease may include alcoholic hepatitis, advanced
                  (F3-F4) fibrosis, and/or portal hypertension.

               -  The diagnosis of AUD will be determined by a hepatologist and/or addiction
                  psychiatrist based on history obtained that is consistent with DSM-5 diagnostic
                  criteria for AUD (all categories of mild, moderate and severe considered
                  eligible) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013; questions from NIH, 2016).

          -  Abstinent from alcohol for at least 2 weeks (but not more than 6 months) prior to
             initiating acamprosate treatment.

          -  At study enrollment, initial MELD-Na score must be less than 20 for the five
             individuals enrolling in the first phase of the pilot safety assessment. The second
             phase of the pilot safety assessment will include individuals with a MELD-Na of 20 or
             more at enrollment.

          -  Have capacity to provide consent themselves

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Individuals with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 30 ml/min

          -  Congestive heart failure (NYHA class II or higher)

          -  Hypotension, requiring the use of vasoconstrictors (i.e. midodrine)

          -  Pregnancy, lactation or refusal to use a reliable method of birth control if a
             sexually active female of childbearing potential. Although no human trial data is
             available, animal studies suggest possible teratogenic effects of acamprosate (Merck,
             2005).
