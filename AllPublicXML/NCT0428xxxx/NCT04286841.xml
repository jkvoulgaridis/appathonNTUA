  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several published clinical trials have shown the superiority of immunotherapy in neoadjuvant
      setting. Here we conducted this real world study to see whether neoadjuvant immunotherapy
      would bring MPR and survival benefits in NSCLC, for example, single agent immunotherapy or
      immunotherapy combination with chemotherapy. Furthermore biomarker analysis would be also
      performed to achieve personalized neoadjuvant immunotherapy.
