      This study aimed to assess the effects of dydrogesterone on sexual function in women with
      endometriosis using Female Function Sexual Index (FSFI).

    <textblock>
      Sexual dysfunction is an important outcome for patients with endometriosis. In this study, we
      compare the fsfi (female sexual function index) questions and the scores before and after
      dydrogesterone treatment in patients with endometriosis. We aim to measure the effect of
      dydrogesterone in patients with endometriosis.

    <description>79 women, aged between 18 and 45 years, who were examined at our tertiary gynecology outpatient clinic between April 2019 and March 2020, with surgically diagnosed endometriosis, were included in this study. They received a treatment with 5 mg dydrogesterone administered orally twice daily for 21 days; from the 5th to 25th day of each menstrual cycle, for a total of 6 months. They were evaluated pre- and posttreatment in terms of their age, parity, and body mass index (BMI). Female Function Sexual Index (FSFI) and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores were recorded pre- and posttreatment</description>
