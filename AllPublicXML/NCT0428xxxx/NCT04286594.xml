    <textblock>
      This open-label to double-blind study evaluates the impact of cannabidiol (CBD) on anxiety in
      adults. Participants will use a custom-formulated sublingual (under-the-tongue) solution of
      whole plant, hemp-derived CBD twice daily for six weeks in addition to their normal treatment
      regimen. Participants' clinical state will be assessed weekly during the treatment period.
      Quality of life, sleep, general health, and cognitive function will also be assessed.

      This investigation will be the first of its kind to conduct a clinical trial of an industrial
      hemp-derived product in individuals with anxiety. Despite the recent interest in medical
      cannabis and cannabinoid-based products, the availability of hemp-derived products in all 50
      states, and anecdotal evidence suggesting that hemp-derived products may have a profound
      anxiolytic effect, no studies have conducted a clinical trial of a hemp-derived product in
      individuals who suffer from anxiety.

      This investigation is composed of two phases. Phase 1 is comprised of a six-week open-label
      clinical trial of the custom formulated hemp-derived high-CBD solution in individuals with
      anxiety. Participants will be pre-screened by phone in order to evaluate their eligibility
      for the study. If approved, participants will come to the hospital for a baseline/screening
      visit, and will complete a structured clinical interview, clinical and quality of life
      questionnaires, and cognitive assessments. Enrolled participants will be given study product
      to use for the duration of the study; participants will be instructed to self-administer the
      solution under the tongue twice daily for six weeks. Throughout the treatment period,
      participants will complete short in-person or phone visits on a weekly basis, where they will
      complete questionnaires about their mood and quality of life. Participants will also return
      to the hospital for a final visit after six weeks of treatment to complete additional
      questionnaires and cognitive assessments.

      Phase 2 of the study is a double-blind clinical trial of this solution in patients with
      anxiety. This double-blind trial will begin after the open-label trial has been completed. In
      the same manner as the open-label trial, participants will be pre-screened by phone, and
      approved participants will come to the hospital for a baseline/screening visit to complete a
      structured clinical interview, questionnaires, and cognitive assessments. Eligible
      participants will also have the option to complete an hour-long MRI scan at the baseline and
      final visits. Enrolled participants will receive either CBD solution or placebo solution to
      self-administer throughout the six week treatment period, as described above. Participants
      will complete in-person visits and phone check-ins during the treatment period to complete
      questionnaires about their mood and quality of life. Participants in this phase of the study
      will also return for a final visit after six weeks of treatment to complete additional
      questionnaires, cognitive assessments, and an optional MRI scan.
