  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PROADAPT is a standardized geriatric intervention that is currently being co-constructed
      during an exploratory phase on a multi-professional and multi-disciplinary basis after a
      systematic analysis of published data (Figure).

      It consists in: 1) before surgery: a prehabilitation of the patients including a nutritional,
      physical and educational preparation; 2) during the hospitalization for surgery: an
      optimisation of their treatments through a pharmaceutical conciliation, educational
      interventions, standardization of surgical procedures and enhanced rehabilitation after
      surgery; 3) bridging and post-discharge interventions for hospital-to-home transition.

      This intervention is based on a logic change model, constructed with literature data and
      validated by an expert group through a DELPHI method : the rehabilitation model.

      This intervention was designed to be implemented pragmatically in the centers according local
      habits and is currently being evaluated in several distinct hospital contexts under the name
      of &quot;PROADAPT pilot study&quot; in different tumor contexts thanks to a grant from the Regional
      Health Agency of Rhône-Alpes Auvergne region.

      PROADAPT intervention is planned to be evaluated in 4 tumor models inducing complex
      medico-surgical procedures considered at high risk of geriatric deconditioning. They have the
      same primary objectives in order to be evaluated into a meta-analysis. Results will be used
      to test the validity of the rehabilitation model. Therefore, it is a study reaching the goal
      of the population health intervention research.

      The purpose of the PROADAPT-ovary/EWOC-2 study is to evaluate the impact of PROADAPT on
      patient's post-surgical outcomes in patients ≥ 70 years old with an advanced ovarian cancer
      (AOC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the conjunction of increased life expectancy and the increasing incidence of cancer with
      aging, older patient represent an increasing proportion of cancer patients. Increasing age is
      also associated with increased risk of co-morbidities as well as a decline of functional
      reserve of multiple organ systems, eventually leading in the context of the disease-and/or
      the treatment-related stress to functional deconditioning or organ failure.

      Surgery or complex medico-surgical procedures can be considered as one proof-of principle of
      such risks, since major cancer surgery the older population is at higher risk of
      morbi-mortality and unplanned hospitalization for geriatric events1.

      In order to reduce complications after surgery, prehabilitation has often been considered,
      and 71% of the surgeons would accept a 4 weeks delay before surgery to improve patients'
      outcomes if shown to be beneficial2. However, the actual level of evidence depends on the
      interventions: high for pre-operative nutrition3, but low for physical exercise, due to
      heterogeneous programs with often bad adherence4. In addition, geriatric validated
      interventions, in order to prevent iatrogenic event, may be added in a multi-interventional
      model of intervention.

    <description>Clavien Dindo classification consists of 7 grades (I, II, IIIa, IIIb, IVa, IVb and V). The introduction of the subclasses a and b allows a contraction of the classification into 5 grades (I, II, III, IV and V) depending on the size of the population observed or the of the focus of a study.
Complications that have the potential for long-lasting disability after patient's discharge (e.g.: paralysis of a voice cord after thyroid surgery) are highlighted in the present classification by a suffix (&quot;d&quot; for disability). This suffix indicates that a follow-up is required to comprehensively evaluate the outcome and related long-term quality of life.</description>
