  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of anti-interleukin (IL)-6 therapy, including tocilizumab, in rheumatoid arthritis or
      giant cell arteritis, led to the improvement or even control of disease in some patients for
      whom no further therapeutic options were available. Nevertheless, the evaluation of the
      efficacy of these treatments are negatively impacted by the lack of reliable biomarkers.
      Indeed, usual inflammatory biomarkers used during the follow-up of these patients to detect
      persistent disease activity or intercurrent infection, such as C-reactive protein, fibrinogen
      and procalcitonin, are dependant on IL-6. Thse usual biomarkers cannot therefore be reliably
      used during anti-IL-6 therapy. Some other experimental biomarkers are totally or partially
      independent of IL-6, or even of inflammasome, and thus are credible candidates for the
      follow-up of patients treated with anti-IL-6 therapy.

      Here investigators propose a controlled, prospective, monocentric, observational study
      evaluating several biomarkers, usual and experimental, in patients suffering from rheumatoid
      arthritis treated with anti-IL-6 therapy.

      This study will include 25 patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis requiring an
      anti-IL-6 therapy and 25 healthy controls.

      In patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, usual and experimental biomarkers will be
      assessed at D0, D15, W24 and W52 from the introduction of anti-IL-6 therapy, or during an
      intercurrent infection.

      Investigators thus hypothesized that experimental biomarker levels will still be increased at
      D15, contrary to usual biomarkers dependant on IL-6 which will be normal whereas rheumatoid
      arthritis is still active based on usual radiological and clinical criteria, and that all
      biomarkers will be normal a W24.
