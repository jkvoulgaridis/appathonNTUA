      This is a single arm, open-label, single-center study. This study is indicated for relapsed
      or refractory CD19+ B-line hematological malignancy involved in CNS. 20 patients were
      enrolled. Primary objective is to explore the safety. The secondary objective is to explore
      the efficacy.

      This is a single arm, open-label, single-center study. This study is indicated for relapsed
      or refractory CD19+ B-line hematological malignancy involved in CNS. All together 20 patients
      were enrolled. Primary objective is to explore the safety including the complication of
      cytokine release syndrome, CRES, pancytopenia and infection. The secondary objective is to
      explore the efficacy. We will also detect CAR-T cell expansion dynamics in blood and cerebral
      fluid and compare the difference.
