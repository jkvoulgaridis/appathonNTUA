    <textblock>
      This prospective randomized controlled trial was planned to be conducted among total
      laparoscopic hysterectomies performed at Zeynep Kamil Maternity and Children's Diseases
      Training and Research Hospital during one year period. The effect of drain insertion during
      the surgery will be assessed by this clinical trial. Patients will be assigned into two
      groups as cases and controls. Patients who will a drain inserted will be considered as case
      group and patients without a drain will be considered as control group. Patients will be
      evaluated according to their post operative VAS scores, hematocrit levels, their drainage
      volume and manifestation of an infection after the surgery.

      This prospective randomized controlled trial was planned to be conducted from February 2020
      to February 2021 and included total laparoscopic hysterectomies performed at Zeynep Kamil
      Maternity and Children's Diseases Training and Research Hospital during the study period.

      Surgeries on patients with existing comorbidity, with underlying malignant conditions,
      patients diagnosed deeply infiltrative endometriosis during surgery and patients who undergo
      multiple surgeries will be excluded from the study.

      Clinical and descriptive data will be collected from both paper and electronic records,
      including the pain of the patient, the need for analgesia at the 6th-12th and 24th hour
      during the post-operative period. Visual analog scale (VAS) will be used to track the pain
      progression of the patients. Intraabdominal bleeding will be determined by measuring the
      hematocrit levels and drainage volume at postoperative day 1. Patients will also be assessed
      according to manifesting an infection in both the short term and long term.

      Patients who will a drain inserted will be considered as case group and patients without a
      drain will be considered as control group. Data will be analyzed using the Statistical
      Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). A Chi-squared test will be used to evaluate the
      significance of the associations between variables. Continuous variables will be displayed as
      means and standard deviations. A P value of â‰¤0.050 will be considered as significant.

      This study obtained ethical approval from the Medical Research &amp; Ethics Committee of Zeynep
      Kamil Maternity and Children's Diseases Training and Research Hospital.
