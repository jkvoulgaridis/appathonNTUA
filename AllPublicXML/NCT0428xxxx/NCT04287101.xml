    <textblock>
      Background and purpose: Hip fracture, a common injury occurred in people aged over 50, may
      result in disability, poor quality of life, and higher care stress for their families. Aging
      population and growing number of hip fractures have increased medical expenses, so developed
      countries implemented post-acute care (PAC) to reduce acute hospitalization, and to improve
      the quality of care. PAC services can be delivered by hospital/facility-based and home-based
      services. Previous studies showed that both services could significantly improve patients'
      activities of daily living and quality of life, and reduce readmissions, long-term care and
      costs. Taiwan has implemented PAC plan for hip fractures since 2017, but relevant evidences
      are limited. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the efficacy and
      cost-effectiveness of PAC for patients with hip fractures.

      Methods: This is a prospective cohort study which will recruit patients aged over 50 with hip
      fractures receiving surgical treatment in the Taipei City Hospital. They will be provided
      home-based PAC, hospital-based PAC, or no formal PAC based on the medical judgment and
      patients/families' willingness. The period of PAC will be two to three weeks after the acute
      hospitalization. Assessments include physical function (30 seconds sit to stand, Barthel
      index, and Harris Hip Score), numerical pain rating scale, EuroQol instrument (EQ-5D),
      Caregiver Strain Index, and using of medical resources. The assessments will be on the day
      before discharge from acute hospitalization, and on the discharge day from post-acute care.
      The follow-up assessment will be at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after operation. The
      cost-effectiveness ratio will be defined as the New Taiwan dollars paid for 1-unit
      improvement of functional performance and quality of life.

    <time_frame>within 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Ask participants to cross their arms at the chest, and to perform sit to stand as more as possible within 30 seconds. Measure the repetitions the participants do. Higher repetition indicates more strength of lower extremities.</description>

    <measure>Activities of daily living Using the Barthel Index (BI)</measure>
    <time_frame>within 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Using the Barthel Index (BI) to measure participants' activities of daily living. The self-care domain is self-report by the patient or their families. The mobility domain is observed by the assessor. The greater score indicates more independence.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional performance of hip Using the Harris hip score (HHS)</measure>
    <time_frame>within 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Using the Harris hip score (HHS) to measure participants' functional performance of hip. The pain domain is self-report by the patient. The function, deformity, and range of motion domain are observed by the assessor. The greater score indicates the better functional performance of hip.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain intensity Using the numerical pain rating scale (NPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>within 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Using the numerical pain rating scale (NPRS) to measure participants' pain intensity. Ask participants to report their pain intensity with the 11-point scale (from 0 no pain to 10 worst possible pain).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of lives Using the EuroQol instrument (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>within 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Part 1: Ask participants to measure their mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression with the 3-point scale. The greater score indicates poor quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Quality of lives Using the EuroQol instrument (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>within 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Part 2: Ask participants to measure their quality of life with a 20-cm visual analog scale. The greater score indicates a better quality of life.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver strain Using the caregiver strain index (CSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>within 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Using the caregiver strain index (CSI) to measure the strain of caregiver. Ask them to fill a 13-item questionnaire. Greater value indicates a higher strain.</description>
