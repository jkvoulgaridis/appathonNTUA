  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study team is currently recruiting volunteers who are interested in participating in a
      brain-spinal cord-muscle response training study that aims to better understand the changes
      that take place in the nervous system as a result of this type of training. After spinal cord
      injury, brain-to-muscle connections are often interrupted. Because these connections are
      important in movement control, when they are not working well, movements may be disturbed.
      Researchers have found that people can learn to strengthen these connections through
      training. Strengthening these connections may be able to improve movement control and
      recovery after injuries.

      Research participants will be asked to stand, sit, and walk during the study sessions.
      Electrodes are placed on the skin over leg muscles for monitoring muscle activity. For
      examining brain-to-muscle connections, the study team will use transcranial magnetic
      stimulation. The stimulation is applied over the head and will indirectly stimulate brain
      cells with little or no discomfort.

      Participation in this study requires approximately three sessions per week for four months,
      followed by two to three sessions over another three months. Each session lasts approximately
      1 hour.
