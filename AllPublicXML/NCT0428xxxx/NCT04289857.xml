  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of neurodynamics is to restore homeostasis of peripheral nerves. In the current
      context there is varied evidence that links neurodynamics with clinical pain treatments or
      different pathologies, but little evidence regarding changes in the functionality of
      athletes, which could be related to improvements in performance.

      The main objective of the study is to determine if the neurodynamic technique is effective in
      increasing the range of hip mobility and in increasing the jump with counter movement.

      Randomized, simple blind clinical study. 15 trampoline jumping gymnasts will be randomized to
      the two study groups: experimental (active sciatic neurodynamics techniques) and control
      (without intervention). The intervention will last 4 weeks, with 3 weekly sessions of
      approximately 5 minutes each. The study variables will be the range of hip flexion movement
      (goniometry) and the countermove jump (My Jump® application). A descriptive statistical
      analysis will be performed calculating the main statistical characteristics. The sample
      distribution will be calculated using a Shapiro-Wills analysis. The changes after each
      evaluation will be analyzed with the t-student test and with an ANOVA of repeated measures
      the intra and intersubject effect will be observed. The effect size will be calculated using
      Cohen's formula.

      It is intended to observe improvement in the range of hip flexion movement and in the jump
      with countermovement.

    <description>Using a universal goniometer. The subject will be placed supine on a stretcher, identifying the lateral condyle of the femur with a marker, as well as the head of the fibula and the fibular malleolus. The goniometer axis will be placed on the projection of the greater trochanter of the femur. One of the arms of the goniometer arms will be placed parallel to the table (checked with a level). The athlete will be asked for active hip flexion by keeping the knee and ankle in the extended position, being careful not to bend the knee, or swing the pelvis backwards and without turning the hip to external rotation. The other arm of the goniometer will be placed in the direction of the line between the head of the fibula and the fibular malleolus. The unit of measure is the degree, a numerical value whose normal range is 0º-120º</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline jump height with counter movement after treatment and at month</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening visit, within the first seven days after treatment and after one month follow-up visit</time_frame>
    <description>It will be done with the My Jump application. The athlete will be placed in standing position, with the feet separated at shoulder height and will be asked to jump as high as possible with a rapid movement in countermovement. The hands will remain on the hips during the execution of the jump. The depth of the counter movement will be self-selected and gymnasts will be asked to land near the initial jump zone. They will be instructed verbally to jump as high as possible without specifying the angle of flexion of the knee during the countermovement phase. With the My Jump application, the athlete will be recorded performing the jump with counter movement and the application will determine the height of the jump. The unit of measure is centimeters, where the greater the distance, the greater the height.</description>

    <description>Starting from a sitting position on a stretcher, with dorsolumbar flexion, it is required to maintain that posture throughout the exercise. Sliding with the straight leg sitting consists of performing alternate movements. First, knee extension and dorsal ankle flexion will be performed, increasing neural tension, combined with cervical extension (to decrease neural tension) in the first instance. Subsequently, knee flexion and plantar ankle flexion (decreasing neural tension) combined with cervical flexion (increasing neural tension) will be performed. The dosage of the technique will be: two seconds for each movement, with 10 repetitions of each one. All sessions will be led by one of the group's researchers.</description>
