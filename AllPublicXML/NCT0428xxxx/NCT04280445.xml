      Title: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for older adults experiencing psychological
      distress: A hermeneutic single case efficacy design (HSCED) series.

      Anxiety and depression in older age is associated with increased level of disability and
      lower quality of life (OAs). Unfortunately, pharmacological treatments are disproportionality
      relied upon to manage the mental health of OAs. Despite cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT)
      being the recommended psychotherapy, there is evidence that CBT is less effective for OAs
      than younger populations.

      An alternative treatment, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), has been shown to be
      effective in reducing distress for OAs experiencing physical health difficulties. Several
      case studies have also indicated that ACT can be effective for OAs with psychological
      difficulties. ACT aims to change how a person interacts with their thoughts/feelings; to
      reduce avoidance; and to promote value-focused living.

      The study aims to use an adjudicated HSCED to answer the following questions:

      i) Is ACT an effective intervention for older adult clients experiencing psychological
      distress.

      ii) Do meaningful changes occur for client-participants over the course of ACT intervention?

      iii) What specific factors (ACT-specific, non-specific, extra-therapeutic) contribute to
      observed changes?

      iv) Are observed changes broadly attributable to the ACT intervention?

      v) What adaptations may facilitate change when using ACT with older adult clients.

      For the study, up to four participants will be recruited from an OA community mental health
      team, each receiving up to 12 individual sessions of ACT. Participants will be required to
      complete a number of questionnaires throughout the study, including before/after sessions.
      Post-treatment, there will be a semi-structured 1:1 interview to explore any changes
      participants experienced, before a six-week follow-up is employed to check stability of
      change.

    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate whether Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is an
      effective psychotherapeutic intervention for older adults experiencing psychological
      distress; what processes contribute towards psychological change; and what adaptations may be
      required to optimise ACT for older adults. There is currently an over-reliance on
      pharmacological treatments to manage older adult mental health (Andreescu &amp; Reynolds, 2011),
      and a lack of inclusion of older adult in efficacy studies of psychological treatments (Gatz,
      2006). Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is the most evidence-based psychological treatment
      for mental health conditions. It emphasises the link between thoughts and feelings, and uses
      cognitive restructuring to facilitate improvement in psychological symptoms. However, of the
      studies that have included older adults, there is evidence that CBT has a lower effect size
      in older adults than with working age adults (Kishita &amp; Laidlaw, 2017). There are a number of
      possible reasons for this, including a lack of age specific adaptations, the over focus on
      diagnosis specific treatment protocols in CBT, and the increasing physical and psychological
      co-morbidity associated ageing.

      ACT is a trans-diagnostic approach which aims to promote better living by supporting clients
      through six key processes (e.g. mindfulness, values). ACT does not aim to reduce distress,
      rather its goal is to promote better living or a better quality of life despite distress
      (Hayes, Strosahl &amp; Wilson, 1999). ACT has been shown to have equal or superior efficacy to
      CBT with a number of psychological and physical health conditions (A-Tjak et al., 2015; Ruiz,
      2012). We propose that ACT would be especially suitable for older adult clients due to the
      high rate of co-morbidity older adults experience and the reduced ability to change aspects
      of these.

      However, there is a lack of understanding about the processes by which ACT works (Ã–st, 2014).
      Randomised controlled trails (RCTs) are the standard research methodology to investigate
      psychotherapy efficacy. Due to the stringent criteria required for RCT analyses, there is a
      limit to how transferrable the findings of an RCT can be to clinical populations (i.e.
      heterogenous groups). As such, a hermeneutic single case efficacy design (HSCED) is an ideal
      methodology to employ to identify what contributes towards change for each client. HSCED
      benefits from high ecological validity, whilst actively focusing on non-specific factors
      (components common to all psychotherapies, e.g., therapeutic alliance) and extra-therapeutic
      factors (components that are not related to the therapy, usually participant factors) to
      delineate change processes.

      The research proposal has been developed as part of a Doctoral Thesis in Clinical Psychology.
      This involved various research presentations panels and submission of an initial research
      protocol. These are designed to guide the decision-making process and gain feedback from the
      course research team. As part of the doctoral program, each trainee is allocated a Primary
      and Secondary Research Supervisor (both Clinical Psychologists), who aided in shaping the
      practicalities of this research proposal. Each project also recruits a Field Supervisor who
      supports with expertise in the project area. Participants will be recruited from the service
      the Field Supervisor is employed at, thereby creating a direct level of clinical supervision
      that is paramount to psychotherapy.

      Participants will be informed about the study through a member of their healthcare team. The
      service will ensure potential participants have the capacity to consent to treatment and will
      provide them with an overview of the study. Potential participants will be made aware of
      informed consent; that they do not have to take part and that declining to take part will in
      no way affect their treatment from the service. If a participant declines to take part at
      this stage, they will be offered treatment as usual from the service. If they consent to take
      part, the researcher will contact them the following week to answer any additional questions.
      This will allow them sufficient time to consider whether they would like to take part or not.

      This research aims to use a sample that is representative of older adults presenting with
      psychological distress. See Inclusion/Exclusion sections for further explanation of these
      criteria.

      This study aims to reflect usual clinical practice where possible; therefore, the burden to
      participants will be of a similar level to treatment as usual. That is, they will be expected
      to attend the older adults service for regular one-to-one psychotherapy and to discuss their
      mental health difficulties, contributing factors and what is maintaining their difficulties.
      Thus, as with any psychological therapy, there is a potential risk that talking about
      distressing experiences will cause an increase in frequency or intensity of pre-existing
      mental health conditions. These risks will be monitored through the study by the Trainee
      Clinical Psychologist (who is both researcher and therapist) through discussion with the
      participant, use of outcome measures and importantly by utilising weekly clinical supervision
      with the Clinical Psychologist at the service. This allows a space for any concerns to be
      raised and for the service to have clinical oversight of the participants.

      The aspects of the study which are additional to usual practice are as follows: participants
      will be required to complete more questionnaires; and participants will be required to come
      in for an interview after the block of therapy has ended. Every effort has been made to
      reduce the burden these place upon participants. For instance, shorter questionnaires have
      been used where possible. Participants will also be asked about any adaptations required to
      complete questionnaires (e.g. larger font, someone completing questionnaires with them).
      Participants will be reimbursed for the aspects of the study which are additional to usual
      practice.

      There are several potential benefits to participants taking part in this research, as
      suggested by the ACT literature. These include decreased psychological distress, increased
      psychological flexibility and improved quality of life.

      To ensure confidentiality, Participant Study Numbers (PSN) will be assigned to each
      participant to correspond with treatment data. PSNs will be listed in the Trial Recruitment
      Log along with participant's name, date of birth and NHS number. All other documents related
      to the participant will use the PSN only. All researchers will endeavour to protect the
      rights of the participants to privacy and will adhere to the Data Protection Act, 2018. Only
      the minimum required information for the purposes of the study will be collected. Participant
      information will be held securely, in a locked room, or locked cupboard or cabinet. Access to
      the information will be limited to the study staff and investigators. Computer held data
      including the study database will be held securely and password protected. All data will be
      stored on a secure dedicated web server. Access will be restricted by user identifiers and
      passwords (encrypted using a one-way encryption method). Information about the study in the
      participant's medical records / hospital notes will be treated confidentially in the same way
      as all other confidential medical information.

      As the main researcher is also the therapist, potential conflict of interests will be managed
      by: using weekly clinical supervision; fortnightly ACT supervision; a 20% random sampling of
      the audio recorded sessions to ensure adherence to ACT techniques; and using an independent
      researcher to carry out the Change Interview. Another benefit of using a HSCED series, is
      that an independent panel adjudicates on the final outcome as to where change was attributed
      for each client, reducing the researcher-therapist bias.

    <intervention_model_description>The study will employ an adjudicated Hermeneutic Single Case Efficacy Design (HSCED) series with three participants. Following Elliott's (2002; Elliott et al., 2009) approach, a crucial aspect of HSCED research is the formation of rich case records. Developed for each client, these consist of data from various time points in the study, and include demographic, quantitative (outcome measures, treatment fidelity measures etc.) and qualitative sources (Change Interview, therapy feedback, therapy process notes and recordings). The rich case records are then cross-referenced and synthesised into an affirmative and sceptic brief. These briefs are then presented to an expert panel to be adjudicated on the process of change. The resulting decisions will then allow for a between-participant analysis of what components contributed towards change and why.</intervention_model_description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be at least 65 years of age.

          -  Score at least 8 on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; ZIgmond &amp; Snaith,
             1983) on either the anxiety or depression sub-scale. The HADS is an outcome measure
             already used by the MHSOP.

          -  Be referred to the MHSOP for psychological support.

          -  Have capacity to give informed consent.

          -  Be willing to engage in one-to-one psychotherapy.

          -  Be able to travel to the service (either independently or with support).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A score lower than 22-24 on the MoCA. This is to screen for a level of cognitive
             deficit, which cannot be accommodated for in the current study, due to the adaptations
             which will be required (e.g. review sessions, carer enrolment to support memory
             consolidation). Cut-off limit is dependent on the individual's age and education
             history. The MoCA is administered by the MHSOP as standard practice.

          -  Not rated higher than Cluster 8 (Mental Health Clustering Booklet 2013/14, Department
             of Health), a categorisation based on the Health of the Nation Outcome Scale (HoNOS;
             Wing et al., 1998). Clusters higher than 8 are associated with clients presenting with
             symptoms of psychosis and it is felt that this level of mental health problem would
             cause serious heterogeneity between client cases. As standard practice, the MHSOP at
             Ling Bar Hospital will have rated the client prior to consideration for the study.

          -  Inability to understand English to a level required to participate fully in the
             intervention. This is due to a lack of ability to benefit from the intervention
             without an interpreter, and the impact an interpreter would have on the
             non-therapeutic processes (e.g. alliance) being measured in this study.

          -  Not currently undertaking any other psychological therapy, talking therapy or
             counselling. This is due to the potential impact the other therapy could have on
             change and the inability to fully account for this.
