  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are no reliable blood-based tests currently available for early-stage lung cancer
      diagnosis. We try to establish a highly accurate method for detecting early-stage lung cancer
      by combining machine learning with untargeted and targeted metabolomics .
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All plasma lipids were first detected by untargeted metabolomics methods and 9 feature lipids
      of early-stage lung cancer were selected by support vector machine algorithm. Then, a
      targeted metabolomics method was developed to detect the 9 lipids quantitatively based on
      multiple reaction monitoring mode. Finally, a detection model was established based on the 9
      lipids.

    <description>A detection model based on 9 lipids were developed, including 3 lysophosphatidylcholines, 5 phosphatidylcholines, and a triglyceride. The 9 lipids were detected by targeted metabolomics by mass spectrometry.</description>

    <description>Patients who underwent surgery at the Department of Thoracic Surgery of Peaking University People's Hospital, Jiangsu Cancer Hospital, and Beijing Haidian Hospital were enrolled with the following criteria: 1) pathologically confirmed lung cancer; 2) no history of other malignancies; 3) no anti-cancer treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, etc.) before surgery. Plasma samples were collected before surgery and plasma lipids were detected by mass spectrometry. Pathological diagnosis and clinical characteristics of enrolled participants were retrieved.</description>

      For enrolled participants, 4 ml of peripheral blood were collected in tubes containing EDTA
      and all participants had fasted at least 8 hr before blood collection. Whole blood was
      centrifuged at 1600 g for 10 min followed by centrifugation at 16000 g for 10 min. Plasma
      aliquots were transferred into cryovials and stored at -80 Â°C.
