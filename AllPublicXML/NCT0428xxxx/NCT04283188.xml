  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this project is to evaluate the longer-term effects of implementing
      DBT for adolescents with BD in a subspecialty clinic. In collaboration with the University of
      Pittsburgh and continuing from the parent study (042-2018), this study will measure the
      longer-term effects of DBT in additional the the longer-term effects of DBT training on study
      therapist knowledge and performance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an extension study related to an ongoing implementation study of dialectical behavior
      therapy (DBT) for adolescents with bipolar disorder, in collaboration with investigators at
      the University of Pittsburgh. During the conduct of that initial study (the DITO study; REB
      PIN 042-2018), compelling questions have been raised by the investigators, study therapists,
      and participants/patients about what will happen following participation in the initial
      study: Which DBT outcomes are sustained over time? Will patients request and/or require
      additional booster sessions? Will study therapists remain adherent to the treatment model?
      There is sparse knowledge regarding what happens after a course of DBT is completed, and this
      study seeks to advance our understanding of what happens in the year after DBT by addressing
      these questions. This study provides a unique opportunity to examine the frequency, dose, and
      indications for ongoing DBT treatment for participants who have completed one year of DBT at
      the Centre for Youth Bipolar Disorder (CYBD). In the spirit of the original dissemination and
      implementation study, this study is focused on &quot;real-world&quot; issues routinely faced by study
      therapists and patients, and anticipated findings will inform future randomized controlled
      trials on this topic.

    <description>Tapes will be rated for adherence using the Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) Adherence Rating scale. The scale generates a Global Score of DBT adherence and subscale scores for the 12 DBT strategy domains. To examine sustained adherence, each therapist will submit 3 consecutive sessions for adherence coding. The rating scale is not available to the public and is utilized by the DBT-Linehan Board of Certification (copyright).

For those who elect to continue with DBT sessions, they will discuss frequency of sessions with their therapist, in addition to selecting type of sessions (individual and/or family skills). Participants who elect not to continue with DBT sessions at the time of enrollment will retain the option of being able to request additional sessions at any point during the 12-month study. Irrespective of participation in additional DBT sessions, all participants will be asked to complete follow-up interviews and questionnaires.</description>
