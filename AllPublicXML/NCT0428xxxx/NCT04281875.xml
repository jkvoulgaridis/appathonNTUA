  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study describes a single center, randomized, single-blinded clinical trial to assess the
      clinical benefits of the use of near infrared autofluorescence (NIRAF) detection with an
      FDA-cleared device 'Parathyroid Eye (PTeye)' for identifying parathyroid glands (PGs) during
      total thyroidectomy (TTx). It compares risk-benefits and outcomes in TTx patients where NIRAF
      detection with PTeye for parathyroid identification is either used or not used.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inadvertent damage or excision of a healthy parathyroid gland (PG) following a total
      thyroidectomy (TTx) could result in transient hypocalcemia (&lt; 6 months) in 5 - 35% of cases
      or permanent hypocalcemia (&gt; 6 months) in 7% of the patients (1, 2). In both of these
      circumstances, patients would require calcium and active vitamin D supplementation in
      addition to a potentially prolonged hospital stay and/or unplanned hospital readmission
      adding to unnecessary burden and healthcare costs. These complications could be minimized
      with label-free intraoperative PG identification using near infrared autofluorescence (NIRAF)
      detection with a fiber-probe based approach (3 - 5) as utilized in 'PTeye', which is medical
      device that was recently FDA-cleared (6). However, the true impact of this particular
      NIRAF-based approach on patient outcomes is yet to be determined

      The aim of this prospective single blinded randomized study is to compare 2 groups of
      patients: TTx patients operated using NIRAF detection technology with PTeye as adjunct tool
      (NIRAF+) vs. patients operated without the adjunct technology (NIRAF-). The main objective of
      this study is to assess the benefit of intraoperative use of NIRAF detection technology via
      PTeye during TTx procedures with regard to postoperative hypocalcemia, PG identification, PG
      auto-transplantation and inadvertent resection rates compared to standard of care.

    <intervention_model_description>NIRAF detection technology is used as an adjunctive tool for intraoperative parathyroid identification in patients who undergo total thyroidectomy (TTx) with or without lymph node dissection (LND) in the interventional group.
Generic Name of Device: Parathyroid Autofluorescence Detection Device (NIRAF detection technology).
The Parathyroid Autofluorescence Detection Device consists of a disposable fiber-optic probe that emits non-ionizing radiation from a NIR 785 nanometer (nm) laser source, and also transmits the resulting tissue NIRAF to a photo detector. The 785 nm laser source emits a maximum power of 20 Milliwatts (mW). The device has an FDA clearance for clinical use in general surgeries and dermatological use (Class 2 device).</intervention_model_description>

The 785 nm laser source emits a maximum power of 20 mW. The device is FDA cleared for clinical use in general surgeries and dermatological use (Class 2 device).
After surgeon identifies a potential parathyroid gland in the surgical field, the surgeon places the fiber-optic probe of PTeye on suspect tissue and presses the device foot-pedal to activate tissue NIRAF measurement. Auditory beep at high frequency with a Detection Ratio &gt; 1.2 is interpreted by device as the suspect tissue being positive for parathyroid.</description>
