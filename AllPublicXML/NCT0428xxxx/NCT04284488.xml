    <textblock>
      An ascending dose study in patients with solid tumors to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacodynamics and efficacy of APG-1387 in combination with toripalimab. A phase II study
      of 3 cohorts will be included.

    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in two phases. In phase Ib, the safety and efficacy of different
      dose levels of APG-1387 in combination with 240 mg toripalimab will be explored to determine
      the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of APG-1387 in combination therapy, both administered as
      a 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion. The following proposed doses of APG-1387 are to be
      evaluated: 20,30, or 12mg (in case no DLT occur in high dose levels, 12mg may be initiated
      for further exploration to determine RP2D comprehensively.) The Phase II portion, will
      compromise 3 cohorts of 29-31 patients.

      The 3 cohorts will include the following:

        -  Colorectal cancer

        -  Nasopharyngeal carcinoma

        -  Non-small cell lung cancer A Simon's 2-stage design will be used for each of the cohorts
           in colorectal cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer. A
           predefined analysis will be performed in the first stage, and failure to achieve the
           prespecified efficacy will halt enrollment to avoid futile treatment.
