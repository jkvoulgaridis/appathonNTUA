  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interscalene brachial plexus block can be used as an additive to general anaesthesia or as
      the primary anaesthetic for shoulder surgeries for pain management.

      The investigators compared the effect of perineural versus intravenous dexamethasone on the
      prolongation of the action of levobupivacaine in ultrasound guided interscalene block for
      shoulder and upper arm surgeries.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dexamethasone had been shown to prolong the duration of postoperative analgesia when given as
      an adjuvant for peripheral nerve blocks.

      The investigators compared the effect of perineural versus intravenous dexamethasone on the
      prolongation of the action of levobupivacaine in ultrasound guided interscalene block for
      shoulder and upper arm surgeries.

      The study hypothesized that adding perineural dexamethasone to levobupivacaine in ultrasound
      guided interscalene block may be more superior to adding intravenous dexamethasone to
      levobupivacaine and levobupivacaine alone in shoulder and upper arm surgeries as regard
      analgesic effect, duration of analgesia and hemodynamic stability.

    <measure>Onset of Sensory block</measure>
    <time_frame>For 30 min after injecting local anesthetic</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be closely observed until 30 minutes after the end of local anesthetic injection. Block success will be defined as loss of sensation to pinprick in the C4 and C5 sensory dermatome distribution measured 30 minutes after the end of local anesthetic injection. sensory block will be assessed by pin prick test using a 3point scale: • Grade 0 = Normal sensation.
Grade 1 = loss of sensation to pin prick (analgesia).
Grade 2 = loss of sensation to touch (anaesthesia). Onset time for sensory block will be defined as the time interval between the end of local anaesthesia administration and complete sensory block (score 2).</description>

    <description>Motor block will be determined according to the modified Bromage scale:
Grade 0 = Normal motor function with full flexion and extention of elbow.
Grade 1 = Decrease motor power.
Grade 2 = Complete motor block. Onset time of motor block will be defined as the time interval between end of local anaesthetic administration and complete motor block (grade 2).</description>
