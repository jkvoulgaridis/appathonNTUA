  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inadequate sleep is an independent risk factor for metabolic abnormalities (such as obesity,
      insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia). Women report sleep disruption during the menopause
      transition (perimenopause) and into the postmenopausal years. Sleep disruption is one of the
      primary reasons why midlife women seek medical care, with up to 60% reporting significant
      sleep disturbances (e.g., trouble falling asleep, early morning waking, and hot flashes/night
      sweats). Despite the majority of women experiencing sleep disruption, no study has
      investigated the molecular mechanisms linking sleep disruption and the changes in metabolism
      that coincide with menopause.

      The investigators will conduct a randomized, crossover trial investigating the effect of
      sleep restriction compared to habitual sleep on adipose tissue and skeletal muscle insulin
      sensitivity in vivo and ex vivo. The investigators will randomize up to 10 healthy
      postmenopausal women with overweight/obesity and ≥6.5 hours of self-reported habitual nightly
      sleep to 4 nights of each sleep condition (sleep restriction and habitual sleep). After the
      fourth night of each sleep condition, the investigators will administer a two-step
      hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and collect skeletal muscle and adipose tissue samples
      prior to insulin infusion.

      The overarching hypothesis is that sleep restriction will reduce skeletal muscle and adipose
      tissue insulin sensitivity compared to habitual sleep.
