  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific training of the elastic-explosive force of the muscles involved in vertical jump
      and active mobilizations is used to improve the quality of the jump. It is also intended to
      reduce the loss of centimeters, recovery times and fatigue produced during a series of
      vertical jumps.

      The objective of the study is to assess the effectiveness of active mobilizations together
      with specific training in lower limbs, in ankle mobility, the perception of effort and the
      height and resistance of vertical jumping in amateur basketball players.

      Randomized clinical study. 50 basketball players from 20 to 35 years will be randomized to
      the study groups: control group (resistance strength exercises, elastic-explosive force) and
      experimental group (resistance strength exercises, elastic-explosive force together with
      active mobilizations). The dependent variables will be: repeated jump (15 second Jump test,
      my Jump 2), maximum vertical jump (CMJ free arms, my Jump 2), subjective perception of effort
      (Borg scale) and ankle dorsiflexion (goniometer). The sample distribution will be calculated
      using a Kolmogorov-Smmirnof analysis. The changes after each evaluation will be analyzed with
      the t-student test and with an ANOVA of repeated measures the intra and intersubject effect
      will be observed. The effect size will be calculated using Cohen's formula.

      It is expected to observe an improvement in the resistance of vertical jumps, with a decrease
      in the loss of centimeters in the repetitions of jumps.

    <description>The My Jump 2 application will be used. With the video we can see the moment when the feet do not touch the ground and with this data the application automatically calculates the height in centimeters. From a squat position, the player will have to perform a vertical jump, landing in the same starting position.</description>

    <description>The 15 sec repeated jump test will assess the resistance of the explosive force. With the My Jump 2 application we will calculate the height in repeated jumps in 15 seconds. To do this, we will ask the athlete to, from a squat position, perform 15 repeated vertical jumps, returning to the starting position every time.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline subjective perception of effort after treatment and at month</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening visit, within the first seven days after treatment and after one month follow-up visit</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the modified Borg scale with a scoring range of 1 to 10 points (the higher the score, the greater the perception of effort). The concept of perceived effort is a subjective assessment that indicates the person's opinion regarding the intensity of the work performed. 1 indicates little fatigue, 10 is the maximum effort perceived by the athlete</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline dorsal ankle flexion after treatment and at month</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening visit, within the first seven days after treatment and after one month follow-up visit</time_frame>
    <description>This variable will be measured with the use of a goniometer. With the athlete standing, from a stride position, with the first finger placed 10 cm from the wall, we will ask him to do a knee flexion towards the wall, with the heel always resting on the floor. We will place the goniometer axis in the center of the outer malleolus. The fixed arm will be parallel to the ground, while the mobile arm will be aligning the fibula. The unit of measure is the degrees.</description>
