      This is a Non-Significant Risk (NSR) medical device, multi-center, open-label clinical study.
      Each study subject that qualifies at the baseline visit will receive an NDE L68 StableFit®
      punctal plug in the lower punctum in one of their eyes. All study plugs will remain in the
      study subject's lower punctum for a period of 28 + 4 days after insertion.

    <description>The primary study endpoint will be the comparison of the tear lake volume at baseline with the tear lake volume at each follow-up visit. The tear lake will be evaluated using a slit lamp micrometer, the micrometer will be oriented vertically and centered on the lower lid margin at the middle of the lower lid. The tear lake will be measured using the slit lamp micrometer from the lid margin to the superior border of the lower tear lake and measured to 0.1 mm.</description>

             condition

          2. A subject must be able to read, comprehend and be willing to give HIPAA authorization
             and informed consent

          3. A subject must be willing to have a punctal plug inserted in the lower punctum of one
             of their eyes

          4. A subject must be willing to comply with all study instructions, agree to make all
             office appointments, and complete the entire course of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A subject with a history of complications, adverse events, trauma or disease in the
             nasolacrimal area, whether or not it was due to punctal plug wear, including but not
             limited to dacryocystitis, inflammation or canaliculitis in the planned study eye

          2. A subject with a history of intolerance to punctal plugs
