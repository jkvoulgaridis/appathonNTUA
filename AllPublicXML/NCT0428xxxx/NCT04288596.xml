      The ACHDi Registry study will create a foundational database for adult congenital heart
      disease interventions. This Pan-Canadian Registry will collect clinical and patient-reported
      information that will enable the evaluation of care processes and outcomes in five most
      common ACHDi interventions by enabling prospective and retrospective registry-based studies
      to answer important clinical practice and policy-relevant questions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to establish a rigorously developed registry to enable an impactful
      research agenda in adults with congenital heart disease interventions (ACHDi). The clinical
      and patient-reported information captured in the Registry will allow researchers to evaluate
      care processes and outcomes in five most common ACHDi interventions including transcatheter
      closure of atrial septal defects, closure of patent foramen ovale, coarctation of aorta
      stenting, percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation, and complex catheterization.

      In 2019, we established the Canadian Research Network for ACHD Interventions (CRN-ACHDi), a
      national ACHD research network bringing together researchers, providers, patients, and
      policymakers from 4 provinces (Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec) to improve
      patient experiences and outcomes through i) a national registry with modern data platform;
      ii) a rigorously established national research priorities agenda; and iii) a strong
      collaborative and multidisciplinary research environment.

      The C-ACHDi Registry will provide opportunities for researchers to ask clinical practice and
      policy-relevant research questions that are supported by high quality data. In addition, it
      will provide an opportunity for patients to contribute data for meaningful and high quality
      clinical and translational research. The C-ACHDi Registry will provide a base for conducting
      registry-based studies (e.g., prospective experimental, prospective and retrospective
      observational) in the future as well as a foundation for benchmark and quality improvement
      activities.
