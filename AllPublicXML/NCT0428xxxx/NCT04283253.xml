  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will validate a predictive model that uses demographics, functional status,
      neurophysiology, neuroanatomy, and other potential biomarkers to predict the likelihood of a
      clinically significant change in impairment at the end of a robot assisted therapy
      intervention.The study will include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS), and an arm exercise program consisting of robot-assisted exercise combined
      with functional arm exercise called transition to task training (TTT).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After informed consent, a baseline neurological exam, medical records review, MRI of the
      brain, TMS, questionnaires, cognitive testing, robot evaluations, and arm function testing
      will occur. Baseline testing will occur in the first 4-6 weeks of participation including two
      separate sessions approximately 1 week a part to examine arm strength, range of motion, and
      ability to perform functional tasks, with one additional session if needed to verify
      stability between results. Additionally, one robot evaluation will be completed.

      The intervention phase consists of 12 weeks of robot and transition to task arm exercise
      training (TTT). Interventions will occur approximately 3 times per week for 12 weeks for a
      total of 36 visits. Additional time and visits will be allowed with visits occurring 4 times
      per week or up to 6 additional weeks (not to exceed 18 weeks) if scheduling conflicts arise.
      The intervention sessions will be one hour in duration.

      During the hour-long intervention, 45 minutes of robotic intervention will be followed by 15
      minutes of TTT. The training will be sequential with 12 sessions focused on the wrist,
      followed by 12 sessions on the shoulder-elbow and the final 12 sessions alternating between
      the wrist and elbow-shoulder.

      After the final training session, subjects will return after a 12 week retention period. At
      various time points during and after the intervention phase there will be additional arm
      function testing, robot evaluations, questionnaires, MRI and TMS sessions for re-assessment.

    <measure>A change in the Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Assessment score</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately following the 12-week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer is one of the primary outcome measures assessing change in arm use from baseline testing to mid-training after visits 12 and 24, and post-training after visit 36 and the 12 week retention period. It is a stroke-specific measure of impairment of the upper extremity that has been shown to be valid and reliable with high inter-rater and test-retest reliability. It provides a direct-observational assessment of volitional movement and motor impairment related to reflexes, sensation, and abnormal synergies. Each item on the FM is rated on a three-point ordinal scale (0 = cannot perform, 1 = performs partially, 2 = performs fully). The scale ranges from 0-66 with higher scores representing less motor impairment.</description>

    <time_frame>Immediately following the 12-week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>TMS stimulation of the motor cortex will be performed using MagStim 200 Magnetic Stimulators (MagStim Ltd., Wales, UK) to assess change in the motor evoked potential (MEP) of the arm muscles.</description>
