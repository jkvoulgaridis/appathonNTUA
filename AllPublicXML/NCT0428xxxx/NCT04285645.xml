  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Injuries to the lower limbs are the most common in rugby and within the lower limbs, the most
      common are those that affect the ligaments of the knee. That is why we will try to improve
      knee stability and quadriceps strength.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of performing a pre-workout exercise
      protocol to improve knee stability and quadriceps strength in rugby players.

      Randomized controlled study, simple blind and with follow-up. 30 semi-professional rugby
      players will be randomized to the two study groups: experimental (pre-training exercise
      protocol that will include continuous running, squats, and squats and monopodal jumps) and
      control (without intervention). The intervention will last 4 weeks, with 2 weekly sessions of
      15 minutes each. The study variables will be: knee stability (Y-Balance) and quadriceps
      strength (Single leg hop). The sample distribution will be calculated using the
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The changes after each evaluation will be analyzed with the
      t-student test and with an ANOVA of repeated measures, the intra and intersubject effect will
      be observed. The effect size will be calculated using Cohen's formula.

      It is expected to see improvement in knee stability and quadriceps strength in athletes who
      performed the exercise protocol, after the study period.

    <description>It will be done using the Y-Balance test. The barefoot sportswoman will be placed with the toes in the center of the Y marked on the floor with adhesive tape. Each of them will have six trials with each foot in each direction (anterior, posterolateral and posteromedial). Subsequently, they will have three attempts with each leg in each direction, taking the best mark of each leg in each direction. The athlete must return to the initial position without losing balance, because if she does not succeed, that attempt will be void. The distance to be measured includes from the central mark where we place the toes to the point where the patient supports the tip of the toes. The unit of measure of this measuring instrument is the centimeter. A higher score indicates greater knee stability.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline quadriceps strength after treatment and at month</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening visit, within the first seven days after treatment and after one month follow-up visit</time_frame>
    <description>It will be done by applying the Single leg hop test. With this test, the quadriceps strength will be measured. With the patient in monopodal and barefoot support, and with the toes placed on a mark made on the floor with adhesive tape, he will make a leap forward, maintaining the balance at least one second. Each player will perform 6 warm-up jumps with each leg. Subsequently you will have three attempts with each leg and the greatest distance achieved with each one will be taken. The distance will be measured from the initial mark, to where the subject's heel lands, with cm being the unit of measure for the test. A greater distance indicates a greater force of quadriceps.</description>

    <description>Each session will last 15 minutes, taking place 2 days a week, over a period of 4 weeks. Prior to training, the exercise protocol will be carried out. Prior to the start of the intervention, the exercises to be performed will be explained to the participants and it will be verified that they are capable of performing them correctly.</description>

    <description>The intervention through exercises will consist in the application of the protocol described by Waldén et al. The objective of the application of this exercise protocol is to produce an improvement in the stability of the knee and the strength of the quadriceps. Before carrying out the exercises, a continuous race will be carried out for 5 minutes, once this first step is finished we will proceed to the realization of the exercises that will be, squats with both legs placing the hands on the hips, feet placed at the width of the shoulders, lowering with a straight back and without raising the heels of the floor, 3 series of 15 repetitions, squats on one leg with the hands on the hips and leg not supported extended forward, 3 sets of 10 repetitions with each leg and jump forward with one leg with the hands on the hips and jump back to return to the starting position, 3 sets of 10 repetitions with each leg</description>
