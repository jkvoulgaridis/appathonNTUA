  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose the following hypothesis: discontinuation of levothyroxine (LT4)
      for veterans with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) will be feasible, acceptable, and safe and
      will not negatively affect their Quality of Life (QoL). The investigators aim to 1) evaluate
      the feasibility of LT4 discontinuation among veterans with SCH and determine the changes in
      QoL measures, treatment burden and adverse events, and 2) assess the acceptability of LT4
      discontinuation among veterans with SCH and LT4 prescribing clinicians.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Semi-structured
      interviews, from randomized participants and LT4 prescribers, will be completed at the end of
      the trial.

      Methodology The investigators will conduct a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial
      where eligible veterans diagnosed with SCH and on LT4 will be 1:1 randomized to either
      continue LT4 or change to placebo. The primary outcome is intervention feasibility
      (willingness to enter the trial, recruitment rate, and completion rate). Secondary outcomes
      are: 1) changes in QoL measures (Hypothyroid Symptom and Tiredness scores of the ThyPRO-39,
      EuroQoL 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire, and Treatment Burden Questionnaire) measured
      at baseline, 6-8 weeks and 6 months and 2) incidence of adverse events (overt hypothyroidism,
      hyperthyroidism, atrial fibrillation, fractures, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, acute
      coronary syndrome, heart failure, mortality).

      The investigators will assess the acceptability of LT4 discontinuation through
      semi-structured qualitative interviews with participants and LT4 prescribers at the
      completion of the clinical trial.
