      Prospective diagnostic study to determine the diagnostic accuracy of preoperative
      18F--fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in
      detecting local tumor extent, cervical lymph node metastases and distant metastases/secondary
      primary tumor.

    <measure>Diagnostic accuracy of FGD-PET/CT to detect the primary tumor</measure>
    <time_frame>2013-2018</time_frame>
    <description>Visual assessment of FDG-PET/CT will be performed according to current guidelines. The localization, expansion, and infiltration of osseous structures will be recorded. The outcome measure is the correct diagnosis (1 = correct; 0 = false) with regards to the histopathological analysis. The outcome measure will then be used to calculate the diagnostic accuracy of FDG-PET/CT to detect the primary tumor.</description>

    <measure>Diagnostic accuracy of FGD-PET/CT to detect lymph nodes metastases</measure>
    <time_frame>2013-2018</time_frame>
    <description>Visual assessment of FDG-PET/CT will be performed according to current guidelines. The presence and number of nodal metastasis will be recorded for each cervical lymph node level. The outcome measure is the correct diagnosis (1 = correct; 0 = false) with regards to the histopathological analysis. The analysis will be performed on a patient level (lymph node metastasis yes/no), on the nodal metastatic involvement of cervical sides and lymph node levels. The outcome measure will then be used to calculate the diagnostic accuracy of FDG-PET/CT to detect lymph node metastases.</description>

The outcome measure is the correct diagnosis (1 = correct; 0 = false) with regards to the histopathological analysis. The outcome measure will then be used to calculate the diagnostic accuracy of FDG-PET/CT to detect lymph node metastases.</description>
