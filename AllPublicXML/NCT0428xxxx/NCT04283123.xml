  <brief_summary>

      This study evaluates the feasibility, including acceptability and preliminary efficacy, of an
      automated bidet intervention to make it easier for caregivers to assist with toileting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Informal caregivers provide over 30 billion hours of care to older adults each year. They
      often assist with toileting tasks which are often identified as one of the most physically
      and emotionally demanding activities of daily living. Caregivers receive limited training and
      support which increases their risk for injury and burnout. One potential strategy to reduce
      or replace the physical support needed from a caregiver is the used of an automated bidet
      system. It remains unknown whether an automated bidet can be used successfully with older
      adults and their caregivers at home. The objective of this feasibility study was to assess
      the acceptability and preliminary efficacy of a toileting intervention using an automated
      bidet system and training by an occupational therapy practitioner (OT) to reduce the amount
      of physical assistance required from caregivers.

      The investigators will recruit 10 informal caregivers and randomize them to the treatment or
      waitlist control group. Caregivers in the treatment group will receive the automated bidet
      right away while those in the waitlist control group will not receive any treatment during
      that time. After 30 days, both groups will participate in a post-test assessment visit. The
      waitlist control group will then be offered the intervention and invited to participate in a
      final session after 30 days to complete assessments and a process evaluation (30 days post
      follow-up).

    <description>During the first intervention visit, a licensed contractor will install the bidets in participants' homes. The OT will then educate and train the caregiver and care recipient to successfully use the bidet, and make any modifications to the remote as needed. Throughout the intervention, the OT will use motivational enhancement strategies. The OT will make minor modifications to the remote as needed. A second intervention visit will occur 1-2 weeks post-installation to address any new difficulties. Check-in phone calls will be offered to the caregiver and care recipient if needed.</description>
