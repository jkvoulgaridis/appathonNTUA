    <measure>Change in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a patient-rated scale designed to screen for and assess depression. The PHQ-9 consists of questions on each of the 9 DSM-5® criteria for depression asking if they have bothered the patient over the last 2 weeks. Each question is rated on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). The 9 questions are summed to a total score ranging from 0 to 27 with higher scores reflecting greater severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Clinical Global Impression-severity of illness (CGI-S) score</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI was developed to provide global measures of the severity of a patient's clinical condition and improvement or worsening during clinical studies. The CGI consists of two clinician-rated subscales: severity of illness (CGI-S) and global improvement (CGI-I). The CGI-S provides the clinician's impression of the patient's current state of mental illness. The clinician uses his or her clinical experience of this patient population to rate the severity of the patient's current mental illness on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (normal - not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients).</description>

    <description>The CGI was developed to provide global measures of the severity of a patient's clinical condition and improvement or worsening during clinical studies. The CGI consists of two clinician-rated subscales: severity of illness (CGI-S) and global improvement (CGI-I). The CGI-I provides the clinician's impression of the patient's improvement (or worsening). The clinician assesses the patient's condition relative to a baseline on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse).</description>
