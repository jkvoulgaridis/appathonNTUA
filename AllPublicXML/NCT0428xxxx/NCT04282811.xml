      Observational study aimed at describing the characteristics and outcome of CLL patients who
      started treatment with venetoclax-based regimens according to the local label outside
      clinical trials in Italy in a period of time ranging from the start of the Venetoclax Named
      Patient Program (March 2016) until October 31st, 2021.

      A longitudinal survey will be carried out by collecting data of patients who received at
      least 1 dose of venetoclax. The study includes two different groups: a retrospective group
      (all patients who have received at least one dose of venetoclax before enrolment) and a
      prospective group (patients receiving treatment with venetoclax after enrolment). All
      patients in both groups will be observed for up to 48 months from the treatment start. In the
      prospective cohort only, QoL will be assessed at the time of study entry (i.e. baseline) and
      thereafter at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 24, 30, 36, 42 and 48 months of follow-up and at treatment
      discontinuation (due to any cause).
