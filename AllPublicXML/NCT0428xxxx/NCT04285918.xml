      The purpose of DEFENSE-ELDERLY is to identify the prevalence of AF and evaluate the clinical
      impact of AF in elderly ESUS patients and no other known sources of stroke besides a
      high-risk patent foramen ovale, and compare it with elderly ESUS patients without high-risk
      PFO (no PFO or non-high risk PFOs)

    <description>If there is no relevant AF detected for 6 months during intermittent follow-up or ICM, device closure of PFO is recommended for high-risk PFOs but is decided ultimately at the discretion of the attending physician. If there is any relevant AF identified from ICM or other modalities during follow-up, adequate secondary prevention with anticoagulants should be carried out. All this process and decision making should be a part of routine clinical practice.</description>
