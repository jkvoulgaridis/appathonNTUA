      This study aims to assess if an educational programme combining approaches of
      self-management, health promotion, and e-learning will improve self-efficacy and other key
      health and mental health outcomes for people with mild to moderate dementia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is currently estimated that 47 million people are living with dementia today and this
      number is expected to double in the next 20 years. Unfortunately, there has been limited
      advancement in medical treatments for dementia and new cost-effective approaches are needed.
      The utility of self-management has been proven to be of benefit in certain chronic diseases,
      however, very little work has been undertaken regarding self-management in people with
      dementia.The SHAPE self-management group therapy aims to significantly improve self-efficacy
      in people with mild to moderate dementia and to improve key health and mental health
      outcomes, carer stress and knowledge of dementia.SHAPE comprises a 10 week course delivered
      as group sessions for the participants with dementia. The sessions are designed to develop
      self-management skills and to provide information on the disease process and the development
      of healthy behaviours in a supportive learning environment to prevent problems that are
      common in the later stages of the disease. E-learning resources will be provided for carers
      (study supporters) which covers the similar and complimentary material discussed in the group
      sessions for the participant with dementia.

      This trial uses 2:1 randomisation and will assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of
      SHAPE. Participants will be randomised to participate in the SHAPE intervention or continue
      with usual care. To assess the effectiveness of SHAPE at improving self-efficacy and
      secondary outcomes a battery of questionnaires will be administered to the participants and
      study supporters at baseline, 3 months after randomisation; after SHAPE participants have
      completed the intervention, and 9 months after randomisation. The answers to these
      questionnaires will be assessed and the results compared between the two groups of
      participants.

Key themes of the intervention will include positive actions to improve and maintain health, how to talk about the impact of the disease on the life of the person with dementia, fear of losing independence and how to tackle and solve other sensitive issues. Running in parallel there will be an e-learning resource available to the carers which covers the similar material covered in the group sessions for the person with dementia, as well as some additional resources and signposting to help them in their role supporting the person with dementia.</description>

    <description>The SHAPE intervention provides information for carers, and maintains the dignity and autonomy of the person with dementia, supporting them in planning for the future with their family. The person with dementia attends a 10 week facilitator lead group based course. It is designed to develop self-management skills in areas including decision-making, symptom management and social interaction. It also provides information on the disease process and the development of healthy behaviors in a supportive learning environment to prevent problems that are common in the later stages of the disease. The adjunctive e-learning platform for carers provides the same information that the person with dementia receives plus additional material and signposting to support them in their role. This will empower the whole family to support and enable more effective self-management by the person with dementia, and enhance their ability to plan ahead together and make key decisions jointly.</description>
