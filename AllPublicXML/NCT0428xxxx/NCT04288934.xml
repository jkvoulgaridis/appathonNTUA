    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess and compare the safety and effectiveness of Autologous Bone
      Marrow-Derived MSCs (AutoBM-MSCs) in one group(group A) of SCI who are unlikely to be able to
      walk independently without treatment after 1 year of SCI, in the other group (group B) to
      assess the second group of Wharton Jelly derived mesenchymal stem cells ( WJ-MSCs) in the
      treatment of acute and subacute spinal cord injury (SCI) patients.

      The study will be directed by the Cell Therapy Center (CTC) in Jordan, where 20 SCI patients
      meeting the inclusion criteria will be recruited and divided according to the type of injury
      into two groups; Group A for patients with complete transection of the spinal cord, and Group
      B for SCI without a total transaction,10 patients will receive (AutoBM-MSCs)and the other 10
      patients with acute and subacute spinal cord injury will receive(WJ-MSCs) by a specialized
      spine surgeon into the spinal medulla. The outcomes and improvements will be assessed using
      the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS) and the Spinal Cord
      Independence Measure (SCIM) version III, in addition to blood tests, MRI, and somatosensory
      evoked potential (SSEP).
