  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking causes cardiovascular disease (CVD) yet many smokers with CVD are unable to
      quit despite strong desire to do so. Within 90 days of discharge, about 30% of smokers have
      returned to daily smoking and almost 60% have relapsed by 1 year. Patients with CVD who
      resume smoking are more likely to experience new events (e.g. heart attack or stroke) or die.
      New approaches are required. A new type of cessation product is a plant-based medication
      called Cytisine. Cytisine is taken orally over 25 days and reduces the pleasurable sensations
      that smokers get from cigarettes and reduces withdrawal symptoms. The primary research
      question is whether or not it is feasible to conduct a large-scale trial of the effectiveness
      of this product compared to conventional nicotine replacement therapy in smokers who have
      failed to quit using conventional methods. To determine feasibility, a pilot study will be
      conducted of sixty smokers (30 men, 30 women) with CVD who have been treated for smoking
      cessation but have relapsed within 90 days of discharge. Participants will complete a
      baseline assessment and will be randomly assigned to either the combination nicotine
      replacement therapy group (patch plus lozenge) or cytisine group. Participants will be
      treated for 25 days and then will return to UOHI so adherence to treatment and smoking status
      can be assessed. Feasibility of the larger trial will be based on: the recruitment rates;
      adherence to assigned treatments; dropout rates; and differences in 25-day quit rates between
      groups.

    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is a causative factor in the development of coronary heart disease (CHD),
      and is the most dangerous form of tobacco use. Effective treatments for smoking cessation
      exist but relapse to cigarette smoking is common, principally due to nicotine addiction and
      related symptoms of withdrawal. Little is known about how best to support smokers who have
      relapsed in subsequent attempts to change their smoking behavior. One emerging treatment has
      features that might make it appealing to smokers and may be effective in the setting of
      recent relapse: cytisine.

      Cytisine is a plant-based smoking cessation medication with more than 50 years of use in
      central/eastern Europe. Cytisine is a partial agonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
      (nAChRs), which is central to the effect of nicotine on the reward pathway. Cytisine acts by
      reducing the rewarding effect of nicotine and attenuating nicotine withdrawal symptoms. A
      recent review concluded that cytisine is the most promising future smoking cessation
      treatment. Cytisine is inexpensive to produce and is currently priced much lower than other
      cessation medications. It is well-tolerated by smokers and requires a shorter treatment
      period (i.e. 25 days) than conventional treatments. Because it is plant-based, cytisine may
      be attractive for smokers who prefer 'natural' medicines. Numerous placebo-controlled studies
      have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of cytisine. One high-quality pragmatic
      non-inferiority trial (n = 1310) found that cytisine was superior to nicotine replacement
      therapy (NRT) in improving self-reported continuous abstinence rates at 1 week, and 1, 2 and
      6 months when both groups received minimal behavioural support. In Canada, cytisine is
      marketed as the natural health product Cravv™.

      The long-term goal is to conduct a definitive, large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT)
      of the efficacy of cytisine compared to conventional treatment (i.e. combination NRT) for
      smoking cessation among smokers who have relapsed to smoking following hospitalization for a
      CHD-related event. Prior to conducting a larger, definitive RCT there is a need to conduct a
      pilot study to better understand the potential feasibility of such a trial.

    <description>The Nicoderm® patch plus Nicorette® Lozenge will be provided to participants in the combination NRT group. Participants smoking less than 15 cigarettes per day will be provided with 14 mg patches while those smoking 15 or more cigarettes per day will receive 21 mg patches. Participants will be told to apply a new patch each morning. Participants will be instructed to use the lozenges as needed (up to 15 per day) to overcome nicotine cravings. Lozenges are available in both 2mg and 4mg strengths. For those who are smoking less than 15 cigarettes per day, they will be given the 2mg strength. For those who are smoking 15 or more cigarettes per day, they will receive the 4mg strength.</description>
