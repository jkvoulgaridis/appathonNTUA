  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The DULCINEA study aims to develop and validate a new therapy that integrates essential
      language characteristics and functional communication by dubbing scenes from television
      series that represent daily situations. It will be a randomized, crossed over, interventional
      pilot study recruiting 54 patients with poststroke nonfluent aphasia. Patients will be
      treated individually in 40-minute sessions twice a week for 8 weeks. In each session, a
      speech therapist and an actor will select the clips with muted words or sentences that have
      been detected as functionally meaningful for each patient. Outcomes will be assessed as
      significant differences in two aphasia tests.

      The DULCINEA study aims to develop and validate a new therapy that integrates essential
      language characteristics and functional communication by dubbing scenes from TV series that
      represent daily situations. It will be a randomized, crossed over, interventional pilot study
      recruiting 54 patients with poststroke nonfluent aphasia from the departments of Neurology
      and Rehabilitation from La Paz University Hospital and also from the &quot;Afasia Activa&quot;
      association. After meeting all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria and signing
      informed consent, patients will be randomised (1:1) in two different treatment groups. The
      first group will receive therapy within the first 3 months of their inclusion with a
      subsequent period of another 3 months without therapy (thus, serving as group 2 controls).
      Group 2 will initiate therapy after 3 months since their inclusion (serving as group 1
      controls during the first 3 months). Therapy consists of 17 sessions performed in a eight
      week period (1 baseline session and 16 dubbing sessions), each lasting 40 minutes, in which
      the patient will be asked to dubb words or sentences previously selected and considered as
      functionally meaningful for them. These words will be chosen through an online survey
      performed by a representative group of aphasic patients and the study patients´own relatives
      in the baseline treatment session. Outcomes will be assessed as significant differences in
      two aphasia tests (CAL questionnaire and the BDAE).

    <description>Neuropsycological battery that evaluates language skills based on perceptual modalities (auditory, visual, and gestural), processing functions (comprehension, analysis, problem-solving), and response modalities (writing, articulation, and manipulation). There are five subtests which include: conversational and expository speech, auditory comprehension, oral expression, reading, and writing. Its results can be used to classify patient's language profiles into one of the localization based classifications of aphasia, and it also provides a severity rating.</description>

    <description>SAQOL-39 is an interview-administered self-report scale that comprises the 49 items of the SS-QOL (modified to be communicatively accessible to people with aphasia) and 4 additional items that measure speech comprehension, difficulties with decision-making and and impact of language problems on family and social life. Questions are answered with a five point scale.</description>

             percentile in the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE) for repetition.
             Moderately preserved language comprehension: listening comprehension exceeding the
             15th percentile of BDAE (average score obtained in three areas: word comprehension,
             commands and complex ideational material).

          -  Signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinical condition (short life expectancy, coexisting disease) or other
             characteristics that precluded appropriate follow-up.

          -  Participation in any therapeutic trial evaluating poststroke recovery.
