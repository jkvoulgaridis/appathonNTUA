  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is a prospective, observational study of participants receiving immunotherapy
      (checkpoint inhibitors, CPI) for cancer therapy, testing the hypothesis that patients with
      immune related cutaneous adverse events (ircAEs) have unique immunologic endotypes associated
      with polarized immune responses.
