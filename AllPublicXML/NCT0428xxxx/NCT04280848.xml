  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most frequent primary brain tumor and the brain tumor with the
      poorest prognosis. The current treatment relies on surgical resection of gross tumor followed
      by radiochemotherapy and adjuvant therapy with temozolomide.

      After such therapy, most patients experiment recurrence and few therapeutic option are
      available. Despite such therapies, median survival only reaches around fifteen months.

      There is a strong rational to develop telomerase vaccine in GBM. Telomerase (TERT) is a major
      oncogene, particularly in primary brain tumors 24. Alterations in TERT are very frequent in
      central nervous system tumors, seen most commonly in gliomas25. Mutations in the TERT
      promoter are found in approximately 80% of primary glioblastoma (GBM). These findings
      strongly support the rational to develop vaccine targeting telomerase in GBM.

      The aim of this project is to evaluate UCPVax treatment in glioblastoma. UCPVax is a
      therapeutic anti-cancer vaccine based on the telomerase-derived helper peptides designed to
      induce strong TH1 CD4 T cell responses in cancer patients (NCT02818426).

    <description>The UCPVax vaccination protocol will start at least one month after glioblastoma patients have completed the concomitant radiochemotherapy (Radiotherapy + Temozolomide RT/TMZ), without the 6 additional monthly cures of temozolomide, with a maximum of 45 days.
UCPVax vaccine will be emulsified in Montanide ISA 51 and injected subcutaneously at days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36 and 43 (priming phase) following by boost vaccination one month after the last injection and then every 8 weeks for 12 months maximum.</description>
