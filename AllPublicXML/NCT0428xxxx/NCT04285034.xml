  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arenaviruses are included in the World Health Organisation R&amp;D Blueprint list of high
      priority pathogens, since this virus group includes several epidemic-prone highly pathogenic
      viruses for which there are inadequate diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventative
      interventions. Junin, Machupo, Guanarito, Sabia, Lujo, and Lassa virus can all cause a viral
      haemorrhagic fever with high case fatality in hospitalised cases. Lassa fever is the most
      common severe arenavirus disease and is endemic across many low and middle income countries
      in West Africa, with an estimated 37.7 million people in 14 countries living in areas at risk
      of Lassa virus. Despite the discovery of Lassa virus in 1972 and an estimated 300,000 cases
      and 5000-10,000 deaths annually, there remain gaps in our understanding of the natural
      history of disease and in the availability of evidence based interventions.

      The protocol has two components. Sites may implement one or both components.

        1. Cardiovascular function in Lassa fever: Lassa fever in humans is often described in the
           literature as being characterized by vascular leak and shock in the terminal phase, this
           being the main pathway to death. Whilst animal data supports this, there are very
           limited data in humans. One of the main aims of this study therefore is to characterize
           cardiovascular function in patients with Lassa fever, with the ultimate goal of
           informing future trials of supportive or therapeutic strategies to improve vascular
           leak.

        2. Ribavirin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics: The recommended treatment for Lassa is
           ribavirin, but its efficacy has not been established in randomized controlled trials and
           its mechanism of action is not fully understood. There are very limited PK data on
           ribavirin in patients with Lassa fever and the optimal dose of ribavirin for an RCT has
           not been established. Furthermore, there are various hypothesized mechanisms of action
           of ribavirin, none of which have been investigated in humans with Lassa fever.
           Therefore, further aims of this study are to characterize the PK of ribavirin and
           ribavirin metabolites (RMP, RDP, RTP) in Lassa fever patients and to identify potential
           mechanisms of action ribavirin in Lassa fever. Understanding Ribavirin's mechanism of
           action in Lassa fever is important for the optimal design of a future RCT.

      Summary of cardiovascular function study Lassa fever carries a treated mortality in
      hospitalized patients of up to 30%. Lassa fever is often described as being characterized by
      vascular leak and shock in the terminal phase, but, whilst animal data supports this, there
      are limited data in humans. A further aim of this study therefore is to characterize
      cardiovascular function in patients with Lassa fever, with the ultimate goal of informing
      future trials of supportive or therapeutic strategies.

      Summary of ribavirin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics sub-study Lassa fever carries a
      treated mortality in hospitalized patients of up to 30% in Nigeria. Ribavirin is the current
      standard of care. However, the efficacy of ribavirin has not been established in RCTs. There
      is very limited PK data on ribavirin in patients with Lassa fever and the optimal dose of
      ribavirin for an RCT is unknown. The aim of this study is to characterize the PK of ribavirin
      in Lassa fever, and identify any associations between ribavirin PK parameters and viral load
      and markers of inflammatory status.
