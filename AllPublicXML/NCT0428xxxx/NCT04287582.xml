  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) have difficulties towards the end of the
      ambulatory period, especially in activities that require lower extremity proximal muscle
      strength such as walking, climbing stairs, standing up without sitting. Stair climbing /
      descending activity is a complex activity that requires joint stability, correct muscle
      synergy and timing. When the literature is examined; It has been observed that the
      performance of stair climb up and down activity in individuals with neuromuscular disease has
      been evaluated with various clinical applications. In recent studies, there are surface
      electromyography (EMG) studies evaluating various aspects of stair climbing and descending
      activity.

      Surface EMG; is a technique for neuromuscular evaluations that is frequently used in both
      research and clinical applications, noninvasive, and can be used in areas such as
      neurophysiology, sports science and rehabilitation.

      Our study was planned to examine the muscle activations in the lower limb muscles involved in
      climbing up stairs activity in children with DMD and to compare healthy children with
      children with DMD and children with different levels of DMD.

      Hypothesis originating from the investigation:

      H0: There is no difference in the muscle activations measured by surface electromyography
      (EMG) of the involved lower extremity muscles during climbing up stairs activity between
      level 1 and level 2-3 children with early DMD.

      H1: There is a difference in the muscle activations measured by surface electromyography
      (EMG) of the involved lower extremity muscles during climbing up stairs activity between
      level 1 and level 2-3 children with early DMD.

      H2: There is no difference in the muscle activations measured by surface electromyography
      (EMG) of the involved lower extremity muscles during climbing up stairs activity between
      children with DMD and healthy children.

      H3: There is a difference in the muscle activations measured by surface electromyography
      (EMG) of the involved lower extremity muscles during climbing up stairs activity between
      children with DMD and healthy children.

      In our study, children will be assessed using the surface Electromyography (EMG) device by
      using electrodes placed in the relevant lower limb muscles that take part during the stair
      climbing activity.

      The study included 10 children with DMD levels were 1 and 10 children with DMD levels were
      2-3 according to the Brooke Lower Limb Functional Classification scale and 10 healthy
      children.

      Muscle activation of vastus lateralis, biceps femoris, tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius
      medialis muscles will be measured by superficial electromyographic measurement. Muscle
      activation according to SENIAM (surface EMG for a non-invasive assessment of muscles) for
      will be evaluated.

      Stair climbing activity will be performed 3 times and at 1 minute intervals.
