  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although neuroplasticity of the brain is high in childhood, some neuropsychological sequelae
      could persist over the long term in children with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI). Many children
      with TBI, show deficits in pragmatic abilities that usually persist. Pragmatic difficulties
      have been observed also in children with sequelae of brain neoplasms .

      The lack of validated assessment tools for this population is described in literature. This
      limit is also valid for the tests that assess pragmatic abilities. The tests that SLPs
      usually administer investigate only the comprehension of verbal pragmatic and, sometimes the
      comprehension of linguistic and emotional prosody as well. This could lead to the risk that,
      sometimes, some pragmatic abilities might not be included in the evaluation. Moreover, it
      leads to a harder definition of the treatment aims and a harder objective demonstration of
      treatment outcomes.

      For these reasons, it is important to use an assessment tool that provides information on all
      the pragmatic abilities, not only in input but also in output. Some Italian researchers,
      recently, developed a test that investigates all these areas. It is called &quot;ABaCo&quot;, and it is
      based on the Cognitive Pragmatics Theory. This theory is focused on cognitive processes
      underlying human communication.

      This test is standardized on a normative group of 300 adults. It was developed with the aim
      of assessing pragmatic abilities in adults with brain injuries. The assessor shows short
      videos to the patient, and he/her has to complete or understand the interaction transmitted
      through different communication channels. The authors also created an adaptation of this test
      for children aged 5 to 8.6 years old, modifying some items. After that, they administered
      this adaptation of the test to 390 healthy children. In another study, the authors
      administered this version of the batteries to children with autism spectrum disorders and to
      a control group of healthy children, matched by age and sex.

      Considering all the studies that already exist for the application of this assessment tool in
      childhood and adolescence, and the perspective of a standardization for developmental ages,
      this study aims to investigate whether this test could be useful to detect pragmatic
      difficulties also in children with ABI.

      This project involved two different experimental populations: children with Acquired Brain
      Injury. Moreover, it includes a wider investigation; in fact, it involves the assessment, not
      only of linguistic and pragmatic abilities but also of neuropsychological abilities and the
      theory of mind.

      Approximately 30 children with Acquired Brain Injury will be involved in the study.

      The data will be collected through the administration of the adapted version of ABaCo test,
      individually, to each subject involved in the study. The assessment will be conducted in the
      IRCCS Eugenio Medea. The assessor will administer ABaCo test through a computer device and
      she will marked the responses on a paper sheet. Video recordings are needed only to allow an
      impartial scoring. In fact, an external trained judge will do the scoring. The researchers
      will complete the scoring process within two weeks from the acquisition of the recordings,
      after that they will destroy the videos.

      Furthermore the linguistic abilities will be assessed through the administration of some
      subtests of the Italian battery &quot;BVL 4-12&quot;. In particular, the researcher will administer the
      following subtests: &quot;naming&quot;, &quot;lexical comprehension&quot; and &quot;grammatical comprehension&quot;.

      Moreover, some neuropsychological abilities will be analysed using the test &quot;BVN 5-11&quot;. In
      addition, the theory of mind and the non-verbal IQ will be assessed.

      The Socio-Economic-Status of the family involved in the research will also be investigated,
      considering its importance on the rehabilitation outcomes , using a questionnaire realized,
      based on the &quot;Four Factor Index of Social Status&quot;.
