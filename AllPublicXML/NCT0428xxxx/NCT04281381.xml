    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of desmoid fibromatosis, either new or newly recurrent. Both
             patients with sporadic and FAP-associated disease will be eligible for inclusion.
             Patients with clinical diagnosis of desmoid (as assessed by MSK physician) but without
             pathologic diagnosis may be enrolled on the study to facilitate acquisition of
             appropriately protocoled baseline scans and allow for biospecimen collection; these
             patients will be replaced for purposes of analysis if pathology does not confirm
             clinical diagnosis.

          -  At least 18 years of age.

          -  Able to undergo cross-sectional imaging by either MRI or CT with intravenous contrast

          -  Disease detectable on cross-sectional imaging with target lesion measuring &gt;/= 1 cm

          -  Eligible for management by active observation as assessed by primary MSK care provider

          -  Willing and able to sign an informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Symptomatic desmoid fibromatosis requiring narcotic pain control, resulting in
             intestinal fistulization, or requiring inpatient admission during the 3 months prior
             to enrollment

          -  Patients with intraabdominal desmoids greater than 7cm in diameter or localized within
             1cm of the central mesenteric vessels and those with tumors in the head and neck

          -  KPS performance status &lt;/= 70 if performance status is limited due to tumor. Patients
             with low KPS performance status related to co-morbidities but without symptoms related
             to the tumor will be eligible for enrollment.

          -  Age less than 18 years old

          -  Strict contraindication for both cross-sectional MRI and CT imaging with intravenous
             contrast (e.g., as per standard institutional protocols regarding renal insufficiency
             or MRI incompatible implanted devices; patients requiring pre-medication to prevent
             contrast reactions will be eligible for study)

          -  Unable to grant reliable informed consent

          -  Ongoing systemic treatment for desmoid fibromatosis
