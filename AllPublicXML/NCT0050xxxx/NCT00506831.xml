  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis of the skin and
      internal organs and widespread vasculopathy. Patients with SSc are classified according to
      the extent of cutaneous sclerosis: patients with limited SSc have skin thickening of the
      face, neck, and distal extremities, while those with diffuse SSc have involvement of the
      trunk, abdomen, and proximal extremities as well. The disease course varies depending on the
      subtype of SSc. However, common features that result in significant morbidity and mortality,
      in addition to cutaneous fibrosis, include Raynaud's phenomenon and digital ulcerations,
      interstitial lung disease (ILD), and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Current
      therapeutic options for patients with SSc and these clinical manifestations have shown
      limited efficacy.

      Imatinib antagonizes specific tyrosine kinases that mediate fibrotic pathways involved in the
      pathogenesis of SSc, including c-Abl, a downstream mediator of transforming growth factor
      (TGF)-beta, and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors. The efficacy of imatinib has
      also been reported in the treatment of patients with refractory idiopathic PAH through its
      effects on vascular remodeling. Based on the mechanism of action and preliminary patient
      data, we hypothesize that imatinib may be effective in the treatment of the fibrotic and
      vasculopathic features of patients with SSc. This is an open label pilot study to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of imatinib in patients with progressive SSc refractory to other
      treatment(s). Validated measures of skin thickness and disease activity will be determined
      over 6-months of therapy and compared with baseline measures.

    <description>Modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS) on scale of 0 (no skin disease) to 51 severe skin disease. %change in mRSS=(score at 6 months - baseline score)/baseline score. Negative values indicate improvement in skin disease. Clinical important improvement defined as &gt; 25% improvement.</description>

FVC% predicted is defined as FVC% of the patient divided by the average FVC% in the population for any person of similar age, sex and body composition.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months compared to baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index at 6 months compared to baseline. The Questionnaire is comprised of a 20 question instrument pertaining to specific activities with possible integer responses of 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unable to do), and five additional scleroderma-specific visual analog scale (VAS) domains with possible values ranging from 0.0 to 15.0. The 20 questions are divided into eight domains. A mean score is calculated for each domain ranging from 0 to 3. A composite score is calculated by dividing the summed domain scores by the number of domains answered. The composite score is reported, falling between 0 and 3 on an ordinal scale. The scores are interpreted as 0 (no impairment in function) to 3 (maximal impairment of function).</description>

    <description>To determine which cell types may be contributing to the gene expression changes associated with imatinib therapy, imatinib-responsive genes were isolated from from patient biopsies. From the total number of imatinib-responsive genes that were isolated, the percentage that came from endothelial cells, fibroblasts, B-cells, and multiple cell types was calculated. Reported values do not total to 100% because of rounding.</description>

FVC% predicted is defined as FVC% of the patient divided by the average FVC% in the population for any person of similar age, sex and body composition.</description>

        <title>Change in Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire at 6 Months Compared to Baseline</title>
        <description>Change in Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index at 6 months compared to baseline. The Questionnaire is comprised of a 20 question instrument pertaining to specific activities with possible integer responses of 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unable to do), and five additional scleroderma-specific visual analog scale (VAS) domains with possible values ranging from 0.0 to 15.0. The 20 questions are divided into eight domains. A mean score is calculated for each domain ranging from 0 to 3. A composite score is calculated by dividing the summed domain scores by the number of domains answered. The composite score is reported, falling between 0 and 3 on an ordinal scale. The scores are interpreted as 0 (no impairment in function) to 3 (maximal impairment of function).</description>

        <description>To determine which cell types may be contributing to the gene expression changes associated with imatinib therapy, imatinib-responsive genes were isolated from from patient biopsies. From the total number of imatinib-responsive genes that were isolated, the percentage that came from endothelial cells, fibroblasts, B-cells, and multiple cell types was calculated. Reported values do not total to 100% because of rounding.</description>
