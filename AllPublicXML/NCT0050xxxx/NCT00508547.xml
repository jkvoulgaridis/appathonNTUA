      The purpose of this study is to further evaluate the safety of infliximab, ustekinumab, and
      guselkumab in patients with plaque psoriasis, and other all forms of psoriasis (such as
      plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis occurring together). The registry study will track
      the behavior of the disease in response to other therapies, such as other biologic drugs. The
      registry will also evaluate clinical outcomes; disease characteristics, including physician
      reported assessment of psoriatic arthritis (PsA); quality of life, and potential risks for
      patients who may receive standard therapies for psoriasis.

      PSOLAR is an 8 year registry study. A registry is an observational study that evaluates the
      status of a disease. This registry study will only include patients who volunteer to take
      part. About 4000 infliximab-exposed patients, 4000 ustekinumab-exposed patients and as well
      as a comparable number of patients (4000) on other standard of care psoriasis therapies (e.g.
      Etanercept) and/or psoriasis treatments (e.g. topical or light therapy treatments) will take
      part in the registry study, internationally. Additionally, enrollment will be opened to
      include at least 2,000 guselkumab-exposed patients and up to 2,000 patients exposed to IL-17
      inhibitors (example, secukinumab, ixekizumab, brodalumab). The Registry does not require any
      study-specific testing, but may capture test information (e.g. laboratory tests, X-rays) that
      are collected as part of normal routine care for the registry program. Patient information
      will be collected at the enrollment visit and about every 6 months thereafter. At enrollment,
      information on demographics (e.g. gender, race, date of birth), medical history and family
      medical history, details of past and current psoriasis treatments (e.g. infliximab and
      standard therapy), and current medication regimens will be collected. Clinical follow-up will
      be based on observations from physical examination, clinical disease status, Quality of Life
      assessment (e.g. Dermatology Life Quality Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, EQ-5D
      (EuroQoL-5D is a Quality of Life Questionnaire) Health Questionnaire Scale,
      Employment/Productivity Health Economic Questionnaire), current medications, and any adverse
      events/problems reported. During each six -month follow-up visit with the study doctor,
      information collected will include observations from physical examination, updates on
      clinical disease status, Quality of life assessments, medications and adverse
      events/problems. No study agents will be administered in this registry. All patients will
      receive standard of care treatments prescribed by the patient's physician.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. All adverse events, including those of special interest, such as dysplasias and malignancies of all types, serious infections, and new autoimmune disease, will be documented.</description>
