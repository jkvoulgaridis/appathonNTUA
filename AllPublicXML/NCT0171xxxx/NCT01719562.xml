  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) works in detecting heart damage
      in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy. Diagnostic procedures, such as MRI, may help
      doctors predict whether patients will have heart damage caused by chemotherapy in patients
      with cancer receiving chemotherapy.

      Exercise Capacity Addendum Brief Summary: This study is designed to demonstrate feasibility
      of performing the physical activity intervention and the primary outcome measures before,
      during and six months after initiating Anth-bC for treatment of non- or Hodgkin lymphoma.
      This study will test the potential for a novel (lifestyle) intervention designed to improve
      exercise capacity, health-related quality of life and cardiac and cognitive dysfunction. This
      data will inform the development of the R33 phase of the clinical trial to determine if the
      physical activity intervention can reduce exercise intolerance in this high-risk population.
      In addition, cardiac MRI data from individuals within this pilot will be compared to cardiac
      MRI data from individuals in the parent study that did not undergo either of the two
      interventional arms of this study.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To design an automated MRI hardware/software platform for measuring and reporting left
      ventricular (LV) function (volumes, strain, and ejection fraction [EF]), T1 myocardial
      signal, and aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV).

      II. To determine if pre- to 3 month post-anthracycline-based chemotherapy (Anth-bC) changes
      in our MRI platform generated measures of LV volumes, EF, strain, myocardial T1, and aortic
      PWV predict pre- to 24 month post-Anth-bC differences in these same parameters.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo MRI scans for LV function, T1 myocardial signal, and aortic PWV at baseline,
      3 months, and 24 months.

      Exercise Capacity Addendum Objectives:

      Primary Objective:

        -  To provide critical participant enrollment data necessary to accomplish the R01
           submission, including:

        -  Feasibility of screening, enrolling, and randomizing 21 Non or Hodgkin lymphoma and
           stage I-III breast cancer patients including the reasons for failed randomization,

        -  Identification of barriers for participating in, or adhering to the Patient ES-AI and
           the Healthy Living Control Group.

      Secondary Objective:

      â€¢ In these 21 patients, at study initiation then 3 and 6 months after initiating Anth-bC or
      other potentially cardiotoxic cancer therapies, to assess the ability to ascertain: peak
      exercise cardiac output, calculated arteriovenous oxygen difference (A-V O2) and VO2 (maximum
      rate of oxygen), and pre-exercise measures of left ventricular and cognitive function,
      health-related quality of life, six-minute walk distance (6min WD) and fatigue. Ascertainment
      of the left ventricular function and health-related rate quality of life will be attempted in
      a manner similar to ascertainment of these variables from 47 individuals with lymphoma in the
      parent study.

    <measure>Parent Study - To correlate results of an automated MRI hardware/software platform for measuring left ventricular (LV) function with manual results.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>For the automation to be considered useful it should correlate highly with the manual results, exhibit a similar mean value and overall variability. 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the difference between measures will be constructed and the upper and lower bounds of these intervals will be examined. The final diagnostic we will perform is to run F-tests to determine whether the variability from each measure is the same or different. 95% CIs will be examined for the ratio of the variance.</description>

    <measure>Parent Study - To test the ability of the pre- to post-anthracycline-based chemotherapy (Anth-bC) changes in our MRI platform generated measures of LV function to predict pre- to 24 month post-Anth-bC differences in LV function.</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Each patient is individually categorized as either having a persistent CV worsening or not depending on whether they exhibit a 20% worsening of their outcome by 3 months and that level of worsening persists to 24 months. We will examine paired t-tests for each time point for each measure to test whether measures are significantly worse at each time point. We will fit longitudinal models that examine all three time points (baseline, 3 and 24 months) simultaneously to determine whether there is a linear (or some other) function that can describe the decline in these subclinical CV MRI measures.</description>
