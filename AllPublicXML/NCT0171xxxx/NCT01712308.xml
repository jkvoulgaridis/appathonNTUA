  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects of and how well sotatercept works in treating
      patients with myeloproliferative neoplasm-associated myelofibrosis or anemia. Sotatercept may
      stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine safety and efficacy of sotatercept as therapy for persons with
      myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN)-associated myelofibrosis and anemia.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive sotatercept subcutaneously (SC) once every 3 weeks. Cycles repeat every 3
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients unable to
      achieve anemia-response after 8 cycles will be taken off study.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month.

    <description>Severity graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Toxicity is defined as an adverse event and classified as possibly, probably, or definitely related to study drug. Such adverse events will be recorded by the principal investigator in a database. The maximum grade for each type of toxicity will be recorded for each patient, including start/stop dates, and frequency tables for each group will be reviewed to determine toxicity patterns.</description>

    <description>Defined as an increase in hemoglobin level equal to or greater than 1.5 g/L without red blood cell-transfusion OR becoming red blood cell-transfusion-independent in a patient who is red blood cell-transfusion-dependent. Will be based on the intent-to-treat principle.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  MPN-associated myelofibrosis

          -  Anemic patient OR red blood cell (RBC)-transfusion-dependent patient

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) and
             aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])
             equal to or less than 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), or equal to or less than 4 x
             ULN (if upon judgment of the treating physician, it is believed to be due to
             extramedullary hematopoiesis [EMH] related to myelofibrosis [MF])

          -  Direct bilirubin equal to or less than 1.5 x ULN; or equal to or less than 2 x ULN (if
             upon judgment of the treating physician, it is believed to be due to extramedullary
             hematopoiesis related to MF)

          -  Creatinine clearance equal to or more than 50 mL/min

          -  Treatment-related toxicities from prior therapies must have resolved to grade equal to
             or less than 1

             non-latex condom NOT made of natural (animal) membrane during any sexual contact with
             females of childbearing potential or a pregnant female while participating in the

             starting therapy with sotatercept

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Serious medical condition or psychiatric illness that would prevent, (as judged by the
             treating physician) the subject from signing the informed consent form or any
             condition including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the subject
             at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds the
             ability to interpret data from the study

          -  Pregnant or lactating female

             day 1 (other than ruxolitinib at a stable dose for patients in the combination cohort
             as stated in inclusion criteria)

          -  Symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina, or unstable cardiac arrhythmia

          -  Prior sotatercept

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to day 1

          -  Severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions or hypersensitivity to recombinant proteins
