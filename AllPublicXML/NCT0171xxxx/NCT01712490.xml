    <textblock>
      This open-label, randomized, 2-arm, multicenter, phase 3 study has the primary objective of
      comparing the modified progression-free survival (mPFS) obtained with brentuximab vedotin
      (ADCETRIS®) plus AVD (doxorubicin [Adriamycin], vinblastine, and dacarbazine; abbreviated
      A+AVD) versus that obtained with ABVD (doxorubicin [Adriamycin],bleomycin, vinblastine, and
      dacarbazine) for the frontline treatment of advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma(HL)

    <time_frame>Baseline up to end of treatment (approximately 1 year)</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 included 30 items across 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 9 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties) and global health status/QOL scale. It has 28 questions (4-point scale where 1=not at all [best] to 4=Very Much [worst]) and 2 questions (7-point scale where 1=very poor [worst] to 7= excellent [best]). Raw scores were converted into scale scores from 0 to 100. For functional scales and global health status/QOL scale, higher scores show better QOL; for symptom scales, lower scores show better QOL. mPFS was time from date of randomization to date of first of documentation of PD, death due to any cause, or for participants who were confirmed non complete responders per IRF, receipt of subsequent anticancer therapy for HL after completion of frontline therapy. PD is any new lesion or increase by &gt;=50% of previously involved sites from nadir.</description>

        <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 included 30 items across 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 9 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties) and global health status/QOL scale. It has 28 questions (4-point scale where 1=not at all [best] to 4=Very Much [worst]) and 2 questions (7-point scale where 1=very poor [worst] to 7= excellent [best]). Raw scores were converted into scale scores from 0 to 100. For functional scales and global health status/QOL scale, higher scores show better QOL; for symptom scales, lower scores show better QOL. mPFS was time from date of randomization to date of first of documentation of PD, death due to any cause, or for participants who were confirmed non complete responders per IRF, receipt of subsequent anticancer therapy for HL after completion of frontline therapy. PD is any new lesion or increase by &gt;=50% of previously involved sites from nadir.</description>
