    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if a change in inflammation or baseline
      inflammation seen on the ultrasound is a good indicator of how rheumatoid arthritis patients
      respond to TCZ 4mg/kg and whether early prediction of dose escalation is possible by
      utilizing ultrasound inflammatory measures.

    <textblock>
      This is a 24-week, double blind open label clinical trial study to evaluate 57 active
      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients who have moderate to severe disease activity with total
      Power Doppler Ultrasound (PDUS) &gt;10 of 34 joints evaluated by Ultrasound (US) (at screening
      to enter into the study). All patients will begin treatment with tocilizumab at a dose of
      4mg/kg. Two study sites will recruit patients (UCLA and UF) using the same protocol, after
      standardizing US acquisition methods, as well as scoring. US synovitis scores will be
      acquired at screening, baseline, and pre-infusion at 4, 12, 16, and 24 weeks, to be able to
      determine whether change in pre-infusion synovitis score at 4 weeks can be used to predict
      change in disease activity at 12 weeks. This will provide evidence to whether such reading is
      useful in predicting which patients may require escalation of dose from 4 to 8 mg/kg. At 12
      weeks, patients not meeting low disease activity within the 4mg/kg (disease activity score
      DAS28/ Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)-4item&lt;3.2) will increase the tocilizumab dose to
      8mg/kg (maximum dose 800mg) in a blinded manner to enable evaluation of these US-focused
      objectives in the context of the current FDA-approved label. The ultrasound scorer will not
      know information about patient's disease activity (Tender Joint Count (TJC), Swollen Joint
      Count (SJC), labs etc) or if there was dose escalation at 12 weeks. The clinical assessor of
      disease activity will be blinded to the ultrasound scores. Additionally, the patient will
      also be blinded to dose escalation. If patients in the 4mg/kg arm achieve DAS28&lt;3.2 at 12
      weeks, patients will continue with their current dose for the duration of the study. Please
      see the below Table for details on the blinding plan.

    <measure>Baseline to Month 3 Change in Total Power Doppler Synovitis Score of 34 Joints (Range 0 - 102)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 Month</time_frame>
    <description>34 joints will be evaluated using a 0 to 3 point scale for each joint. Power Doppler synovitis score is the sum of all the joint scores. Change scores are calculated by subtracting Baseline minus 3 Month Power Doppler scores.
This scale is called the Power Doppler Synovitis Score (PDUS). It ranges from 0 to 102. Scores of 0 indicate the least amount of inflammation of the joint while scores of 3 indicate the most amount of inflammation. Therefore, a higher value of the total score for PDUS represents more severe disease level.</description>

    <description>34 joints will be evaluated using a 0 to 3 point scale for each joint. Synovial hypertrophy score is the sum of all the joint scores. Change scores are calculated by subtracting Baseline minus 3 Month Synovial Hypertrophy Scores.
This scale is called the Grey Scale Synovial Hypertrophy Score (GSUS). Please note that B-mode is the same as GSUS. It ranges from 0 to 102. Scores of 0 indicate the least amount of inflammation of the joint while scores of 3 indicate the most amount of inflammation.

    <description>28 joints will be evaluated for Tender Joint Count (TJC) and Swollen Joint Count (SJC) as well as patient and physician global values assessed at the time of each visit, finally the ESR lab value will be included in the total calculation. Change scores are calculated by subtracting Baseline minus 3 Month Disease Activity Score (DAS) scores.
The scale being used is called the Disease Activity Score for 28 Joints (DAS28) using the Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) in the calculation rather than the C Reactive Protein (CRP). The scale ranges from 0 to 9.4. Values of DAS28 below 2.6 imply remission, below 3.2 imply low disease activity and greater than 5.1 implies active disease.</description>

          <title>Disease Activity Score All Joints (DAS28)/ Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)</title>
          <description>DAS28 is a measure of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). DAS stands for 'disease activity score' and the number 28 refers to the 28 joints that are examined in this assessment. The calculation takes into account the number of swollen joints, the number of tender joints (both out of 28 assessed joints), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and a self-reported global assessment of health from the patient. DAS28 ranges from 0 to a maximum of 9.48. A DAS28 more than 5.1 implies active disease, less than 3.2 implies low disease activity, and less than 2.6 implies remission.</description>

This scale sums the count of swollen joints, the count of tender joints (both out of 28 assessed joints), and the final scores of both a patient global health assessment and a care provider global health assessment for the patient on a continuous scale from 0-10. CDAI ranges from 0 to 76, and &lt;2.8 implies remission, &lt;10.0 implies low disease activity, &lt;22.0 implies moderate disease activity, and &gt;22.0 implies high disease activity.</description>

          <description>HAQ-DI stands for Health Assessment Questionnaire- Disability Index. HAQ-DI is derived from the HAQ, Health Assessment Questionnaire, developed in the 1980's. The HAQ-DI measures the quality of life of the patient by asking the patient to report answers to their abilities to perform daily life tasks such as getting in and out of bed. It ranges from 0 to a maximum value of 3. Values in the range of 0 to 1 implies the patient has mild difficulties to moderate disability, 1 to 2 implies that the patient has a moderate to severe disability, and 2 to 3 implies a very severe disability.</description>

        <title>Baseline to Month 3 Change in Total B-mode Synovial Hypertrophy Score of 34 Joints</title>
        <description>34 joints will be evaluated using a 0 to 3 point scale for each joint. Synovial hypertrophy score is the sum of all the joint scores. Change scores are calculated by subtracting Baseline minus 3 Month Synovial Hypertrophy Scores.
This scale is called the Grey Scale Synovial Hypertrophy Score (GSUS). Please note that B-mode is the same as GSUS. It ranges from 0 to 102. Scores of 0 indicate the least amount of inflammation of the joint while scores of 3 indicate the most amount of inflammation. Therefore, a higher value of the total score for GSUS represents more severe disease level.</description>
