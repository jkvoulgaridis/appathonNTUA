    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ixazomib citrate and lenalidomide after stem cell
      transplant work in treating patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Ixazomib citrate
      may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways
      and stop cancer cells from growing. Giving ixazomib citrate together with lenalidomide may be
      effective in treating multiple myeloma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish safety and efficacy of oral ixazomib citrate (MLN 9708) and lenalidomide in the
      maintenance setting post autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) in myeloma patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Incidence of secondary primary malignancy. II. Evaluate the best response rate (stringent
      complete response [sCR]/near complete response [nCR]/very good partial response
      [VGPR]/partial response [PR]).

      III. Evaluate time to progression. IV. Evaluate time to next therapy. V. Evaluate the
      tolerability and toxicity. VI. Evaluate M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI)-myeloma
      symptom evaluation.

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning 60-180 days post-transplant, patients receive ixazomib citrate orally (PO) on days
      1, 8, and 15 and lenalidomide PO on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
