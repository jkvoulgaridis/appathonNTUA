    <measure>Change in Total IPSS Scores (International Prostate Symptome Score) After 1, 3, 6 and 12 Months Compared to Baseline.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) is based on the answers to 7 questions concerning urinary symptoms plus one question concerning quality of life (QoL). Each of the seven symptoms includes the assignment of scores from 0 to 5. The total score can therefore range from 0 to 35 points (asymptomatic to very symptomatic). The patient's quality of life (QoL) was evaluated separately in this clinical study.</description>

    <description>Quality of life (QoL) Due to Urinary Symptoms is an eight point of the IPSS scale referred to the patient's quality of life. The answers to this question range from &quot;delighted&quot; to &quot;terrible&quot; or 0 to 5.</description>

    <measure>Change in Total Value of Risk Factors for Progression (Total Score of IPSS, Prostate Volume, PSA Level, Maximum Urinary Flow Rate, Residual Urine Volume) Compared to Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the risk of BPH progression, the following were used: 1) moderate to severe BPH symptoms (ie, IPSS total score&gt; 7); 2) an increase in the volume of the prostate gland (&gt; 30 cm^2); 3) increased PSA level in the blood (≥ 1.4 ng / ml); 4) a decrease in Qmax (&lt;12 ml / s) and 5) a large volume of residual urine (&gt; 200 ml).
The total value of risk factors for progression is assessed as the sum of the risk factors that the patient had at the time of inclusion in the study (presence of risk factors = 1 point, absence = 0 points). After 3, 6 and 12 months of treatment, the dynamics of risk factors for progression was assessed: an increase in the severity of the risk factor meant +1, no change = 0, a decrease in the severity of the risk factor of -1.</description>

        <description>The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) is based on the answers to 7 questions concerning urinary symptoms plus one question concerning quality of life (QoL). Each of the seven symptoms includes the assignment of scores from 0 to 5. The total score can therefore range from 0 to 35 points (asymptomatic to very symptomatic). The patient's quality of life (QoL) was evaluated separately in this clinical study.</description>

        <title>Change in Total Value of Risk Factors for Progression (Total Score of IPSS, Prostate Volume, PSA Level, Maximum Urinary Flow Rate, Residual Urine Volume) Compared to Baseline</title>
        <description>To assess the risk of BPH progression, the following were used: 1) moderate to severe BPH symptoms (ie, IPSS total score&gt; 7); 2) an increase in the volume of the prostate gland (&gt; 30 cm^2); 3) increased PSA level in the blood (≥ 1.4 ng / ml); 4) a decrease in Qmax (&lt;12 ml / s) and 5) a large volume of residual urine (&gt; 200 ml).
The total value of risk factors for progression is assessed as the sum of the risk factors that the patient had at the time of inclusion in the study (presence of risk factors = 1 point, absence = 0 points). After 3, 6 and 12 months of treatment, the dynamics of risk factors for progression was assessed: an increase in the severity of the risk factor meant +1, no change = 0, a decrease in the severity of the risk factor of -1.</description>
