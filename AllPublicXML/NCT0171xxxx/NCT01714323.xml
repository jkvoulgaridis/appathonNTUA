  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in the U.S. The 2008 US Public
      Health Service Smoking Cessation Guideline recommends offering effective treatment to smokers
      in all health care settings, including hospitals. Nearly 4 million smokers are hospitalized
      each year, and hospital admission offers a &quot;teachable moment&quot; for intervention.
      Hospital-initiated smoking cessation intervention is effective, but only if contact continues
      for more than 1 month after discharge. The challenge is to translate this research into
      clinical practice by identifying an evidence-based cost-effective model that U.S. hospitals
      can adopt. The major barrier is sustaining contact after discharge. This project tests an
      innovative strategy to streamline the delivery and maximize the uptake of post-discharge
      smoking interventions.

      Specific Aim: To test the effectiveness of an innovative strategy to maximize smokers' use of
      evidence-based tobacco treatment (counseling and medication) after hospital discharge,
      thereby increasing the proportion of smokers who achieve long-term (6-month) tobacco
      abstinence.

      Study Design: A multi-site randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial will enroll
      1350 adult smokers admitted to 3 acute care hospitals in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. All
      subjects will receive a brief in-hospital smoking intervention and be randomly assigned at
      discharge to either Standard Care (passive referral to their state quitline) or Extended
      Care, a 3-month program consisting of (1) Free Medication: A 30-day supply of FDA-approved
      medication (nicotine replacement, bupropion, or varenicline) given at hospital discharge and
      refillable for a total of 90 days to encourage medication use and adherence; (2) Interactive
      Voice Response (IVR) Triage to Telephone Counseling from a national quitline provider. IVR
      aims to encourage medication adherence and enhance counseling efficiency by identifying
      smokers who need post-discharge support. Immediate transfer of a patient from automated IVR
      call to live telephone counselor will facilitate a successful connection to counseling.

      Outcomes, assessed at 1, 3, and 6 months after hospital discharge, are: (1) intervention
      effectiveness (cotinine-validated 7-day point-prevalence tobacco abstinence rate at 6 month
      follow-up [primary outcome] and other tobacco abstinence measures); (2) treatment
      utilization, and (3) cost-effectiveness (cost per quit). Exploratory analyses will examine
      the intervention's effect on hospital readmissions and mortality in the 6 months after
      discharge.

      <pre_assignment_details>1359 patients were enrolled in the study and randomized to Sustained Care (n=681) or Standard Care (n=678). Two patients, 1 in each group, were excluded post-randomization but before hospital discharge (when intervention began) because they were not eligible. ITT analysis was conducted on 1357 patients (Standard Care n=677, Sustained Care n=680).</pre_assignment_details>

Sustained Care: A 3-month program after hospital discharge with these 2 components: (1) Free Medication - A 30-day supply of FDA-approved medication (nicotine replacement, bupropion, or varenicline) given at hospital discharge and refillable for a total of 90 days to encourage medication use and adherence; (2) Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Triage to Telephone Counseling from a national quitline provider (Alere Wellbeing, Inc., previously Free &amp; Clear). IVR aims to encourage medication adherence and enhance counseling efficiency by identifying smokers who need post-discharge support. Immediate transfer of a patient from automated IVR call to live telephone counselor will facilitate a successful connection to counseling.</description>

      <desc>Hospital admissions for 1 year after index hospitalization were obtained by chart review of admissions to the network of hospitals affiliated with Partners HealthCare and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Deaths in the first 6 months were systematically identified at patient assessments (1, 3, and 6 months). No systematic assessment of other adverse events during the trial was done due to the intervention's minimal risk.</desc>
