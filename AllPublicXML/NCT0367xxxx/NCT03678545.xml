  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      40 participants with Eosinophilic Gastritis 18-60 years of age will be randomly assigned with
      dupilumab or placebo subcutaneous injections every two weeks for a total of 12 weeks. Study
      subjects who complete the 12-week treatment phase, may continue into an open label extension
      study, where dupilumab will be administered every two weeks for a total of 24 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial testing
      the efficacy of dupilumab vs. placebo in EG. Qualifying subjects will be randomized 1:1 to
      either study drug (dupilumab) or placebo, and will receive 600 mg once followed by 300 mg
      doses every two weeks of study treatment for a total of 6 injections. After the 6th injection
      subjects may continue into an open-label treatment phase in which dupilumab will be
      administered every two weeks for a total of 24 weeks.

      Approximately nine sites associated with the Consortium of Eosinophilic Gastrointestinal
      Disease Researchers (CEGIR) will take part in the study.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of repeat subcutaneous (SC)
      doses of dupilumab, compared with placebo, to reduce eosinophilic inflammation in the
      gastrointestinal tract of patients with EG.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean peak eosinophil counts in the stomach</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will determine the mean of the peak eosinophil counts in the 5 most eosinophil dense HPFs in the gastric antrum, body, and/or incisura. Comparison between drug vs placebo at 12 weeks will be the primary measurement endpoint.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Induction of disease remission</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the 30 eosinophils/hpf threshold, which is the study inclusion level. Comparison between drug vs placebo at week 12 will be the measurement endpoint.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in histologic score of gastric mucosa</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in histologic score from pre- to post-treatment with dupilumab or placebo as measured by the Eosinophilic Gastritis Biopsy Evaluation Form. The EG Biopsy Evaluation Form assesses 11 different types of histological features, each one rated from 0-2 (0 = absent, 1 = mild/moderate, 2 = marked), with a maximum score of 22 (most severe) and a minimum score of 0 (normal).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in endoscopic score before and after treatment with dupilumab</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in endoscopic score from pre- to post-treatment with dupilumab or placebo as measured by Eosinophilic Gastritis Endoscopic Assessment. The Eosinophilic Gastritis Endoscopy Assessment captures 6 endoscopic features of the stomach, each scored from 0-6, varying by endoscopic feature. The maximum score is 43 (most severe), and the minimum is 0 (normal).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in clinical symptoms as measured by the Severity of Dyspepsia Assessment tool.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in symptoms from pre- to post-treatment with dupilumab or placebo as measured by the Severity of Dyspepsia Assessment (SoDA) tool. The SoDA measures 3 domains: Pain Intensity (scored from 2-47, with 47 being the most severe), Non-pain symptoms (scored from 7-35, with 35 being the most severe), and SoDA satisfaction (scored from 2-23, with 23 being the most satisfied). Each domain is assessed independently; they are not summed or averaged.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of the value of baseline blood and esophageal biomarkers in predicting responsiveness to dupilumab.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The baseline values of blood biomarkers (primarily cytokine levels) as well as esophageal transcripts will be assessed before and after treatment. We will determine if baseline values correlate with drug responsiveness.</description>
