  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to investigate if improvements in patient self-reported
      pain, symptoms, function and quality of life 12 months after Lumbar spinal fusion among
      patients that have good projected prognosis differ from those among patients with a poor
      projected prognosis.

      The secondary purpose is to explore the underlying factors of the physiotherapists projected
      prognosis to identify objective and possible modifiable candidate prognostic factors for
      recovery.

      Background:

      Over recent decades, an increasing number of patients with Chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP)
      undergo surgical lumbar spinal fusion (LSF). For many of the patients LSF is their last
      resort in the hope of a better life with less pain, disability and use of medication.
      Unfortunately, several reports show, that the pain level remains the same after LSF for many
      patients, and that consumption of medication remains unchanged in almost 50 % of the
      patients.

      Knowing that characteristics such as maladaptive coping strategies, fear avoidance beliefs
      and pain catastrophizing seem to be predictive of worse outcome in pain, function and quality
      of life after surgery. It is important to assess how these individual factors in the
      postsurgical rehabilitation can be addressed.

      The single physiotherapists have an essential role in mobilizing the LSF patient
      post-operatively. In clinical practice it is not enough for the physiotherapists to use their
      biomechanical understanding of LSF material and heeling processes, it is also essential to
      use a so-called &quot;silent knowledge&quot; of experience and personal interaction with the patient.

      It remains unknown if this &quot;silent knowledge&quot; is a reliable predictor of the outcome of LSF
      surgery. If the physiotherapist can predict the outcome, it is important to explore which
      factors the physiotherapist rely their prognosis upon in order to identify objective and
      possible modifiable candidate prognostic factors for recovery.

      The aim of this study is to assess if physiotherapists attending inpatients at public back
      surgery hospitals can predict the future course (post hospitalisation) of recovery of
      patients undergoing LSF. The study will also break down the physiotherapists' &quot;silent
      knowledge&quot; in an attempt to identify objective (and hopefully modifiable) candidate
      prognostic markers of recovery.

    <measure>Oswestry Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Disability will be measured using the Oswestry Disability Index. ODI is a validated measure of condition-specific disability originally developed for patients with LBP. The ODI consists of ten items regarding pain intensity, personal care, lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, sex life, social life, and traveling. For each item the patient chooses one of six answers, with 0 representing no difficulty in the activity and 5 representing maximal difficulty.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient reported movement capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Patients are asked to mark the position along a horizontal 10-cm line that best corresponded to their movement capacity. The endings of the line have verbal descriptions: 0 (''very poor capacity'') - 100 (&quot;very good capacity&quot;)</description>

    <measure>Back Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>A visual analogue scale (VAS) is a simple and frequently used method for the assessment of variations in intensity of pain. Patients are asked to mark the position along a horizontal 10-cm line that best corresponded to their pain intensity. The endings of the line have verbal descriptions: 0 (''no pain'') - 100 (&quot;the worst pain imaginable&quot;)</description>

    <measure>Health outcome and quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed using the EuroQol 5 Dimensions 3 levels (EQ-5D-3L). The EQ-5D is a generic questionnaire developed by an international research group including re-searchers from Denmark. EQ-5D-3L consist of 5 dimensions in health-related quality of life: Mobility, Self-care, usual activities, Pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension is divided into three levels: no problems, some problems or extreme problems. EQ-5D-3L also include a 20-cm vertical scale, were the respondent are asked to describe his/her own health with endpoints of 'best imaginable health state' set at 100 and 'worst imaginable health state' set at 0. The EQ-5D has been validated in Danish, including the development of preference values and Danish population norms.</description>

    <measure>Questionnaire regarding postoperative rehabilitation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>We will administer a questionnaire that includes questions regarding the postoperative rehabilitation. It is questions regarding: setting, duration, participation and the degree of relevance to the individual patient. The patient will answer the questionnaire by a yes or no and detailed answers by text.</description>
