  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychological factors such as stress, distress, anxiety, depression, and poor coping
      strategies may be associated with ongoing pain following injuries such as fractures. To study
      this relationship, patients will undergo cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) which is
      designed to modify such thoughts with the goal of reducing ongoing pain and improving quality
      of life. The goal of this study is to determine if CBT, versus usual care, reduces the
      prevalence of moderate to severe persistent post-surgical pain (PPSP) over 12-months
      post-fracture

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The relationship between psychological factors, behaviors, and cognitive processes and the
      sensation of pain is well documented. Stress, distress, anxiety, depression, catastrophizing,
      fear-avoidance behaviors, and poor coping strategies appear to have a significant positive
      relationship with both acute and chronic pain. Evidence suggests that these psychological
      factors can cause alterations along the spinal and supraspinal pain pathways which influence
      the perception of pain. Previous studies suggest that patients' beliefs and expectations may
      be associated with clinical outcomes, including self-reported pain. Previous studies in
      trauma patients have demonstrated patients' beliefs and expectations regarding their recovery
      following surgery are associated with functional limitations, lower rates of return to work,
      and reduced quality of life one year after injury. Furthermore, up to two thirds of patients
      with operative managed extremity fractures demonstrate unhelpful illness beliefs that
      increase risks of negative outcomes, including persistent pain. Psychological interventions,
      such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), that are designed to modify unhelpful beliefs
      and behaviours have the potential to reduce persistent post-surgical pain and its associated
      effects among trauma patients.

      Our primary objective is to determine if CBT, versus usual care, reduces the prevalence of
      moderate to severe PPSP over 12 months post-fracture in participants with an open fracture of
      the appendicular skeleton, or closed fracture of the lower extremity or pelvis. Our secondary
      objectives are to determine if CBT, versus usual care: 1) increases physical functioning, 2)
      improves mental functioning, 3) accelerates return to function, 4) reduces pain severity, and
      5) reduces pain interference over 12 months post-fracture, and 6) reduces the proportion of
      participants prescribed opioid class medications (and average dose) at 6 and 12 months
      post-fracture in patients with an open fracture of the appendicular skeleton or closed
      fracture of the lower extremity or pelvis. This trial is a multi-centre RCT of 1,000
      participants with an open fracture of the appendicular skeleton or closed fracture of the
      lower extremity or pelvis treated with internal fixation.

    <description>The primary outcome is PPSP according to the World Health Organization's (WHO) proposed definition.
The WHO's definition requires 4 criteria for the diagnosis of PPSP: 1) Pain that began after surgery or a tissue trauma is experienced; 2) The pain is in an area of preceding surgery or tissue trauma, 3) The pain persisted for at least three months after the initiating event, and 4) The pain is not better explained by an infection, a malignancy, a pre-existing pain condition or any other alternative cause.</description>

    <description>General health related quality of life will be assessed by the SF-36. The SF-36 is an established, reliable and validated health status measure. It is a self-administered, 36-item questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life in 8 domains related to physical, social, mental, and emotional functioning, bodily pain, and general health. Both physical and mental summary scores can be obtained. Each domain is scored separately from 0 (lowest level) to 100 (highest level).</description>

The return to function outcome will be assessed using the Return to Function questionnaire.</description>

    <description>Participants who are randomized to the CBT intervention will be encouraged to begin CBT immediately following randomization. The CBT intervention will focus on addressing maladaptive beliefs related to pain and recovery as well as teaching skills to enhance coping and management of pain symptoms. The specific focus of CBT sessions will be informed by each individual patient's responses to baseline questionnaires. All other aspects of post-operative care will be at the discretion of participant's surgeon.
