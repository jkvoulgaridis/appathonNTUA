      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of a 90-day intravaginal ring
      (IVR) containing tenofovir (TFV) in healthy, HIV-uninfected individuals assigned female sex
      at birth.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive an IVR containing either 1.4 g TFV or
      placebo. The IVR will be inserted at the enrollment visit (Day 0) and used continuously for
      approximately 91 days.

      Additional study visits will occur at Days 1, 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, 91, and 92. Study visits may
      include behavioral assessments, physical examinations, blood and urine collection, and pelvic
      and rectal specimen collection.

          -  Age 18 through 45 years (inclusive) at Screening, verified per site standard operating
             procedures (SOPs)

          -  Able and willing to provide written informed consent to be screened for and enrolled
             in MTN-038

             to each clinical visit and for 72 hours after biopsy collection

          -  Willing to use male condoms for penile-vaginal and penile-rectal sexual intercourse
             for the duration of study participation

          -  Per participant report, using an effective method of contraception for at least 30
             days (inclusive) prior to Enrollment, and intending to continue use of an effective
             method for the duration of study participation; effective methods include:

               -  hormonal methods (except contraceptive vaginal ring)

               -  intrauterine device (IUD)

               -  sterilization (of participant or partner, as defined in site SOPs)

               -  having sex exclusively with individuals assigned female sex at birth

               -  sexually abstinent as defined by abstaining from penile-vaginal intercourse for
                  90 days prior to Enrollment, and intending to remain abstinent for the duration
                  of study participation

                  progestin-only method of contraception at Screening (e.g., Depo-Provera or
                  levonorgestrel-releasing IUD) nor to participants using continuous combination
                  oral contraceptive pills, as the absence of regular menstrual cycles is an
                  expected, normal consequence in this context.

          -  Per participant report at Screening and Enrollment, states a willingness to refrain
             from inserting any non-study vaginal and rectal products or objects into the vagina or

             the Female Genital Grading Table for Use in Microbicide Studies Addendum 1 (Dated
             November 2007) to the DAIDS Table for Grading Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events,
             Corrected Version 2.1, July 2017, or satisfactory evaluation with no treatment
             required of Grade 1 or higher Pap result

          -  At Screening and Enrollment, agrees not to participate in other research studies
             involving drugs, medical devices, vaginal or rectal products, or vaccines after the
             Screening Visit and for the duration of study participation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant at Screening or Enrollment or plans to become pregnant during the study
             period

               -  Note: A documented negative pregnancy test performed by study staff is required
                  for inclusion; however, a self-reported pregnancy is adequate for exclusion from
                  the study.

          -  Diagnosed with symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) or reproductive tract
             infection (RTI) at Screening or Enrollment

               -  Otherwise eligible participants diagnosed with UTI/RTI during screening will be
                  offered treatment. If treatment is complete and symptoms have resolved within the
                  45 day screening window, eligible participants may be enrolled.

               -  Note: Asymptomatic BV and candidiasis are not exclusionary.

          -  Diagnosed with an acute sexually transmitted infection (STI) requiring treatment per
             current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines
             (http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/) at Screening or Enrollment such as gonorrhea,
             chlamydia, trichomonas, pelvic inflammatory disease, and/or syphilis

               -  Note: Genital warts requiring treatment and frequent recurrence of HSV are
                  considered exclusionary; however, infrequent HSV outbreaks are not. Genital warts
                  requiring treatment are defined as those that cause undue burden or discomfort to
                  the participant, including bulky size, unacceptable appearance, or physical
                  discomfort. See MTN-038 Study-Specific Procedures (SSP) Manual for additional
                  information.

          -  Has a clinically apparent Grade 2 or higher pelvic exam finding (observed by study
             staff) at Screening or Enrollment. *

                  collection judged to be within the range of normal according to the clinical
                  judgment of the IoR/designee is considered expected non-menstrual bleeding and is
                  not exclusionary.

               -  Note: Otherwise eligible participants with exclusionary pelvic exam findings may
                  be enrolled/randomized after the findings have improved to a non-exclusionary
                  severity grading or resolved within 45 days of providing informed consent for
                  screening.

          -  Participant report and/or clinical evidence of any of the following:

               -  Known adverse reaction to any of the study products (ever), including

                       test as well as IUD insertion/removal are not exclusionary.

               -  Currently breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed during the study

               -  Participation in any other research study involving drugs, medical devices,
                  vaginal or rectal products, or vaccines, in the 60 days prior to Enrollment

          -  Use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention and/or post-exposure
             prophylaxis (PEP) for potential HIV exposure within the 3 months prior to Enrollment,
             and/or anticipated use and/or unwillingness to abstain from PrEP during trial
             participation

          -  Has any of the following laboratory abnormalities at Screening Visit:

               -  Grade 1 or higher Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT)*

                    -  Note: Otherwise eligible participants with an exclusionary laboratory result
                       may be re-tested during the screening process. If a participant is re-tested
                       and a non-exclusionary result is documented within 45 days of providing
                       informed consent for screening, the participant may be enrolled.

          -  Has any other condition that, in the opinion of the IoR/designee, would preclude
             informed consent, make study participation unsafe, complicate the interpretation of
             study outcome data, or otherwise interfere with achieving the study objectives
             including any significant uncontrolled active or chronic medical condition.
