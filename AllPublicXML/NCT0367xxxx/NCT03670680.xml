  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Menometrorrhagia is the first cause of consultation in gynecology. Etiology of
      menometrorrhagia is varied, but in majority of cases no underlying pathology is found, they
      are said functional idiopathic menometrorrhagia .

      In case of failure of medical treatment, for women who do not wish to preserve reproduction
      possibilities, a surgical treatment by endometrectomy (destruction of the uterine endometrial
      epithelial) can be proposed. Currently, a new system, Lina LibrataTM is available on the
      market. This system allows destructing endometrial membrane with a balloon which offer
      several advantages compared to present used system. Specially, it does not require dilatation
      of uterus's cervix and it reduces the pain. The investigator make hypothesis that the use of
      the system Lina LibrataTM does not cause pain and can be thus used under local anesthetic in
      ambulatory surgery. With the aim of developing ambulatory care, the main objective of this
      prospective monocentric study is to estimate the efficiency of Lina LibrataTM system in the
      treatment of functional idiopathic menometrorrhagia. Secondary objectives are to estimate the
      pain during the procedure, the rate of per and post-complications and quality of life.
