  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effects of a combined &quot;cocktail&quot;, cessation intervention of
      brief advice, nicotine replacement therapy sampling and active referral (BANSAR) for smoking
      expectant fathers on smoking cessation outcomes
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure cause substantial harms to pregnant women, foeti and infants.
      Smoking cessation (SC) interventions for smoking expectant fathers are needed particularly in
      China where male smoking predominates and many pregnant women (about 30% in Hong Kong) were
      exposed to SHS. Prenatal period presents a valuable teachable moment to engage smoking
      expectant father in tobacco dependence treatment. However, most smoking cessation trials were
      conducted in the Western countries on smoking pregnant women or smoking couples. Very few
      trials were designed to target fathers quitting.

      Given the busy clinical settings in Hong Kong Public Hospitals, evidence-based, low-cost and
      sustainable brief cessation intervention applicable in real-world practice is imperative.
      Informed by previous research, a combined cessation intervention of brief advice, nicotine
      replacement therapy sampling and active referral (BANSAR) has been developed for smoking
      expectant father. This multicentre, pragmatic, assessor-blinded, individually-randomized
      controlled trial aims to evaluate BANSAR for smoking cessation outcomes in smoking expectant
      father visiting prenatal clinics in Hong Kong
