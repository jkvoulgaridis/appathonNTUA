    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the use of virtual visits in the post-discharge care of patients with
      heart failure. Participants admitted to the hospital with a primary diagnosis of heart
      failure will be randomized at discharge to either a virtual visit or outpatient visit for
      their 7-day post discharge follow up visit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Published guidelines recommend that patients being discharged home after hospitalization for
      HF should be offered a 7-day post-discharge outpatient clinic visit as a way to increase
      engagement with care and reduce risk of poor outcomes. Unfortunately no-show rates for the
      7-day post-discharge outpatient visit in this population are high, suggesting poor
      engagement. The investigators have previously observed a 76% no-show rate at the Cleveland
      Clinic Main Campus. This study is to evaluate whether use of 7-day post-discharge virtual
      visit versus in-person visit can improve adherence with post-discharge appointment.
