  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label, phase 1 study, to determine the safety and efficacy of
      anti-CD123 CAR-T cells in treating patients diagnosed with refractory/relapsed acute leukemia
      in a dose-escalation way.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose-escalation study of autologous anti-CD123 CAR-T cells. Patients receive
      fludarabine phosphate(300 mg/m^2) and cyclophosphamide (30 mg/m^2) IV on days -5 to -3, and
      then Patients receive autologous anti-CD123 CAR T cells IV over 20 minutes on day 0 (20% of
      total dose), day2 (30% of total dose) and day6 (50% of total dose, according to the
      side-effects occured). The total dose of CAR-T cells used in dose-escalation study is
      0.5x10^6- 2.0x10^6 CAR-T cells/kg.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Research patients enrolled are those patients with relapsed or refractory CD123+ acute
             leukemia (Acute Myeloid Leukemia/ acute lymphoblastic leukemia );

          2. Relapsed: is defined as patients that had a first complete remission (CR) before
             developing recurrent disease (increased bone marrow blasts);

          3. Refractory: is defined as patients that have not achieved a first CR after 2 cycles of
             induction chemotherapy; for patients with leukemia evolving from myelodysplastic
             syndrome, they should have completed at least one cycle of induction chemotherapy;

          4. Research participants must have bone marrow and/or peripheral blood samples available
             for confirmation of diagnosis; CD123 positivity must be confirmed by either flow
             cytometry or immunohistochemistry within 90 days of study entry; cytogenetics, flow
             cytometry, and molecular studies (such as FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 [FLT-3] status)

          3. Research participants who have tested human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive, or
             have active hepatitis B or C infection, or poorly controlled infection;

          4. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
             biological composition to cetuximab

          5. Dependence on corticosteroids (5mg/day prednisone more than 2 weeks);

          6. A known hypersensitivity to any of the test materials or related compounds;

          7. Presence of active and clinically relevant Central Nervous System (CNS) disorder;

          8. Undergone prior allogeneic stem cell transplant, GVHD occurred within 6 months,
             requiring immunosuppressive therapy;

          9. Active autoimmune disease, such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis;
