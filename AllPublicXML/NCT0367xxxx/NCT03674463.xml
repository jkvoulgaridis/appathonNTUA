  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label, phase 1 study, to determine the safety and efficacy of
      LCAR-B4822M CAR-T cells in treating patients diagnosed with refractory/relapsed multiple
      myeloma (r/r MM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM) is a usually incurable malignancy of plasma cells. Current therapies
      for multiple myeloma often cause remissions, but nearly all patients eventually relapse,
      there is an unmet clinical needs for these patients. B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is a
      protein expressed by normal plasma cells and the malignant plasma cells of multiple myeloma,
      and it was supposed to be a promising target for r/r MM.

        immunohistochemistry.

        Refractory diseaseï¼š1) At least 3 prior regimens, which must at least have contained
        bortezomi. or 2) other circumstances identified by clinical doctors.

        Relapse criteria in NCCN clinical practice guidelines in Oncology: Multiple Myeloma
        (2016.V2)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Women of child-bearing potential or who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Have any active
        and uncontrolled infection: hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, or other fatal viral and
        bacterial infection.

        Systemic corticosteroid steroid therapy of greater than 5 mg/day of prednisone or
        equivalent dose of another corticosteroid are not allowed within 2 weeks prior to either
        the required leukapheresis or the initiation of the conditioning chemotherapy regimen.

        Patients with any uncontrolled intercurrent illness or serious uncontrolled medical
        disorder.

        Patients with CNS metastases or symptomatic CNS involvement (including cranial neuropathies
        or mass lesions and spinal cord compression).
