  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) covers a spectrum from reversible hepatic steatosis
      to inflammation and fibrosis termed steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis. New evidence
      indicates that NAFLD is associated with development of heart failure, abnormal ventricular
      glucose and fatty acid (FA) utilisation and cardiosteatosis. The mechanisms behind cardiac
      involvement and the progression from NAFL to NASH are poorly understood but must include
      altered cardiac and intrahepatic lipid handling. In collaboration with renowned research
      groups from Oxford, Mayo Clinic and Copenhagen we plan comprehensive kinetic studies of heart
      and liver FA uptake and oxidation, ventricular function and substrate utilisation, and
      hepatic triglyceride (TG) secretion in order to assess mechanisms governing cardiac and
      hepatic lipid and glucose trafficking in subjects with NAFL and NASH and the relationship
      with heart function. In addition, we will assess skeletal muscle and adipose tissue enzyme
      activities, gene expression and protein concentrations in these subjects to define mechanisms
      involved in the cross-talk between heart, liver, muscle and adipose tissues. We will address
      these questions using innovative tracer techniques (11Cpalmitate, 11C acetate, 18FDG glucose
      PET tracers and TG tracers) in combination with hepatic vein catherisation to study cardiac
      and liver substrate trafficking, as well as NMR spectroscopy, echocardiography, muscle and
      fat biopsies in combination with state-of-the art muscle and adipose tissue enzyme kinetics,
      gene- and protein expression. Effects of acute exercise as well as GLP-1 agonist and SGLT-2
      inhibitor treatment (alone and in combination) will be assessed. The overarching goals are to
      define abnormalities and differences between NAFLD and NASH in hepatic lipid (FA and TG)
      metabolism and to assess hepatic, adipose and skeletal muscle lipid and substrate
      utilisation.
