  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label, single-center, phase 1 study, to determine the safety and
      efficacy of autologous reinfusion of CAR-T cells targeting BCMA in the treatment of
      refractory/relapsed multiple myeloma (r/r MM) who get recurrence and progression after
      previous CAR-T cell therapy.

    <description>Patients will undergo leukapheresis to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or use their mononuclear cells that preserved in the laboratory for the production of CAR-T cells. After a pre-treatment lymphodepletion therapy, patients will receive the re-treatment of CAR-T therapy by intravenous injection.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have a confirmed prior diagnosis of active multiple myeloma as defined
             by the updated IMWG criteria.

          2. Patients with refractory multiple myeloma. Clear BCMA expression must be detected on
             malignant plasma cells from either bone marrow or a plasmacytoma by flow cytometry or
             immunohistochemistry.

          3. Refractory diseaseï¼š1) At least 3 prior regimens, which must at least have contained
             bortezomi. or 2) other circumstances identified by clinical doctors.

          4. Relapse criteria in NCCN clinical practice guidelines in Oncology: Multiple Myeloma
             (2016.V2).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Women of child-bearing potential or who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          2. Have any active and uncontrolled infection: hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, or other
             fatal viral and bacterial infection.

          3. Systemic corticosteroid steroid therapy of greater than 5 mg/day of prednisone or
             equivalent dose of another corticosteroid are not allowed within 2 weeks prior to
             either the required leukapheresis or the initiation of the conditioning chemotherapy
             regimen.

          4. Patients with any uncontrolled intercurrent illness or serious uncontrolled medical
             disorder.

          5. Patients with CNS metastases or symptomatic CNS involvement (including cranial
             neuropathies or mass lesions and spinal cord compression).

          6. History of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Have active acute or chronic
             graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), or require immunosuppressant medications for GVHD,
             within 6 months of enrollment.

          7. Patients with active autoimmune skin diseases such as psoriasis or other active
             autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.

          8. other conditions that excluded by clinicians.
