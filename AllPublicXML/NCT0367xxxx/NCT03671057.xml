  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative anxiety is frequently experienced by children undergoing anaesthesia and surgery
      and being separated from parents during the operation. It is associated with a significant
      number of adverse outcomes such as maladaptive behavioural changes and increased
      postoperative analgesic requirements. Pharmacological interventions such as midazolam are
      widely used to decrease preoperative anxiety in children. However, premedication may be
      associated with undesirable effects such as paradoxical reactions, prolonged sedation and
      adverse behavioural changes.The aim of this study is to develop and use a serious game,
      HospiAvontuur, which can be used during the preparation of children for an admission at the
      hospital. By using this game the researchers aim to reduce the usage of pharmacological
      interventions and to increase the use of non-pharmacological interventions, such as
      HospiAvontuur.

      The research questions for the primary outcome are formulated in 5 zero hypotheses:

      Zero hypothesis 1: there is no difference in anxiety levels measured as mYPAS-SF on T1
      between the two groups.

      Zero hypothesis 2: there is no difference in anxiety levels measured as mYPAS-SF on T2
      between the two groups.

      Zero hypothesis 3: there is no difference in anxiety levels measured as ICC on T2 between the
      two groups.

      Zero hypothesis 4: there is no difference in anxiety levels measured as VAK 4-12 on T0
      between the two groups.

      Zero hypothesis 5: there is no difference in change in anxiety levels measured as difference
      between mYPAS-SF on 2 moments (T1 versus T2) between the two groups.

      The research questions for the secondary outcomes are formulated Zero hypothesis 6: there is
      no difference in level of emergence delirium (ED) measured during the postoperative period
      (T3) in the recovery room, at 4 moments, as PAED scale, between the two groups.

      Zero hypothesis 7: there is no difference in level of postoperative pain measured during the
      postoperative period in the recovery room, as FPS-R scale and OPS scale, between the two
      groups.

      Zero hypothesis 8: there is no difference in level of pain as FPS-R scale and problematic
      behaviour (PB) as modified and simplified version of the PHBQ questionnaire on day 2 and at
      the end of week 1 after the operation.

      Design The design of the study will be a single blinded randomized clinical trial. Children
      will be divided in 2 research groups: an intervention group (children who will play the game
      HospiAvontuur as a non-pharmacological at home preparation prior to the hospital admission.
      These children will not receive any pharmacological preparation - Midazolam - at the
      hospital) and a control group (children who do not play the game at home and do receive a
      pharmacological preparation - Midazolam - at the hospital). Participants will be randomly
      assigned to the intervention group or the control group using a computer-generated random
      allocation sequence, created by the study investigator (F.V.). Each patient will receive a
      unique randomized test number.

      Outcome measures As primary outcome for this research project, 2 kinds of anxiety will be
      measured. First the trait anxiety will be measured. Therefore the VAK 4-12 (Vragenlijst Angst
      Kinderen - attachment 1) will be used. To measure the state anxiety, the mYPAS-SF and the ICC
      will be used.

      Emergence delirium: ED will be measured in the recovery room, using the five-point Pediatric
      Anesthesia Emergence Delirium Scale (PAED).

      Pain will be measured in the recovery room, using the four-point Objective Pain Scale (OPS),
      at two time moments: the time of the first awaking of the child and the moment of discharge
      from the recovery room. For the purpose of this study, the FPS-R (Faces Pain Scale -
      Revised), a self-reporting pain scale, will also be used on the same time moments. This
      instrument will be used by a researcher.

      On two time moments: 2 days after surgery and at the end of the first week after surgery,
      parents will receive a phone call from one of the doctors from the anesthesia department or
      the study investigator.

      Both postoperative pain and problematic behaviour will be questioned during a semi-structured
      interview. The FPS-R will be used for pain measurement and 10 questions will be asked in
      order to get a good impression of the child's postoperative behaviour (table 1).

      One version of the FPS-R will be handed over to the parents and the child at the moment of
      discharge from the hospital. Parents will be informed that they can expect a phone call from
      a researcher or an anesthesia staff member and that some questions including the pain
      perception will be asked.

      Power analysis

      Based on the duration of the research project, the expected subjects that could be included
      in the study, the controlling of the variables and based on previous research from Marechal
      et al (2016), the following power analysis was calculated:

      A total research population of 164 subjects (82 subjects per group), would be required to
      demonstrate a 8 point difference in m-YPAS score at time of induction (level of significance
      of p &lt; 0.05 and power of 80%). The mean mYPAS score at time of induction, after MDZ
      premedication in the study of Marechal et al (2016) was 43.74 (SD = 18.32).

      Data received from the OR database (1/12/2015 - 30/11/2016) show that approximately 300
      children undergo ORL surgery over 12 months. Our study will start at 01/09/2017 and will end
      on 31/05/2018 (a period of 9 months). During this period approximately 225 children will be
      operated in the OR. As surgeons are able to set parents at ease to participate in the study
      because no harm will done to the child and since children nor parents won't notice the
      presence of the researcher in the OR (performing the observations), it is expected that most
      parents and children will participate. However, some parents are not keen on scientific
      studies. Others will not be interested in participating because their mind is set on the
      child that needs surgery rather than on other things. Moreover, the number of children
      undergoing ORL surgery is not always constant and there is also a risk of loss-to-follow-up.
      Therefore, the sample size of 164 patients will be inflated to 90 participants per group (180
      in total) to account for a possible 10% loss-to-follow-up.

      Statistics The significance of the differences between the two groups for the scores of
      VAK4-12, mYPas at T1, mTPAS at T2, ICC will be tested with Mann-Whitney U-tests. The
      significance of the differences between T2 and T1 for the two groups will be measured with
      two-way ANOVA. All statistical analyses will be done in the package SAS.

      Ethics During the recruiting of the participants it is important that both parents and
      children are fully informed about the randomization process. In general, playing a serious
      game is considered to be a pleasant activity and children who are assigned to the
      intervention group may consider themselves to be lucky. On the other hand parents may think
      that playing a game and therefore not receiving the standard pharmacological treatment may be
      considered as unfavourable. When providing information to parents it is crucial to make it
      clear that both the non-pharmacological as the pharmacological strategies have a scientific
      basis and that no harm will be done to the children.

      The non-pharmacological preparation of children before surgery is considered standard
      procedure in many hospitals. At the Jessa Hospital this is not yet the case although
      questions about this issue have been risen some time ago, according to the anaesthesia
      department. At this moment there is no specific non-pharmacological alternative in use.
      Therefore this research project could be an answer to this issue. The results from the study
      could support the decision in whether a non-pharmacological preparation program could be
      introduced.

      During the observations of the children in the preoperative holding area and in the operating
      room during anesthesia induction, it is possible that the researcher or the anesthesiologist
      can happen to hear some information from the child or the parent about gaming experiences.
      This can be the case when the child recognizes specific information in the OR that he/she has
      experienced during the gameplay. When this is the case, the researcher and/or the
      anesthesiologist should make a remark on the observation form. Even if this is the case, the
      objective observation and scoring on the scale should continue as planned.

    <masking>Triple (Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Two sets of cartboard boxes will be prepared. The boxes are prepared and numbered by the study investigator (F.V.) (the unique randomized test number) and distributed amongst the consultation offices of the surgeons by the researchers. To blind both the researchers and the surgeons, the 2 sets of boxes will have the same weight. The weight of the ipad is simulated in the boxes of the control group by the use of a coloring book. This will prevent patient selection bias.
After the consultation and when the parent and the child has agreed to participate, the surgeon hands over a box to the parent. The surgeon writes the box number, name of the child, date of birth and the phone number of the child in an excel sheet. This document will be used during data procession.
The patients participating in the trial, the treating physicians, the surgeons dispensing the study boxes, the researchers assessing outcomes and the data-managers will be blinded for group allocation.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>mYPAS-SF (pre-operative)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline: at the beginning of the preoperative process</time_frame>
    <description>For the measurement of the state anxiety, the mYPAS-SF (attachment 3) (modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale - Short Version) will be used. In previous research projects usually the mYPAS (attachment 4) is used. The mYPAS was developed in 1995 (Kain et al, 1995) and modified in 1997 (Kain et al, 1997). It has been used in more than 100 studies spanning diverse health fields, such as anesthesia, surgery, paediatrics and dentistry (Cuzzocrea et al, 2013; Davidson et al, 2006; Huet et al, 2011; Weldon et al, 2004; Fortier et al, 2009; Fortier et al, 2010). This measurement instrument uses 5 items, each representing a different domain of child anxiety, and is used at 4 points in time during the preoperative phase. These 4 time points are: preoperative holding, walk to the OR, entrance to the OR (child enters the OR but has not yet seen the anesthesia mask), and introduction to the anesthesia mask (Jenkins et al, 2014).</description>

    <time_frame>Up to two weeks before baseline measurement: the VAK4-12 will be completed at home, before any intervention has taken place.</time_frame>
    <description>In order to determine any baseline imbalances between the research groups, the VAK4-12 questionnaire will be used. The VAK4-12 (Vragenlijst Angst Kinderen) is a Dutch questionnaire to determine the level of subjective experienced fear in children of 4-6 years old (trait anxiety). It is a reconstructed version of the Revised Fear Survey Schedule for Children. The scale offers scores on 5 subscales and can be completed by children and their parent(s) together. It is a scale which is easy to complete and takes about 20 minutes. In scientific research this questionnaire can be used to select anxious and non-anxious children. It can also be used in effectiveness studies for interventions which focus on anxiety reduction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ICC (pre-operative)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline: at the beginning of the preoperative process</time_frame>
    <description>The ICC (Induction Compliance Checklist) is an observational checklist for describing the compliance of a child towards the induction of general anaesthesia. The checklist consists of 11 items which indicate the compliance. The ICC score is the sum of the items checked. A perfect induction, during which the child does not show negative behaviors, fear or anxiety is scored as 0. This instrument was developed by the research group of Kain et al (1998).</description>

    <measure>PAEDS (Pediatric Anxiety Emergency delirium Scale) (post-operative)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The PAED (Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium Scale) is an observational checklist for describing emergence delirium in the postoperative phase. The scale incorporates cognitive and agitation assessment items and is generally acknowledged to be the most valid and reliable. A score of 10 or above has the highest diagnostic sensitivity and specificity (Bong CL, Ng AS, 2009; Janseen NJ, Tan EY, Staal M, et al, 2011).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>OPS (Objective Pain Score) (Post-operative)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The OPS (Objective Pain Score) is an observational scale for postoperative pain measurement. The scale is a good stand-alone tool to scale pain and to ascertain the need for analgesia and is a good tool to refer to when the NRS is indicative of mild or moderate pain (Tandom M. et al, 2016). At this moment the scale is the standard used instrument in the recovery room.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Faces Pain Scale - Revised (FPS-R) (post-operative)</measure>
    <time_frame>After 2 days and after 1 week of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Faces Pain Scale - Revised (FPS-R) (Hicks CL, von Baeyer CL, Spafford P., et al, 2001) is a self-report measure of pain intensity developed for children. It was adapted from the Faces Pain Scale (Bieri D., Reeve R., Champion GD., et al., 1990) to make it possible to score the sensation of pain on the widely accepted 0-to-10 metric. The scale shows a close linear relationship with visual analog pain scales across the age range of 4-16 years. It is easy to administer and requires no equipment except for the photocopied faces.</description>
