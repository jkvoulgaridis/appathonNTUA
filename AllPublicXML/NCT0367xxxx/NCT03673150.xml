  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer, the first female cancer, affects one in eight women in her lifetime. The
      increase and unequal distribution of its prevalence throughout the world, regardless of age
      and genetic factors (&lt; 10% of cases), observations in migrant women and the increased risk in
      women who have been exposed in utero to diethylstilbestrol, suggest the involvement of
      environmental factors that can act very early in development, such as persistent chemical
      pollutants (POPs) that are endocrine disrupting (EP) acting via nuclear receptors. But the
      demonstration of the deleterious role of such exposure to chemical pollutants is confronted
      epidemiologically with methodological difficulties: the correlation is most often sought at
      the time of cancer discovery when the critical windows of exposure are for the breast, fetus,
      perinatal, peri-advertising or pregnant and a single pollutant is usually measured, whereas
      they can be potentiated (&quot;cocktail effect&quot;).

      The objective of this project is therefore to assess the risk related to pre- and
      per-gravidic exposure to a range of POPs families (dioxins, dioxin-like, PolyChlorinated
      Bysphenyls PCBs, flame-retardant polybrominated compounds, waterproofing perfluorinated
      compounds and several organochlorine pesticides), to develop breast cancer within 15 years of
      delivery, taking into account the conventional risk factors for breast cancer.

      This project benefits from a historical bio-bank of 6242 cord blood, an indirect reflection
      of the pre and per-gravidic maternal exposure, a bank set up between 2002 and 2005, during a
      PHRC at the Nice University Hospital, frozen and stored under strict and regulatory
      conditions, declared to the CNIL, and the Cancer Observatory / CRISAP of the PACA-Corsica
      region, with an exhaustive register of over 92% since 2005, and containing the main
      characteristics of cancer. The cross-referencing of these two registers (biobanks and
      CRISAP), supported by the preliminary feasibility study (155 cases of cancer expected, 35% of
      controls lost to follow-up or opposed to participation), makes it possible to consider a
      prospective case-control study nested in the cohort of mothers included in the bio-bank.

      It will therefore be investigated whether women parturient women of this period who had the
      highest levels of POPs cord blood between 2002 and 2005 had a higher risk of developing
      breast cancer than those who had the lowest levels, taking into account other known risk
      factors.

      The assays will be carried out by LABERCA in Nantes, the national reference laboratory, using
      gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry coupling. Blood lipid concentrations
      will be described in quartile and analyzed in continuous values, alone or in combination with
      a cumulative score, in N=140 cases and 2N=280 controls, matched for age and parity at birth
      by random drawing, sample required for 80% power, risk 5% OR at 2, frequency of exposure&gt;70%.

      The investigators propose to develop a predictive model of breast cancer occurrence based on
      exposure to endocrine disrupters measured during pregnancy by adjusting for known breast
      cancer risk factors.

      These conditions should provide information on the possible association of exposure to POPs
      present in the domestic environment during critical pre- and per-gravidic periods and the
      risk of breast cancer and reinforce the relevance of preventive measures recently recommended
      during pre-conceptional and/or pre-natal consultations.
