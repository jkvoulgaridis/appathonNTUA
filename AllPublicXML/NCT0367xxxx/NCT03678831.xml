  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and other associated complications promote the development and the progression of
      osteoarthritis. The subcutaneous and abdominal fat release several factors that alter bone
      and the cartilage. The role of the marrow fat in close connection with bone has not been
      defined yet, whereas cellular and animal models indicate that this fat depot modifies bone
      and cartilage.

      The aim of the study is to define if the marrow fat produces more joint-altering factors by
      comparison with subcutaneous fat. This fat depot can be characterized from removed pieces
      during the prosthetic surgery of the knee. Measuring before surgery the body weight, waist
      and hip circumferences, blood pressure, glucose, insulin and lipids in blood will also allow
      to determine if obesity and/or type 2 diabetes make this fat more dangerous for the joint.
      Such research will allow the elaboration of new therapeutic strategies in osteoarthritis.
