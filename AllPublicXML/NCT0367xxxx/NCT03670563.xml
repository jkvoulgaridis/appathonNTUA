  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The foot intrinsic muscles are increasingly targeted in foot and ankle rehabilitation. The
      exercises are often difficult to learn initially. The purpose of the proposed study is to
      examine the effect training the intrinsic foot muscles on performance in selected physical
      and functional measures such as balance, plantar pressure during gait, vertical jump, and
      foot posture. In addition,the investigators will compare one group training with traditional
      exercise instruction methods and one group using an adjunctive modality (neuromuscular
      electric stimulation) during the introductory phases of exercise instruction. The
      investigators are interested in how this modality might affect physical and functional
      outcome measures and if it affects participants' frustration with learning a new exercise.

      Arm 1: The purpose of this arm of the study is to determine if a 4-week trial of foot muscle
      exercises, instructed with passive, active-assisted, and active techniques, affect functional
      measures such as balance, plantar pressure during gait, and vertical jump. A frustration
      index will be employed to assess participant frustration with learning a new exercise. 15
      will be enrolled in this arm of the study.

      Arm 2: The purpose of this arm of the study is to determine if a 4-week trial of foot muscle
      exercises, instructed with neuromuscular electric stimulation (NMES) and active techniques,
      affect functional measures such as balance, plantar pressure during gait, and vertical jump.
      A frustration index will be employed to assess participant frustration with learning a new
      exercise.15 will be enrolled in this arm of the study.

      Arm 3: This group will not engage in any training, but will serve as a comparator for the two
      intervention arms.
