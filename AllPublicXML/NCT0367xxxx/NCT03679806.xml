      This study aims to compare and contrast the effects of two different aquatic exercises on
      postural control and hand functions in people with multiple sclerosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Impaired limits of stability causes falls in people with Multiple sclerosis (pwMS) whereas a
      well-controlled posture provides improved upper limb functions which are limited in almost
      75% of pwMS due to weakness, spasticity or tremor. It is an already known fact that hand
      dexterity is an indicator of fall risk due to neuromuscular causes and/or abnormalities in
      the corpus callosum in pwMS.

      Aquatic therapy (AT) provides a safe and effective environment for many therapeutic purposes.
      It is important to understand the effects of each type, intensity, and duration of the
      aquatic interventions to accomplish most suitable aquatic exercise program.

      Halliwick method, neuromotor treatment approach which uses fluid and mechanical properties of
      water, is based on postural control by mobilizing and controlling body parts through the Ten
      Point Program.

      During Aquatic Plyometric Exercises, proximal part of the body needs to be stabilized to
      generate a sudden and powerful contraction at the distal part and stabilization of the
      proximal joints is necessary for maintaining distal movements in a coordinated way.

    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>measured with Biodex Balance System (BBS; SD 12.1&quot;Display 115 VAC). Patients were asked to stand on the rigid surface with barefoot and eyes open during measuring limits of stability. During each test trial, patients must shift their weight to move the cursor from the center target to a blinking target and back as quickly and with as little deviation as possible. The same process is repeated for each of the nine targets. Targets on the screen blink in random order. The tests repeated three times with 30 second resting time between trials. Patients' performance is evaluated from a total score of 100 where the higher score represents better trunk control.</description>

    <measure>Change in Nine hole peg Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The patient is seated at a table with a plastic NHPT placed at the patient's middle and asked to place pegs in a random order as quick as possible by using dominant hand first total time was recorded in seconds. Three consecutive trials with the dominant hand are immediately followed by three consecutive trials with the non-dominant hand.</description>

    <description>Exercises were performed in a private pool owned by the local MS society twice in a week for 8 weeks. Pool depth was 120 cm 30-31°C. The three phases of each exercise; eccentric (or loading) phase, the amortization phase, and the concentric (or unloading) phase included.</description>

    <description>The exercise program was progressed by increasing the speed and the range of motion of the movements. Patients were asked not to accelerate the exercise and to focus on their alignment. Mental adjustment, sagittal rotation, transverse rotation, and combined rotation controls, balances in stillness steps of the Halliwick concept were included.</description>

    <description>The APE programme was progressed by increasing speed and the range of motion of the movements. Patients were carefully informed not to deform the exercise just to emulate the speed. The three phases of each exercise; eccentric (or loading) phase, the amortization phase, and the concentric (or unloading) phase explained thoroughly at the beginning of every exercise.</description>
