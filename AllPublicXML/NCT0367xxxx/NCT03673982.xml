      To improve treatment for patients with severe anorexia nervosa admitted for inpatient care,
      and to help their families. Inpatients and their families will be offered a novel
      intervention which includes multimedia training materials. These materials provide guidance
      in how families can provide support to maintain and build on changes made during inpatient
      care

      Problem to be solved: Hospital Episode Statistics reveal that admissions for anorexia nervosa
      are increasing [1]. Admission restores nutrition in a timely manner [2], but psychosocial
      problems remain and relapse following discharge is common [3]. The mortality post discharge
      is high [4]. We have found that relapse and bed use post discharge are reduced by a parenting
      intervention giving the family skills to manage eating disorder behaviours [5].

      Innovation: Through a process of co-production, in collaboration with service users and their
      families, we have developed tools exemplifying emotional coaching behaviour change strategies
      for patients and their carers (texts, DVDs and podcasts; iCASK programme). These aim of these
      tools is to improve the transition to outpatient care. These are hosted on a user-friendly,
      confidential and NHS-compliant platform.

    <description>Battery of quantitative self report measures for patients administered at admission, discharge and 3-month follow up.
Primary Questionnaire:
EDEQ (Eating Disorders Questionnaire) - Global score calculated for each time point to assess psychopathological change over time. Reduction in global score would indicate an improvement.
Secondary Measure: A reduction in scores would indicate an improvement, except for AQ-10 which should remain constant if true Autism detected. Scores will be assessed individually using total scores but then combined with EDEQ to look overall at psychopathological change over time.
WSAS (Social Adjustment) - Total Score AQ-10 (Autism Quotient) - Total Score indicates levels of autism symptoms. HADS (Anxiety and Depression Scale) - Total Score MR (Motivational Ruler) - Total Score</description>

    <description>Battery of quantitative self report measures for carers administered at admission, discharge and 3-month follow up.
Questionnaire total scores are calculated to provide overview of carer burden. Sub-scales are not used.
Carer Questionnaires: A decrease in overall scores would indicate an improvement.
Burden:
DASS (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale) - Total Score used EDSIS (Eating Disorder Symptom Impact Scale) - Total Score used PvAN (Parent vs Anorexia Scale) - Total Score used AESED (accommodation and enabling scale for eating disorders) - Total Score used</description>
