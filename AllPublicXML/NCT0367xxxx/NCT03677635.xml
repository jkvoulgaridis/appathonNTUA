  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with a diagnosis of psychosis often experience low motivation and pleasure when
      thinking about doing future activities. This leads, quite understandably, to doing fewer
      activities they used to enjoy and not taking up opportunities to do new activities. One model
      suggests that this may be partly due to difficulties using memories of previous events to
      help boost motivation and anticipation before a future activity. Research shows that people
      with psychosis may recall previous events in less detail. These memories therefore may not be
      as helpful as they could be for motivation. This study will investigate this by asking people
      with experience of psychosis and low motivation who are seen by a care team in South London
      and Maudsley NHS Trust to attend two research sessions. In the first session they will be
      asked to recall memories of events from their lives and the researcher will assess how
      detailed they are and how much they refer to the past and future. Alongside this task people
      will also be asked to complete measures of symptoms such as low pleasure and motivation as
      well as a measure of depression. These will be used to find out if the detail and specificity
      of the memories are related to these symptoms in people with psychosis. The second half of
      the study will then investigate whether additional prompts to support positive memory
      retrieval can increase the specificity of this and subsequently improve mood, motivation and
      self-belief. Participants will be randomised to one of two groups. The clinical group will be
      guided through their memory recall using prompts and a control group will be asked to recall
      positive memories without prompts. If we show that supporting memory recall is beneficial
      then memories for past events may be an important target for future therapies.
