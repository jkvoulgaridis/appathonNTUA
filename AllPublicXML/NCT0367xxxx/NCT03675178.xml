      To evaluate the efficacy, safety and whether it can reduction of antibiotic use in the
      treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in children with Anerning granules combined with
      ceftriaxone sodium.In this study, a randomized, double blind, parallel control of placebo,
      multi-center clinical study will be established. According to the relevant regulations of the
      CFDA, 216 cases need to be registered at least.The aim population is children who suffering
      of community-acquired pneumonia from September 2018 to December 2019. These cases will be
      devided into treatment group（Anerning particle+ Intravenous ceftriaxone sodium）,control
      group（Anerning particle simulants+ Intravenous ceftriaxone sodium）. Each group will be
      treated for 10 days hospitalization and if there is adverse drug reaction during treatment,
      follow-up until the laboratory indicators are normal. The efficacy indicators of this study
      were mainly from three dimensions: Frequency of antibiotics at the clinical endpoint, Total
      disease efficiency, Clinical recovery time. The symptom scores changes of each group before
      and after treatment were observed.
