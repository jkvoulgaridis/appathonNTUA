  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the benefitial and harmful effects of short-term (20 weeks) compared
      to long-term (14 months) mentalization-based therapy for outpatients with subthreshold or
      diagnosed borderline personality disorder.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psychotherapy for borderline personality disorder is often lengthy and resource-intensive.
      Mentalization-based therapy is an example of an evidence-based treatment that currently has
      empirical support as an 18-months outpatient program for borderline personality disorder.
      However, this duration is rarely available, and the long and costly treatment combined with a
      highly prevalent disorder result in insufficient access to evidence-based care.

      The trial is an investigator-initiated, single-centre, assessor-blinded, randomized clinical
      superiority trial of short-term (20 weeks) compared to long-term (14 months) outpatient
      mentalization-based therapy for borderline personality disorder or subthreshold borderline
      personality disorder. Participants will be recruited from the Outpatient Clinic for
      Personality Disorders at Stolpegaard Psychotherapy Centre, Mental Health Services, Capital
      Region of Denmark. Participants will be assessed at trial intake using the Mini International
      Neuropsychiatric Interview and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Personality
      Disorders. Participants will be included if they meet a minimum of four DSM-5 criteria for
      borderline personality disorder. Participants will be assessed blind to treatment allocation
      at baseline, and at 8, 16, and 24 months after randomization.

      The primary outcome is severity of borderline symptomatology assessed using the Zanarini
      Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder interview. Secondary outcomes include
      self-harm incidents, functional impairment (Work and Social Adjustment Scale), quality of
      life (Short-Form Health Survey), and global functioning (Global Assessment of Functioning
      scale). Psychiatric symptoms (Symptom Checklist 90) will be included as an exploratory
      outcome. Measures of personality functioning, attachment, group alliance, borderline symptoms
      and mentalization skills will be included as predictor and mediator variables.

    <measure>Change in severity of borderline personality disorder assessed with the Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder (ZAN-BPD) interview</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, and at 8, 16 and 24 months post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>ZAN-BPD is an investigator-administered interview assessing change in severity of borderline personality disorder over time. Each of the nine DSM-5 criteria for borderline personality disorder are rated on a scale from 0-4, where 4 is the most severe, yielding a total score from 0-36.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in functional impairmment assessed with the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, and at 8, 16 and 24 months post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>WSAS is a 5-item questionnaire assessing change in functional impairment. Each item is rated on a scale from 0-8, where 0 is no impairment and 8 is severe impairment, yielding a total score between 0-40.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life assessed with the Short-Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, and at 8, 16 and 24 months post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a questionnaire assessing change in self-reported quality of life over time. The instrument measures eight health dimensions: physical function (PF), role physical (RF), bodily pain (BP), social function (SF) role emotional (RE), general health (GH), vitality (VT) and mental health (MH). The questions related to each dimension are scored on a scale from 0 (worst score) to 100 (best score).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in global functioning assessed with the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, and at 8, 16 and 24 months post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>GAF is an investigator-administered rating of change in global functioning over time. Global funtioning is rated on a scale from 0-100 for both symptomatic and functional impairment, yielding two total scores from 0-100, where 100 is no impaitment and 0 is severe impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in amount of self-harm incidents</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, and at 8, 16 and 24 months post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of participants with severe self-harm defined as deliberate acts of self-harm resulting in visible tissue damage - data will be collected as both dichotomous data and count data.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in psychiatric symptom distress assessed with the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, and at 8, 16 and 24 months post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>SCL-90 is a questionnaire assessing change in psychiatric symptom distress over time. All 90 items are rated on a scale from 0-4. The total score is divided by number of items, yielding a total score on the Global Severity Index ranging from 0 to 4, where 4 is the most severe.</description>
