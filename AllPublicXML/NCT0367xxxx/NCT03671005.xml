  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single-centered randomized controlled trial with a parallel-groups design is utilized,
      comprised of mindfulness-based group therapy (MBGT) in the experimental condition, and
      treatment as usual (TAU) in the control condition. Participants in the experimental condition
      continued their regular psychiatric treatment (TAU) next to the participation in the MBGT. In
      order to evaluate possible psychotherapeutic effects, self-report and other clinical
      questionnaires including interviews and app-based assessments are evaluated before (T0), and
      after the four-week intervention (T1).

      Ward psychiatrists identify eligible participants and invite them to participate in the
      study. An eligibility screening is held by the study assistant at baseline, introducing the
      study, providing informed consent in written form, as well as conducting the self-report
      measures and app-based assessments. A blinded psychiatrist who works independently of the
      (co-) therapist conducts the remaining rater-questionnaires. Due to the psychotherapeutic
      nature of the study, information about the treatment allocation had to be shared with the
      co-therapist and the participants. Randomization was conducted by the Random Group Generator
      (pubmed, 2018). The data management plan includes standard procedures for data-handling such
      as using anonymized identification codes for patient data. The participants have the right to
      access their data, and the right to claim an annihilation. The data is being stored in locked
      cupboards, only allowing researchers involved in the study to access the data.

    <description>The mindfulness-based group therapy (MBGT) involves a four-week manual with three group therapy sessions per week in addition to TAU. The therapy represents the first German group-based mindfulness manual for psychosis. One sixty-minute session was held by a certified psychotherapist who is experienced in mindfulness-based therapy. A trained co-therapist implements two 30-minute sessions. On a weekly basis, a new theme is discussed in the three sessions to ensure the internalization of different mindfulness concepts. Namely, the topics Mindfulness of the Breath (1), Mindfulness of the Senses in the Context of Nature (2), Mindfulness of Detachment (3), and Mindfulness in the Context of Bodily Awareness (4) are addressed during the group-sessions.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Treatment as usual (TAU) at the ward consists of a variety of daily activity groups the patients can choose from. Every patient at the ward receives a daily schedule depending on individual needs for therapy. The therapies offered at the ward include occupational therapy, physiotherapy, psychoeducative groups, and concentration practice of two levels, all not related to mindfulness interventions. In addition to the group activities at the ward, every patient receives individual psychotherapy sessions at least once a week, held by a certified psychiatrist or psychologist. Psychopharmacological treatment is provided by the physicians, and social workers are available in order to support patients in managing their everyday lives after the stationary treatment. Weekly group meetings at the ward, together with the treating physicians, psychotherapists, social workers and the respective patient, foster the exchange success and possible improvements of the treatment.</description>
