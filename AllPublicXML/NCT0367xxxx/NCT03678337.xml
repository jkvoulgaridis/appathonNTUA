  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, the medical management of cancer patients has considerably improved the prognosis
      of these patients and today some cancers are becoming &quot;chronic diseases&quot;. As a result, new
      adverse effects (AEs) are observed, particularly cardiac.

      These &quot;new&quot; cardiac AEs are the consequence of a significant increase in patients life
      expectancy (delayed AEs not previously seen) but also the use of new pharmacological classes
      of anticancer drugs such as kinase inhibitors. The incidence of these cardiac AEs varies
      according to the patient profile and the anticancer molecules used, but their impact on the
      morbidity and mortality of the patients is significant.

      In this context, we started at the University Hospital of Caen Normandy in September 2017 a
      cardio-oncology program entitled &quot;prevention and pharmacological management of cardiac
      adverse effects induced by drugs used in Oncology&quot; (PICARO program). This program involves
      the pharmacology department (opening of a dedicated consultation), the cardiology department
      (opening of a dedicated ultrasound consultation), vascular medicine departement (opening of a
      dedicated consultation) and the oncology federation. This program aims to be regional in the
      future. We therefore propose to build a cohort backed up to the PICARO program to assess the
      regional impact of cardiac AEs of anticancer drugs and thus to be better able to specify the
      number of AEs, the incidence and regional prevalence of these drugs. .

      The constitution of this cohort is only the first step towards the constitution in the near
      future (2 years) of an observatory and then a regional registry of cardiac AEs induced by
      anticancer drugs. The objectives associated with the establishment of such a registry would
      be to reduce the number of cardiac AEs, the hospitalizations caused by these AEs, a better
      information of health professionals and patients, an improvement in the screening of patients
      at risk, all coming back in the context of health, clinical, epidemiological and
      pharmacological surveillance.
