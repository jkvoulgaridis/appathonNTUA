  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a
      group-based yoga intervention to decrease the frequency and impact of urinary incontinence in
      ambulatory middle-aged and older women and explore potential mediators of improvement in
      outcomes. Women aged 45 years and older who report daily or more frequent stress-, urgency-,
      or mixed-type incontinence, are not already engaged in formal yoga or muscle
      stretching/strengthening programs, are willing to temporarily forgo other clinical treatments
      for incontinence, are able to walk to and use the bathroom without assistance, and meet other
      eligibility criteria will be recruited from multiple locations surrounding the San Francisco
      Bay area.

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived stress will be measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), a 10-item measure of thoughts and feelings related to perceived stress in the past month, validated in a probability sample of the United States.
