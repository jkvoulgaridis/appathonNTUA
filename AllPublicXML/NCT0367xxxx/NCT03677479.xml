  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alveolar ridge preservation following tooth extraction has the ability to maintain the ridge
      dimensions and allow the implant placement in an ideal position fulfilling both functional
      and aesthetic results. Postextraction socket healing commonly results in resorption of the
      alveolar ridge.

      To prevent this clinical situation, different authors have described several surgical
      procedures, ranging from regenerative techniques for socket preservation to immediate implant
      placement. Regenerative techniques have been widely tested in controlled and uncontrolled
      studies with various materials and clinical approaches: bone grafting alone, including
      autografts, allografts, xenografts, and alloplasts; membrane alone, whether absorbable or
      not; and membrane in conjunction with grafting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Various classic studies in the 1960s showed that the resorption process of the postextraction
      alveolus in both jaws was significantly more pronounced on the buccal aspect. This comes as
      no surprise, as the buccal surface of the anterior alveolar ridge is commonly thin and
      fragile. The maxilla tends to exhibit greater reductions in width than in height. The loss of
      tissue contour takes place mostly during the first 1 to 3 months following tooth extraction.
      Because the healing patterns of human sockets are unpredictable architecture), then such
      common procedures as extractions may lead to intraoral situations in which the remaining
      healed ridge does not allow for an esthetic and functional solution without the aid of
      significant bone grafting.
