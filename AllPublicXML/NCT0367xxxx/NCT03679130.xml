  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A physically active lifestyle during pregnancy has potential to improve maternal and child
      health. However, less than four out of ten Danish pregnant women succeed to achieve 30
      minutes of daily physical activity at moderate intensity as recommended by the Danish Health
      Authorities. This project investigates how to implement physical activity in pregnant womenÂ´s
      everyday life by testing the efficacy of two very different exercise programs on physical
      activity level during pregnancy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low levels of physical activity during pregnancy constitute a significant public health issue
      as increasing evidence suggests that the mother's lifestyle during pregnancy may influence
      the future health of her child. A physically active lifestyle during pregnancy has potential
      to improve metabolic health of mother and child and thus may play an important role in
      relation to counteracting the obesity epidemic and the increasing incidence of metabolic
      diseases that escalates globally.

      However, less than four out of ten Danish pregnant women succeed to achieve 30 minutes of
      daily physical activity at moderate intensity as recommended by the Danish Health
      Authorities. The key gap in evidence and practice towards tackling the significant public
      health issue of being physically inactive during pregnancy is lack of evidence of how
      physical activity can be implemented. Only very few and scattered regional or municipal
      physical activity initiatives are currently targeting Danish pregnant women, and these are
      mainly targeted overweight women. Implementing and validating means to empower the pregnant
      women to be physically active have the potential to establish the norm of being physically
      active during pregnancy and might halt the negative spiral effect of physical inactivity,
      obesity and metabolic diseases that escalates globally.

      The aim of FitMum RCT is to evaluate the effects of structured supervised exercise training
      and motivational counseling supported by health technology on physical activity level during
      pregnancy. The two exercise programs are designed to meet the motivators and overcome the
      specific barriers for physical activity among pregnant women. The programs will be tested in
      a three-armed randomized controlled trial including 220 healthy, physically inactive,
      pregnant women.

      FitMum is carried out in collaboration between University of Copenhagen, Nordsjaellands
      Hospital, Technical University of Denmark, Aarhus University and international researchers.

    <intervention_model_description>FitMum RCT is designed as an open-labeled single-site three-arm randomized controlled trial, including 220 pregnant women no later than gestational age week 15+0 days. Included women will be randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive a structured supervised exercise training (EXE) intervention, receive a motivational counseling intervention supported by health technology (MOT), or a control group receiving standard treatment (CON), respectively. The participants in the EXE and MOT groups continue in the physical activity intervention as long as their pregnancy allows and ideally until delivery, in total approximately six months. Collection of data for assessment of the primary outcome will take place from randomization (one week after inclusion) to GA week 28+0-6 and will be measured by a commercial activity tracker. Secondary outcomes will be examined at Nordsjaellands Hospital five times during the study period. Time frames and methods for assessment of outcomes are specified below.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Physical activity level from randomization to GA week 28+0-6 determined by a wrist-worn activity tracker, Garmin Vivosport, with built-in heart rate monitor and accelerometer. The activity tracker is to be worn continuously by the women from inclusion until delivery. After inclusion baseline physical activity level will be measured for one week, followed by randomization to one of the three study groups and continuous monitoring of physical activity level by the activity tracker. Preferably, the activity tracker is also worn continuously from delivery and one year ahead. The activity tracker determines the frequency, duration and intensity of activity periods on a minute-to-minute basis and data from the activity tracker is wirelessly synced to its associated smartphone application, Garmin Connect, and research platform, Fitabase.</description>
