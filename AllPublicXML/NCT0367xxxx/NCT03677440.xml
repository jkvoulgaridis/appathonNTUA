  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment is highly prevalent, poorly-managed, and disabling in persons with MS
      and exercise training might represent a promising approach to manage this symptom of the
      disease. The proposed study aims to examine the effects of 3-months of supervised,
      progressive (both intensity and duration) treadmill walking exercise training (designed based
      on pilot work and American College of Sports Medicine guidelines) compared with an active
      control condition (i.e., stretching-and-toning activities) on cognitive processing speed and
      functional MRI outcomes in 88 cognitively-impaired persons with MS. This study is critical
      for providing evidence supporting treadmill walking exercise training as a behavioral
      approach for managing slowed cognitive processing speed (i.e., the most common MS-related
      cognitive impairment) and improving brain health in persons with MS.

    <description>This condition will include 3-months of supervised, progressive light, moderate, and vigorous intensity treadmill walking exercise training based on ACSM guidelines for maximizing adaptations with exercise training. Exercise intensities will be prescribed based on percent oxygen consumption reserve (% VO2R) using values derived from the baseline graded exercise test.
The exercise training itself will be led by trained exercise leaders who are not involved in the collection of outcome assessments. At the outset of each session, participants will be fitted with a Polar HR Monitor (Oy, Finland), and HR will be monitored continuously throughout each session. Each session will begin with a 5-10 min warm-up, followed by the exercise; the target heart rate reserve (HRR) range associated with the VO2R range will be maintained for as long as possible during each exercise period. This will be followed by a 5-10 min cool-down.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The active, non-aerobic exercise condition will involve stretching-and-toning activities using the same frequency and duration of the treadmill walking exercise condition. These activities will be based on a manual provided by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and sessions will be led by trained exercise leaders who are not involved in the collection of outcome assessments. Activities will target the head/neck, shoulder, elbow/forearm, hand/wrist, trunk/hip, ankle/foot. The progression of activities over the 3-month period will involve performing additional exercises and sets along with using progressively thicker elastic resistance bands that provide minimal resistance. Each session is designed to last up to 60 minutes in total. Each session will begin with a warm-up of up to 10 minutes, followed by stretching-and-toning (following the same duration as the treadmill walking exercise training condition) activities, and a cool-down of up to 10 minutes.</description>
