  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study highlights the global management of the various components of outpatient pain by
      hypnoanalgesia (pain management by hypnosis) in radiopediatrics.

      Indeed, pain is induced by sclerosis of cutaneous angiomas in interventional radiology. It is
      managed by MEOPA (an equimolar mixture of oxygen nitrous oxide) or by general anesthesia.

      For four years, the medical electroradiology technologist of the Mother and Child Hospital
      (HFME) of the Hospices Civils de Lyon offer patients in addition a pain management by
      hypnoanalgesia.

      The investigator propose a multicenter open randomized study comparing two pain management
      strategies, in children aged 7 to 18 years treated for cutaneous angioma by sclerosis in
      interventional radiology at the HFME. The two strategies studied are: Hypnoanalgesia and
      MEOPA (the reference strategy).

      The main objective is to evaluate the efficacy of hypnoanalgesia compared to the standard of
      care of pain, which is the use of MEOPA, in the treatment of sclerosis of cutaneous angioma
      in pediatric interventional radiology.

    <description>The running of a hypnosis session is protocolized and is based on three times:
The hypnotic induction time that allows to move from the state of consciousness to a modified state of consciousness: it will be adapted according to the patient as specified by the procedure of Ericksonian hypnosis. It varies from a few seconds to 10 minutes. Induction time depends on the patient's level of stress, apprehension, subsequent experiences of hospitalization, history, and level of hypnotizability.
The dissociation time. It is the state of modified consciousness obtained at the end of the induction which is prolonged,
The time of &quot;return&quot;. It is time that allows the patient to regain his classic state of consciousness.</description>

    <description>The pain management will be done exclusively by a mask delivering the equimolecular mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide (MEOPA) throughout the procedure.
For optimal use, the beginning of its administration by the radiological technologist is performed 3 minutes before the sclerosant injection (at the end of the locating ultrasound). The end of administration will correspond to the end of the injections of the sclerosing product. These sclerosing products are not considered experimental or ancillary products in this study.</description>
