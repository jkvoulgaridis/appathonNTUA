  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As core stability improves in handball players, ball-throwing speed increases as well.
      Postural stability is considered as the most important component of athletic performance as
      it occurs in almost all movement types. No studies have yet evaluated postural stability,
      performance and trunk muscle endurance in female athletes at the same time and examined the
      relationship between these parameters.This study aims to identify the relationship between
      the postural stability, performance and trunk muscle endurance of female athletes in
      different branches of sports.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 45 female athletes (15 volleyball, 15 handball, and 15 football players) (average
      age: 22,26 ± 6,43 / BMI: 21,45 ± 2,39) and 15 sedentary females (average age: 24,86 ± 3,02 /
      BMI: 21,42 ± 1,90) participated in the study. Trunk muscle endurance of the participants was
      measured with the McGill core endurance tests and the prone bridge test. Postural stability
      of the participants was evaluated using Biodex Biosway Portable Balance System (950- 460 USA)
      device. Sportive performance was tested with the vertical jump test and the hexagonal
      obstacle test.
