  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On of the main fixed prosthetic options of completely edentulous patients is the
      screw-retained implant supported prosthesis which was constructed on transmucosal abutments
      with its encountered problems such as: hardness to make it passively seated with multiple
      screw fracture and loosening problems and multiple encountered veneer material fracture and
      so there effect on patient satisfaction with multiple maintenance recalls.so, we want to try
      a new technique of fabrication which was proposed for reducing the problems of lack of
      passivity which is the intraoral luting cement technique on titanium bases with reduced screw
      number but, with luting cement problems as de-cementation and cement biological effects on
      soft tissues and bone and there effect on number of patient recall visits and maintenance and
      so there effect on patient satisfaction.
