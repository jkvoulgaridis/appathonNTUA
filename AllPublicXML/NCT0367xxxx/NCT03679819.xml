      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of HR-TRUS in detection of
      prostate cancer lesions relative to whole mount section after radical prostatectomy as the
      reference. The analysis will include the detection of all prostate cancer lesions as well as
      the detection of significant prostate cancer lesions. With this approach it is possible to
      calculate the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value
      and overall accuracy of the correct detection of prostate cancer in the prostate. These
      results are of importance when the ExactVu ultrasound scanner is to be used later for
      prostate cancer diagnosis using targeted biopsies.

    <description>Medical procedures to be performed in the study consist of subject preparation and prostate imaging. The HR-TRUS exam will be done with a transrectal probe either the day before surgery, or in the OR right before surgery. The exam will be done in the same manner as during a regular transrectal ultrasound exam and no invasive procedures will be associated.</description>
