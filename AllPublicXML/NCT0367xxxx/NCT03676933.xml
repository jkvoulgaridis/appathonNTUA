    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the steroid sparing potential of DS107E to vehicle in patients
      with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.

      DS107E or vehicle will be topically administered with a steroid twice a day for the first 7
      days. For the following 56 days DS107E or vehicle will be topically administered twice a day.

      This study will enrol approximately 40 paediatric patients.

      Patients will come to the clinic on 8 occasions: Screening, Baseline, Day 7, Day 21, Day 35,
      Day 49, Day 63 (End of Treatment) and Day 91 (Follow-up). The primary efficacy variables will
      be IGA (Investigator Global Assessment) and SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis) .

      The secondary efficacy variables will be IGA, SCORAD, EASI (Eczema Area and Severity Index),
      IDQOL (Infant Dermatology Quality of Life), DFI (Dermatitis Family Impact), BSA, TEWL
      (Transepidermal Water Loss) and Time to Rescue Medication.

          1. Female and male infants aged 3-12 months.

          2. Diagnosis of atopic dermatitis according to the Hanifin and Rajka Criteria.

          3. Patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (IGA ≥3)

          4. Patients with atopic dermatitis covering a minimum of 10% of the body surface area at
             baseline.

          5. Atopic Dermatitis is stable for the past 7 days, in the opinion of the investigator.

          6. The patient's parents are able to apply the study product twice a day (each morning

             (including the tolerability patch test performed at the Screening Visit) or
             intolerance to any ingredient in Locoid® Ointment (hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1%).

          7. Use of systemic treatments that could affect atopic dermatitis less than 4 weeks prior
             to Baseline Visit (Day 0), e.g. oral corticosteroids; Intranasal corticosteroids and
             inhaled corticosteroids for stable medical conditions are allowed.

          8. Treatment with any experimental drug within 30 days prior to Day 0 Visit (Baseline),
             or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer).

          9. Excessive sun exposure or other ultraviolet (UV) light sources 4 weeks prior to Day 0
             Visit (Baseline) and/or is planning a trip to sunny climate or other UV sources
             between screening and follow-up visits.

         10. Use of any topical medicated treatment for atopic dermatitis 2 weeks prior to start of
             treatment/Day 0 Visit (Baseline), including but not limited to topical
             corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, tars, bleach, antimicrobials and bleach
             baths.

         11. Use of topical products containing ceramides 2 weeks prior to Day 0.

             infection with human immunodeficiency virus).
