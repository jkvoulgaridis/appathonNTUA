    <textblock>
      The purpose of this single arm intervention study is to determine if the fall rate (as
      measured by falls per 1000 patient days) for patients designated &quot;high fall risk&quot; decreases
      with the use of the PUP™ [Patient is UP Falls Prevention System] when compared to the
      historical falls rate data for the prior 12 months from those same nursing units within the
      OSUWM Brain &amp; Spine Hospital.

      The purpose of this single arm intervention study is to determine if the fall rate (as
      measured by falls per 1000 patient days) for patients designated &quot;high fall risk&quot; decreases
      with the use of the PUP™ [Patient is UP Falls Prevention System] when compared to the
      historical falls rate data for the prior 12 months from those same nursing units within the
      OSUWM Brain &amp; Spine Hospital. All Brain and Spine Hospital patients will be evaluated as to
      fall risk using the current fall risk assessment tool employed by OSU Medical Center and
      administered in the usual and customary fashion upon evaluation on the floor and Pod.
      Patients who are determined to be at a high fall risk will be approached to participate.
      Those patients who consent to participate in the study will remain in the study until a nurse
      removes the patient from high risk fall status or the participant has been discharged from
      the hospital. Any patient fall will to be reported and evaluated following current processes
      and procedures developed by the OSU Brain and Spine Institute as maintained with IHIS; the
      PUP™ as the intervention for this study will be an adjunct to those fall prevention processes
      already in place.

    <description>The Study site, the OSU Wexner Center Brain and Spine Hospital, is located on three contiguous floors with each floor being made up of two units or Pods designated East and South. Following commencement of the study, and throughout its duration, Pods assigned to the Study will only utilize the Palarum Fall Prevention System and a monitored PUP™ sock, i.e., (Patient is Up) System as the standard of care intervention for fall prevention in accordance with its operating instructions and procedures.</description>

    <description>The Palarum Fall Prevention System that includes the PUP™ (Patient is Up) System, is made upon of seven tangible elements: an inpatient room Android tablet (IRT), a nurse station Android monitor (HUC), a local server (PLS), a cloud server (PCS), a Bluetooth Low Energy beacon(s), an Android smart watch, and an e-textile sock connected sensor transmitter (PUP™ sock). The PUP™ sock monitors and transmits pressure, force, acceleration and motion data.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 years of age or older;

          -  All high-risk fall patients, eighteen years of age or older, who are admitted to the
             OSU Brain and Spine Hospital on Floors 8 South, 9 South, 10 South, 8 East, 9 East or
             10 East. Patients will undergo a pre-assessment as per OSUWMC procedure to determine
             if they are a high-fall risk.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients whose medical condition as assessed by the PI prohibits their participation
             in the program, which would include among others the following: patients who lack the
             capacity to consent, patients with an anatomy or wound issue on their feet or around
             their calves that would bar them from wearing socks on either foot, and/or patients
             for whom the sock would impede medical treatment.
