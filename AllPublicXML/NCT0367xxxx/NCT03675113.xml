  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a cardiac structural or functional disorder that, despite normal filling
      pressures, leads to inability to deliver enough oxygen to meet the metabolic needs o tissue.
      Heart failure is a serious chronic condition that affects a large proportion of the adult
      population in the world causing high mortality, leading to exercise intolerance and reduced
      health-related quality of life. Patients included in the cardiac rehabilitation program slow
      down disease progression, hospitalization decreases, quality of life improves and health
      expenditures decrease. Despite the frequent use of upper extremities in daily living
      activities, studies investigating the effect of upper extremity aerobic training on daily
      living activities, functional exercise capacity and other outcomes are limited. No studies
      have investigated the effect of upper extremity aerobic exercise training on physical
      activity level, functional and maximal exercise capacity and other measures in patients with
      heart failure.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been reported that exercise capacity in peak arm exercise is almost 30% lower in heart
      failure patients. For this reason intolerance to arm exercise is a significant problem in
      heart failure patients and may contribute to a decrease in performance in activities of daily
      living. Considering the fact that developments in these patients are caused by vasculature
      functional adaptation the extremity skeletal muscle and applied limbs, upper extremity
      exercises may be useful to reduce exercise intolerance during activities requiring continuous
      arm movement.

    <description>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (Turkish version) (PSQI) is a self-reported questionnaire. PSQI evaluates patients' sleep quality. The scale includes 24 questions overall, with 19 questions answered by the person him/ herself and the remaining 5 answered by his/her bed partner or roommate. The first 19 self-answered questions evaluate 7 subscales, subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, duration of sleep, routine sleep activity, sleep disorders, the use of drugs for sleeping, and daytime dysfunction. Each item in the scale is scored between 0 and 3 (no difficulty to severe difficulty). The sum of the 7 subscale scores gives the overall PSQI score. Lower scores show better sleep quality.</description>
