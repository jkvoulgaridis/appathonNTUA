      MTN-035 is a multi-site, randomized-sequence, three-period, open label crossover study that
      will enroll approximately 210 participants randomized (1:1:1:1:1:1) to one of six sequences
      of rectal microbicide placebo product application. At the start of each 4-week product use
      period, participants will receive either rectal inserts, rectal douches, or rectal
      suppositories and be instructed to use their assigned study product prior to each receptive
      anal intercourse (RAI) encounter during that period. Participants who do not have RAI in a
      given week will be asked to use the product without sex. There will be a 1-week washout
      period between each of the three product use periods. Participant follow-up will take
      approximately 3.5 months.

             unknown ART use status (by self report).

          8. In the month prior to Enrollment, participant engagement in condomless RAI or RVI
             while not on PrEP with a partner who is of unknown HIV status and unknown PrEP/ART use
             status (by self-report).

          9. Non-therapeutic injection drug use in the 12 months prior to Enrollment.

         10. At either Screening or Enrollment, participant-reported symptoms and/or clinical or
             laboratory diagnosis of active anorectal or reproductive tract infection (RTI)
             requiring treatment per current WHO guidelines (http://www.who.int/hiv/
             pub/sti/pub6/en/), or symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI). Infections requiring
             treatment include: Neisseria gonorrhea (GC), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), syphilis,
             active herpes simplex virus (HSV) lesions, anogenital sores or ulcers, or symptomatic

             treatment per current WHO guidelines may be retested during the screening process and

             participant may be enrolled.

             Note: HSV-1 or HSV-2 seropositive diagnosis with no active lesions is permitted since
             treatment is not required.

             Enrollment or planning to become pregnant during study participation.

             Screening.

         13. Has any other condition that, in the opinion of the IoR/designee, would preclude
