      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate changes in subject performance on social
      skills assessments after engaging in a gaze-controlled video game that leverages ABA
      principles of learning, in comparison to an alternative game. The secondary objectives of
      this study are to evaluate changes in subject gaze patterns during social skills assessments
      after engaging in the video game, including in comparison to an alternative game and to
      evaluate possible correlations in changes in social skills assessments with changes in
      subject game play performance.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Ages 4-14.

          2. Meets diagnostic criteria for ASD.

          3. Estimated intelligence standard score of at least 40 (can be substituted for a
             receptive language score such as PPVT or use of the Differential Ability Scales, 2nd
             Edition (DAS-II)).

          4. Parent reports difficulty with at least one of two social skills (via modified
             questions from the Social Responsiveness Scale)

          5. English as the child's primary/first language (key measures used in the study do not
             have alternate language versions).

          6. Attains a score equal to or less than 75% correct on the Ekman 60 Faces Test

          7. The parent who completes the questionnaires needs to be proficient in English.

          8. Has successfully played a video game using a Microsoft Xbox game controller, Sony
             PlayStation game controller, or other comparable game controller.

          9. Parental/guardian permission (informed consent) and if appropriate, child assent.

         10. Wi-Fi internet connection at subject's home/school/therapy center/research
             organization available for use by study laptop computer.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of seizures.

          2. History of traumatic brain injury or other significant medical or neurological
             abnormality affecting motor or higher cortical functioning.

          3. Certain visual, auditory, DSM 5, or conduct disorders (see below).

          4. A visual disorder that cannot be corrected through the use of corrective lenses to a
             level of 20-40 in both eyes.

          5. Use of corrective visual lenses that would significantly impede the valid collection
             of visual attention and gaze pattern data during dyadic interaction tasks.

          6. Auditory impairment (that cannot be corrected by a hearing aid) that would
             significantly impede the valid collection of test measures.

          7. Profound intellectual disability or sensory-motor difficulties that would preclude
             valid use of diagnostic instruments and/or use of a computer or mobile computing
             device.

          8. A DSM 5 disorder or other psychiatric symptoms that would interfere with the
             participant's ability to participate in the study (e.g., active psychosis), per parent
             report.

          9. History of one or more psychiatric hospitalizations.

         10. Presence of significant symptoms of a conduct disorder.
