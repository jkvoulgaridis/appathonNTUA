      The purpose of this study is to obtain ovarian tissue from female patients undergoing
      gonadotoxic treatments or gonadal ablating surgery, and that in consequence may see their
      future fertility impaired. Participants will be offered to preserve (freeze) and use ovarian
      tissue for the purpose of conceiving in the future.

      Although, 86 live births have been reported with ovarian tissue cryo-preservation and
      grafting, the procedure is still considered experimental.

      This research, will help us to learn and validate how to perform ovarian tissue
      cryo-preservation and thawing in the fertility preservation context.

      his Study will conducted at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Ste-Justine Collected
      ovarian tissue will only be for the patients own use.

      Subjects will undergo surgical removal of their ovarian tissue, and the following categories
      will be invited to participate:

        1. Patients have elected to have one or both ovaries removed for the treatment or
           prevention of disease.

        2. Patients who have elected to have surgery to remove all or part of one or both ovaries
           for medical reasons where cryopreservation of the remaining limited portions of normal
           ovarian cortex is the only option for fertility preservation at the time (except that
           ovarian cortex from the ovary that contains the mass will not be cryopreserved).

        3. Participants who have elected to have one or part of one ovary removed, solely for the
           purpose of fertility preservation because they are not candies to use standard fertility
           preservation technologies.

      If the subject chooses to participate and consent, she will be assessed to determine her
      eligibility The subject will also have a serum AMH drawn for the evaluation of the ovarian
      reserve, and also infectious disease testing will also be performed per Health Canada
      guidelines.

      The oophorectomie will be performed laparoscopically under general anesthesia. In patients'
      in whom it is medically unsafe or not feasible to complete the surgery laparoscopically, the
      patient and/or legal gardian may opt to proceed with a mini-laparotomy or laparotomy approach
      or may opt to stop the procedure and withdraw from the study at that time. This decision will
      be discussed with the patient and legal gardian during the consenting process and documented
      prior to the surgery. The procedural risk and treatment delays will be discussed with the
      primary treatment team in order to provide a better evaluation of the patients wellbeing.
      This procedure is performed for fertility preservation purposes only, but can potentially be
      coordinated with another procedure such as placement of a central line for future
      chemotherapy. In the event the subject is undergoing a surgical intervention for other
      indications, the oophorectomies could be coordinated at the same time.

      A tissu sample will be evaluated by pathology for routine histologic evaluation. If the
      pathologist finds evidence of neoplasia in the ovarian tissue sample. All the tissue could be
      send to pathology for a more detailed examination. In this case, there will be no tissue
      available for the subject to use for fertility preservation.

      Cryopreservation :

      Ovarian tissue preparation:

        1. Ovarian tissue will be transported from the operating room at the CHU Sainte-Justine to
           the Embryology laboratory at the REI department in a modified HTF supplemented with 10%
           supplement serum substitute (9922 SSS; Irvine Scientifc, Santa Ana, CA, USA) and deposed
           in a heated trait at 37 °C.

        2. The ovarian cortex will be separated from the medulla and cut in tissue bands (0.5-1 x
           0.5- 1cm, 1-2 mm)

        3. Tissue washing with TCM 199 (Life technologies, Foster City, CA, USA) supplemented with
           20% (v/v) SSS (milieu WS) and then exposed to three different vitrification solutions at
           room temperature.

      Vitrification:

        1. Ovarian tissue equilibration in TCM199 avec 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol (EG, Wako Pure
           Chemical Industries, Tokyo, Japan) et 20% (v/v) SSS for 5 minutes.

        2. Ovarian tissue equilibration in TCM199 with 20%(v/v) EG and 20% (v/v) SSS for 5 minutes.

        3. Ovarian tissue equilibration in TCM199 avec 35%(v/v) EG, 5% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone
           (sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) et 0.5 mol/l sucrose (Wako Pure Chemical industries)
           for 5 minutes.

        4. Ovarian tissue bands will be installed on&quot; Cryosupport &quot; (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA,
           USA) before immersion in liquid nitrogen.

        5. Ovarian tissue bands will be stored in a cryo vial at -196°C.

      The ovarian tissue bio-bank is located at the embryology laboratory in the REI department at
      the CHU Ste-Justine

      Infectious disease screening:

      As per Health Canada guidelines, patients will be screened for (VIH, VDRL, HBsAg, anti
      Hepatitis C, HTLV).

      Study and safety data collection:

      Adverse events after an elective oophorectomy will be identified according to the Health
      Canada criteria (www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/advisories-avis/reaction-eng.php#Drugs).

      Data Collection :

        1. Date of fertility preservation

             1. Intervention type

             2. Age

             3. Age at diagnosis

             4. Age at menarche

        2. Diagnosis

        3. Outcome: remission, relapse, or death

        4. Gynaecological history

        5. Obstetrical and neonatal outcomes

        6. Treatment regimen associated with high risk of sterility

        7. Choices regarding use of cryopreserved stored tissue for fertility restoration Fertility
           preservation outcome

      Risks:

      The potential risks of laparoscopy, laparotomy, and oophorectomy include injury to bowel,
      bladder, and blood vessels with need for subsequent repair. The chance of the subject
      requiring hospitalization for complication(s) is about 1%. In addition to the surgical risk,
      there are also inherent risks of general anesthesia. The subject's chance of dying from
      anesthesia is less than 1 in 10,000. The risk of injury with laparotomy is moderate. The
      subject, legal guardian, and/or parent(s) will be asked to sign the standard consent form for
      laparoscopy, and/or laparotomy and oophorectomy after the risks and benefits have been
      discussed. The subject, legal guardian(s), and/or parent(s) will also be asked by the
      anesthesiology team to sign an anesthesia consent form after risks and benefits have been
      discussed.

      There is a risk that the ovary to be cryopreserved may be affected by cancer, disqualifying
      the subject from ovarian tissue freezing. Although care will be taken, damage to the removed
      ovarian tissue may occur during any part of the cryopreservation, shipping or storage
      process. The effects of cryopreservation and long term storage on human ovarian tissues are
      not known and possible damage to the tissues may occur; in this instance a future pregnancy
      may not occur. The birth defect(s) and/or genetic damage to any child who may be born
      following ovarian tissue cryopreservation procedure are also unknown. However, thousands of
      children have been born worldwide from frozen embryos and eggs and there has been no report
      of increased risk of birth defects in these children.

      Benefits:

      The patient participation in the study protocol may provide her with a means to restore her
      fertility and reproductive hormonal function. However, However, there is a significant
      possibility that there may be no direct benefit due to no utilization of the ovarian tissue,
      or that the ovarian tissue may not result in any live brith.

      Costs: All expenses related to this procedure will be covered by the &quot;Régie s'Assurance du
      Québec&quot;. Tissue storage is also covered for a period of five years.
