  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this collaborative research program is to develop, validate and translate
      advanced quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) biomarkers of obesity-associated non-alcoholic
      fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This protocol represents the research plan for two distinct
      phases. The first phase is an optimization phase. The second phase is designed to complete a
      rigorous test of conventional and advanced MRE techniques. Complementary anthropometric,
      laboratory, and MR measures will also be collected to characterize the cohort and identify
      factors that affect MRE performance

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-term objective of this research is to improve the health of the millions of
      Americans with or at risk for NAFLD, the most common chronic liver disease and most rapidly
      growing indication for liver transplantation in the United States. To achieve this objective,
      an advanced MR-based imaging method will be used to measure liver &quot;stiffness&quot; which is an
      early sign of disease. This technique has been previously developed and validated and ready
      to be used for further research. This current protocol will extend previous work by
      optimizing and validating advanced 2 dimensional and 3 dimensional-magnetic resonance
      elastography (MRE) methods as non-invasive biomarkers of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in
      obese patients at risk for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the histologically more
      aggressive subset of NAFLD.
