  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A comparative randomized intervention study is presented between a mixed strategy of use of
      bee wax mammary areolae. Together with the health education program for the promotion of
      breastfeeding by the WHO and another educational program with the aim of improving the
      adherence of breastfeeding to primiparous women. The use of both interventions can contribute
      to the adherence to exclusive maternity in 20% in the first 6 months of life, than only with
      the educational program.

      The study provides evidence of nursing practice, thus contributing to the improvement of
      nursing mothers in the prevention of lesions in the nipple and care in them if they occur.
      Consequently, improve the rates of successful breastfeeding, as well as the quality of life
      of breastfeeding mothers. The study will be carried out with several groups of midwives in
      Health Centers, in Spain, Colombia and Mexico. The sample was calculated in 240 women who
      attend the midwife's controls between week 29 and 40.

The product to be valued are mammary areolae made by hand with organic beeswax. Despite its honey aroma, it does not contain honey. The wax used for the manufacture of the areolae is operculum. This wax is used and not another because it avoids possible residues and allergies that may contain other types of waxes. The operculum wax is used as a thickener in pharmacy and cosmetic products as a fat base in ointments and creams.</description>
