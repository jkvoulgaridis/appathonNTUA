      This pilot trial studies how well a resistance training program and cardiovascular exercise
      work in increasing muscle mass in adolescent and young adult stem cell transplant survivors.
      Resistance training and cardiovascular exercise may increase physical activity, muscular
      strength and improve lean body mass which is beneficial to improving the overall health of
      stem cell transplant survivors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the feasibility of a 12-week resistance training (RT) intervention in adolescent
      and young adult (AYA) hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) survivors starting +100 days
      post-HCT.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine the change from baseline of a RT intervention on muscle strength and body
      composition at day +200 and day +365.

      II. Determine the effectiveness of RT exercise on improving the cardio-metabolic risk factor
      profile at day +200 and day +365.

      III. Determine the effectiveness of RT exercise on improving quality of life (QOL) measures.

      IV. Compare day +80 and day +365 assessments to subjects in a historical control population.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo moderately intense aerobic/cardiovascular exercise over 30-60 minutes and
      complete 1-2 sets of 8 to 10 resistance/strength training exercises, 8 to 12 repetitions of
      each exercise, 3 days per week for 12 weeks. Patients also participate in weekly phone calls
      with an exercise physiologist to ensure adherence to the program and to provide support.

      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up within 2 weeks, then at 365
      days post HCT.
