  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this pilot study is (i) to test the use of an Artificial Pancreas (AP)
      System as a viable therapy treatment for two vulnerable populations: 6 to 10 year-old and
      adults older â‰¥65 years old with T1D; (ii) to assess cognitive function in children and older
      adult patients with T1D and examine whether improved glycemic control defined by stable (more
      than 70% of the day in glycemic range 70-180 mg/dL) control positively influences cognitive
      function; and (iii) obtain preliminary data to apply to funds to continue with larger and
      longer clinical trials.

      This study will evaluate up to 15 subjects in each age group for a period of 8-10 weeks
      performing neurocognitive tests before and after each intervention. The first study phase
      will be up to 2 weeks of a training period to allow participants to get acquainted with the
      use of the CGM if they are not familiar with the use of the device. This training period will
      be followed by a 4-week sensor-augmented pump (SAP) period using a study CGM and the
      subject's personal insulin pump. The subjects will return to clinic at the completion of the
      SAP period and will be trained on the Tandem t:slim X2 with Control-IQ and G6 CGM. At the
      completion of the system training session, subjects will begin 4-weeks of Closed-Loop Control
      (CLC). Questionnaires will be completed by the study subject at screening, after completion
      of SAP and after completion of CLC. Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMAs) and actigraphy
      data will be collected in the last 14 days of the SAP and CLC periods.

      A parent/guardian of the enrolled children will also be asked to participate in all
      trainings, complete parental Patient-Report Outcomes (PRO) Questionnaires, and collect sleep
      patterns while wearing the actigraph watch.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis, based on investigator assessment, of type 1 diabetes for at least
             one year, using insulin for at least 1 year and using an insulin pump for at least 6
             months.

          -  Familiarity and use of a carbohydrate ratio for meal boluses by participants and
             families participating.

        A negative serum or urine pregnancy test will be required for all females of child-bearing
        potential. Participants who become pregnant will be discontinued from the study. Also,
        participants who during the study develop and express the intention to become pregnant

             the participant in case of an emergency.

          -  Willing to disable any automated insulin delivery functionality on a personal insulin
             pump during study, such as Medtronic 670G in auto mode. Predictive low blood glucose

          -  Investigator has confidence that the participant and family can successfully operate
             all study devices and is capable of adhering to the protocol.

          -  Willingness to switch to lispro (Humalog) or aspart (Novolog) and to use no other
             insulin besides lispro (Humalog) or aspart (Novolog) during the study.

          -  Total daily insulin dose (TDD) at least 10 U/day.

          -  Diagnosis of Diabetic Ketoacidosis in the 12 months prior to enrollment.

          -  Uncontrolled cardiac disease (e.g. recent myocardial infarction, severe congestive
             heart failure).

          -  Cerebrovascular accident in the 12 months prior to enrollment.

          -  Uncontrolled resting arterial hypertension (&gt;160/90 mm Hg).

             immobility).

          -  Current use of oral/inhaled glucocorticoids or other medications, which in the
             judgment of the investigator would be a contraindication to participation in the
             study.

          -  Concurrent use of any non-insulin glucose-lowering agent other than metformin
             (including GLP-1 agonists, pramlintide, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT-2 inhibitors,
             sulfonylureas).

          -  Hemophilia or any other bleeding disorder
