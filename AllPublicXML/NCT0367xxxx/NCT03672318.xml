  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect
      for fighting cancer. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease:
      antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from disease caused by
      bacteria or toxic substances. Antibodies work by binding those bacteria or substances, which
      stops them from growing and causing bad effects. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are
      special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or
      cells that are infected. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with
      cancers. They both have shown promise, but neither alone has been sufficient to cure most
      patients. This study is designed to combine both T cells and antibodies to create a more
      effective treatment. The treatment that is being researched is called autologous T lymphocyte
      chimeric antigen receptor cells targeted against the CD138 antigen (CAR138 T cells).

      In previous studies, it has been shown that a new gene can be put into T cells that will
      increase their ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. A gene is a unit of DNA. Genes
      make up the chemical structure carrying the patient's genetic information that may determine
      human characteristics (i.e., eye color, height and sex). The new gene that is put in the T
      cells in this study makes a piece of an antibody called anti-CD138. This antibody floats
      around in the blood and can detect and stick to cancer cells called multiple myeloma cells
      because they have a substance on the outside of the cells called CD138. Anti-CD138 antibodies
      have been used to treat people with multiple myeloma, but have not been strong enough to cure
      most patients. For this study, the anti-CD138 antibody has been changed so that instead of
      floating free in the blood part of it is now joined to the T cells. Only the part of the
      antibody that sticks to the multiple myeloma cells is attached to the T cells instead of the
      entire antibody. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric
      receptor. These CD138 chimeric (combination) receptor-activated T cells seem to kill some of
      the tumor, but they do not last very long in the body and so their chances of fighting the
      cancer are unknown.

      Cell Procurement Up to 300 mL total of peripheral blood (up to 3 collections) will be
      obtained from patients for cell procurement. In patients with a low CD3 count in the
      peripheral blood (less than 200/μl by flow cytometry), a leukopheresis may be performed to
      isolate sufficient T-cells. The parameters for pheresis will be 2 blood volumes.

      CAR138 T-cell Administration Autologous CAR138 T-cells will be administered 2-14 days
      following lymphodepletion. The lymphodepletion regimen will consist of Cyclophosphamide 300
      mg/m^2 and Fludarabine 30 mg/m^2 IV each given daily over 3 consecutive days.

      Duration of Therapy Autologous CAR138 T-cells will be administered 2-14 days following
      lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine by a licensed provider (oncology
      registered nurse or physician) via intravenous injection over 5-10 minutes through either a
      peripheral or central line. The expected volume is 1-50cc.

      Treatment with one infusion will be administered unless:

        -  The patient decides to withdraw from the study, OR

        -  General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable
           for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.

      Duration of Follow-up Patients will be followed for up to 15 years for replication-competent
      retrovirus evaluation or until death, whichever occurs first. Patients removed from study for
      unacceptable adverse events will continue follow up for evaluation of progression free
      survival, overall survival and replication-competent retrovirus monitoring.

      Patients who experience disease progression after receiving a cell infusion will still be
      required to complete abbreviated follow up procedures.

    <description>The maximum tolerated dose will be determined through assessment of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) experienced during the safety evaluation period. Severity and categorization of adverse events will be determined in accordance with the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 5.0). A DLT is defined as any of the following that may, after consultation with the FDA, be considered possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study cellular products: Grade 3 and 4 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) that persists beyond 72 hours, or any Grade 5 CRS event; Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia lasting more than 28 days from the time of CAR138 T-cell infusion. Any other ≥ Grade 3 non- hematologic toxicity (exceptions include: alopecia; grade 3 electrolyte abnormalities, hyperglycemia, diarrhea, or nausea and vomiting that can be managed with supportive care and do not persist as Grade 3 toxicities for &gt; 72 hours)).</description>

    <description>The MTD is defined as the dose at which approximately 0.20 of patients experience DLT dose escalation guided by the continual reassessment method (CRM).
Six dose levels will be evaluated:
Dose level 1: 5X10^6 cells/m^2 Dose level 2: 1X10^7 cells/m^2 Dose level 3: 2.5X10^7 cells/m^2 Dose level 4: 5X10^7 cells/m^2 Dose level 5: 1x10^8 cells/m^2 Dose level 6: 2x10^8 cells/m^2
Six patients will be enrolled at the MTD to better characterize safety at that dose level.
Cell Administration: CAR138 T cells will be given by intravenous injection over through either a peripheral or a central line.
The lymphodepletion regimen will consist of intravenous cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m^2 and fludarabine 30 mg/m^2 given once daily for three days.</description>

             contacted. In such an event, the patient may be allowed to receive lymphodepletion and
             CAR138 T-cell infusion if it is felt to be in the patient's best interests. The
             patient would not be evaluable for response (disease not measurable) but would be
             evaluable for all other safety and efficacy measures.
