      Drug of investigation: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), given orally as a tablet twice daily.

      Dosage of drug: This study recruits patients who have been prescribed a steady dose of MMF in
      the range between 1000 and 3000 mg daily by their physician.

      Design: This is an open-label PK study.

      Disease studied: Systemic sclerosis (SSC, scleroderma).

      Variables assessed: Estimated AUC0-12 for MMF. Gastrointestinal manifestations of SSc.
      Concomitant medication.

      Study population:

      Inclusion criteria: Diagnosis of SSC fulfilling the 2013 classification criteria for this
      disease. Participant should have been prescribed a stable dose of MMF tablets, taken twice
      daily, for at least 3 months prior to the study.

      Exclusion criteria: Failure to comply with study protocol. Limited access to repeated venous
      puncture. Recipient of organ transplant. Pulmonary arterial hypertension.

      Number of participants: The study aims at the inclusion of 35 subjects.

      Primary objective: To investigate the PK of orally ingested MMF in SSC.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To investigate how SSC manifested in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract may alter the PK of
           MMF.

        2. To investigate how the PK of MMF in SSc is altered by medications often used in SSC,
           i.e. proton pump inhibitors (PPI), NSAID and calcium channel blockers.

      DESIGN AND ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE Study participants will take their medication, including the
      study drug, as prescribed by their ordinary physician. Study participant will note what they
      had for breakfast.

      The study-timespan for the individual study participant is estimated to maximum 8 hours.

      Blood samples will be drawn from a subcutaneous venous port if available. If not available,
      subjects will be receive a peripheral venous catheter that is to be used for repeated blood
      sampling. If usage of such a catheter fails during the study day, blood samples will be drawn
      from repeated venipunctures.

      VARIABLES STUDIED

      The following variables will be studied:

      Plasma-MMF-concentration: Will be measured by approved laboratory, Sk√•ne UniversityHospital,
      using high performance liquid chromatography. AUC 0_12 will be calculated as suggested by de
      Winter, Neumann, van Hest et. al., Ther Drug Mon 2009;31(3):382-390.

      Kidney and liver function: Serum samples will be analysed regarding kidney function and eGFR
      will be calculated from creatinin and cystatin C. Liver function will be assessed by AST,
      ALT, GT and ALP. Hematological characteristics will be noted.

      GI manifestations of SSc: Fecal calprotectin, will be assayed by ELISA (Calpro, Lysaker,
      Norway) at University Hospital Lund. Malnutrition will evaluated in reference to the
      validated Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST). S-transthyretin, vitamin B12, folic
      acid, iron and zink and S-albumin will be assessed as markers of malnutrition. The intestinal
      flora will be assessed by microbiological analysis of fecal sampling (Genetic Analysis AS,
      Oslo, Norway).

      Pregnancy: Will be evaluated by urine test.

      Questionnaire: Regarding concomitant medication and the UCLA SCTC GIT 2.0 (Swedish version)
      will be given to each study participant.
