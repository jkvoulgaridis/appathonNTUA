  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The electroencephalography (EEG) is a noninvasive medical technique for monitoring and
      recording the electrical activity of brain. The Hilbert-Huang Transformation (HHT) was
      proposed to decompose EEG signal into intrinsic mode functions (IMF). HHT can obtain
      instantaneous frequency data and work well for nonstationary and nonlinear data. We applied
      this method in perioperative EEG signal analysis in order to find the energy shift and
      quantify the energy change during general anesthesia. Ketamine was a depolarized sedative
      which was wildly used in anesthesia. We are trying to find the energy change after ketamine
      injection, and the interaction between different oscillations in EEG. The whole brain mapping
      for ketamine and other sedatives interaction is the next step.

      Method: In the first year, we will record 60 patients who received general anesthesia, their
      EEG data recorded from bi-spectral index (BIS) monitor. Under the same anesthesia depth, the
      experimental group use ketamine 0.5mg/kg; while the control group using alfentanil 0.01mg/kg
      injection. Both perioperative data were recorded included heart rate, blood pressure and
      surgical time. We decompose the raw EEG data from BIS monitor with EMD, and we observe
      difference between IMFs, and quantifying energy change. Second year: We will extend the EEG
      monitor to temporal lobe, parietal lobe and occipital lobe. Besides the whole brain mapping
      method for detecting energy change after ketamine injection; we also tried to find the
      interactions between oscillations. Finally, we want to apply the analysis method to pediatric
      patients, try to find the difference of ketamine reaction between generations. Anticipated
      Results: We anticipate that we can quantify the energy of EEG by Emperical mode
      decomposition(EMD), and ketamine injection can cause different energy change with other
      sedatives. We will find the energy traveling in EEG with EMD decomposition. We will find that
      HHT is more suitable for EEG analysis in clinical practicing. With the whole brain mapping
      method, we can understand the electrical activity during general anesthesia.
