  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a common sleep disorder for patients with depression. This has a major impact on
      the quality of life for the individual.

      The aim is to investigate, whether music intervention is effective in

        1. improving sleep quality,

        2. reducing symptoms of depression and

        3. improving quality of life

      Participants use a sound pillow and selected music in the The Music Star app at home as a
      sleep aid in 4 weeks.

      Depression is a common health problem in Denmark with a prevalence for depression of 17-18%.
      Depression has serious personal and social consequence. Sleep disorders are common in
      patients with depression. Resolving sleep disturbances in depression may prevent worsening of
      symptoms and relapse (Fava, 2004).

      Music listening is widely used as a sleep aid. A study from the Cochrane library shows
      consensus that music may be helpful to improve sleep quality in insomnia. (Jespersen, Koenig
      &amp; Vuust, 2015). It remains unclear if music listening is helpful to patients with depression
      as it is to a broader population.

      A randomized controlled trial address the use of music as a supplementary treatment to
      improve sleep in depression.

    <intervention_model_description>The study design is an explanatory mixed methods design in two parts. The first part is a two-arm parallel group, single center randomized controlled trial (n=120). Experimental group and waitlist control group receive standard treatment according to national guidelines. The experimental group use a sound pillow and The Music Star App at bedtime as a sleep aid in 4 weeks.The second part is an interview study (n=4). Qualitative data from a semi-structured interview on the use of music and sleep are used to discuss findings from the RCT.</intervention_model_description>
