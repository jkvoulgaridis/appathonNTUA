  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The transition to unassisted breathing after invasive ventilation often proves challenging.
      Persistent ventilator dependence predisposes patients to nosocomial complications and death
      and increases the economic burden of critical illness. Ventilator-dependence results from an
      imbalance between the load and capacity of the respiratory muscle pump. Patients who fail a
      trial of spontaneous breathing commonly exhibit excess respiratory loads secondary to
      weaning-induced pulmonary edema, atelectasis or dynamic hyperinflation. At the same time,
      many ventilator-dependent patients exhibit striking loss of respiratory pump capacity due to
      diaphragm dysfunction which predisposes to prolonged ventilator dependence. Diaphragm
      dysfunction is common in ventilated patients. By prolonging ventilator dependence it may be
      an important contributor to the poor long-term clinical and functional outcomes of survivors
      of critical illness. While some main risk factors for diaphragm dysfunction have been already
      described (diaphragm disuse induced by mechanical ventilation, sepsis, initial severity upon
      admission), the determinants of recovery of diaphragm dysfunction are unknown, as well it has
      not been elucidated whether diaphragm function can simply improve after the acute phase of
      ICU admission. Therefore, the goal of this study is to investigate the time course evolution
      of diaphragm function in patients exposed to prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation
      (i.e. in a weaning center) and to determine which factors are associated with an improvement
      of the diaphragm function leading to a safe mechanical ventilation discontinuation.

      In this prospective study, all patients admitted to the weaning center of Pitié-Salpêtrière
      Hospital to undertake a weaning program will be closely followed up to assess twice a week
      their diaphragm function. Only one experimental group will be constituted. Diaphragm function
      will be assessed with both 1) the phrenic nerves stimulation technique and 2) diaphragm
      ultrasound (thickness, thickening fraction). The time course evolution of the diaphragm
      function over the stay will be investigated and all potential factors involved in the change
      in diaphragm function will be determined.

    <description>Diaphragm function will be defined as pressure generating capacity. In practice, it will be assessed by using the phrenic nerves stimulation technique. A bilateral magnetic stimulation of the phrenic nerves will be done and the drop in endotracheal pressure so generated will be measured (twitch pressure).</description>

    <measure>Partial liberation from mechanical ventilation</measure>
    <time_frame>During hospitalization in Intensive Care Unit (ICU), up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Partial liberation from ventilation will be defined by spontaneous breathing without the ventilator through closed or opened tracheostomy collar for a period of time between 12 and 24 hours, the rest of the time, patients being under invasive or non invasive mechanical ventilation.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of patients with diaphragm dysfunction upon admission and upon discharge</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of admission in ICU until the date of hospital discharge in ICU, assessed up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of patients with diaphragm dysfunction will be the ratio of patients with diaphragm dysfunction over the total number of patients enrolled in the study. Diaphragm dysfunction will be defined as a twitch pressure (endotracheal pressure generated by magnetic stimulation) below 11 cmH2O.</description>
