      The study is an open-label Phase 1 study of the combination of relacorilant with enzalutamide
      in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Patients will be
      enrolled in 6 patient cohorts with a 6+3 design and a 28 day DLT period. Doses of
      relacorilant, enzalutamide will be adjusted based on safety and pharmacokinetics (PK). Once a
      safe dose with appropriate drug levels (PK) has been established, the cohort will be expanded
      to a total of 12 patients to refine safety and PK at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D).

             castration-resistant setting.

          5. Any prior therapy for castrate disease is acceptable except prior GR antagonist

          9. Active psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with protocol
             requirements.

         10. NYHA class II, NYHA class III, or IV congestive heart failure (any symptomatic heart
             failure).

         11. Concurrent therapy with strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 (See Section
             9.12below for list of strong inhibitor or inducers) due to concerning possible
             drug-drug interactions

         12. Presence of concurrent medical conditions requiring systemic glucocorticoids for
             immunosuppression (e.g. Autoimmune diseases, organ transplantation) that is active and
             has required glucocorticoids in the last 6 months.
