  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this investigation is to compare the effects of continuous (CUS) and pulsed (PUS)
      ultrasound associated with a program of exercises on pain, range of motion, muscle strength,
      functionality, mobility and activity in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Participants were
      randomized into five groups: Group I (in the first month, continuous ultrasound was applied),
      Group II (in the first month, pulsed ultrasound was applied), Group III (in the first and
      second month, the continuous ultrasound was applied), Group IV (in the first and second
      month, the pulsed ultrasound was applied) and Group V (patients received only exercise
      sessions for eight weeks).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Strong evidence suggests that joint exercises reduce pain and disability in patients with
      osteoarthritis. There is evidence that exercise is responsible for muscular strengthening and
      better flexibility, improved global function as well as better performance in activities of
      daily living (ADL).

      There are two modes of US, continuous and pulsed. Continuous US (CUS) generates thermal
      effects by stimulating the process of tissue regeneration, changing cell membrane
      permeability and increasing intracellular calcium, while pulsed US (PUS) mainly produces
      non-thermal effects to increase tissue metabolism, enhance fibrous tissue extensibility and
      elevate pain threshold

    <measure>Pain Intensity Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>eight weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS)14 consisting of a 10 cm rule (without numbers). At the left side, 'no pain' is written, while on the right side, 'unbearable pain'. Patients were instructed to mark on the rule what their level of pain was.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functionality Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>eight weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Functionality was measured using the Lequesne questionnaire,14 which consists of 11 questions about pain, discomfort and function. Scores range from 0 to 24 (from 'no' to 'extremely severe' dysfunction).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Range of motion</measure>
    <time_frame>eight weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Range of motion for flexion of the knees was measured with the universal goniometer (AESCULAP), according to the methods described by Marques.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscular strength</measure>
    <time_frame>eight weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Muscular strength was estimated at maximal isometric force for the quadriceps, using a portable dynamometer (Lafayette, USA). Under stabilized conditions, patients, sitting with knees flexed at 10o, 60o and 90o (measured by a goniometer),16 were asked to extend the legs as far as they could. Three trials were conducted and the mean value was obtained.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>eight weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Activity was measured using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) questionnaire,17 which is self-administered and measures pain, frozen joints and physical activity. Increased scores indicate decreased activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mobility and balance</measure>
    <time_frame>eight weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Mobility and balance are evaluated by Timed Get Up and Go (TGUG)18 and 8 meters Test19. The TGUG quantifies in seconds the functional mobility through the time that the individual needs to perform the task of getting up from a chair, walking three meters, turning back towards the chair and sitting again. The 8-meter test measures the time and number of steps required for a person to walk for 8 meters.</description>

    <description>Group I In the first month, continuous ultrasound was applied three times a week. In the second month, patients performed only exercise sessions three times a week. In the ultrasound treatment, the following parameters were used: frequency of 1 MHz, intensity of 1.5 W/cm2 (temporal and spatial mean SATA), duty cycle of 100%, with application time of 5 minutes on the medial side and 5 minutes on lateral side of knee.
Exercises
The intervention was divided into three phases: P-1, P-2 and P-3 during eight weeks with three sessions a week. Each session lasted 45 minutes:
10 minutes warming-up (treadmill, ergometer bike or rowing machine);
30 minutes 2-3 sets with P-1, P-2 or P-3;
5 minutes stretching (hamstrings, quadriceps, adductors, and gastrocmenius).</description>
