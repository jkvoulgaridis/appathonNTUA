    <textblock>
      GSK-3β is a potentially important therapeutic target in human malignancies. The Actuate 1801
      Phase 1/2 study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 9-ING-41, a potent GSK-3β
      inhibitor, as a single agent and in combination with cytotoxic agents, in patients with
      refractory cancers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      9-ING-41 is a first-in-class, intravenously administered, maleimide-based small molecule
      potent selective GSK-3β inhibitor with significant pre-clinical antitumor activity. GSK-3 is
      a serine/threonine kinase initially described as a key regulator of metabolism and has a role
      in diverse disease processes including cancer, immune disorders, pathologic fibrosis,
      metabolic disorders, and neurological disorders. GSK-3 has two ubiquitously expressed and
      highly conserved isoforms, GSK-3α and GSK-3β, with both shared and distinct substrates and
      functional effects. GSK-3β is particularly important in tumor progression and modulation of
      oncogenes (including beta-catenin, cyclin D1 and c-Myc), cell cycle regulators (e.g. p27Kip1)
      and mediators of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (e.g. zinc finger protein SNAI1, Snail).
      Aberrant overexpression of GSK-3β has been shown to promote tumor growth and chemotherapy
      resistance in various solid tumors including colon, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers and
      glioblastoma through differential effects on the pro-survival nuclear factor
      kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and c-Myc pathways as well on tumor
      necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and p53-mediated apoptotic
      mechanisms. GSK-3β helps maintain malignant cell survival and proliferation, particularly in
      terms of mediating resistance to standard anti-cancer therapies, through the NF-κB pathway.
      GSK-3β has been established as a potential anticancer target in human bladder, breast,
      colorectal, glioblastoma, lung, neuroblastoma, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, renal and
      thyroid cancers as well as chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lymphomas.

      9-ING-41 is a small molecule potent selective GSK-3β inhibitor with broad spectrum
      pre-clinical antitumor activity. It's modes of action include downregulation of NF-κB and
      decreasing the expression NF-κB target genes including cyclin D1, Bcl-2, anti-apoptotic
      protein (XIAP) and B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-XL) leading to inhibition of tumor growth
      in multiple solid tumor cell and lymphoma lines and patient derived xenograft (PDX) models.
      NF-κB is constitutively active in cancer cells and promotes anti-apoptotic molecule
      expression. NF-κB activation is particularly important in cancer cells that have become
      chemo- and/or radio-resistant. 9-ING-41 also has significant activity in pre-clinical models
      of pathological pleural and pulmonary fibrosis. 9-ING-41 has significant in vitro and in vivo
      activity as a single agent and/or in combination with standard cytotoxic chemotherapies in a
      spectrum of solid tumors and hematological malignancies including bladder, breast,
      glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, pancreatic, sarcomas, and renal cancers as well as lymphomas.

      The 1801 study will have three parts:

        -  Part 1 (9-ING-41 as monotherapy): The standard 3+3 dose escalation design will be
           applied to all dose cohorts until the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) or Recommended Phase
           2 Dose (RP2D) is identified

        -  Part 2: 9-ING-41 combined with standard anticancer agents: The 3+3 dose escalation study
           design will be used for 7 chemotherapy combination regimens (9-ING-41 plus gemcitabine,
           doxorubicin, lomustine, carboplatin, irinotecan, nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine,
           paclitaxel plus carboplatin) to identify the MTD/RP2D of each regimen. Part 2 will be
           started after a maximum of 3 dose escalations of 9-ING-41 as a single agent in Part 1.
           The starting dose level in Part 2 of 9-ING-41 within the seven combination regimens will
           be the 4th dose level of single agent 9-ING-41 (or lower if the IDMC so recommends).
           Dose escalations of 9-ING-41 as a single agent in Part 1 will continue in parallel with
           dose escalations of 9-ING-41 in combination treatments in Part 2.

        -  Part 3: Assessment of activity of 9-ING-41 based combination regimens: The primary
           objective for Study Part 3 is to assess the clinical benefit of each of the seven
           9-ING-41-based combination regimens. Secondary objectives will include the assessment of
           other efficacy variables, including progression-free survival (PFS), duration of tumor
           response, time to treatment failure, 1-year survival rate and overall survival (OS) as
           well as additional evaluation of toxicities. The Simon's 2-stage design will be employed
           for Study Part 3 for the seven 9-ING-41-based combination regimens.

               7. Has had major surgery (not including placement of central lines) within 7 days
                  prior to study entry or is planned to have major surgery during the course of the
                  study (major surgery may be defined as any invasive operative procedure in which
                  an extensive resection is performed, e.g. a body cavity is entered, organs are
                  removed, or normal anatomy is altered. In general, if a mesenchymal barrier is
                  opened (pleural cavity, peritoneum, meninges), the surgery is considered major)

               8. Has any medical and/or social condition which, in the opinion of the investigator
                  or study medical coordinator would preclude study participation

               9. Has received an investigational anti-cancer drug in the 14-day period before the
                  first dose of study drug (or within 5 half-lives if longer) or is currently
                  participating in another interventional clinical trial

              10. Has a current active malignancy other than the target cancer

              11. Is considered to be a member of a vulnerable population (for example, prisoners)
