  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence (UI) is a major public health issue affecting up to 25-50% of all women
      and has a detrimental impact on patient quality of life. Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is
      the most common form of urinary incontinence and is defined as the leakage of urine, which
      occurs during physical activity of exertion or on sneezing or coughing. It has been reported
      that the prevalence of SUI is 25 to 45% of the female population. If pelvic floor exercises
      are not effective, mid-urethral slings (MUS) are widely used as a first-line surgical
      treatment. Subjective and objective cure rates of 91% and 85% respectively have been reported
      for retropubic midurethral slings.

      Midurethral slings are commonly made of polypropylene (PP). Although the polypropylene
      products are effective and have relatively low rates of adverse events, the adverse events
      that do occur, like exposure and pain, have been related to the fact that a permanent
      synthetic mesh is implanted. Mesh-related complications are difficult to manage and may even
      involve partial or complete removal of the implant.

      Clinically, there is a need to investigate whether mid-urethral sling surgery can be
      performed with a non-permanent mesh made from a resorbable biomaterial, as an alternative for
      PP. Non-permanent meshes may be associated with fewer complications and better quality of
      life. However, before non-permanent and permanent mesh procedures can be compared, there is a
      need to first establish the feasibility of using a mesh in a mid-urethral sling procedure.

      The investigators hypothesize that a retropubic mid-urethral sling procedure to treat stress
      urinary incontinence, can be successfully performed using an implant made of
      poly-4-hydroxybutyrate (P4HB).

      The overall objective of this study is to determine the preliminary safety and efficacy of
      resorbable TephaFLEX sling implanted via a retropubic procedure to treat SUI.

      Prospective, observational single-center study with a follow-up of 24 months post-surgery. Up
      to 25 patients will be recruited at Groote Schuur Hospital Urogynecology Out-Patient
      Department. Eligible patients will receive a retropubic surgical producedure where a
      TephaFLEX sling, composed of the resorbable material P4HB, is placed. After the surgical
      procedure, follow-up visits are scheduled at 4-6 weeks, 3 months (+/- 2 weeks), 6 months (+/-
      2 weeks), 12 months (+/- 1 month), and 24 months (+/- 1 month) post-procedure. TephaFLEX
      sling, manufactured by Tepha, Inc., will be implanted via a retropubic mid-urethral sling
      procedure for treatment of women with stress urinary incontinence. The product is supplied as
      a sterile, single-use device. One device will be utilized per patient. TephaFLEX sling,
      developed specifically for treatment of stress urinary incontinence, is a single layer,
      bioresorbable, mesh made from poly-4-hydroxybutyrate (P4HB) monofilament fiber. The mesh is
      constructed as a 11mm x 60cm tape with an open pore structure, and is enclosed in a
      polyethylene sleeve to ease insertion. The mesh was designed specifically to provide strength
      over the three-month critical wound healing period in soft tissue repair and reinforcement,
      and to encourage the proliferation of healthy tissue at the repair site. The product
      undergoes a gradual loss of strength after implantation and is essentially resorbed by 18 -
      24 months.

    <description>The retropubic mid-urethral sling procedure using UroFLEX sling is considered to be safe at 6 months after implantation if the number of serious adverse events comply with safety standards as defined by the safety criteria outlined below and analyzed using sequential analysis. The device will be considered safe at A) a maximum of 3 of the first 5 patients experience a device or procedure-related SAE (60%); B) a maximum of 5 of the first 10 patients experience a device or procedure-related SAE (50%); C) a maximum of 7 of the first 20 patients experience a device or procedure-related SAE (35%); D) a maximum of 8 of the first 25 patients experience a device or procedure-related SAE (32%).</description>
