  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates how a protocol of scheduled non-narcotic anesthetic used in the
      immediate post-operative period affects the average patient pain scale scores and the amount
      of oral narcotic medication administered. The objective of the study is to identify a
      post-operative pain control regimen that can decrease the amount of oral narcotic medications
      administered in the post-operative period.

      The primary outcome will be the amount of morphine milligram equivalents (MME) used in each
      group. Secondary outcomes will include pain scores, postoperative complete blood count, and
      post-operative satisfaction with care received during admission.

      Subjects who consented to be part of the trial will be randomized at the time of skin closure
      of their cesarean section to either the standard group or the study group. The standard group
      will receive the standard treatment of 2 doses of 30mg IV Ketorolac on an as needed basis.
      The study group will receive 6 doses of 30mg IV Ketorolac scheduled every 6 hours. The
      subject will receive her first dose in the operating room. The ob/gyn residents will be
      responsible for placing the orders in Sorian for either &quot;Standard Post-Operative Pain
      Control&quot; order set or the &quot;Ketorolac Study Post Cesarean Section Pain Control&quot; order set.
      Please see below for sample order sets. Pain scores will be evaluated using a visual analog
      pain scale every 6 hours throughout hospitalization and recorded in the electronic medical
      record. The amount of oral opiate medications administered for subjects in each group will be
      recorded in the electronic medical record as well.

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The amount of MME's will be monitored for each group. MME's will be determined by the amount of opiate mediations administered. The MME value can range from 0 to typically 200 MME's, however there is no upper limit of measureable MME's. The MME's for each patient will be a sum of MME's administered throughout the course of the hospitalization.</description>

    <measure>Pain scores</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The patient reported pain scores will be recorded and analyzed for each group. The Pain Score is determined by the patient using a visual analog scale with a range from 0-10, where 0 is no pain at all and 10 is the worst pain imaginable for the patient.</description>
