  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalization, for cancer patients, exposes to a risk of undernutrition which has the
      effect of significantly increasing infections, pressure ulcers, muscle wasting, loss of
      autonomy, impaired function and delayed healing.

      All of these factors contribute to increase the length of stay in hospital, thus lengthening
      the spiral of undernutrition, which has serious consequences for the patient welbeing, health
      establishments and public health.

      Undernutrition has been the subject of many studies over the last twenty years, that outline
      that an adequate nutritional management exerts a direct effect on the reduction of
      comorbidities and duration of hospitalization.

      However, there are periods, in the preoperative course of care, where nutritional and
      phisical care are not realized in the current clinical practice whereas they could be done,
      for example, between the diagnosis and the consultation of anesthesia, between the anesthesia
      consultation and the surgical procedure and the end of hospitalization of the patient.

      Current management is usually limited to the period of hospitalization which tends to be
      reduced. This situation is reinforced by the absence of relays at home, dietary consultations
      being not reimbursed by French health insurance.

      Moreover, a preliminary survey, conducted in 2012 during the pre-operative outpatient
      anesthesia consultation, shows that 26% of patients are already clinically malnourished, with
      16.5 % of them who have lost more than 10% of their weight.

      Then, the investigators hypothesize that the combination of perioperative nutrition and
      mobilization program coordinated andrealized by dieticians and physiotherapists, with the
      Nutrimus follow-up booklet, would improve the post-operative evolution of patients and reduce
      their postoperative comorbidities.

      This management, initiated at the consultation of anesthesia, would include an accurate
      nutritional diagnosis, nutritional and physical support therapy to improve their nutritional
      and muscular status.
