      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) injection in muscle injuries.
      The investigators check football players in the acute phase of hamstrings or quadriceps
      injuries.

      Efficacy and safety are evaluated. There are two intramuscular infiltration of PRP (Ortho
      pras ® system) or a homeopathic product (Traumeel ®) in each of the football players. The
      number of days between the date of injury and the return to play, the pain, the recurrence
      and the adverse reactions are registered.

      STUDY DESIGN: Randomized Clinical Trial.

      METHODS:

      41 football players are included in the study. It is used randomly PRP injection or a
      homeopathic product in muscle injuries (hamstring), in the early stage (first 48-72 hours).

      One week later, the investigators do a second infiltration with the same product, always
      ultrasound guided. 3-4 weeks after the injury, different variables are evaluated: the injurie
      with ultrasounds , self-perception test, muscle strength, flexibility, jump and run. It is
      compared the elapsed time in days in each of the groups: RETURN TO PLAY.

      Furthermore, the PAIN, RECURRENCE RATE and ADVERSE REACTIONS are evaluated.
