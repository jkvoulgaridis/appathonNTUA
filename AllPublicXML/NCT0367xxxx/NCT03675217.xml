      This estudy evaluates the effects of physical exercise program on health related quality of
      life (HRQoL), pain and physical fitness in family caregiver.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Justification: Research indicates that the dependent patient caregiver´s have physical,
      psychological and social repercussions, as consequence of the care that they provide. From
      Primary Health Care there is a &quot;caregiver care program&quot; to prevent and palliate this
      situation, consisting mainly in education programs in care and psychotherapy. There is
      controversy about the effectiveness of these programs, being necessary to develop new
      therapeutic strategies.

      Objectives: to determine the effects of a physical exercise program, adressed by the primary
      health care physioterapist, on health related quality of life (HRQol), pain and physical
      fitness in dependent patient caregivers included in the &quot; caregiver care program&quot; of a basic
      health area.

      Methodology: randomized clinical trial, with control group (GC = 32) and intervention group
      (GI = 36), double blind and pre and post-intervention evaluation. The GC received the usual
      program of the &quot; caregiver care program&quot;. The GI also carried out a multi-component exercise
      program for 12 weeks, with 3 weekly sessions realized in group and monitored by
      physiotherapists. The outcomes variables are measured by Quality of life (SF-36), Burden
      (Zarit), anxiety (Goldberg Ansiety Questionanaire), depression (Yesavage Questionnaire), pain
      intensity (EVA), disability (Roland Morris) and physical fitness (battery of fitness tests).
      Patients evaluator and Outcomes Assessor are masked.

      Applicability of results: If the physical exercise program, carried out from the primary
      health care physiotherapy, improves the HRQol, pain and physical fitness, this intervention
      could be an effective therapeutic strategy in the &quot;caregiver care programs&quot;. Furthermore the
      proposed intervention is simple, reproducible and requires few resources.

    <description>Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) V2. Spanish version. The SF-36 is a 36- item scale constructed to survey health status and quality of life. It yields an 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being scores as well as psychometrically-based physical and mental health summary. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale. Higher scores indicate better overall quality of life.</description>

    <description>Zarit Carer Burden Interview. Spanish Version. It´s a questionnaire that evaluates carer burden and asks about many commonly reported difficulties faced by carers (intraclass correlation coefficient = .71). This questionnaire presents 22 Likert-type questions each of which has a score of 0 to 4. The total score can be from 0 to 88. Higher values indicate greater burden caregiver.</description>

    <measure>Changes in maximal oxygen uptake (Vo2 max)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to post-treatment (16 weeks from baseline).</time_frame>
    <description>Maximal oxygen uptake (Vo2 max) is assessed using the &quot;2km Walking test &quot; We perform the test based on the guidelines of the Afisal-Inefc Battery. For this purpose, a circuit is designed, is also used stopwatch (portable digital brand Oregon Scientific®, model SL929 Hockenheim Nero) with a precision of tenths of a second (0.1 sg) and heart rate monitors (Polar RS800 CX) to measure the heart rate at the end of the test. Procedure: The caregivers with comfortable clothes and shoes walk as fast as possible they could without running. Interpretation of the results: The time used to travel is recorded 2 kilometers, the heart rate corresponding to the end of the test expressed in beats per minute. If you spend more than 22 minutes completing the this test loses its validity. To calculate de maximal oxigen uptake (Vo2 max) this formula is used: Vo2max ( mi· kg·' ·min·' ) = 116,2 - 2,98*(time) - 0,11*(heart rate) - 0,14 (age) - 0,39*( body mass index)</description>
