  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EpiBone-Craniomaxillofacial (EB-CMF) is an autologous, anatomically shaped bone graft created
      specifically for the patient's defect, using the patients own adipose-derived mesenchymal
      stem cells. This first in human trial is designed specifically to assess the safety of EB-CMF
      clinically. Although secondary measures of graft efficacy are being assessed, the primary
      focus will be on Adverse Events stemming from graft implantation.

          6. Patient must be available at the study center for all specified assessments throughout
             the study duration.

          7. Patients whose clinical laboratory test results are within the reference range for

             consent and authorization for use and disclosure of protected health information.

          6. Patient has any underlying or current medical or psychiatric condition that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, would impact patient safety or interfere with the
             integrity of the study data.

          7. Active uncontrolled infection or malignancy. Patients will be allowed to undergo
