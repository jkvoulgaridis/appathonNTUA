      Purpose:

      To assess retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) and retinal structural changes in eyes with
      neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) treated with anti-vascular endothelial
      growth factor (anti-VEGF) during long-term follow-up and to evaluate morphological markers
      potentially influencing prognosis.

      Methods:

      18 patients (18 eyes) with neovascular AMD were recruited subsequent to completion the
      Avastin Versus Lucentis in Age Related Macular Degeneration (MANTA) study following a mean
      period of 84 months (range: 69-93 months). After receiving a loading dose of 3 intravitreal
      anti-VEGF injections subsequent to baseline of the MANTA study, patients were treated
      as-needed [pro re nata (PRN)]. Functional and morphological changes were assessed using
      spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT).

        Initially 55 Participants were included in the Avastin Versus Lucentis in Age Related
        Macular Degeneration (MANTA) trial [16]. These patients received a loading dose of 3
        intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF and were subsequently treated as-needed [pro re nata
        (PRN)] [16]. From that study population we recruited for another long term follow up visit.
        Of these patients 9 (16%) were excluded due to missed visits, another 14 patients (25%)
        died before the last study visit and 14 former participants (25%) did not approve further
        study participation.
