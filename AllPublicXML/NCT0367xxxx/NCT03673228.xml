  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalization for elective knee or hip replacement surgery presents an outstanding
      opportunity to motivate people to quit smoking, because it provides an opportunity to
      encourage patients to remain smoke-free as they proactively quit to optimize their surgery
      outcomes. This study will conduct a comparative effectiveness trial of patients who quit
      smoking pre-operatively, comparing the current standard of care with a novel comprehensive
      relapse prevention intervention guided by Marlatt's Relapse Prevention Model.

      The specific aims of this study are to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of
      the relapse prevention intervention and will: 1) compare the effectiveness of standard
      post-operative cessation treatment with a comprehensive relapse prevention intervention on
      smoking cessation outcomes; 2) conduct a comparative economic analysis to assess the value of
      the relapse prevention intervention for patients and the healthcare system; and 3) explore
      the impact of the interventions on surgical complications and readmissions.
