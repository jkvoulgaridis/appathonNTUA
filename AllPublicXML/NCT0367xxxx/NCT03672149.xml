    <description>a) If a patient requires antimicrobial therapy for a proven or suspected infection at the time of CRRT initiation or at any time receiving CRRT, they are eligible for inclusion. If cefazolin is part of the empiric or definitive treatment regimen, it will be mixed in the CRRT solution(s) and administered via a continuous infusion to obtain pharmacokinetic and safety data of administering cefazolin via the CRRT solution and infection treatment related data. For this indication, pharmacokinetic and safety data will be obtained for the duration the patient receives cefazolin via the CRRT solution(s) for the proven or suspected infection as dictated by the primary team caring for the patient.</description>

For this indication, pharmacokinetic and safety data will be obtained for a 72-96-hour duration.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients eligible to participate in the study must have a need for continuous renal
        replacement therapy (CRRT) of any modality:

          1. CVVH-continuous veno-venous hemofiltration

          2. CVVHD-continuous veno-venous hemodialysis

          3. CVVHDF-continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be considered ineligible if they meet any of the following criteria:

          1. History of any moderate or severe hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to cefazolin
             (a history of mild rash followed by uneventful re-exposure and/or red man syndrome is
             not a contraindication)

          2. Any rapidly-progressing disease or immediately life-threatening illness (defined as
             imminent death within 48 hours in the opinion of the investigator)

          3. Any condition or circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             compromise the safety of the patient or the quality of study data

          4. Females that are pregnant or breastfeeding
