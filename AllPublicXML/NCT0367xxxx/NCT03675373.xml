    <textblock>
      The aims of this pilot study are:

        1. To examine the factors associated with alcohol drinking and alcohol use disorder

        2. To examine the effect of face-to-face alcohol brief intervention on drinking reduction

        3. To examine the effect of a continuous interactive chat-based intervention via &quot;WhatsApp&quot;
           on drinking reduction

        4. To explore the perception of face-to-face alcohol brief intervention

        5. To explore the perception of continuous interactive chat-based intervention via instant
           messaging mobile application &quot;WhatsApp&quot;

    <textblock>
      According to the Department of Health, majority of people in Hong Kong started to develop
      drinking habit at 18-21 years of age in 2014/2015. Amongst them, 16.8% had scored higher than
      3 in the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test for Consumption (AUDIT-C) (an abbreviated
      version of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, or AUDIT, designed by the World
      Health Organization(WHO)), while 3.5% had even scored 8 or above in the test. With higher
      prevalence to begin drinking within 18 and 23 years old, university students could have
      established higher tendency of harmful drinking and alcohol dependence as compared with other
      age groups. Therefore, early interventions such as the evidence-based Alcohol Brief
      Intervention (ABI) suggested by the WHO are particularly needed to target university drinkers
      who are 5% more likely to develop higher frequency of drinking in later of their lives
      compared with other age groups.

    <description>Subjects in the active arm study will receive continuous interactive chat-based intervention as an extension of alcohol brief intervention at baseline. The interactive mobile chat will be carried out on Friday night and Saturday before and during the period of &quot;happy hour&quot; and ask for drinking and giving personalized advises on drinking reduction using behavioral change techniques.</description>

    <description>Those in the control arm will be assigned to only receive the face-to-face ABI. The ABI consists of: (1) giving feedback and information about the screening result in phase I and hazard of drinking; (2) emphasizing the benefits of reduce drinking and informing about alcohol problems; (3) setting goal on reducing alcohol consumption; (4) reviewing advice and ;(5) giving encouragement.</description>
