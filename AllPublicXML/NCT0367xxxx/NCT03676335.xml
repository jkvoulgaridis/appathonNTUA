    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of CsA ophthalmic gel in the
      treatment of moderate to severe tear deficiency dry eye with different dosage, frequency and
      concentration, and to preliminarily determine the optimal dosage, frequency and
      concentration, so as to provide a theoretical basis for the design of follow-up clinical
      studies.

      A multicenter, randomized, single-blind, positive controlled exploratory study will be
      conducted with cyclosporine A ophthalmic emulsion as the control drug.

      The experimental drugs were divided into three groups:

      Treatment group A: CsA eye gel: 0.3 g: 0.15 mg, once daily； Treatment group B: CsA eye gel:
      0.3 g: 0.15 mg, twice daily, interval of about 12 hours； Treatment group C: CsA eye gel: 0.3
      g: 0.3 mg, once daily. One drop into each eye when you use it.

      Control group: CsA emulsion: 0.4 ml: 0.2 mg. One drop into the eye, 2 times daily with an
      interval for 12 hours.
