      This study will investigate the steroid sparing potential of DS107E to vehicle in patients
      with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.

      DS107E or vehicle will be topically administered with a steroid twice a day for the first 7
      days. For the following 28 days DS107E or vehicle will be topically administered twice a day.

      This study will enrol approximately 40 adult patients.

      Subjects will come to the clinic on 7 occasions: Screening, Baseline, Day 7, Day 14, Day 21,
      Day 35 (End of Treatment) and Day 42 (Follow-up). The primary efficacy variable will be EASI
      (Eczema Area and Severity Index). The secondary efficacy variables will be EASI, IGA
      (Investigators Global Assessment), SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis), Target Lesion Score,
      VAS (Visual Analogue Scale), Skin Tolerability, DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index),
      Erythema, TEWL (Transepidermal Water Loss) and Time to Rescue Medication.

          -  Use of any topical medicated treatment for atopic dermatitis 2 weeks prior to start of
             treatment/Day 0 visit (baseline), including but not limited to, topical
             corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, tars, bleach, antimicrobials and bleach
             baths.

          -  Use of topical products containing ceramides 2 weeks prior to Day 0. Topical products
             that do not contain ceramides are allowed.

          -  Use of anti-histamines for atopic dermatitis within 2 weeks of baseline.

             infection with human immunodeficiency virus).
