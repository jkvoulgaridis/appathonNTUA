  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain control for newborns has made significant improvements over the last 30 years. The use
      of narcotics remains the standard of care for neonates undergoing minor and major surgeries.
      Narcotics, however, are associated with adverse effects such as respiratory depression,
      prolonged intubation and withdrawal symptoms. Acetaminophen (Tylenol©) has been proposed as
      an adjunct to reduce narcotic use but current evidence from well designed studies in newborns
      and premature infants is limited. This study will randomly assign neonates undergoing a
      surgery to either morphine plus acetaminophen or morphine alone for pain control. The
      subjects will be followed for 72 hours after the operation and evaluate the benefits of
      acetaminophen for pain control.

    <description>Infants randomized to the intervention arm will receive scheduled IV acetaminophen per LexiComp dosing guideline (28 0/7-32 6/7 weeks 10 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours; 33 0/7-38 6/7 weeks 10 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours; &gt;39 0/7 weeks 10 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours). N-PASS scores will guide administration of IV morphine. Continuous infusion of morphine will be started if an infant requires 3 doses of morphine within a 6-hour period and titrated as needed per N-PASS scores.</description>

    <description>Infants randomized to the control arm will receive normal saline placebo IV at the appropriate volume and times for the gestational age. IV acetaminophen is concentrated at 10 mg/ml; corresponding saline volumes will be 1 ml to 5 ml, approximately, based on subject weight. Control infants will also have N-PASS scores assessed using the same protocol following the surgical procedure for 72 hours. Dosing of IV morphine will be the same as the dosing for the intervention arm.</description>
