  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) performance depends on equipment performance, equipment
      maintenance and relevance of MRI sequence used. To optimize MRI performance, it's necessary
      to develop, optimize, test and validate new acquisition sequences for enhanced diagnosis and
      therapy monitoring. These new sequences will allow better spatial resolution and specificity
      while reducing acquisition time.

      The purpose of the present study is to test and optimize, on healthy subjects, specific MRI
      acquisition sequences firstly developed in a preclinical phase on phantoms (inert objects
      containing solutions or gels) and animal (Pig, sheep). This study will allow the
      investigators to define practical acquisition parameters that will allow reproducible results
      and precise definition of clinically relevant examination protocols for each new developed
      sequence.

    <description>The values of the signal intensities will be measured in adjacent structures of interest. The difference between these values divided by the noise will be calculated to quantify the contrast-to-noise ratio between these structures. The higher this value is, the better is the sequence in its ability to differentiate these structures from one another.</description>
