  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) might develop dizziness or vertigo as a first
      manifestation or during the course of the illness. Many patients with MS experience chronic
      or intermittent dizziness. Acute symptoms of dizziness or vertigo in MS fall into two
      categories; acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) and positional vertigo.

      Vestibular disorder due to MS decreases whole body dynamic postural control and causes many
      functional limitations as limitations in ambulation, dynamic balance and trunk control and
      that decreases the quality of life.

      Vestibular dysfunction has long been recognized as causing some of the most common symptoms
      in MS, true vertigo is found at presentation in up to 17% of patients, several recent reports
      have suggested that vestibular symptoms develop early in the disease process. Vestibular
      Rehabilitation has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms and improving function for
      patients with vestibular disorders. The goal of vestibular rehabilitation is to promote the
      central nervous system compensation through exercise-based strategies.

      The purposes of the study were to:

        -  Measure the effect of Cawthorne Cooksey Exercises on trunk kinetics and velocity of gait
           in patient with MS.

        -  Measure the effect of vestibular habituation on trunk kinetics and velocity of gait in
           patient with MS.

        -  Determine which type of vestibular exercises had more effect on the rehabilitation of
           patients with MS Cawthorne Cooksey or vestibular habituation?

        -  Determine if there was a correlation between the improvement in trunk kinetics and
           velocity of gait in patients with MS.

      Forty five patients with multiple sclerosis were selected from the Out Patient Clinics of
      Neurology and Internal Medicine in Kasr Al- Aini Hospitals, Out Patient Clinic of Neurology,
      Faculty of Physical Therapy, Cairo University and 6th of October central hospital.

      The selected patients were divided into three equal groups:

        -  Patients in G1 will receive traditional physical therapy program (balance training) for
           twelve sessions; day after day

        -  Patients in G2 will receive Cawthorne Cooksey Exercises in addition to traditional
           physical therapy program for twelve sessions; day after day.

        -  Patients in G3 will receive vestibular habituation exercises in addition to traditional
           physical therapy program for twelve sessions; day after day.
