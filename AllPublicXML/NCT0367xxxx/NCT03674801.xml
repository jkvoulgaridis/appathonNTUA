  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2013, esophageal cancer was the 9th cause of cancer in the world and the 6th in terms of
      cancer mortality. The prognosis of this cancer varies according to geographical areas, but in
      Europe and the USA, the 5-year survival rate has risen from less than 5% in the 1960s to
      around 20% in the 2000s. In the United States, however, the survival rate has risen from 5%
      in the 1960s to around 20% in the 2000s.

      Increased the detection of premalignant lesions and early stages may improve prognosis. The
      presence of esophageal cancer is determined by endoscopy, biopsy and histological
      confirmation. However, endoscopic techniques (mucosectomy and sub mucosal dissection) are
      also used as curative treatment for early esophageal lesions.

      Now, due to the low number of diagnoses of esophageal tumours at the superficial stage, few
      studies are available in Europe on the efficacy of these endoscopic techniques and on the
      complications resulting from their use. Similarly, little is known about the complications of
      endoscopic techniques and about therapeutic strategies for managing these superficial
      lesions. In particular, no data are available concerning the adequacy between the treatment
      proposed in multidisciplinary consultation meetings and the actual management of patients.

      Our study is therefore fundamental to make an inventory of superficial esophageal cancers
      treated by endoscopy, and their management

      This fundamental study will therefore best describe current French practices for the
      management strategy of esophageal cancers after endoscopic treatment. Consequently, the
      interests of this study, national inventory, are multiple:

        1. List a significant number of endoscopic treatments. In particular, by sub mucosal
           dissection in France, in order to strengthen scientific evidence of its efficacy, to
           assess its feasibility and complication rate.

        2. Describe the therapeutic strategies currently in place during endoscopic treatment,

        3. Evaluate the adequacy between the proposed upstream management of the endoscopic
           procedure by SCP and the actual management.
