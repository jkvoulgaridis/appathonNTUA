  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-dose, single-arm, single-center imaging study using DOTATATE
      peptide, labelled with the 64Cu tracer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In total, 59 subjects will be recruited in the study. The study will recruit both healthy
      volunteers as well as patients with confirmed or suspicious NET disease by histology or
      conventional anatomical and functional imaging modalities including but not limited to
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and/or computed tomography (CT), and/or, F-18 FDG PET/CT
      and /or F-18 NaF bone PET/CT and/or bone scintigraphy, and/or Octreoscan.

    <description>The detection of tumor location using Cu64-DOTATATE will be done in subjects with known or suspected NETs, when comparing individual reader results of PET/CT scans to a standard of truth (SOT) for each subject.</description>

    <measure>Determine the positive predictive value (PPV) of 64Cu- PSMA PET/CT for detection of neuroendocrine tumor on a per-patient basis.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>To characterize the predictive value of 64Cu-DOTATATE PET-CT imaging, the standard of truth results (SOT) results for each subject will be compared to results from PET/CT imaging ( based on the individual reader results and based on the reader-majority rule determination).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed or suspicion of NET based on histology/ biopsy report.

          -  Confirmed or suspicion of NET based on conventional imaging scans of affected area
             such as MRI and/or contrast enhanced CT and/or an FDG PET

          -  CT scan and/or NaF PET-CT scan and/or OctreoScan® performed within 8 weeks prior to
             study date.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant, planning to be pregnant within the next two weeks

          -  Inability to provide written consent.

          -  Therapeutic use of any somatostatin analogue, including Sandostatin® LAR and
             Lanreotide (within 28 days) and Sandostatin® (within 2 days) prior to study imaging.
             If a subject is on Sandostatin® LAR or Lanreotide, a wash-out period of 28 days is
             required before the injection of the study drug.
