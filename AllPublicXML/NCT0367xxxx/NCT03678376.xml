  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurocognitive disorders (NCD) are today often largely underdiagnosed or diagnosed in late
      stages in France. Indeed the ALzheimer COoperative Valuation in Europe (ALCOVE) study stated
      that about 50% of people living with NCD remain undiagnosed until late severe stages with a
      deep autonomy loss inducing at risk behaviours and/or behavioural crisis. The French High
      Authority of Health (Haute Autorité de Santé - HAS) and ALCOVE recommend a timely diagnosis
      at a time when the specific intervention help to implement secondary or tertiary prevention
      dynamics that would delay severe complications and help to maintain a reasonable quality of
      life for both the patient and the caregiver. Moreover, the representatives of the National
      College of General Practitioners, the French Federation of Memory Centres, the French
      Federation of Gerontology and Geriatrics, the French Federation of Neurology, the French
      Society of Psychogeriatrics and the National Plan on Neurodegenerative Diseases designed a
      hierarchized and tailored diagnosis strategy of NCD promoting a shared diagnosis between the
      General Practitioner (GP) and specialists of NCD. It therefore appears crucial to determine
      the diagnosis value of a short duration strategy assessing the complaint, cognition and
      autonomy in primary care to detect NCD and referring to a specialist to perform the
      etiological diagnosis. The identification of NCD by GP in primary care (TROCOMEGE) study aims
      at assessing the positive and negative predictive values of a NCD diagnosis strategy through
      the assessment of the subjective memory complaint, the cognitive status and the autonomy
      level in primary care. It relies on the clinical impression of the GP, a cognitive complaint
      interview for complaint and functional assessment thanks to the General Practitioner
      assessment of Cognition (GP-Cog, part 2) tool and the cognitive assessment thanks to the
      Six-Item Cognitive Impairment test (6-CIT).

    <description>The evaluation with their GP is composed of (1-) Clinical impression, (2-) GP-Cog part 2 with patient or their informal caregiver and (3-) 6-CIT test.
The identification of patients at risk of NCD with the new strategy applied by the GP will be compared to the gold standard for diagnosis of NCD at the Memory Clinic, established according to Diagnosis and Statistical Manual of mental disorders (DSM-5) criteria and based on a clinical, neuropsychological evaluation and functional abilities. If needed, a secondary etiological diagnosis procedure will be undertaken following the HAS 2011 recommendation including brain MRI and biology.</description>
