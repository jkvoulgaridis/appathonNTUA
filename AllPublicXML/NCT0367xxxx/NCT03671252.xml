  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative radiation and chemotherapy is the standard treatment for local advanced rectal
      cancer. The addition of oxaliplatin to capecitabine combined with radiotherapy does not
      improve local control and long-term survival. Most importantly,chemoradiotherapy
      significantly increased surgical complication and poor long-term quality of life .In the
      absence of effective measures of predicting chemo-sensitivity, there is considerable risk of
      using any two-drug regimen for neoadjuvant therapy. Simultaneous use of the three
      chemotherapeutic drugs may be able to reduce the likelihood of resistance to both dual drug
      regimen and single drug regimen. The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and
      safety of three chemotherapeutic regimen known as FOLFOXIRI (the drug 5-fluorouracil,
      oxaliplatin, Irinotecan) with standard radiotherapy combined with capecitabine in neoadjuvant
      therapy for local advanced rectal cancer. The drugs in the FOLFOXIRI regimen are all FDA(Food
      and Drug Administration) approved and have been used routinely to treat patients with
      advanced colorectal cancer.

      Outline: This is a multicenter,prospectively,randomized control ,phase III clinical
      study.Patients are stratified according to the distance from the tumor to the anal
      margin（≤5cm，＞5cm） and randomized to 1 of 2 treatment regimen.Patients will receive full
      supportive care while on this study.

      Objectives：

      Primary: To compare neoadjuvant chemotherpay of FOLFOXIRI with conventional capecitabine
      single-agent radiotherapy in local advanced rectal cancer with respect to 3-year disease free
      survival rate (DFS) .

      Secondary:

        1. To compare postoperative 3-year local recurrence rate, 3-year distance metastasis free
           survival rate, 3-year overall survival between neoadjuvant FOLFOXIRI with capecitabine
           single-agent radiotherapy groups.

        2. To compare R0 Resection rate and surgical complication between the two groups.

        3. To evaluate the tumor regression grade(TRG) between the two groups.

        4. To evaluate the adverse event profile and Long term quality of life between the two
           groups.

    <description>Patient will receive FOLFOXIRI regimen every two weeks for 4-6 cycles within 2-3 months.Two weeks after completing 3 and 6 cycles of FOLFOXIRI regimen,patients will have two efficacy evaluations according to RECIST criteria and toxicity evaluation .If the tumor is defined as no progression without severe toxicity at the first efficacy evaluation, the rest of 3 cycles of FOLFOXIRI regimen will be performed.If it is defined as progression of primary tumor or it is defined as progression of primary tumor and MRF(+)at the second efficacy evaluation,patients are assigned into active comparator group. If distant metastasis occurred during chemotherapy, patients are treated according to the guidelines for metastatic colorectal cancer.Chemotherapy is initiated at 3-4 weeks after R0 resection. XELOX regimen is performed post-operatively (about 4-6 cycles). If postoperative pathology confirmed as positive margin, postoperative chemoradiotherapy was given.</description>
