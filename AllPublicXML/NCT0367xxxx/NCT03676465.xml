  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to assess an approach of self-management called CloudConnect, evaluating the
      impact of CloudConnect Reports on patient engagement, adolescent/parent discussion, and
      clinical outcomes in adolescent Type 1 Diabetes (T1D).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that in contrast to adolescents randomized to the Control Group subjects
      will maintain a Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) while adolescents randomized to receiving the
      CloudConnect Report will have a lowering of HbA1c that is related to the increase in
      adolescent/parent disease-specific engagement. Moreover, the hypothesis is that the subjects
      receiving the CloudConnect Report will increase the engagement of adolescents/ parent through
      increased communication and self-management behavior, and that this increase in engagement
      will lead to improved medical outcomes.

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects will be randomized to either a Control Group or an Experimental Group. Both groups will use a study CGM and activity tracker. MDI users will use an inPen to dispense their insulin treatment with their personal insulin. Subjects who use an insulin pump to care for their diabetes will use their personal pump and their personal insulin during the study. All subjects will be asked to download their equipment each week. The study team will communicate with both the subject and their parent(s) each week to discuss their diabetes management. Subjects will complete questionnaires at the beginning and end of the study.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>It is hypothesized that individuals randomized to the Control Group will initially modestly improve management as a result of either of new access to CGM, but it will return to baseline levels by the 12-week evaluation. By contrast, it is hypothesize that individuals randomized to the Experimental Group will benefit from receiving the weekly CloudConnect Report by having increased engagement and communication by 8 weeks that is sustained by 12 weeks (3 months). The communication will be measured by comparing pre- and post-study Family Communication Inventory questionnaire and the weekly communication assessments.</description>

    <description>Subjects will wear their personal pump (if appropriate), use a study insulin pen (if appropriate), a study CGM and study activity tracker (i.e. Fitbit). Participants will receive a weekly CloudConnect Report based on analysis of the weekly data gathered for each participant. The report will be sent via email once a week to both the subject and their parent(s). Subjects and parents will have weekly contact with the study team. Subjects will complete questionnaires at the beginning and end of the study. These questionnaires will ask subjects about:
the communication within the family about the information shared in this report
how subjects feel when blood sugar is high or low
who takes responsibility of how diabetes care is managed</description>
