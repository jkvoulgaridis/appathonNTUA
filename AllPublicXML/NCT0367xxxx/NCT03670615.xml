  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease are conditions that involve memory
      difficulties. Transcranial direct current stimulation is a type of brain stimulation. It may
      help improve these memory difficulties. However, it works better on active brain areas. This
      study looks at if combining exercise and applying current to important parts of the brain can
      help improve memory in people with Mild Cognitive Impairment or Alzheimer's disease.

      Objectives: To assess the efficacy of a combined exercise and tDCS treatment for improving
      cognitive outcomes in mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's disease.

      Study Design: Eligible participants will be randomized to one of three interventions:
      Exercise primer with tDCS, Treatment as usual (TAU/exercise education) with tDCS, or Exercise
      primer with sham tDCS. Participants randomized to an exercise group will undergo exercise,
      followed by either sham or active tDCS. Participants randomized to TAU will receive written
      information in accordance with the Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines for older adults and
      tDCS for the same duration. Cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms and fasting blood samples
      for biomarker analysis will be collected.

    <time_frame>Change over 2 weeks (Midpoint to Endpoint)</time_frame>
    <description>Biomarkers associated with exercise, tDCS outcomes, angiogenesis and neurogenesis will be obtained from blood work and analyzed using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays.</description>

    <measure>Change in neuropsychiatric symptoms: The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change over 2 weeks (Midpoint to Endpoint)</time_frame>
    <description>A widely used assessment of behavior disturbances in dementia including: apathy, agitation, delusions, hallucinations, depression, euphoria, aberrant motor behavior, irritability, disinhibition, anxiety, sleeping, and eating. Frequency and severity of each symptom is measured using subscales. Frequency and severity are judged using a 4-point scale (ranging from 1-4) and 3-point scale (ranging from 1-3) respectively. A 6-point scale for each symptom is used to evaluate caregiver distress (ranging from 0-5). Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in cognition: n-back reaction time</measure>
    <time_frame>Change over 2 weeks (Midpoint to Endpoint)</time_frame>
    <description>A measure of working memory. Reaction times in milliseconds will be recorded. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in cognition: n-back accuracy</measure>
    <time_frame>Change over 2 weeks (Midpoint to Endpoint)</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Change over 2 weeks (Midpoint to Endpoint)</time_frame>
    <description>Assesses recall memory. Number of words not recalled will be tallied. Word recall scores range from 0 to 10. Higher scores represent a worse outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Change over 2 weeks (Midpoint to Endpoint)</time_frame>
    <description>Assess recognition memory. Words incorrectly recognized will be tallied. Word Recognition scores range from 0 to 12. Higher scores represent a worse outcome.</description>
