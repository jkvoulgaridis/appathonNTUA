  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, 4-visit, subject-masked, 2x3 bilateral crossover, dispensing
      trial. Each study lens will be worn bilaterally in a daily wear (DW) modality for at least 6
      hours per day and 5 days per week for approximately two weeks each. The subject will wear
      either the Test or Control lens twice and the other study lens once.

    <measure>Overall Comfort Score</measure>
    <time_frame>2-Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Overall comfort was assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience™ (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response with a range of 0-120.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Vision Satisfaction in Bright Lighting</measure>
    <time_frame>2-Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Vision satisfaction in bright light was assessed using the individual item&quot; I was satisfied with the quality of my vision in bright lighting&quot; from the CLUE™ questionnaire. This item used the response scale, 1: Strongly Disagree, 2: Disagree, 3: Neither Agree nor Disagree, 4: Agree and 5: Strongly Agree. CLUE is the Contact Lens User Experience™ questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response with a range of 0-120. The Proportion of responses in each category were reported for each lens type.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Distance Monocular LogMAR Visual Acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>2-Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Distance Monocular LogMAR visual acuity was assessed at 4 meters using an ETDRS chart under high illumination low contrast (room illumination &gt; 400 lux and chart luminance 120-200 cd/m2) and low illumination high contrast (room illumination &lt;2.5 lux and chart luminance 2.0 - 5.0 cd/m2 at the 2-week follow-up for each subject eye. The average visual acuity for each lens was reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Contact Lens Fitting Acceptance Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2-Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Contact lens fitting acceptance was assessed for each subject eye using a biomicroscope at all study visits. Lens fit was a binary variable where acceptable lens fit=1 and unacceptable lens fit=0. The percentage of eyes with acceptable lens fit was reported for each lens.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Grade 3 or Higher Slit Lamp Findings</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2-Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Slit Lamp Findings (SLF) were assessed using a biomicroscope and was graded using the FDA grading scale (Grade: 0, 1,2, 3 and 4) with grade 0 represents the absence of findings and 1 to 4 representing successively worse findings (i.e. Grade 1 = trace, Grade 2 = Mild, Grade 3 = moderate and Grade 4 = severe). This was performed on each subject eye at every study visit (baseline, unscheduled visits and 2-week follow-up). The data was then dichotomized into two groups. Those with grade 3 or higher and those with grade 2 or lower. The proportion of eyes with SLF with grade 3 or higher by lens was reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Quality of Vision Indoors</measure>
    <time_frame>2-Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Quality of Vision Indoors was assessed using the individual item&quot; Overall Quality of Vision Indoors&quot; from questionnaire assessing contact lens performance. This item used the response scale, 0: Not Applicable, 1: Excellent, 2: Very Good, 3: Good, 4: Fair and 5: Poor. The Proportion of responses in each category were reported for each lens type.</description>

        <title>Overall Comfort Score</title>
        <description>Overall comfort was assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience™ (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response with a range of 0-120.</description>

This was performed on each subject eye at every study visit (baseline, unscheduled visits and 2-week follow-up). The data was then dichotomized into two groups.

        <title>Overall Handling Scores</title>
        <description>Overall handling was assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience™ (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response with a range of 0-120.</description>
