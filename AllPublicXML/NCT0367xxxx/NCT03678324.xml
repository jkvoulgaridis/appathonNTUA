      The purpose of this research project is:

        -  to use an advanced quantitative MRI technique (FBFI) to detect and quantify brain lesion
           in patients with FD

        -  to use fMRI to identify altered brain function

        -  to use FBFI and fMRI together to map altered connectivity in response to brain lesions

    <textblock>
      Fabry disease (FD) is a lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency in an enzyme that
      degrades components of the outer cell wall. A deficiency of this enzyme in humans has been
      associated with stroke. In males with FD, 6.9% have a stroke by 39 years of age. In females
      with FD, 4.3% have a stroke by 46 years of age.

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the main tool for studying stroke in FD. Importantly, MRI
      has identified other types of lesions in the brain beyond that caused by stroke. These
      additional lesions may herald stroke or be a different manifestation of FD in the brain.
      These lesions are seen in &gt;50% of men and women with FD.

      Diffusion-based imaging MRI has been the leading approach for studying these lesions in FD.
      However, these lesions that appear to be specific to FD are difficult to quantify, analyze,
      and interpret using this and other current MRI methods. The Investigators would like to use a
      form of MRI called fast bound-pool fraction imaging (FBFI), which is a technique better
      suited to capture and quantify these lesions, to study these lesions in patients with FD. In
      parallel, the investigators would like to use functional MRI (fMRI) to study how these
      lesions alter brain function and connectivity in FD. The combination of these techniques
      (FBFI + fMRI) will also provide us the opportunity to study brain plasticity in response to
      injury as Fabry disease is slowly progressive over decades allowing the brain to remodel
      connections to maintain function.
