      This study will determine whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can be used
      alter the amplitude of spontaneous neural activity, and thereby modulate cognitive function
      in healthy adults

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An emerging neurological tool, called transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), has
      recently been shown to safely and effectively enhance cognition in healthy individuals, as
      well as reduce key symptomatology in disorders such as stroke and depression, with only
      negligible side effects. tDCS delivers low-amplitude current to the scalp using small
      electrodes and part of this current passes through the skull and modulates neural activity in
      the underlying brain region. How this tiny amount of electric current acts to improve
      cognitive function and reduce symptoms (e.g., motor impairments in stroke patients with a
      lesion in motor brain areas) is currently unknown, although many investigators across the
      world are now working on this problem. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) offers a unique view of
      neural function, as it can delineate changes in active brain regions with excellent temporal
      resolution (&lt; 1 ms) and high spatial accuracy (2-3 mm). MEG non-invasively measures the
      magnetic fields that emanate from active neocortical cells. The potential of the MEG
      technique to precisely monitor the neural effects of tDCS shows extreme promise, but to date
      the method has been rarely utilized in this area.

      Under this protocol, Modulation of Spontaneous Cortical Activity by tDCS: BRAIN Initiative I,
      approximately 124 participants will provide written informed consent, undergo cognitive and
      behavioral testing and a structural MRI during a single visit, and then return several weeks
      later (2-4 weeks) to complete a short tDCS session followed by a MEG recording (i.e., after
      tDCS). Most participants will return for two more visits, each separated by 2-4 weeks, that
      include a tDCS session followed by a MEG recording (i.e., 4 total visits). The three tDCS-MEG
      visits will be identical except that the nature of the stimulation (e.g., location,
      amplitude, direction/polarity) will be different.
