  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is Part 2 of data collection from 13-25 years old subject population for
      validation of previously derived algorithms. This data will be combined with that collected
      under NCT02957461 (Part 1 with subject age range 18-25 years) for the final analyses of
      validation of the algorithms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EEG, neurocognitive performance and clinical data will be collected at time of injury (within
      3 days) at clinically determined Return to Play (RTP) and 45 days after RTP, for the purpose
      of independently validating the performance of the algorithms developed in prior studies
      (NCT02477943, NCT02661633 and NCTXXXXXX). Data collected under this study will be combined
      with that collected under NCT02957461 for the final analyses of prospective algorithm
      performance in an independent population ages 13-25 years. Subjects will come from the sports
      and other populations of concussed individuals. They will be matched with controls i.e. not
      head injured subjects who will also undergo the same set of tests and the same time intervals
      as the injured subjects. An additional pool of uninjured (not head injured) subjects will be
      collected who will be assessed at a single time point.

    <description>Injured subjects consist of subjects who are head injured and meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Injured subjects will be tested within 72 hours (3 days) of injury and at specified time points post injury. Matched control subjects will be tested at the same time intervals as the injured subject. BrainScope Battery will be performed at each time point and consists of the following components: brain electrical activity (EEG), neurocognitive performance assessment, ocular motor assessment, and clinical symptoms/assessments.</description>

    <description>This subject pool will consist of uninjured (not head injured) subjects and will be tested at a single time point. These subjects will perform the same BrainScope Battery as the injured and matched control subjects.</description>

    <description>The BrainScope Battery evaluation will consist of 4 tests to aid in the assessment of concussion: History, Physical, signs and symptoms (SAC, SCAT5), Electrophysiological Function; Neurocognitive Performance Assessment, Ocular Motor Assessment. BrainScope Ahead 300iP will be used to perform EEG and Cognitive assessments.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        For Injured subjects:
