  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      90 % of the patients with bile duct cancer are not justifiable of a surgical resection with
      curative aim for oncologic reasons ( metastatic extensions), for reasons of resectability
      (canalar extension, vascular) or still for surgically reasons (age, comorbidity).

      The palliative care of these patients consists at first in assuring an effective biliary
      drainage, infectious complications being one of the main causes of death. The biliary
      drainage allows to improve the survival of these patients. It bases by the implementation, by
      the endoscopic or percutaneous way of biliary, generally metallic prosthesis the duration of
      average permeability of which is of approximately 6 months.

      The standard oncologic treatment is the administration of a chemotherapy exclusive or
      associated with a radiotherapy. The radiotherapy and the radio chemotherapy did not show
      efficiency on the survival superior to the exclusive biliary drainage. The first-line
      exclusive chemotherapy bases on the gemcitabine-cisplatin association with a median survival
      of 11,6 months. No study allows to justify the administration of a chemotherapy of the second
      line.

      Thus the preservation of the permeability of the biliary ways is today, the most important
      factor to improve the survival of these patients. Therefore, the addition of a treatment
      allowing to obtain a local tumoral response to the insertion of biliary prosthesis would
      allow to increase the duration of permeability of the biliary prosthesis and would limit the
      local evolution.

      Endoductal destruction tumoral technics were thus developed in this indication:

        1. Dynamic phototherapy which demonstrated, during preliminary studies, a certain
           efficiency both on the tumoral response estimated on the improvement of the tumoral
           stenosis as on the survival in case of cholangiocarcinoma bile ducts not resectables.
           However, the improvement of the survival was not confirmed by wider randomized studies.
           A study randomized of phase III was interrupted prematurely because of a survival
           decreased in the experimental arm.

        2. The radium therapy and the brachytherapy were estimated in this indication with results
           interesting on series limited in size, but is not used in routine because of its cost
           and of technics difficulties.

      Ablation therapy technics (radio frequency, microwaves, radium therapy) percutaneous by
      radiological or surgical way proved their efficiency for the treatment of hepatocarcinoma and
      liver metastasis.

      The hepatic radio frequency was estimated, during trials of phases II, for peripheral
      cholangiocarcinoma intra hepatic (developed at a distance main bile ducts) with interesting
      tumoral rates of necrosis.

      However, the direct percutaneous access of the cholangiocarcinoma of the biliary ways is not
      practicable because of the risk of iatrogenic biliary fistula.

      Therefore, systems allowing to realize ablation therapy by endoductal radio frequency are
      from now on available. It is miniaturized bipolar probes which are inserted into bile ducts
      by reactionary way (retrograde cholangiography), or anterograde percutaneous.

      Two systems (Habib ®, ELLRA ®) are at present available and were estimated during in vitro
      and in vivo studies, to the animal and in man.

      The purposes of this study are to estimate the feasibility, the efficiency and the morbidity
      of the biliary radio frequency for the treatment of the extra hepatic cholangiocarcinoma non
      resectable (resection or transplantation).
