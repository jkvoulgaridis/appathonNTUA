  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In total knee arthroplasty (TKA), the relationship between implant design, soft tissue
      balance, neuromuscular contributions, and rehabilitation strategies on patient satisfaction
      and functional outcomes is highly complex and poorly understood. The investigators will
      prospectively study the effects of these factors using in vivo assessments preoperatively,
      and postoperatively. Computer simulation models will also be used to analyze lower extremity
      biomechanics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is the primary treatment for end-stage knee osteoarthritis and
      effectively relieves pain and improves function after surgery. Nevertheless, as many as 1 in
      5 patients are dissatisfied with the postoperative outcome, and knee instability remains one
      of the top indications for revision surgery. Implant design, soft tissue balance,
      neuromuscular capabilities, and rehabilitation strategies can all influence postoperative
      outcomes. However, the relationship between these factors and the most effective therapeutic
      approach for total knee arthroplasty has yet to be identified. The investigators will study
      preoperative and postoperative functional measures and patient satisfaction along with
      implant design and specific intraoperative data, which may help inform a targeted approach
      for optimal outcomes after total knee arthroplasty and improve future care of patients.
