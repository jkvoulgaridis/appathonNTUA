  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of tranexamic acid (TXA) on blood loss
      and transfusion requirements in patients with femur fractures requiring open surgical
      approaches.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Transfusion requirements as assessed by number of packed red blood cell units received</measure>
    <time_frame>from the time of surgery to hospital discharge (about 3-5 days)</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Surgical blood loss as assessed by change in red blood cell volume</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, while in PACU (which is about 4-6 hours after surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood loss will be determined using the following calculations:
[Patient's Blood Volume (PBV) = (k1 x Height^3 (m)) + (k2 x Weight (kg)) + k3] (- k1 = 0.3669, k2 = 0.03219, and k3 = 0.6041 for men) (- k1 = 0.3561, k2=0.03308, and k3 = 0.1833 for women)
Multiplying the PBV by the hematocrit (Hct) gives the red blood cell (RBC) volume. As such, a change in the RBC volume can be calculated from a change in the Hct level as follows. PACU is post-anesthesia care unit: [Operative RBC volume loss = PBV x (Day of surgery Hct - PACU Hct)]
If a patient requires an intraoperative transfusion, the calculation will be adjusted as follows:
Operative RBC volume loss = [ [PBV x (Day of surgery Hct - PACU Hct)] +)] + (No. of Units Transfused x 0.285) / (Day of surgery Hct - Post-op Hct) / 2) ]</description>
