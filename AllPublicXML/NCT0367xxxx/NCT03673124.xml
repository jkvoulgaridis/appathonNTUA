  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ribociclib (formerly LEE011) is an orally bioavailable, highly selective small molecule
      inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6). Ribociclib has been approved by the
      United States Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) and the European Commission as an
      initial endocrine-based therapy for the treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone
      receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or
      metastatic breast cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor based on a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, international clinical trial (MONALEESA-2). Additional
      marketing authorizations are under review by health authorities. Additional phase III
      clinical trials for the treatment of hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer patients,
      as well as several other phase I or II clinical studies are being conducted.

      Letrozole is a highly potent, orally active non-steroidal competitive inhibitor of the
      aromatase enzyme system. It effectively inhibits the conversion of androgens to estrogens
      both in vitro and in vivo. It is indicated both as first-line treatment of postmenopausal
      women with hormone receptor positive or hormone receptor unknown locally advanced or
      metastatic breast cancer as well as for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in
      postmenopausal women with disease progression following antiestrogen therapy.

      Based on encouraging results in women with advanced hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer,
      a clinical trial for women with recurrent low-grade serous carcinoma is warranted.
      Furthermore, such a trial would have great appeal to women with recurrent low-grade serous
      carcinoma, a cohort with limited therapeutic options. Although low-grade serous carcinoma is
      a rather uncommon histologic subtype, prolonged overall survival results in a relatively high
      prevalence.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Patients eligible for inclusion in this study must meet all of the following criteria:

          1. Patient has signed the Informed Consent (ICF) prior to any screening procedures being
             performed and is able to comply with protocol requirements.

          2. Age &gt; 18 years at time of study entry.

          3. Willingness and ability to comply with study and follow-up procedures.

          4. Histological confirmation of diagnosis of low-grade serous carcinoma of ovary,
             fallopian tube or peritoneum; Original diagnosis of de novo low-grade serous carcinoma
             or Original diagnosis of serous borderline tumor with subsequent diagnosis of
             low-grade serous carcinoma.

             • In order to prevent inclusion of patients with high-grade serous carcinoma,
             diagnosis of low-grade serous carcinoma will be verified as part of screening review
             by a gynecologic pathologist. Tissue for confirmation can be from primary tumor or
             recurrence.

          5. Patient must have recurrent, measurable disease by RECIST v1.1.

          6. There are no restrictions on number of prior therapies.

          7. Patient cannot have previously received a prior cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor
             (CDKi). Patients who were treated with letrozole or another aromatase inhibitor for
             other indications must have not taken the drug for 6 months prior to initiating
             letrozole for this trial and may not have progressed on treatment.

          8. Patients must not have remaining ovarian function to be included. In women who have at
             least one retained ovary, menopause must be confirmed with laboratory confirmation.
             Women who have ovarian function are eligible but must be placed on hormonal
             suppression. Menopause must be confirmed with laboratory confirmation, to include an
             estradiol level as this is assessed within 8 weeks of patient having been on
             tamoxifen.

             neuropathy, any grade alopecia, amenorrhea, or other toxicities not considered a
             safety risk for the patient as per investigator's discretion are eligible. 1. Patient

               -  INR ≤1.5 (unless patient is receiving permitted anticoagulants and the INR is
                  within the therapeutic range of intended use for that anticoagulant within 7 days
                  prior to the first dose of study drug). Serum creatinine &lt;1.5 mg/dL or creatinine

             longer) or participation in any other type of medical research judged not to be
             scientifically or medically compatible with this study. If the patient is enrolled or
             planned to be enrolled in another study that does not involve an investigational drug,
             the agreement of Novartis study medical lead is required to establish eligibility.

         10. Patient is currently receiving warfarin or other coumadin-derived anticoagulant for

             days) of systemic corticosteriods; any durations of topical applications (e.g., for
             rash), inhaled sprays (e.g., for obstructive airways diseases), eye drops or local
             injections (e.g., intra-articular)

         12. Patient who has received radiotherapy ≤4 weeks or limited field radiation for
             palliation ≤2 weeks prior to starting study drug, and who has not recovered to grade 1

         13. Patient has had major surgery within 14 days prior to starting study drug or has not
             recovered from major side effects (tumor biopsy is not considered as major surgery).

         14. Patient with a Child-Pugh score B or C.

         15. Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

         16. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             throughout the study and for 3 weeks after study drug discontinuation. Highly
             effective contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before
                  taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

             Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile
             (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.
             In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
             been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child
             bearing potential.

         17. Current use of food or drugs known to be potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, drugs known to be
             potent CYP3A4 inducers, and drugs that are known to prolong the QT interval unless the
             prohibited concomitant medication can be replaced by other drugs of less potential to
             inhibit or induce CYP3A4 or prolong QT interval (See Appendix C for Prohibited
             Concomitant Medications).

         18. Patients whose tumors contain both low-grade serous carcinoma (LGSC) and high-grade
             serous carcinoma (HGSC)

         19. Patients with history of haemopoietic stem cell or bone marrow transplant.
