  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial researchers want to learn more about the occurrence of pregnancies growing
      outside the womb over the last decade (2009-2018) and the potential risk factors associated
      with pregnancies growing outside the womb. Electronic data in women who were age 15 to 44
      years abstracted from health care systems such as electronic health records (EHR), regional
      claims systems and administrative databases were used to address research questions on ...

        -  occurrence and trends of pregnancies growing outside the womb;

        -  influence of method of contraception used on occurrence and trends of pregnancies
           growing outside the womb;

        -  potential risk factors associated with pregnancies growing outside the womb;

        -  trends in management of pregnancies growing outside the womb over the last decade.

      The overall goal of this study is to assess the incidence rate of ectopic pregnancy over the
      last decade in a representative population of US women and potential risk factors associated
      with ectopic pregnancy.
