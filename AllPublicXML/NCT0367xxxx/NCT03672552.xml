  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Frazier Free Water Protocol (FFWP) using plain, thin (unmodified) water is an accepted
      method to increase fluid intake and hydration in older adults with disordered swallowing and
      dementia.This study aims to take an interdisciplinary approach to see if the FFWP with
      improved oral care can be introduced in a long term care (LTC) setting comparing an
      intervention group with a control group receiving standard oral care, to prevent respiratory
      infections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit a convenience sample of 36 participants from a single
      long-term care facility. Participants will be randomly assigned into control or intervention
      groups. Both groups will be assessed at study onset for swallowing and oral health and
      continue with agreed upon diet texture and fluid modifications. The intervention group (FFWP
      and improved oral hygiene) will receive a dental hygienist cleaning at onset of the study and
      have supervised tooth brushing before thin water between meals. The control group will
      continue with standard oral care and offered the full dental hygienist cleaning at the end of
      the study. If findings indicate no difference between groups on outcome measures (eg.
      respiratory illness, hydration, nutrition) then the intervention is considered efficacious in
      long-term care residents. If improvements in outcome measures are evident for the treatment
      relative to the control group, then this intervention may provide opportunity for improved
      healthcare and cost-savings.

    <intervention_model_description>All study participants will have assessments for swallowing and oral hygiene. The intervention group will have a dental hygiene cleaning and supervised tooth brushing before taking plain, thin (unmodified) water and between meals.

    <masking>Single (Participant)</masking>
    <masking_description>Participants may identify with the study receiving more oral care than previously but not know if they are in the intervention or control group. Clinicians performing swallowing and oral health assessments will not know which participants are randomly assigned to groups. Nursing staff will be performing daily care on all participants as specified in daily nursing protocols and may have more oral care but may not identify whether a participant is in the intervention or control group except some staff will be adding supervised brushing before plain (thin) water and between mealtimes.</masking_description>
