  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research study is being done so we can determine the quality of the protein present in
      Rice, Wheat, Chickpeas and Lentils. Amino acids are the building blocks of protein and
      protein quality is determined by the amount of amino acids present and by their
      bioavailability (their absorption and use by the body). Some amino acids are essential which
      means they must be obtained from the diet. If any one of the essential amino acids is missing
      in the diet, the body cannot make proteins that are used to repair tissue build bone, teeth,
      etcâ€¦ Rice, Wheat, Chickpeas and Lentils as a food source contain low amounts of the essential
      amino acid methionine (Chickpeas and Lentils) and lysine (Rice and Wheat) which makes its
      protein incomplete. The amino acids in Rice, Wheat, Chickpeas and Lentils are also affected
      by cooking. Our objective is to determine the amount of methionine in Rice and Wheat and the
      amount of lysine in Chickpeas and Lentils that the body can use.

      This research is being done in order to bridge the gap between knowledge of protein
      requirement and the amount of food needed to meet that requirement. Results from this study
      will be important for recommendations guiding food choices of Rice, Wheat, Chickpeas and
      Lentils as a major protein source in the diet.

      Previously the quality of dietary protein for human consumption was studied in animals. This
      study is being done in humans because studies in animals are not always directly applicable
      to humans. Plant protein sources like rice, wheat, chickpeas and lentils are important
      protein sources shown to &quot;enhance ecosystem resilience, and improve human health.

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will participate in 7 different experiments for
      each food. For each food you will receive 3 different amounts of Rice, Wheat, Chickpeas or
      Lentils which will contain different amounts of the essential amino acid methionine (Rice or
      Wheat) or lysine (Chickpeas or Lentils).

      The quality of the protein in the Rice, Wheat, Chickpeas or Lentils will be compared to the
      quality of a reference protein (egg protein) by giving you 4 reference diets containing amino
      acids made up like the amino acids in egg protein. The amount of Rice, Wheat, Chickpeas or
      Lentils you receive will be provided in a random order.

      Each experiments will be conduced over 3 days- 2 adaptation days where you will receive the
      diets at home, provided by the investigators and 1 study day. On the 3rd day (study day) you
      will visit the Clinical Research Center (CRC) at the Hospital for Sick Children where you
      will receive 9 hourly meals. Breath samples will be collected after the 4th meal in 15 min
      intervals for 1 hour. Breath collection will resume again two and a half hours after the 5th
      meal every 15 minutes until 30 minutes after the last meal. A total of 52 breath samples will
      be collected during each of the 3rd study day.

      Before the study begins, you will visit the CRC at the Hospital for Sick Children for a
      baseline study assessment. At that time your body composition (fat and fat-free mass) will be
      measured and your resting energy expenditure will be measured. This will tell us the amount
      of calories your body need so we can prepare the diets for you for each experiment. This
      baseline assessment takes about 2 hours.
