    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, interventional, open-label, single arm, non-randomized trial
      treating 30 patients with peripheral or mixed neuropathic corneal pain at their baseline exam
      and following 45 days and 90 days of daily use with the TrueTear™ ITN device.

      The investigators hypothesize that the stimulation through the ethmoidal nerve in the nasal
      cavity may have an inhibitory effect on the primary TG interneurons and block the ocular pain
      signaling to the brain.

      The investigators propose a non-randomized, open-label, single arm pilot trial for treatment
      of neuropathic corneal pain (NCP) with ITN with the following specific aims:

      Specific Aims:

        1. To elucidate the efficacy of ITN in ameliorating pain among neuropathic corneal pain
           patients.

        2. To elucidate the safety, efficacy, longevity of ITN in ameliorating pain among
           neuropathic corneal pain patients during a 90-day period with daily use.

        3. To assess quality of life changes by treating neuropathic corneal pain with ITN during a
           90-day period with daily use.

    <description>Ocular Pain Assessment Survey (OPAS) is a multidimensional 32-questions, 8-domain questionnaire using numerical rating scales to assess eye pain intensity (worse eye) in the past 24 hours and 2 weeks (worst, least and average pain intensity), frequency of eye and non-eye pain (past 24 hours and 2 weeks), non-eye pain intensity (past 24 hours and 2 weeks), impact on QoL, pre-occupation with eye and non-eye pain, aggravating factors and associated factors.</description>

    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>IDEEL Quality of Life Questionnaire is a 27-item questionnaire, designed specifically for DED and is divided into three parts. It assesses the quality of life in three aspects of life for the previous 2 weeks: daily activities, work and feelings. The quality of life is assessed on a scale of 0-5, with zero being inability to do the activity. The score is calculated between 0 - 100 with higher scores indicating a better quality of life.</description>
