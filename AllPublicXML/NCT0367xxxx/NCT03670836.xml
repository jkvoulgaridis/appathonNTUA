  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if Dilapan works as well as Misoprostol for
      preparing the mouth of the uterus (cervix) for inducing labor in women who need to undergo
      this procedure. The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of Dilapan for cervical
      ripening compared to Misoprostol in women undergoing Induction of labor (IOL) at or more than
      37 weeks gestation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In developed nations 25 % of pregnant women undergo labor induction for various indications.
      Likelihood of vaginal delivery depends on the degree of ripeness of cervix. Majority of women
      undergoing induction of labor are candidates for cervical ripening. Dilapan is an osmotic
      hygroscopic dilator of cervix commonly used for cervical preparation for mid trimester
      abortions. It has been proven safe for use for induction of Labor (IOL) at term. Misoprostol
      is a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analogue, widely used for cervical ripening and IOL in United
      States and is considered as standard of care.

      This is a non-inferiority, unblinded randomized, controlled trial where 322 eligible
      participants undergoing IOL at &gt;37 weeks gestation and admitted to labor and delivery unit
      will be enrolled and randomly assigned in a ratio 1:1 to either receive Dilapan or
      Misoprostol for cervical ripening.

      After randomization all participants will undergo assessment as per standard of care.
      Participants will have either 1-5 Dilapan rods inserted into their cervix by the providers or
      receive 25 mcg of misoprostol orally every 2 hours to a maximum of 6 doses over 12 hours.
      Participants will be evaluated for artificial rupture of membranes and initiation of oxytocin
      for inducing uterine contraction. A diagnosis of failed IOL will be made if patient does not
      go into active labor within 24 hours after initiation of Oxytocin and Artificial Rupture Of
      Membranes (AROM). Intrapartum management will be according to institutional guidelines. All
      participants will be followed up and contacted by phone 2 weeks after discharge regarding
      their experience with the method of induction.

    <description>The Bishop Score (also known as Pelvic Score) is the most commonly used method to rate the readiness of the cervix for induction of labor. The Bishop Score gives points to 5 measurements of the pelvic examination dilation, effacement of the cervix, station of the fetus, consistency of the cervix, and position of the cervix. It ranges from 0 to 13. Higher score is associated with increased likelihood of vaginal delivery.</description>
