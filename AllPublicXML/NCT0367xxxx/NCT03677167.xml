  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients suffer from chronic heel pain, and studies have not yet found the most
      appropriate treatment. There are some researchers who claim that the pain is caused by
      weakness in the muscles of the foot, which causes increased pressure in the heel. In walking,
      the muscles of the foot are activated and strengthened. No research has yet been done on
      whether walking (barefoot or with shoes) on a treadmill reduces pain in the heel and improves
      function.

    <textblock>
      A bare foot functions differently than a foot in a shoe while walking, as there are
      differences in movement, muscle tone, pressure and sensation. Wearing shoes over the years
      can cause changes in walking and pain. In the examination of the feet of patients suffering
      from chronic pain in the heel was found a smaller volume of muscle, and calcification in the
      heel area that could be caused by increased pressure. Although the trend of physiotherapy
      treatments has changed in recent years from passive to active treatments, the overwhelming
      majority of studies are testing passive therapies only as a treatment option for chronic heel
      pain. Barefoot walking has not been tested as an option for treating chronic pain in the
      heel, although there are studies indicating that bare feet lead to reduced heel pressure,
      increased muscle work, and better proprioception.The purpose of this study is to examine the
      effect of barefoot walking on the level of pain, function and pain threshold for stress in
      patients with chronic heel pain.

    <intervention_model_description>The study will include 52 subjects with heel pain for more than 12 weeks. The subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: a barefoot walking group on a treadmill and a walking group in shoes on a treadmill. The subjects will receive treatment twice a week at the Meuhedet Health Fund Institute for 4 weeks. All subjects will be instructed to walk on the treadmill until they reach level 6 on the Short Borg Scale. In addition, all subjects will receive an ultrasound treatment for 5 minutes each session. Before and after the intervention, the subjects will complete the SF-36 questionnaire, and will assess the level of pain they experience on the heel during initial treading down from the bed in the morning. In addition, the minimum pain threshold and pain tolerance will be checked with an algometer at relevant points in the heel and the speed and walking time will be documented.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>This is a questionnaire consisting of eight separate parts, each section examining a different aspect of quality of life. In the evaluation of pain in the heel, it is customary to use a part that assesses functional function, and in part that evaluates physical pain. The score ranges from 0 - very low, to 100 - very high. A change of 7.8 points indicates a change in the level of pain and physical function.</description>

    <description>The ladder is 10 cm long, and the patient must surround the number that corresponds to his or her pain intensity, 0 - does not hurt at all, and 10 - the most severe and intolerable pain. When a change of 1.4 cm out of 10 cm indicates a change in the patient's pain level</description>

    <measure>change in results of Three clinical tests to diagnose chronic pain in the heel, from baseline to 4 weeks and 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>before intervention, after 4 weeks of intervention, after 4 weeks from the end of intervention (i.e. baseline to 4 weeks of intervention and 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Three clinical trials have been found to be relevant to the diagnosis of chronic heel pain. All the tests listed below are performed on the painful leg and until the first sensation of pain (p1) is produced:
Static standing on one leg: measuring the number of seconds (up to 20 sec) and the level of pain on a visual analog scale (VAS);
Crouching on one leg: measuring the number of repetitions (up to10 rep) and the level of pain according to VAS;
Ascension on fingertips: Measuring the number of repetitions (up to10 rep) and the level of pain according to VAS.
It was found that when pain is produced in one of the above tests, the patient may be diagnosed with chronic heel pain. The results options for all of the above tests are &quot;positive&quot; (if at least one of the tests creates pain) or &quot;negative&quot; (if non of the tests creates pain)</description>
