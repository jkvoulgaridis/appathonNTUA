  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity is widely documented as one of the cornerstones of Cystic Fibrosis (CF)
      management as it is directly linked to mortality and quality of life. Levels of physical
      inactivity and sedentary behaviour have been poorly investigated among the CF population in
      Ireland. The measurement of these behaviours is important in order to monitor prevalence
      amongst people with CF (PWCF) and determine methods by which health care providers can assist
      with maintaining and enhancing physical activity.

      The use of physical activity monitoring can provide health care providers with insightful
      real world analysis of physical activity and exercise behaviours. Over the last decade there
      has been many advancements in technology and fitness tracking with positive results being
      demonstrated in the healthy population and in chronic diseases such as Diabetes Mellitus II,
      post surgery and Multiple Sclerosis. Limited research has been conducted among PWCF to date.

      The aim of this research project is to examine physical activity levels amongst PWCF and
      determine the effect of a 12 week randomised parallel intervention on a number of health
      outcomes.

      Participants will be provided with an accelerometer to assess physical activity and sedentary
      behaviour at baseline. The participants will then undergo further baseline testing to
      determine exercise capacity, body composition, quality of life, breathlessness, sleep quality
      and wellbeing. Baseline short and long term goals will be established together with the
      participant and physiotherapist.

      Participants will then be randomly allocated to either the intervention or the comparator. A
      researcher independent of the recruitment process (MC) will complete the first random
      allocation using a sealed opaque envelope. Following this a minimisation randomisation
      procedure will be completed based on lung function, where FEV1 of &lt;70% predicted lung
      function will be classified as having mild lung disease. While those with an FEV1 of 30-50%
      predicted lung function will be classified as having moderate lung disease, with &lt;30%
      indicating severe lung disease. Allocation will be revealed after recruitment and baseline
      assessments have occurred.

      Both groups will receive a fitness tracker which will be linked to an online monitoring
      system (Fitabase) for 24 weeks.

      The intervention group will receive personalised feedback via a text message every week on
      their physical activity levels as measured by their fitness tracker and progress on
      attainment of their goals established at the start of the study. Feedback will be provided
      from their CF physiotherapists.

      The comparator group will not receive any feedback on their Fitbit data. After 12 weeks both
      groups will be re-assessed. Thereafter, both groups will continue with the Fitbits alone for
      12 weeks. Finally outcome measures including lung function, physical activity levels, aerobic
      capacity, quality of life, sleep quality, muscle mass and well-being will be re-assessed
      again at 24 weeks.

      Following the intervention semi structured interviews will be conducted to qualitatively
      establish satisfaction with the interventions and provide insight into barriers and enablers
      to achieving goals and physical activity levels.The results of this study may provide
      valuable insights into potential interventions to optimise the health and well-being of PWCF.
