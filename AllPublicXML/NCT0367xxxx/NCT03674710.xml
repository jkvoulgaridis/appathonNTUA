  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare endoscopic ultrasound guided-fine needle aspiration
      (EUS-FNA) with a standard 22-gauge needle using &quot;standard suction&quot;, &quot;slow-pull&quot; and &quot;wet
      suction&quot; for thoracic/abdominal solid/solid-cystic lesions. Investigators intend to compare
      the effectiveness and safety of the three methods in order to discover the optimized
      technique for obtaining diagnostic material and making accurate diagnosis.
