  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LLR was applied for tumors located at the lower edge and lateral segments of the liver that
      could be resected more easily than posterosuperior segments. With the development of
      technology and the growing experience of hepatobiliary surgeons, LLR has been expanded to
      major liver resections, anatomical resections, and donor hepatectomies by skilled surgeons.
      However, due to the concerns over the risk of operative bleeding, tumor seeding and positive
      resection margin, the true benefit of LLR remains unclear across surgical community.

      The 2nd International Consensus Conference on Laparoscopic Liver Resection (ICCLLR) was held
      in Morioka, Japan, in 2014. The new recommendations of the ICCLLR state that the outcomes of
      LLR are not inferior than OLR regarding to operative mortality rate and margin negativity,
      and are superior in decreasing postoperative complications, blood loss, and the length of the
      postoperative hospital stay. However, it is not clear that whether LLR is able to alleviate
      the impairment of liver function after hepatic resection, and there is no RCTs to compare the
      short and long outcomes between LLR and OLR.
