  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to study the level of high-sensitivity CRP in sera of pre-diabetic
      and newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and its correlation with HOMA IR
      and HbA1c

      This study will include (180) subjects, 60 pre-diabetic patients, 60 patients with newly
      diagnosed type 2 diabetes ( within one month of diagnosis) and 60 normal healthy non diabetic
      individuals as a control group. The study individuals will be recruited from the Diabetes and
      Internal Medicine Clinics of Fayoum University Hospital
