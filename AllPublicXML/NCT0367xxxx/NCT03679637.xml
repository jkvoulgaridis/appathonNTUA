  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As aphasia is one of the most common and disabling disorders following stroke, in many cases
      resolving in long-term deficits, it is now thought that intensive aphasia therapy is
      effective, even in the chronic phase following stroke. However, as intensive aphasia
      rehabilitation is difficult to achieve in clinical practice, tablet-based aphasia therapies
      are explored to further facilitate language recovery. Although there is mounting evidence
      that computer-based treatments are effective, it is also important to assess the feasibility,
      usability and acceptability of these technologies, especially in the acute phase post stroke.
      The investigators assume that tablet-based aphasia therapy is a feasible treatment option for
      patients with aphasia in the acute phase following stroke. The researchers also believe that
      the specific app that will be used in therapy is user-friendly and that it will be well
      accepted by this specific patient population.

      The study is a prospective study, with each participant undergoing testing approximately
      within three days after inclusion in the study (immediately prior to tablet-based aphasia
      therapy). Based on the results of diagnostic testing (standard of care in the acute phase),
      therapy will be tailored for each individual. After two short training sessions, patients
      will independently practice with the app during hospitalisation, guided by a user-friendly
      instruction sheet. Patients will be encouraged to practice as much as possible, with a
      minimum of 30 minutes per day. Exercises will be selected by the speech-language therapist
      based on diagnostic results and will be adjusted for difficulty and type of exercise during
      treatment based on performance rates. the aim of the study is to investigate the feasibility,
      usability and acceptability of a tablet-based aphasia therapy in patients with aphasia in the
      acute phase following stroke.
