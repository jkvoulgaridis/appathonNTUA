  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims at optimizing the long-term and extended management of patients with a first
      episode of venous thromboembolism (proximal deep vein thrombosis with or without pulmonary
      embolism) (VTE). Patients at high risk of recurrence (with altered D-dimer test), who had
      received anticoagulation (whatever the drug used) for 12-15 months after the first episode of
      thrombosis, will be treated with Apixaban 2,5 mg x 2 for 18 months as extended treatment.
      Patients at low risk, with normal D-dimer test, will stop anticoagulation definitely.

      This prospective cohort study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of a management
      procedure to decide on giving or not an extended anticoagulation (administering apixaban 2
      2.5 mg twice daily ) to outpatients with a single episode of proximal deep vein thrombosis of
      the lower limbs and/or pulmonary embolism who had received 12-15 months of anticoagulation
      (whatever the anticoagulant drug used). The study seeks to assess whether a management
      procedure involving D-dimer testing assessment can identify a subset of subjects at low risk
      of recurrence in whom an extended anticoagulation can be safely avoided.

    <intervention_model_description>The patients included in the study will receive a serial determination of D-dimer assay (a maximum of four determinations in case of negative results).The D-dimer measurements should be performed at the moment of patient screening, when patients still assume their anticoagulant treatment (T0), at 15±2 days (T1), 30±4 days (T2), and 60±5 (T3) days after their anticoagulant treatment has been stopped. At the first positive D-dimer result patients resume anticoagulation with apixaban 2.5 mg bis in die for the next 18 months. Patients with negative D-Dimer results at all determinations stop anticoagulation definitely and will followed up for the next 18 months.</intervention_model_description>

The presence of venous ulcer of the leg or a score &gt; of 15 points indicate the occurrence of severe post-thrombotic syndrome. The maximum score is 33. The score from 5 to 9 points indicate mild post-thrombotic syndrome and from 10 to 15 points indicate moderate post-thrombotic syndrome</description>
