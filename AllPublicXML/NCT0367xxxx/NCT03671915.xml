  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, three-center, randomized, two-session, 4 days inpatient and 6-week follow-up
      home study phase, crossover study comparing Diabeloop closed-loop (CL) system and
      sensor-augmented pump (SAP) therapy.

      The follow-up home study phase will be done only in French centers for a sub study. During
      this session, patient wearing the closed-loop system will benefit of a 24h/24, 7 d/7, remote
      monitoring follow-up by specialized nurses, under supervision of a diabetologist. A
      visualization of glucose CGM curves, insulin delivery, meal and physical activity
      announcements will be available online through secured website, and the system will send
      automated message in case of predetermined situations as persistent too high or too low Blood
      Glucose (BG). Custom settings will be possible by the nurses during the follow-up period.

    <description>Diabeloop software embeds a regulation algorithm to automatically regulate the patient's glycaemia. It takes as input glycaemia value received every 5 minutes from the CGM and patient inputs related to meals and physical activities and it calculates the amount of insulin to be delivered. It sends this information to the pump that automatically delivers this quantity.</description>
