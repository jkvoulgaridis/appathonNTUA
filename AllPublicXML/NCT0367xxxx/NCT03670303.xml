  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is planned to test an educational intervention promoting the use of spectacles
      among secondary school children. It is based on the hypothesis that educating teachers,
      parents and children about the importance of wearing spectacles has the potential to increase
      spectacle wear among children.Reasons for non-compliance towards spectacle use will be
      explored and educational intervention will be planned considering these reasons. Educational
      intervention will increase awareness about the importance of spectacles use and reduce the
      barriers towards spectacle use.Reducing barriers will increase compliance towards spectacles
      use which will ultimately prevent the avoidable visual impairment.

      Aim of this research is to improve school performance and quality of life of children with
      refractive errors. Planned research will be carried out in Public Sector Secondary Schools of
      Islamabad and vision of 1200 students (600 girls and 600 boys) will be tested.Students having
      vision â‰¤ 6/9 will receive cycloplegic auto refraction and prescription of spectacles will be
      given after subjective refraction ( 3 days after cycloplegia ). Follow-up at three months
      after prescribing spectacles will find out compliance towards spectacles. Non-compliant
      students will be given a questionnaire to provide the reasons for non-compliance towards
      spectacles. Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) will be conducted with non-compliant students,
      their teachers and parents to explore reasons of non compliance.

      On the basis of information obtained from FGDs an educational intervention will be planned
      for these students to explain importance of spectacles. Through stratified randomization
      schools will be assigned to intervention and control groups. Educational intervention will be
      given to intervention group Three months after the intervention compliance pre and post
      intervention in intervention group and between two groups will be compared to assess
      effectiveness of intervention.

    <description>Educational intervention will be given by trained optometrists to participants (requiring spectacles) their parents and teachers. Duration of Intervention will be about one hours and it includes:
Lectures on importance of spectacles use including visual materials such as pictures and videos.
An interactive classroom based demonstration carried out by trained optometrist. Children will be asked to read from blackboard, written to be visible with 6/6 vision, while seated at a distance of 6m. After this children will be given their glasses and asked to read again. The purpose of this demonstration is to make children aware of their poor vision and of the potential impact of corrected VA.
