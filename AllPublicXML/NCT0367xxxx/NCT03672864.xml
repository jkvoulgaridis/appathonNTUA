  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, single blind, parallel group, randomized control trial to determine if early,
      intensive leg exercise delivered by a physical therapist and a parent in combination improves
      gross motor function more than standard of care.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized controlled trial at 3 healthcare centres: Edmonton, Calgary and
      Ottawa. The period of participation for each child is 12 months. The Immediate Group will
      have 3 months of intervention and 9 months follow-up. The Delay Group will be followed for 6
      months (control period), then given the opportunity to receive the same intervention and
      followed for 3 months after the intervention.

      The intervention will be delivered by clinicians in the rehabilitation centres in partnership
      with the child's parents. Therapists will provide training 2 days a week and will coach the
      parents to provide the training at home for 2 days a week.

      The intervention will consist of child-initiated, intensive leg activities for one hour a
      day, four days a week for 12 weeks.

    <measure>Change in stiffness at the ankle</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will use a newly developed device for measuring spasticity, called Portable Spasticity Assessment Device (PSAD). A hand-held segment of the device is applied to a limb segment to measure the forces applied by the hand to the limb and the motion of the limb. Disposable, surface electromyographic electrodes are applied to the skin of the limb to measure the muscle activity. In this way, the reflex contractions and the stiffness of the limb can be measured simultaneously. The data is recorded in real time on a laptop computer and saved for further analysis.</description>

    <description>Intensive, child-initiated movement of the lower extremity: 1 hour/day, 4 days/week, 2 sessions delivered by a physical therapist, 2 delivered by a parent. All activities are play based, and exercise intensity is enhanced by small weights placed on the dorsum of the foot and the ankle of the affected limb. Intervention is delivered over 12 weeks for a target of 48 hours of training.</description>
