    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of auricular neurostimulation via an non-invasive
      percutaneous electrical nerve field stimulator (PENFS) in adolescents with functional nausea.
      A neurostimulator is applied to the outer ear and stimulates several nerves that are thought
      to be involved in transmission of nausea and vomiting signals. Half of the study subjects
      will receive an active nerve stimulator while the other half will receive an inactive one.

    <textblock>
      By stimulating branches of several cranial nerves in the outer ear, this study aims to
      improve symptoms and quality of life in adolescents with functional nausea.

      The study has the following specific aims:

        1. To define adolescent functional nausea into subtypes based on clinical characterization
           and physiologic testing.

        2. Evaluating the efficacy of auricular neurostimulation via PENFS for functional nausea.
           Subjects will be randomized into two groups: 1) neurostimulation versus 2) sham. They
           will receive either an active or non-active (sham group) device for 5 days each week x 4
           weeks total. Those who do not improve will receive an additional 4 weeks of therapy with
           active stimulation.

        3. Investigate possible brain functional connectivity changes induced by auricular
           neurostimulation compared to patients with irritable bowel syndrome and healthy controls

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Nausea Severity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline Nausea Severity Scale score at 4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Measures 1) frequency of nausea on a scale 0-4 over past week (0=not at all; 4=every day), 2) average number of nausea episodes/day over past week on a scale 0-4 (0=none; 4=constant), 3) average duration of nausea episodes over past week on scale 0-4 (0=none; 4=most or all of day) and 4) severity of nausea on scale 0-10 (0=none;10=most nausea possible). The severity subscale is converted to a 5 point scale ranging from 0-4. The mean of all 4 subscales yields a total score ranging from 0 to 4, with a higher score indicating more severity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Nausea Profile</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline total Nausea Profile score at 4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Measures 3 dimensions of nausea (Emotional, GI and Somatic distress) with 17 items. Each sub scale is measured on a 10-point scale from 0-9 (0=not at all; 9=severely). Total score is calculated as follows: actual score/153 * 100%. Subscales are similarly computed into a percentage score. Higher percentage indicates worse outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Baxter Retching Faces scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline Baxter Retching Faces scale score at 4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Measures daily nausea severity on a pictorial faces scale from 0-10 (0=no nausea; 10=most nausea possible). Weekly averages will be computed and change from baseline to average severity during last week of therapy will be assessed. Higher values indicate worse outcome.</description>
