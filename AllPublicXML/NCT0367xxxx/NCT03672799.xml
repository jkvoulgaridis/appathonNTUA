  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the efficacy of the Rehabilitation Planning Consult (RPC) to achieve
      key rehabilitation outcomes in survivors of head and neck cancer compared to a waiting list
      control group. The RPC is a consultative intervention that teaches survivors to use
      self-management and problem solving strategies to meet and attain individualized goals.
      Follow-through with plans and goal attainment are facilitated by a Rehabilitation Consultant.
      Results from this study will be used to plan for a larger multi-site trial and subsequent
      real world implementation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Survivors of head and neck cancer (HNC) often have significant impairments, functional
      limitations, and reduced quality of life (QL). Rehabilitation services, such as
      speech-language pathology to improve swallowing, physiotherapy to improve neck mobility, and
      occupational therapy to enable return to work, can effectively reduce the impact of
      impairments, restore function, and improve QL. However, access to rehabilitation for
      survivors of HNC is extremely limited. A trans-professional self-management program is needed
      to provide resources, links to community providers, and instruction in problem-solving
      strategies. The program should fit seamlessly into the cancer care system with minimal
      additional resources. To meet these specifications, an innovative intervention, the
      Rehabilitation Planning Consult (RPC), was developed and evaluated. The RPC is delivered in 1
      to 2 sessions and, in a single arm pilot study, had a moderate to large effect on several
      aspects of QL and individualized goal attainment. It remains unknown whether the RPC is
      efficacious in comparison to standard care. In preparation for a Phase III trial, the effect
      of the RPC, as compared to a standard care control will be estimated, on HNC survivors' QL,
      attainment of individualized goals, and self-efficacy related to self-management. To
      facilitate recruitment and ensure ethical provision of services, participants will be
      randomized to a waiting list control (WLC) or RPC. Assessments will be conducted at three
      time points for the RPC group and four times for the WLC group. Based on pilot data,
      approximately 43% of the RPC group are expected to achieve a minimal important difference
      (MID) in QL, thus 56 participants per arm, 112 participants total, will be recruited. The
      primary outcome will be QL related to physical health, measured using the SF-36 Physical
      Component Summary Score (PCS). Secondary measures will include individualized goal
      performance measured using the Brief Rehabilitation Assessment for Survivors of HNC,
      disease-specific QL measured with the FACT-HN, and self-efficacy.

    <description>The 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) is a self-report generic quality of life measure. The SF-36 has eight domains with scores ranging from 0 to 100, higher scores indicate greater self-reported quality of life. The proportion of participants achieving minimal important difference on the Physical Composite Summary score in the RPC group and WLC group will be analyzed.</description>

    <description>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Head and Neck (FACT-H&amp;N) is a self-report disease-specific quality of life measure. The FACT-H&amp;N covers 5 domains of quality of life: a) physical well being (score range 0-28), b) social/family well being (score range 0-28), c) emotional well being (score range 0-24), d) functional well being (score range 0-28), and e) head and neck cancer subscale (score range 0-40). A total score can be calculated by adding the 5 subscale scores (total score range 0-148). Higher scores indicate greater better outcomes.</description>

    <description>The RPC is a trans-disciplinary, consultative intervention. In the RPC, individualized rehabilitation needs are established, goals are set, strategies to achieve the goals are developed, and follow-through with strategies and goal attainment is facilitated by a rehabilitation professional who consults and collaborates with the survivor. The Rehabilitation Consultant does not provide hands-on treatment, but rather determines the survivors' priority individualized rehabilitation goals, and then helps devise a plan for the survivor to meet those goals independently.
Participants allocated to RPC will receive a 1 hour consultation with the Rehabilitation Consultant and second consultation 2 to 12 weeks later.</description>
