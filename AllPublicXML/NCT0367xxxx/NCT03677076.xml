    <textblock>
      This study is for patients with metastatic prostate cancer receiving radium-223 as their
      standard of care therapy. The researchers will collect blood and urine samples from patients
      before, during and after the radium-223 therapy. The researchers will compare these samples
      to observe how the treatment has affected different cancer markers.

      This study proposes to document the presence of clonal emergence and regression during
      radium-223 therapy for metastatic prostate cancer by serial ctDNA analysis of
      tumor-associated mutations, using the clinically-available Guardant 360 platform. These data
      may provide important mechanistic insights into radium-223 therapy by 1) identifying
      mutations associated with radium-223 resistance or sensitivity, 2) providing new markers of
      treatment response in an individual, and 3) revealing antitumor effects from radium-223 that
      are not easily recognized with standard tumor response metrics. Positive finding based on
      this clinically-available platform will be readily applied by the oncology treatment
      community.
