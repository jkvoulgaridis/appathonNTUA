      The aim of the trial is to compare the objective response rates of FUDR/Oxaliplatin HAI plus
      CPT-11 and FOLFOXIRI chemotherapy in patients with initially non-resectable metastatic
      colorectal cancer liver metastases. The patients will be treated with systemic FOLFOXIRI
      chemotherapy or FUDR/Oxaliplatin hepatic arterial infusion with CPT-11 systemic chemotherapy.

      Previous studies and our experience have proved the efficacy and safety of systemic
      chemotherapy combined with hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) with floxuridine and dexamethasone
      in patients with initially unresectable colorectal liver metastasis. Hepatic arterial
      infusion oxaliplatin trials have been done with oxaliplatin alone and in combination with
      irinotecan, 5-FU/LV, and mitomycin-C and have showed that Hepatic arterial infusion
      oxaliplatin and FUDR could increase response rate and resection rate for colorectal liver
      metastasis. Therefore, we designed this study to compare objective response rates of
      FUDR/Oxaliplatin HAI plus CPT-11 and FOLFOXIRI chemotherapy in patients with initially
      non-resectable metastatic colorectal cancer liver metastases.
