      This study investigates the brain response to a single acute dose of AZD7325, a GABA-A
      positive allosteric modulator, compared to a single dose of placebo in adults with and
      without autism spectrum disorder.

      Previous research suggests that GABAergic drug compounds could shift brain excitation and
      inhibition (E-I) in the healthy brain and in neurodevelopmental psychiatric conditions, such
      as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) - where this balance is disrupted. A study by Ajram et al.
      (2017) has shown an E-I shifted towards more GABA in individuals with ASD, and not in
      controls, after a single dose of the anti-glutamatergic and pro-GABAergic drug Riluzole.
      Moreover, brain connectivity patterns in ASD patients where shifted towards the ones observed
      in the control group. However, it was unclear whether this changes could be driven by GABA
      receptors, thus more specific probes may help to clarify the mechanism underlying the E-I
      coordination in ASD. Therefore, this study will use neuroimaging and electrophysiology to
      investigate the brain E-I coordination in ASD compared to control participants when the
      system is responding to a single dose of the specific GABA-A (AZD7325) receptor agonist. 50
      adult individuals with ASD and 50 neurotypical adults (25 males and 25 females per group)
      will be invited to participate. Each participant will receive a single dose of the drug (10mg
      or 20mg AZD7325) or matched placebo. Brain activity and neurochemistry will be investigated
      using magnetic resonance imaging. Further data will be collected through questionnaires,
      behavioural tasks, blood samples, and sensory tasks using electroencephalography and retinal
      imaging.

        1. Diagnosis of ASD confirmed on the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) if a
        relative is available and/or on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).

        For all relatives:

          1. Aged under 18 years.

          2. Does not know the participant personally at present or in their childhood.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        For all participants

          1. History of allergy/idiosyncrasy to AZD7325 or chemically related compounds or
             excipients which may be employed in the study or to any other drug used in the past.

          2. Subject has taken systemically (po, iv) any potent or moderate CYP3A4 or CYP2C9
             inhibitor or inducer, 1 month prior to screening (topical or inhaled are permitted)

             be excluded from the study.

          9. Intelligence Quotient below 70.

        Reproductive safety: Male study participants who are sexually active should avoid
        procreation for 1 week after study drug administration. Avoidance of procreation can be
        through use of a highly effective contraception method by the study participant or by the
        partner. In this case, effective means of contraception are defined as tubal occlusion,
        copper banded intrauterine device, levonorgestrel medicated intra uterine system (e.g.,
        Mirena), medroxyprogesterone injections (e.g. Depo-Provera), etonogestrel implants (e.g.,
        Implanon, Norplan), normal and low dose combined oral contraceptive pills, norelgestromin /
        EE transdermal system, intravaginal device (e.g., EE and etonogestrel) and desogestrel
        (Cerazette).

        Pregnancy or breastfeeding (is a routine exclusion for research MRI scanning). Female study
        participants must be willing to use one form of highly effective non-hormonal contraception
        for one week after study drug administration. This would include a vasectomised partner
        (sole partner), tubal occlusion, intrauterine system [IUS]/hormonal coil or copper
        containing intrauterine device or copper containing IUD, or true abstinence (when this is
        in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject). Women should have been
        stable on their chosen method of birth control for a minimum of 2 months before entering
        the study. Participants must agree to undergo a pregnancy test prior to each administration
        of study drug.

        For individuals with ASD:

          1. ASD caused by a known genetic syndrome, e.g. Fragile X, 22q11 deletion syndrome.

          2. Currently treated for epilepsy.
