  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Few studies have been conducted to assess the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of
      smoked and vaporized cannabis. Careful analysis of different cannabis administration methods
      on these parameters is required to determine the level and duration of biological cannabinoid
      exposure and associated subjective, cardiovascular and cognitive effects. In the present
      study the investigators evaluated the detection of cannabinoids in whole blood, oral fluid,
      and urine, as well as the acute pharmacodynamics associated with smoked and vaporized
      cannabis among individuals who were not regular cannabis users. The outcomes of the study
      will extend scientific knowledge about the behavioral pharmacology and toxicology of smoked
      and vaporized cannabis administration and can inform policies regarding clinical, workplace
      and roadside drug testing programs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Have provided written informed consent

          2. Be between the ages of 18 and 45

          3. Be in good general health based on a physical examination, medical history, vital
             signs, 12-lead ECG and screening urine and blood tests

             GC/MS laboratory test) and at clinic admission

          5. Test negative for other drugs of abuse, including alcohol at the screening visit and
             at clinic admission

             pregnancy test at the screening visit and a negative urine pregnancy test at clinic
             admission.

          7. Have a body mass index (BMI) in the range of 19 to 36 kg/m2

          8. Blood pressure at Screening Visit does not exceed a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of
             150 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 90 mmHg

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Non-medical use of psychoactive drugs other than, nicotine, alcohol, or caffeine 3
             month prior to the Screening Visit;

          2. History of or current evidence of significant medical or psychiatric illness judged by
             the investigator to put the participant at greater risk of experiencing an adverse
             event due to exposure or completion of other study procedures.

          3. Use of an OTC, systemic or topical drug(s), herbal supplement(s), or vitamin(s) within
             14 days of experimental sessions; which, in the opinion of the investigator or
             sponsor, will interfere with the study result or the safety of the subject.

          4. Use of a prescription medication (with the exception of birth control prescriptions)
             within 14 days of experimental sessions; which, in the opinion of the investigator or
             sponsor, will interfere with the study result or the safety of the subject.

          5. Use of hemp seeds or hemp oil in any form in the past 3 months.

          6. Use of dronabinol (Marinol) within the past 6 months.

          7. History of xerostomia (dry mouth), or the presence of mucositis, gum infection or
             bleeding, or other significant oral cavity disease or disorder that in the
             investigator's opinion may affect the collection of oral fluid samples.

          8. History of clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias or vasospastic disease (e.g.,
             Prinzmetal's angina).

          9. Abnormal EKG result that in the investigator's opinion is clinically significant.

         10. Enrolled in another clinical trial or have received any drug as part of a research
             study within 30 days prior to dosing.
