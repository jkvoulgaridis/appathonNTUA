  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower limb prosthesis users are known to be at a substantially increased fall risk compared
      to able-bodied individuals. The interaction between increased fall risk, reduced balance
      confidence and high prevalence of a fear of falling often leads to restricted mobility and
      loss of independence. Critically, the cause of these falls and the role that inherent balance
      plays in fall risk is poorly understood. This study proposes to identify key differences in
      balance and mobility between older below-knee prosthesis users who have fallen twice or more
      in the past 12 months and those who have fallen once or less, and compare both groups to data
      from able-bodied individuals. By further understanding the differences between these groups
      and relationships between fall risk and various outcome measures, intervention techniques can
      be developed to improve functional balance. An improvement in upright balance will reduce the
      occurrence of falls and fall related injuries in this veteran population, as well as increase
      their participation in daily activities and improve their quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that persons with transtibial amputations (TTA) are at a
      substantially increased risk of falling as compared to able-bodied age-matched controls and
      have reduced confidence in their balance, both contributing to their restricted mobility and
      daily activity. This risk increases with progressing age, as aging affects musculoskeletal
      and somatosensory systems that are vital to controlling upright balance (i.e., maintaining
      the body center-of-mass (BCoM) within the limits of the base-of-support) and are already
      compromised in persons with TTA. An important consequence of elevated fall incidence is an
      increased risk of fall-related injuries that may lead to lost participation and independence.
      The effects of reduced sensory-motor function on upright balance in older adults has been
      extensively studied and led to development of effective assessment tools and intervention
      strategies to minimize fall risk. However, the dearth of similar studies and relatively poor
      understanding of the effects of additional complications from TTA on upright balance have
      significantly hampered progress towards addressing this important concern for Veterans with
      TTA. Consequently, this limits knowledge of predictive factors of falls among these
      prosthesis users and for informing therapeutic interventions that enhance functional balance.
      Therefore, the primary objective of this research is to develop an improved understanding of
      the sensory-motor mechanisms underlying upright balance and fall risk in older Veterans with
      TTA. The proposed study will compare differences between three age- and gender-matched
      groups: 1) amputees who reported two or more falls in the past 12 months, 2) amputee controls
      (one fall or less in the past 12 months), and 3) able-bodied controls.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion criteria for the recruitment of subjects with below knee amputation include:

          -  Transtibial amputation

          -  Daily use of their clinically-prescribed prosthesis for ambulation without an
             assistive device

          -  Classified as Medicare Functional Classification Level K2- defined as a patient who
             &quot;has the ability or potential for ambulation with the ability to traverse low-level
