  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the concentration of hemoglobin within the subject's blood will be reduced in
      a controlled manner by administering fluids intravenously. The accuracy of a noninvasive
      hemoglobin sensor will be assessed by comparison to hemoglobin measurements from a laboratory
      analyzer.

    <description>Accuracy will be determined by comparing the noninvasive hemoglobin measurement of the pulse oximeter to the hemoglobin value obtained from a blood sample and calculating the arithmetic root mean square (Arms) error value. In order to obtain the Arms value, the blood sample hemoglobin value is subtracted from the pulse oximeter hemoglobin value for a number of samples, the average of this difference is computed as the bias. The standard deviation of the differences is computed as the precision. The square root of the sum of the squares of bias and precision is computed as the Arms Error value.</description>
