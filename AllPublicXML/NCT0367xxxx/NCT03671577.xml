  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>

      Anxiety Disorder.

      This study hopes to assess whether a month long computerized intervention aimed at giving
      people skills to form closer friendships. Participants will be randomized into an active
      treatment condition or a wait list control. We hypothesize that 1) participants in the
      treatment condition will have lower fear of intimacy at post treatment than those in the
      waitlist condition 2) participants in the treatment condition will have lower levels of
      loneliness than those in the waitlist condition 3) participants in the treatment condition
      will have higher perceived social support than those in the waitlist condition.
