    <textblock>
      The purpose of this post-marketing surveillance (PMS) study is to collect safety information
      on the use of Cervarix upon the expanded indication to anal cancer to both women and men (at
      least 600 Korean women and men) within 30 days after each vaccination dose, when administered
      according to the approved prescribing information (PI) in Korea in a real health care setting
      over a period of 4 years.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse.</description>

    <measure>Number of subjects with serious adverse events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the post-marketing surveillance (PMS) period up to 30 days (Day 1 to Day 30) after the last vaccine dose administered during subject's participation in the PMS</time_frame>
    <description>A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject.</description>

    <description>The study group comprises of 9-25 year-old male and female subjects who will be administered 3 doses of Cervarix vaccine, according to a 0, 1, and 6 months schedule, as per locally approved prescribing information (PI) in Korea. The 9-14 years old subjects can be vaccinated with 2 doses, according to a 0 and 6-12 months schedule. In the 2-dose schedule, if the second dose is administered before 5 months after the first dose, the third dose vaccination is required. In the 3 doses schedule, if the vaccination schedule requires flexibility, the second dose can be administered between 1 and 2.5 months and the third dose can be administered between 5 and 12 months after the first dose.</description>

    <description>This study assesses the safety of GSK Biologicals' Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in terms of frequency and intensity of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) when administered routinely in male and female subjects aged between 9 and 25 years, according to the approved Prescribing Information in Korea.
All AEs reported during the 30-day post-vaccination follow-up period (Day 1 to Day 30) and all SAEs reported through the study period from dose 1 up to 30 days after the last dose administered during the post-marketing surveillance (PMS) will be collected as part of safety data in this PMS.</description>
