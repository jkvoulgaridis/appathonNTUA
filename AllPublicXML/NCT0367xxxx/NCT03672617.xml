  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to examine the suitability, the so-called validation, of a
      questionnaire, with which one can grasp the reasons why injections of growth hormones are
      omitted by patients (&quot;non-adherence&quot;). Participants are treated with growth hormone and are
      therefore eligible to take part in the study. Study doctor will ask participants to answer
      questionnaires. two times within 14 days. The first time participants answer during the
      routine visit to the practice / clinic and the second time at home. There are no risks
      associated with participating in the study as it does not affect participant's medical
      treatment.

The preliminary working title of the questionnaire GHCQ used in the outcome measures was renamed for simplicity reasons into BAR-GHT (abbreviation for barriers to growth hormone therapy) after study completion.</description>
