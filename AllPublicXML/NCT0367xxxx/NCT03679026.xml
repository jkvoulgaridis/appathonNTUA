  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognition and locomotion are two human abilities controlled by the brain. Their decline is
      highly prevalent with aging, and is greater than the simple sum of their respective
      prevalence, suggesting a complex age-related interplay between cognition and locomotion.
      Recently, a systematic review and meta-analysis has provided evidence that poor gait
      performance predicts dementia and, in particular, has demonstrated that &quot;motoric cognitive
      risk&quot; (MCR) syndrome, which has been described in cognitively healthy individuals and
      combines subjective cognitive complaint with objective slow gait speed, is a pre-dementia
      syndrome. The uniqueness of &quot;motoric cognitive risk&quot; (MCR)syndrome is that it does not rely
      on a complex evaluation or laboratory investigations. Thus, it is easy to apply in
      population-based settings. The overall objective of the proposal is to examine the
      epidemiology of the newly reported &quot;motoric cognitive risk&quot; (MCR) syndrome, in the Quebec
      population using the database of the NuAge study.

        Individuals eligible for this study will be participants of the comprehensive Canadian
        Longitudinal Study on Aging (n=30,097). They are separated in four age groups (i.e.; 45-54,
        54-64, 65-74 and 75-85). Each group will be divided in two subgroups: individuals with and
        without cardio-vascular risk factors and diseases.
