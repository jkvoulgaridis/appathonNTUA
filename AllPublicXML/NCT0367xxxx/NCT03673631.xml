  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ICU care of patients considered &quot;palliative&quot; but without contraindications to admission to
      intensive care, for whom a do-not intubate order decision was made upon admission represents
      a particular target for non-invasive oxygenation techniques. The benefits of non invasive
      ventilation (NIV) in this population are debated especially in cancer patients. The more
      recently used nasal humidified high flux canula oxygenation (HFNC) therapy may have benefits
      over NIV in these patients. It is supposed to have better tolerance and could allow better
      compliance and thus higher efficiency. These potential benefits are major for such a
      population for which tolerance and symptomatic relief are priority goals

      Observational prospective multicenter study Primary outcome: To analyze the efficacy and
      tolerance of NIV and HFNC in patients admitted to intensive care unit, or intermediate catre
      unit for acute respiratory insufficiency for whom a a do-not intubate order decision was
      taken upon admission or after extubation if the patient initially received mechanical
      ventilation.

      Secondary outcomes: To analyze the efficacy and tolerance of NIV and HFNC according to the
      following reason for ICU admission: chronic obstructive pneumopathy decompensated COPD,
      severe heart failure, evolutive cancer or hematologic malignancy; to analyze tolerance and
      acceptability of different techniques; to analyze the duration of the oxygenation methods
      use; to analyze the modalities of eventual withdrawing life support therapies and the
      associated sedative and opioid treatments; to analyze the satisfaction for the use of the non
      invasive technique by the relatives and the caregivers; to analyze mortality at D28 and D90
      and quality of life at 3 and 6 months in surviving patients

The baseline score will be recorded after admission in the ICU and reflects the patient's quality of life just before his or her admission. After 3 and 6 months, a higher value of the score will represent a worse outcome.</description>
