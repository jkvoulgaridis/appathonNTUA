      The study consists in estimating the mental load (cognitive saturation) and the production of
      driving cognition to suicidal patients.

      The study consists in testing two big general hypotheses:

        -  In the first place, that suicidals presents a mental load (cognitive saturation) and an
           activity pain behaviour of their space of the thought by extremely painful peripheral
           cognitive movements (impression that the brain is saturated of thoughts, turbulences,
           internal movements)

        -  Secondly, that suicidals produces a surplus of representations of action, such takes out
           that their vision of the world is saturated of a not integrable kinaesthetic imaging by
           the subject.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mental load (calm or turbulence of the spirit) - test of the aquarium</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the calm or the turbulence of the spirit of the participant, the investigator will make him take the test of the aquarium. The participant will perform an exercise to assess the load and movement of his thoughts. The participant must imagine that the aquarium reflects the content of his mind. The fish are the thoughts and the waves represent the turbulences and movements of all these thoughts. Some subjects, for example, play about with the size of the fish (&quot;it is only a single large fish, but it takes over my entire head&quot;), the shape of the fish (&quot;these fish are pointed because they are bad&quot;), scrawl (the participant scrawled on the aquarium to say that his head was overrun), the projection of feelings (&quot;those fish there are sad&quot;) or made digressive but interesting comments (&quot;the wavy lines carry away the fish...&quot;).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Moral pain - Analog Visual Scale Battery</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days</time_frame>
    <description>In order to evaluate the participant's moral pain, the investigator proposes to answer the questions of a test titled Analog Visual Scale Battery. It is in the form of a horizontal bar with left a peaceful state (mental pain not strong at all...) and conversely, on the right are the opposite feelings corresponding to a moral pain (very strong mental pain). The participant is asked to check on the bar the level that most seems to reflect his feelings or impressions related to his moral pain.</description>

    <measure>Suicidal thoughts - Analog Visual Scale Battery</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days</time_frame>
    <description>In order to evaluate the participant's situation, the investigator proposes to answer the questions of a test titled Analog Visual Scale Battery. It is in the form of a horizontal bar with left a peaceful state (example: calm thoughts, slight suicidal ideation ...) and conversely, on the right are the opposite feelings corresponding to a tormented state (example: many thoughts, suicidal ideation ...). The participant is asked to check on the bar the level that most seems to reflect his feelings or impressions related to his suicidal ideation.</description>
