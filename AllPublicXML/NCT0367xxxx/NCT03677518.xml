      The &quot;ball-in-socket&quot; design of the Medial-Pivot knee system (MicroPort Orthopedics,
      Arling-ton, Tennessee, USA) aims to reproduce normal knee kinematics by medializing its
      rotational axis. Thegoal of this study was to measure knee range of motion (ROM) with this
      implant after a mean follow-up of 10 years and to report the survivorship and long-term
      clinical and radiological outcomes. Wehypothesized the prosthetic knee would have at least
      120◦flexion at 10 years. This was retrospective, single-centre study of 74 Medial-Pivot knees
      implanted in71 patients (average age of 69 years) between May 2005 and November 2007. All
      patients who receiveda Medial-Pivot knee were included consecutively. The mean follow-up was
      10 years. Clinical and radio-logical assessments were performed using the Knee Society Score
      (KSS) and Ewald's score. Kaplan-Meirsurvival analysis was used to calculate survivorship.

    <description>The objective of this study was to evaluate the flexion in patients with an Advance® Medial-Pivot knee after an average follow-upof 10 years. Knee flexion was measured with a goniometer in the office; thegreater trochanter, knee centre and lateral malleolus were used asreference points.</description>

        The patients were operated by four experienced surgeons usingthe same protocol. A mid-line
        skin incision was made in all patientsexcept one who had previously undergone a lateral
        osteotomy. The parapatellar arthrotomy was medial in all cases. Independent tibialand
        femoral cuts were made with an intramedullary femoral aim-ing device targeting 7◦valgus in
        48 cases and 5◦in 2 cases. Femoral component external rotation of 3◦relative to the
        posterior condy-lar plane was applied in all patients. All implants were fixed
        usingPalacos®bone cement with gentamicin (Haeraus, Warsaw, USA).The patella was resurfaced
        in 40 knees.
