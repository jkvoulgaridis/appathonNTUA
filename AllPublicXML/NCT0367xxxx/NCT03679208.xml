    <textblock>
      KIO014 is an innovative chitosan-based biomaterial intended for synovial fluid
      viscosupplementation indicated for the symptomatic treatment of knee osteoarthritis (OA). The
      study KIO014-APROOVE is aimed to evaluate the safety and performance of KIO014 in patients
      with symptomatic knee OA. A total of 100 patients will be enrolled. The study is divided in
      two stages. The Stage 1 cohort is the safety cohort where 10 patients will be enrolled. Stage
      1 patients receiving two injections of KIO014 at day 0 and at month 3, and will be followed
      for 12 months post initial injection. The Stage 2 cohort is the performance cohort for 90
      patients, and this stage will be randomized controlled and single-blind for the patient. In
      stage 2, 60 patients will receive an intra-articular injection of KIO014 (test group) and 30
      patients will receive an intra-articular injection of Durolane® (control group). Patients
      will be followed for 6 months.

    <measure>Change in pain at 3 months versus pre-injection baseline using the 5-graded Likert self-administered WOMAC pain questionnaire (Stage 2 cohort only)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) is a self-administered questionnaire designed to assess pain, stiffness, and physical function through a series of 24 questions divided into 3 subscales. The WOMAC pain score consists of 5 questions. Each question is graded 0-4 on the 5-graded Likert scale (none, mild, moderate, severe or extreme) relating to how much pain the subject has experienced during the last 48 hours. The mean score is reported.</description>

    <description>The WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) is a self-administered questionnaire designed to assess pain, stiffness, and physical function through a series of 24 questions divided into 3 subscales. Each question is graded 0-4 on the 5-graded Likert scale (none, mild, moderate, severe or extreme) relating to how much pain, stiffness or daily physical activities the subject has experienced during the last 48 hours. The score of each dimension, namely pain, stiffness and physical function, is calculated by simply adding the score for each question using the 5-graded Likert scale from 0 to 4. For each dimension, the mean score is reported.</description>
