    <textblock>
      Determine the effectiveness of an electronic self-administered pre-visit planning tool
      allowing adolescents to list areas of concern to support shared decision-making and
      communication during an office visit through a randomized controlled trial (RCT).

      Aim 1: Through qualitative data collection, characterize perspectives of adolescent girls and
      providers regarding the feasibility and acceptability of an electronic self-administered
      pre-visit planning tool allowing adolescents to list areas of concern to support shared
      decision-making and communication during an office visit. Interviews will also explore
      approaches to implement and evaluate such a tool.

      Aim 2: Determine the effectiveness of the tool through a randomized controlled trial (RCT).

      Aim 3: Synthesize outcomes, identify opportunities for improvement and plan next steps in
      both research, and if the tool works well, implementation.
