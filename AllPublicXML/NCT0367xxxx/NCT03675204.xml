  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Collect breast milk samples in various administrative regions of China to measure the
      nutrients in breast milk; analyze the composition of nutrients; and establish the database of
      breast milk in China.

      The study cities are Guangzhou, Weihai, Chengdu, Beijing, Harbin, Wuhan, Jinhua, Zhengzhou
      and Lanzhou.

      Breast milk will be collected at 9:00-11:00 in the morning from 15 to180 days after giving
      birth. The nutrients (protein, triglyceride, phospholipid, oligosaccharides and probiotics)
      in the collected breast milk samples will be measured. These data will be used to establish
      the breast milk database in China. This databased will provide references for infant nutrient
      intake and for the formulation and revision of infant formula standards. It will also provide
      references for the development of new infant formula products in China.
