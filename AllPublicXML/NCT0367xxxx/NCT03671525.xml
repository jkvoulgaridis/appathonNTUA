  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the acute effects of nimodipine on cognitive performance in
      patients with schizophrenia using a battery of cognitive assessments.The subjects will also
      complete a 30-minute structural and functional MRI scan, with the goal of linking brain
      activity with working memory performance. Investigators predict that the performance increase
      induced by nimodipine will be greater in subjects who carry the A allele for the Calcium
      Voltage-Gated Channel Subunit Alpha1 C (CACNA1C) risk single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
      (rs1006737) in comparison to the response of G carriers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main cognitive task of interest in this study is the N-back task because of the observed
      attenuation of prefrontal and parietal cortical activity after nimodipine administration in
      healthy subjects. Investigators hypothesize that acute nimodipine administration will improve
      cortical activation, which will lead to improved cognitive performance. The current study
      will provide insight whether nimodipine or another calcium channel blocker could be used as a
      treatment approach to alleviate cognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia.
