  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronally advanced flap plus connective tissue graft (CTG) is the gold standard therapy for
      root coverage. The bioabsorbable porcine collagen matrix (CM) has been widely used in
      periodontal and mucogingival surgery as a substitute for CTG and has achieved similar
      results. The CM has the advantage of no need of a second surgical area and availability
      overcoming the limitations of donor site in autograft.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the use of Mucoderm® in root coverage procedures
      combined with extended coronally positioned flap (ECAF), test group (TG), in comparison to
      the connective tissue graft associated with the ECAF, control group (CG).
