  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, propofol-controlled, parallel-design,
      multi-center study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HSK3486 for sedation or anesthesia
      in patients undergoing colonoscopy and gastroscopy.

      The study will enroll approximately 280 adults. The maximum study duration is anticipated to
      be up to nine months.
