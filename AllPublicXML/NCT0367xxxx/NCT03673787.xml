    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, proof-of-concept phase I trial of atezolizumab in combination with
      ipatasertib. There are two parts to this study, the dose escalation phase (Part A) and the
      dose expansion phase (Part B). Part A, will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      recommended Phase II dose (RP2D). This will be followed by the Part B dose expansion phase to
      further characterise the safety and tolerability and to assess the pharmacodynamic activity
      of the combination.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 trial of atezolizumab in combination with ipatasertib. There are two parts
      to this study. Part A: dose escalation, and Part B: dose expansion.

      Part A:

      The investigators will investigate the combination of a fixed dose of atezolizumab (1200mg)
      in combination with escalating doses of ipatasertib in patients with advanced solid tumours
      (Cohort A1) and patients with resectable glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (Cohort A2).

      Cohort A1 (advanced solid tumours):

      There will be an ipatasertib run-in phase of 14 days of continuous oral dosing with paired
      pre and post-treatment blood and tissue samples. Combinations dosing will commence on Cycle 1
      Day 1 with the atezolizumab infusion. Cycle 1 will therefore be 35 days. Only patients with
      advanced solid tumours recruited into Cohort A1 will be included in dose escalation decisions
      and determination of the MTD and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for part B.

      Cohort A2 (potentially resectable GBMs):

      There will be an ipatasertib run-in phase of at least 14 days and up to 21 days followed by
      surgical resection of the patient's tumour (5 day window for surgery). Ipatasertib dosing
      will be stopped 48 hours prior to surgery and combination dosing on Cycle1Day1 (C1D1) will
      commence after recovery. Accrual to Cohort A2 will run in parallel Cohort A1 without formal
      dose escalations and patients in Cohort A2 will not be included in dose escalation decisions
      for Cohort A1.

      Part B:

      Patients will be enrolled into the expansion phase (Part B) to further characterize the
      tolerability of the RP2D (established in Cohort A1) of the combination in specific subgroups
      of patients. Part B of the study will have a pre-screening component for patients with solid
      tumours (Cohorts B1 and B2) to allow for enrichment for these specific subgroups of patients.

      Part B of the study will have three cohorts:

        -  Cohort B1: patients with solid tumours with hyperactivation of PI3K pathway as
           determined by pathogenic mutations identified by next generation sequencing (NGS) (eg
           known activating mutations in PIK3CA, AKT1, AKT2) or PTEN loss (assessed by
           immunohistochemistry (IHC) (n=12).

        -  Cohort B2: patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer with PTEN loss as assessed
           by IHC (n=12)

        -  Cohort B3: patients with glioblastoma (n=12) of which at least three (n=3) patients will
           have potentially resectable recurrent glioblastomas.

      Approximately 12 patients with solid tumours and 3 patients with glioblastoma will be entered
      into Part A of this trial and a further 36 patients will be enrolled into part B of the trial
      for an expected maximum of 51 patients on the study. If the MTD is reached in Part A with
      less than 15 patients enrolled, the investigators may enrol further patients at the R2PD in
      Part A to a maximum of 15 patients to include sufficient numbers of patients for the
      proof-of-concept translational studies. Additional subjects may be enrolled in a given cohort
      to ensure that the required number of evaluable subjects in each cohort is achieved.

                  3 months (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or
                  immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or
                  physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary
                  insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment. Patients
                  with a history of inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease or
                  ulcerative colitis will be excluded from the study. Patients with Sjogren's
                  syndrome will not be excluded from the study. In addition patients that
                  experienced a Grade 2 or higher immune-related AE's on treatment with
                  immunotherapy will be excluded from the study. Patients with inactive autoimmune
                  disease which has previously required systemic therapy, may be considered on a

                  or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 14 days prior to the first
                  dose of trial treatment. The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be
                  approved after consultation with the chief Investigator. Stable use (i.e., no
                  change in dose within 1 month prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1 of inhaled
                  corticosteroids is allowed.

        In the Part B dose expansion only, patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer who

        in the Part B3 dose expansion only, patients with glioblastoma will be allowed to be
        enrolled if they had been on a stable dose of steroids ≤3mg Dexamethasone for at least 5
        days prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1.

        16.Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note: The
        killed virus vaccines used for seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are allowed;

             of bone marrow within eight weeks.

             19.Current malignancies of other types, with the exception of adequately treated
             cone-biopsied in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri and basal or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin. Cancer survivors, who have undergone potentially curative
             therapy for a prior malignancy, have no evidence of that disease for three years or
             more and are deemed at negligible risk for recurrence, are eligible for the trial.

             20.Is a participant or plans to participate in another interventional clinical trial,
             whilst taking part in this Phase I study of ipatasertib and atezolizumab.
             Participation in an observational trial would be acceptable.

             21.Patients with prior exposure to a PI3K or AKT inhibitors will be excluded from this
             study. Patients with prior exposure to mTOR inhibitors will be permitted to be
             enrolled on study. Patients with prior exposure to immunotherapy (either CTLA-4,
             PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor/cellular therapy) will be excluded from the dose escalation Part
             A of the study, but will be permitted to enrol onto the Part B dose expansion as long
             as they did not experience any ≥Grade 2 immune-adverse event toxicity while on their
             prior immunotherapy.

             22.Is taking or requiring the continued use of any of the prohibited concomitant
             medications listed in 5.8 Concomitant medication and treatment.

             23.Any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion would not make the patient
             a good candidate for the clinical trial.
