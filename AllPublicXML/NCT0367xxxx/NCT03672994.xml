  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An acute study carried out across three acute admissions units within Leicestershire. The
      study is aimed at discovery and validation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled
      breath. Participants will be recruited and tested within 24 hours of admission and once
      recovered, up to 6 months following discharge.

      A prospective real world observational study carried out across three acute admissions units.
      Participants with self-reported acute breathlessness, with a confirmed primary diagnosis of
      either acute heart failure, community acquired pneumonia and acute exacerbation of asthma or
      COPD will be recruited within 24 hours of admission. These will be matched to healthy
      volunteers from a similar environment. Additionally, school age children admitted with severe
      asthma will be evaluated and breath samples will be collected. All participants will undergo
      breath sampling on admission and upon recovery, up to six months following discharge. A range
      of online technologies including: proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS), gas
      chromatography ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS), atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation-
      mass spectrometry (APCI-MS) and offline technologies including gas chromatography mass
      spectroscopy (GC-MS) and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
      (GCxGC-MS) will be utilised for VOC discovery and replication. For offline technologies a
      standardised CE marked breath sampling device (ReCIVAÂ®) will be used. All recruited
      participants will be characterised using existing blood biomarkers including C - reactive
      protein (CRP), brain derived natriuretic peptide (BNP), Troponin-I and blood eosinophil
      levels and further evaluated using a range of standardised questionnaires, lung function
      testing including hand held forced oscillation technique (FOT) and fractional exhaled nitric
      oxide (FeNO), sputum cell counts and echocardiography for heart failure and COPD patients.
      Additional samples will be collected for bio-banking including urine, serum, plasma and
      sputum supernatants and plugs.

The CAT has a scoring range of 0-40, with Since COPD is a progressive disease, a fi xed target score for all patients cannot be set. In Practice, a target for improvement in individual patient CAT scores may be set, based on an holistic assessment of the patient. A change of 2 units suggests a meaningful difference. This test should be used in conjunction with the eMRC and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) to determine COPD health assessment of participants.</description>

        Leicester (UHL).

        Patients with confirmed acute airway exacerbation or heart failure decompensation as part
        of other research studies at the NIHR Leicester BRC may also be included.

        Age- and/or home environment matched adult/spousal/parent and sibling healthy volunteers
        will be recruited where possible on the admissions unit or in the research units across
        both sites at a separate visit.

        A stable state control population will also be recruited to compare with the unstable
        state. This will consist of participants with a confirmed diagnosis matched with the acute
        care population but not in the exacerbation state.

        serial breath samples.

        (iv) Diagnosed with acute breathlessness as one of the primary indicator reasons by the
        clinical acute care team. This is not a requirement for healthy subjects or matched
        controls.

        (v) One of the indicator provisional diagnoses identified in section 7.1 following senior
        review by the clinical acute care team. This is not a requirement for healthy subjects or
        matched controls (vi) Able (in the Investigators opinion) and willing to comply with all
        study requirements.

        (vii) Willing to allow his or her General Practitioner and consultant, if appropriate, to
        be notified of participation in the study.

        (viii) Ability to understand English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        (i) Female participants who are known to be pregnant, lactating or planning pregnancy
        during the course of the study.

        (ii) Current participation in a clinical trial of an investigative medicinal product or
        within 3 months or 5.5 half-lives of the IMP whichever is longer.

        (iii) Active or clinically suspected pulmonary tuberculosis (iv) In the opinion of the
        treating physician, breath sampling during the acute admission would be clinically unsafe
        or inappropriate due to the patient's condition or poor prognosis. Examples include
        malignancy or autoimmune disease with anticipated survival of under 1 year, and chronic
        renal replacement therapy.

        (v) Unable or unwilling to give informed consent by visit 1b. (vi) Any other significant
        disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may either put the
        participants at risk because of participation in the study, or may influence the result of
        the study, or the participant's ability to participate in the study.
