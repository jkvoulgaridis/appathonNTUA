    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the Össur Rebound dynamic ACL brace on
      knee kinematics evaluated using dynamic stereo X-ray (DSX) imaging during functional
      activities. Brace performance will be evaluated before and after ACL reconstruction.

    <description>ACL-reconstruction patients will be issued an Ossur Rebound ACL Brace at the time of enrollment in the study, prior to surgery. They will use this brace throughout their rehab and physical therapy.
Dynamic X-ray imaging of the knee will take place prior to surgery, and again upon clearance from physical therapy 7-9 months after surgery. The injured knee will be imaged with and without the brace, and the contralateral limb will be imaged for use as a control.</description>

             other conditions, is excluded from the study. Those who have an annual occupational
             radiation exposure greater than 25mSv may not enroll.)

             other forms of loose metal implants

          -  Initial MRI exclusion criteria (assessed by clinical MRI obtained as standard of care
             at time of ACL injury diagnosis): concomitant injury, multi-ligamentous injury,
             significant meniscal damage

          -  Allergy or sensitivity to silver or latex

          -  Adults lacking capacity to consent for themselves

        Post-Op Visit Exclusion Criteria

          -  Participants who do not pass their return-to-sport test within 7-9 months of
             ACL-Reconstruction surgery will be excluded from the second phase of testing.

          -  Participants who no longer pass the MRI screening at the time of Phase 2 testing (for
             example, who have a new loose metal implant), will be excluded from the MRI portion of
             the testing only.
