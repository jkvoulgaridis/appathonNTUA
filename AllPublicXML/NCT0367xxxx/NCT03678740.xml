  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A previous NAMDC survey study (NAMDC 7414 - Diagnostic Odyssey Survey, referred to hereafter
      as Odyssey1), provided a benchmark account of the substantial challenges faced by patients in
      achieving a diagnosis of mitochondrial disease, and of the impact such a diagnosis has on
      them (Grier et al. 2018).1 This study was conducted from October 2015 through January 2016.
      We propose a new survey study (Odyssey2) which will provide an update, additional data
      collection (duration of the diagnostic odyssey), and allow assessment of next-generation DNA
      sequencing techniques since Odyssey1 concluded.

      Odyssey2 will retain the strengths (simplicity, brevity, confidentiality, and data quality
      assurance measures) which made Odyssey1 successful. While Odyssey2 adds some refinements
      based on experience learned from Odyssey1, the basic questions are changed as little as
      possible to maximize comparability, and the additions are limited. Odyssey1 consisted of
      between 16 and 23 questions, depending on skip patterns, and took an estimated 15 minutes to
      complete. Odyssey2 consists of between 23 and 33 questions, depending on skip patterns and we
      estimate that it will take approximately 20 minutes to complete. As in Odyssey1, only
      patients who report, directly or through a guardian, that they have been informed by a doctor
      that they have a confirmed mitochondrial disorder will be eligible for Odyssey2.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To gain an understanding of the &quot;Diagnostic Odyssey&quot; patients with mitochondrial disease
      undergo the Odyssey2 survey will address the following 7 questions. The first 6 are the same
      as in Odyssey1.

        1. How much time typically elapses between when patients initially notice symptoms of a
           mitochondrial disorder and when they receive the diagnosis of mitochondrial disease?

        2. How many physicians do patients typically see before they receive the diagnosis of
           mitochondrial disease?

        3. What testing do patients typically undergo?

        4. What other diagnoses, if any, do patients typically receive?

        5. How did receiving a mitochondrial disease diagnosis impact the patient's life?

        6. If the patient were to learn that their mitochondrial disease diagnosis was incorrect,
           what impact would that have?

        7. Have any of the above changed since Odyssey1 in the RDCRN results?

      Upon collection, the survey data will be stored by the Rare Diseases Clinical Research
      Network (RDCRN) Data Management and Coordinating Center (DMCC) at the University of South
      Florida.

      Upon conclusion of the study period, the data will be de-identified prior to being sent to
      Dr. Seamus Thompson at the NAMDC Data Coordinating Center (DCC). The data will be analyzed by
      a team which will include Drs. Thompson, Hirano, Karaa, and Yeske; and Ms. Shepard, the
      project statistician. All data collected will be sent to a Federal data repository to be
      stored indefinitely per the current RDCRN data sharing policy.
