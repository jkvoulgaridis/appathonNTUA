  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that results from
      immune dysregulation. Arguably, the development of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) antagonists
      (including infliximab, adalimumab and golimumab) revolutionized the management of
      immune-mediated chronic diseases in the past two decades.

      However, about one third of patients will not respond to a first anti-TNF treatment and 10%
      to 30% will loose response to anti-TNF during the follow-up.

      Historically, a switch between anti-TNF was performed to recapture remission and response to
      anti-TNF. Recently, a new biologic therapy blocking another target has been approved and is
      now reimbursed during ulcerative colitis, namely vedolizumab. Vedolizumab is an anti-integrin
      agent avoiding the recruitment of lymphocytes specifically in inflamed gut tissue.

      Emerging data suggest that a switch of therapeutic class (meaning a change of biologic target
      with Non-TNF-targeted biologic) in case of clinical failure or insufficient response to
      anti-TNF may be the best choice. This idea of a switch out of the anti-TNF class is also
      supported by data on drug monitoring that may help physician decision making in case of loss
      of response. However, no trial is currently available and ongoing to assess the best
      therapeutic strategy. The aim of the proposed study is to assess the best biological based
      strategy in patient losing response to a first subcutaneous anti-TNF (golimumab and/or
      adalimumab).

      Design :

      A prospective, multicenter, randomized, double blind clinical trial

      Primary objective :

      To determine whether a non-TNF-targeted biologic (vedolizumab) is superior to infliximab to
      treat patient with UC losing response or with a primary failure to a first subcutaneous
      anti-TNF drug at week 14.

      Secondary objective :

        -  To assess the rate of clinical response and remission at Week 54 in each group of
           treatments and the time to clinical response and remission from baseline ;

        -  To assess the changes in faecal calprotectin levels from baseline to week 14 and 54
           according to treatment ;

        -  To assess the rate of colectomy and hospitalization in each treatment group ;

        -  To assess the rate of mucosal healing at week 14 and 54 in each group of treatments ;

        -  To assess the rate of loss of response in each group of treatments for patients
           responder after induction phase ;

        -  To assess the changes of quality of life indexes and the disability index from baseline
           to week 14 and 54 ;

        -  To determine the safety profile of each group of treatments ;

        -  To characterize the response in each group of treatments according to drug monitoring of
           the first anti-TNF agent ;

        -  To describe the pharmacokinetics of infliximab and vedolizumab as second-line treatment
           of UC and explore the sources of pharmacokinetic inter-individual variability ;

        -  To identify predictive factors of response to the treatment, including pharmacokinetic
           features

      Expected findings and impact:

      The patients include in the clinical will not lose any benefit since both treatments are
      actually indicated and effective in this condition. In both arm of treatment, patients will
      receive an effective treatment.

      The study will optimize physician decision making to decrease the disease activity period in
      UC patients with known consequence such as hospitalisation, surgery, work cessations with
      related cost effects.

    <masking_description>The investigator will proceed to the patient randomization as follows :
The investigator fulfill the electronic case report form (eCRF)
The randomization will be performed through the eCRF.
A mail will be sent to the pharmacy that included the inclusion number of the patient, the group allocated and the dose of infliximab or vedolizumab to be infused.
A mail will be sent to the investigator that included only the inclusion number of the patient.
The trial is conducted in a double-blind manner. The biostatistician who generated the randomization list, the person in charge of pharmacovigilance, the pharmacy of the clinical trials of the Rennes university hospital and the pharmacist of the recruiting center can have access to the arm of treatment under study.
Patients and physicians will not know the nature of the molecules administered.</masking_description>
