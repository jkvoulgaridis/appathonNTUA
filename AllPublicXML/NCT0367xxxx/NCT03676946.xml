  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1+2, open-label, dose-escalation, and multidose study, aiming to investigate
      the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ZKAB001 (a fully human monoclonal antibody
      targeting the Programmed Death - Ligand 1 (PD-L1) membrane receptor on T lymphocytes and
      other cells of the immune system) administered every 14 days in subjects with locally
      advanced and metastatic urothelial carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 4 periods: Screening (up to 28 days), Lead-in period (Day -28),
      Treatment (up to 24 cycles or 1 year, whichever occurs first）, and Follow-up (up to 1 year).
      There will be a lead-in period on Day -28 for each dose escalation cohort in which the
      single-dose pharmacokinetics(PK) of ZKAB001 will be characterized prior to initiation of
      continuous dosing in the first cycle of treatment. The lead-in period duration, PK
      time-points, doses and/or regimens used in subsequent cohorts may be modified based on the
      exposure (AUC) observed during the lead-in period (although the number of PK samples will not
      be increased). Treatment of continuous dosing is up to 24 cycles or 1 year, until as per
      investigator's opinion, subjects experience disease progression (evaluated by RECIST 1.1 and
      immune-related response criteria irRECIST), no clinical benefit, or intolerable toxicity. If
      investigators suspect subjects experience pseudoprogression or has evidence to prove &quot;mixed
      response&quot;, subjects can continue to accept treatment as investigator decided.

             to the termination of the study, such as other serious diseases or serious laboratory
             test abnormalities or other factors that may affect the safety of the subjects, family
             or social factors that may affect the study data and sample collection.
