      The aim of this trial is to investigate the effects of a single bout of aerobic exercise on
      sleep in patients with depression.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether a single bout of aerobic exercise
      improves sleep efficiency more than a control condition in patients with depression.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      Secondary objectives are to assess the effects of a single bout of aerobic exercise on 1)
      sleep continuity, 2) sleep architecture, 3) pre-sleep arousal, 4) subjective sleep quality,
      5) daytime sleepiness, 6) nocturnal blood pressure, 7) heart rate variability, and 8) the
      frequency and severity of adverse events.

      DESIGN:

      This will be a two-arm parallel group, randomized, outcome assessor blinded, controlled,
      superiority trial. According to sample size calculation a total of 92 patients will be
      randomized using minimization. The trial will take place in the first five days of the
      patients' psychosomatic in-patient rehabilitation in the clinic OBERWAID, St.Gallen,
      Switzerland. The study visits are scheduled is as follows:

      Day 0-2: Screening, inclusion, and graded exercise test to determine exercise intensity of
      intervention

      Day 3: Questionnaires for background information

      Night 1 (day 3-4): Baseline polysomnography and sleep related questionnaires

      Day 4: Randomized allocation (control or exercise condition) and performing corresponding
      intervention

      Night 2 (day 4-5): Follow-up polysomnography and sleep related questionnaires

      Day 5: Daytime sleepiness questionnaire

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in adverse events between exercise and control group</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after termination of exercise intervention or control condition and after awakening from follow-up (night 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events will be explicitly assessed through a questionnaire. Patients will be asked whether they experienced adverse effects on a five point Likert scale (not at all, very) using the following categories: Pain (if yes, location), dizziness, cardiovascular symptoms (e.g. angina symptoms, cyanosis, pallor), respiratory symptoms (e.g. wheezing), nausea, falls (yes or no), other (to be described).</description>

    <measure>Mood assessed by self-rating questionnaire 'Befindlichkeitsskala' (BFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before and at the end of the control condition as well as the exercise intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Eight subscales are calculated from the 'Befindlichkeitsskala' (BFS): activity, elation, contemplation, calmness, fatigue, depression, anger, and excitement. Values of all subscale range from 1 to 5. Higher scores on the subscale depression indicate worse outcome. Higher scores on the other subscales cannot a priori be judged as representing better or worse outcomes.</description>

    <description>Patients allocated to the intervention group will perform a single bout of supervised aerobic exercise. The starting time will be approximately 1630 hrs. The exercise mode will be a bicycle ergometer. After a warm-up period, during which the intensity is gradually increased, an intensity of 80% of the individual anaerobic threshold will be maintained for 30 minutes. The intensity level was chosen based on clinical experience that this corresponds to an approximate rate of perceived exertion of 13 (on a scale from 6-20) in this population.</description>
