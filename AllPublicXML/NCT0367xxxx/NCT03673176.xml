      Since medical therapies offer only modest palliation and minimal hopes for improved survival
      to COPD patients, surgical therapies have been designed that may provide greater benefits in
      selected patients. Lung transplantation, for example, clearly improves survival and quality
      of life in patients with end stage COPD. This comes at substantial economic cost, however, as
      well as the at the cost of complications that may result from the complex surgery and from
      life-long immunosuppression. In addition, nearly all lung transplants will fail within 5
      years as a result of progressive bronchiolotis obliterans, which we currently have no way to
      prevent or treat.

      A second operation designed to treat severe COPD patients is lung volume reduction surgery
      (LVRS). This operation, designed for patients with predominant emphysema rather than chronic
      bronchitis, is among the most carefully studied operations ever developed.

      We believe that by reducing the volume of emphysematous lung with the precise target
      localization made possible by image-guided SABR, that we will be able to duplicate the
      benefits of surgical lung volume reduction with far less risk. We believe that this may
      represent a major advance in the therapy of emphysema - a highly prevalent disease. It may
      provide not only palliation but also increased survival, as does surgical lung volume
      reduction, in carefully selected patients.

      Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR), also called stereotactic body radiation therapy
      (SBRT), is a relatively recent advance in radiotherapy which allows high doses of radiation
      to be transmitted to focused areas (typically malignancies), allowing higher rates of
      tumoricidal activity, generally lower complications, and greater convenience for patients
      since it can be delivered in 1 to just a few sessions. As the radiation is administered from
      multiple directions according to stereotactic planning, high doses can be delivered to the
      tissues with rapid fall-off to relatively low doses in even nearby, surrounding normal
      tissues. This technique was initially applied to brain tumors- an application which over the
      years has met with great success. More recently, it has been applied with substantial success
      and is gaining increasing acceptance as a primary mode of therapy for stage I lung
      malignancies, and malignancies in multiple other body areas.

      In the lung, the rate of pneumonitis resulting from SABR is far lower than the rates incurred
      by conventional external beam radiotherapy. In conventional external beam radiotherapy
      reported pneumonitis rates range from 13-37% (7), depending on dose and field size. Reported
      rates of symptomatic pneumonitis after lung SABR are significantly lower and generally are
      ~5% (8). SABR does, however, typically leave a scar in the area of lung that has been treated
      (9). Importantly, there appears to be contraction of surrounding lung parenchyma into this
      scar resulting in an effect that is essentially a &quot;lung volume reduction.&quot; One often sees
      clear loss of lung volume following any form of lung radiotherapy. With SABR, this &quot;volume
      reduction&quot; is achieved with a far lower risk of morbidity - in particular, less risk of
      pneumonitis.
