      Identification of the effects of yoga, stabilization exercise and home exercise approaches on
      pain, function,stress and quality of life in individuals with low back pain.

    <textblock>
      44 patients participating in the study were divided three groups. The patients in the
      stabilization exercise group were instructed to perform hotpack, Trans-cutaneous Electric
      Nerve Stimulation (TENS) and spinal stabilization exercises, the patients in the yoga group
      were instructed to perform yoga program consisting of breathing, relaxation and flexibility
      exercises. The patients in the home exercise group were instructed to perform stabilization
      exercise. The severity of the pain evaluated through visual analog scale, functional status
      and quality of life evaluated through Oswestry Disability Index(ODI), Nottingham Health
      Profile (NHP), respectively. Assessments were repeated before and after the treatment.

    <measure>Changes in pain severity</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline in pain severity at 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' average resting and activity pain intensities assessed by Visual Analog Scale.
The visual analog scale is an 11-point scale ranging from 0 to 10, in which 0 defines absence of pain and 10 describes unbearable pain. Participants asked to rate the average pain levels a horizontal 10 cm straight line on a white sheet from, before and after treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in life quality levels at 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life assessed by Nottingham Health Profile (NHP). The NSP contain 38 questions in 6 subareas: pain, physical abilities, energy level, sleep, social isolation and emotional reaction. The scores range from 0 to 100, with each question assigned a weighted value; the sum of all weighted values in a given subarea adds up to 100. Lower scores denoting a better quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of functional status</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline in functional status at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's permanent functional disability measured by Oswestry Disability Index. The scale is considered the 'gold standard' of low back functional outcome tools. This scale contain questions related to functional activities of pain intensity, personal care, lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, sex life, social life and travelling.Interpretation of scale are 0% to 20% for minimal disability, 21% to 40% for moderate disability, 41 % to 60 % for severe disability 61% to 80 % for crippled and 81 % to 100 % Bed-bound.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of stress level</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline in stress level at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' stress levels were measured with State Trait Anxiety Inventory. State anxiety scale questions how does a person feel in a given moment and situation, mean while trait anxiety scale questions how does a person usually feel without depending on situation and moment. Scale contain 40 questions, minimum and maximum score 20-80, respectively. Scores below 36 accepted as &quot;no-anxiety&quot;, between 37-42 accepted as &quot;low-anxiety&quot;, 42 and above accepted as &quot;high-anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Changes of stress related biomarkers</measure>

    <description>Venous blood samples were taken from antecubital area between 08.30-09.00 am and stress related markers (DHEA(S) and cortisol) were analyzed. All analyses were performed in the same laboratory.</description>
