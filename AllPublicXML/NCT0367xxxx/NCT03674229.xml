    <textblock>
      This trial studies the effectiveness of patient navigators in facilitating weight management
      in obese participants. Health coaches or patient navigators may help more participants take
      part in weight management programs.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effectiveness of patient navigators to increase enrollment in
      evidence-based weight management programs.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effectiveness of patient navigators to increase overall attendance or use
      of evidence-based weight management programs.

      II. To evaluate the effectiveness of patient navigators to promoting and facilitating
      positive health behavior change: increased physical activity; improved diet; and weight loss.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Participants receive information about commercially-available weight management
      programs and encouragement to participate in one of the programs for 6 months.

      GROUP II: Participants receive information about commercially-available weight management
      programs encouragement to participate in one of the programs for 6 months. Participants also
      receive 6 phone calls over 20-30 minutes each from an assigned patient navigator for 6
      months.

      After completion of the study, participants are followed up at 2 months.
