      The objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
      subepithelial implantation of the Allotex TransForm corneal allograft (TCA) for improving
      near vision in presbyopic subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Beginning in 1949 with the pioneering work of Jose Barraquer, there has been an interest in
      using natural corneal tissue to change the refractive properties of the eye. In recent years,
      non-allogenic, synthetic corneal implants have received marketing approval in the United
      Stated and Europe for refractive purposes. Although synthetic implants are made of
      biocompatible materials they are not equivalent to an allogenic implant in terms of
      biocompatibility. The Allotex TCA is a piece of acellular cornea, sterilized with electron
      beam radiation and shaped to a particular shape using a laser. The availability of precise
      laser shaping systems and sterile corneas are the key factors that make the use of allogenic
      implants possible.

      The TCA is applied to the surface of Bowman's membrane just underneath the epithelium. The
      goal is to enhance the visual performance of the patient with a material that is 100%
      biocompatible and precisely shaped for the individual's needs.

      Subjects must be presbyopic adults, needing from +1.75 D to +3.50 D of reading add in the
      non-dominant eye and must have uncorrected near visual acuity worse than 20/40 in the
      non-dominant eye. Bilateral treatments will not be allowed during this study.

          -  Presbyopic adults, needing from +1.75 D to +3.50 D of reading add in the nondominant
             eye to improve near visual acuity at 40 cm by at least one line or more.

          -  Uncorrected near visual acuity worse than 20/40 in the non-dominant eye.

          -  Distance visual acuity correctable to at least 20/20 in both eyes.

          -  Manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE) between -0.75 and +1.00 D with ≤0.75 D
             of refractive cylinder in the non-dominant eye.
