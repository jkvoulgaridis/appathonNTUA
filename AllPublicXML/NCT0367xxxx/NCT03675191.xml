  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide and obesity is an important risk factor for
      cardiovascular disease. In addition, back pain has been increasing steadily due to sitting
      life, lack of exercise, wrong posture, and obesity. Recent studies found that obesity and
      back pain are common diseases and are closely related to each other. People with back pain
      have lower physical activity, which in turn leads to an weight gain and a deterioration in
      physical performance. Among the drugs used for obesity, orlistat has been approved for
      long-term use, and phentermine, the most commonly used drug, has been approved for short-term
      use. However, phentermine can increase blood pressure and pulse rate. Meanwhile, several
      studies have shown that orlistat, a pancreatic lipase inhibitor, lowers blood pressure and
      pulse rate and diminish LDL-cholesterol. Lowering LDL-C could lead to improved vascular
      endothelial function.

      The investigators aimed to investigate the effect of orlistat and phentermine combination
      therapy on weight loss and improvement of vascular function compared to phentermine
      monotherapy in obese patients (BMI 27 kg/m2) with metabolic risk and back pain.

      The investigators aimed to investigate the effect of orlistat and phentermine combination
      therapy on weight loss and improvement of vascular function compared to phentermine
      monotherapy in obese patients (BMI 27 kg/m2) with metabolic risk and back pain.

      Randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials (12 weeks), Patients: Obese patients (BMI 27
      kg/m2) with metabolic risk and back pain

      The patients were divided into two groups: orlistat (120mg, three times a day), phentermine
      (37.5 mg, once a day) combined Group (N = 57), placebo (placebo, three times a day) and
      phentermine (37.5 mg, once a day) Group (N=57).

      Randomly assigned to each group at 1: 1, and allocation codes are generated using SAS (Ver.
      9.2). The investigators provide orlistat and phentermine or placebo and phentermine. The
      investigators check physical measurement, blood test, questionnaire, blood pressure and
      pulse, body composition, FMD, heart rate variability test, in the first visit. The
      investigators check for changes in body weight, compliance, and side effects after 4 weeks
      and 8 weeks, respectively. After 12 weeks, the investigators re-check physical measurement,
      blood test, questionnaire, blood pressure and pulse, body composition, FMD, heart rate
      variability test.
