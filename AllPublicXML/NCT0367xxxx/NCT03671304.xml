  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1. Determine the feasibility and acceptability of the proposed mobile technology
      intervention to increase physical activity patients receiving treatment for renal cell
      carcinoma.

      Aim 2. Evaluate the effect of the proposed intervention components (affective framing,
      intention planning, and goal-setting) on changes in physical activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent analyses have indicated that physical activity reduces mortality risk among patients
      with RCC.1. Physical activity also provides additional benefits for patients undergoing
      treatment for cancer such as improved quality of life and sleep, and reduced
      treatment-related fatigue. However, individuals receiving treatment for renal cell carcinoma
      (RCC) often fail to engage in sufficient physical activity. Many cancer survivors experience
      a decrease in their physical activity after diagnosis2 and the majority of RCC survivors do
      not meet the recommended guidelines for physical activity.3 Traditional physical activity
      interventions require significant resources and present substantial barriers for participants
      (travel, time commitments, etc.). In contrast, mobile technologies enable delivery of
      interventions with significantly fewer resources. These technologies also facilitate the
      delivery of just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) in which intervention support is
      provided at only at times when an opportunity for positive changes exists.4 The purpose of
      this support the development of a JITAI in RCC patients. Evaluation of the acceptability and
      efficacy of three intervention strategies (affective framing, intention planning,
      goal-setting, and savoring) will determine their inclusion in the JITAI.

    <description>Participants will receive a Fitbit Versa and instructions on its use. The study design is not a traditional randomized controlled trial in which participants are randomized to either the intervention or control group. Instead the study utilizes a microrandomized design. This is a within-subjects design in which participants will receive affective framing messages and intention planning prompts on a randomized schedule, such that participants will receive each message type on 50% of days.</description>

    <intervention_name>Fitbit Versa</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will receive a Fitbit Versa and instructions on its use. Participants will be asked to wear the device for eight weeks, removing it only for charging and when engaging in activities in which the device could be submerged in water (bathing, swimming, etc.).
At enrollment, participants will indicate a preferred time to receive affective framing messages and EMA prompts (morning), and intention planning prompts (evenings). Participants will receive affective framing messages and intention planning prompts on a randomized schedule, such that participants will receive each message type on 50% of days.</description>
