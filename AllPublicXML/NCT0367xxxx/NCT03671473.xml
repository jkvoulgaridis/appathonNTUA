  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extracorporeal shock wave is a novel treatment for peripheral nerve entrapment. This study
      was designed to compare the efficacy of focused and radial extracorporeal shock wave for
      carpal tunnel syndrome.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both focused and radial extracorporeal shock wave had been proved to treat carpal tunnel
      syndrome by several studies. However, there was no study comparing these two methods.
      Considering different mechanisms and costs, this randomized comparative trial would be
      conducted to compare the efficacy of focused and radial extracorporeal shock wave for carpal
      tunnel syndrome.

    <description>Boston carpal tunnel syndrome questionnaire (BCTQ) is a frequently used patient-based questionnaire for measurement of carpal tunnel syndrome which encompasses two components. eleven questions and eight items were evaluated to rate the symptom severity scale (SSS) and functional status scale (FSS), respectively. Each question or item ranges from 1 to 5 with a higher score indicating severer symptom or a higher degree of disability. Total score of SSS ranges from 11-55 and FSS from 8-40. The mean of total SSS and FSS divided with each item score were used for further analysis.</description>

    <description>Shock waves are defined a sequence of acoustic pulse characterized by a high peak pressure (100 MPa), fast pressure rise (&lt; 10 ns) and short duration (10 Î¼s). Different studies and clinical experiments have demonstrated the efficacy of shock waves in the treatment of musculoskeletal system such as chronic tendinopathies or hypertrophic pseudoarthrosis.</description>
