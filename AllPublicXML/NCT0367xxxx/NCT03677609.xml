  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of a novel intervention for physicians to
      increase awareness about interacting with patients with pre- diabetes, diabetes, and
      hypertension. The investigators will measure health outcomes in patients as well as patient
      and physician satisfaction at Stanford Corporate clinics. The doctor-patient relationship has
      been shown to positively impact not only patient satisfaction, but also patients'
      physiological health outcomes. Thus, the investigators hypothesize that improving the
      patient-provider relationship would increase physician efficacy in regards to communicating
      and mitigating long-term risks to patients at risk for or suffering from chronic illness. The
      present study develops and tests a mindset intervention for physicians aimed at helping
      physicians prioritize connecting with their patients both in addition to and in comparison
      with a communication skills training for physicians.

      Healthcare providers at seven Stanford clinic sites will be the investigators' main
      participants and the study will follow a wait-list control design. The investigators will
      track outcomes of patients with pre-diabetes, diabetes, or hypertension of participating
      providers.

      The intervention described in this study will only be for physicians. The investigators will
      track both physician outcomes (using self-report survey measures) and patient outcomes (using
      health information already being collected by the clinic in addition to electronic
      self-report surveys we will distribute). Although the investigators will be tracking the
      outcomes of all physicians at the clinics, only patients with pre-diabetes, diabetes, or
      hypertension will have their outcomes tracked as part of this study.

      The study will begin with physicians filling out baseline self-report surveys online and/or
      in person.

      At Stanford Employer Based Clinics:

      The initial, baseline data collection phase of the study will involve recruiting 30 patients
      with pre-diabetes, diabetes, or hypertension per participating physician.

      Patients with pre-diabetes, diabetes, or hypertension will be identified via either 1) a
      biometrics screen blood test; 2) a primary care screening blood test; or 3) chart review.
      Once these patients are identified, they will be asked if they would like to participate in a
      study about their healthcare at the clinic. Those who say yes will have their contact
      information sent to the research team, who will contact them via e-mail to send the consent
      form and initial survey. Then, patients will have a standardized consultation with their
      primary care physician and then a standardized follow-up visit. Patient satisfaction will be
      assessed after each visit with their physician. These patients will then be tracked for an
      additional 3 months, so that patient outcomes are tracked for approximately 6 months total.

      At all participating clinics:

      Prior to delivering the intervention, the clinics will be split, and half of the clinic sites
      will be assigned to receive only a communication skills training (corporate clinics), while
      the other half of sites will receive this training + a mindset intervention. After physicians
      complete these trainings, the investigators will once again recruit and track the outcomes of
      30 patients with pre-diabetes per participating physician for 3-24 months, using the two
      standardized visit procedures described above.

      The intervention for physicians will be delivered in person by members of the research team.
      Physicians will be told that the investigators are assessing several training programs and
      that they will all receive all the trainings at some point. Physicians will truthfully be
      informed that the training they are receiving is designed to enhance their interactions with
      patients.

        -  Condition 1: Skills condition: This condition will consist of a training for physicians
           in communication and/or health coaching. Physicians at Stanford Corporate Clinics will
           receive the communication training.

        -  Condition 2: Skills + mindset intervention condition: This condition will consist of
           condition 1 plus the addition of a two-hour mindset training and one-hour follow-up for
           all members of the care team.

      Questionnaires:

      Physicians: Physicians will be asked to fill out an initial brief survey about their mindsets
      about connecting with patients, burnout, job satisfaction, and their knowledge of
      motivational interviewing for pre- diabetes patients. Physicians will then be asked to fill
      out the same survey after receiving their training. Physicians will then also be asked to
      fill out very brief surveys after their clinic visits with pre- diabetes participants. This
      survey will assess whether or not they felt they were successfully able to communicate with
      patients regarding the risk of diabetes the patients face.

      Patients: Patients will be asked to fill out brief surveys before and after their clinic
      visits with their physicians to assess their baseline knowledge of their risk for diabetes
      and then their post-visit knowledge, as well as their satisfaction with their visit. Only
      patients at the Employer-based clinics will be surveyed.

      Predictions: The investigators expect that physicians in the skills + mindset intervention
      condition will have the most successful interactions with their patients in terms of
      effectively communicating risk and encouraging behaviors and treatments that can prevent
      diabetes onset or help manage diabetes and hypoertension. The investigators expect that
      patients of these physicians will also fare better than patients of physicians in other
      condition. The investigators hypothesize benefits will be seen in the following areas:

        1. Physician satisfaction with visit

        2. Physician feelings of efficacy

        3. Patient satisfaction with visit

        4. Patient knowledge of risk factors for diabetes and behaviors that can offset those risks

        5. Patient adherence to medical treatment

        6. Patient adherence to behavioral recommendations, such as diet and exercise

        7. Patient health outcomes: hemoglobin A1c, BMI, fasting sugar

        8. Patient anxiety and depression

        9. Patient retention with new physician

      Physicians will be informed that the training they are receiving is aimed to help improve
      their clinical skills for communicating with patients with pre-diabetes, diabetes, or
      hypertension. Physicians will have the option to remove their data from analysis at any time
      if they wish.

      Data from the electronic medical record will be used to assess patient health outcomes at all
      clinics.
