          -  Women of child bearing potential have to use reliable methods of contraception with a
             low failure rate (i.e., less than 1 % per year; implants, injectables, combined oral
             contraceptives, hormone-based intrauterine-devices, sexual abstinence or vasectomized
             partner).

             in the opinion of the Investigator;

          -  Intake of drugs interfering with the immune system (e.g. corticosteroids,
             immunosuppressive drugs and antihistamines) within 30 days before screening as well as

          -  Patients with psychiatric conditions that might limit the participation in the trial
             and/or that lead to the assumption that the ability to completely understand the
             consequences of consent is missing;

          -  Patients with any history of drug addiction or alcoholism in the past 3 years;
