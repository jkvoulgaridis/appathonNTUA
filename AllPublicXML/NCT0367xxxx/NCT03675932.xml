  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Forced cadence cycling (FCC) in which individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD) pedal with
      external augmentation at 80-90 revolutions per minute (rpm) has demonstrated significant
      motor improvement in prior clinical trials. These studies required either a tandem bicycle
      with second rider or an expensive motorized bicycle, making this therapy inaccessible to most
      patients. In this pragmatic open-label before and after pilot study investigators examine
      implementation and effectiveness of (RCC) without tandem or motor augmentation and in a
      community-based setting. Approximately 30 participants will be recruited to participate in 24
      one-hour rapid-cadence spin classes in YMCAs over 8 weeks. Primary outcomes will examine
      implementation of the intervention and secondary outcomes will examine effectiveness against
      a historical comparison group.

    <description>The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) section III measures severity of motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease with scores ranging from 0 to 199 with higher scores indicating more severe motor symptoms. This study utilizes a modified version of the UPDRS without rigidity which will be recorded on video and rated remotely by a movement disorder neurologist blinded to intervention status of the participant. This modified version has been shown to be reliable and valid, both at cross-sectional time points and longitudinally (Abdolahi, 2013).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adults age 18 or older.
