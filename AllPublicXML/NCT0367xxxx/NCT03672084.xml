  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Results of conventional therapy in patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma(PTCL) are poor.
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(allo-HSCT) gave excellent results in PTCL
      after failure of conventional therapy and in many cases also of HDT/ASCT. A disadvantage of
      allo-HSCT is high TRM rate, especially in refractory or relapsed patients. Another limitation
      to the use of allo-HSCT is the availability of a HLA matched donors. Haploidentical family
      donors have been successfully used in treatments of hematologic malignancies, including
      malignant lymphomas. Thus, allo-HSCT could be used as first-line consolidation following
      conventional chemotherapy in high-risk PTCL patients. The study hypothesis: Using allo-HSCT
      as consolidation following chemotherapy in high-risk PTCL exerts a strong anti-lymphoma
      effect and could increase response rate and improve long term survival.

      After primary diagnosis eligible patients receive 2 to 3 courses of CHOEP-21 with formal
      restaging after course 2. Patients with CR, PR or no change proceed to allo-HSCT. Donor
      selection: Matched sibling donor(MSD) is the first choice. An unrelated donor or
      haploidentical family donor search is performed in patients without sibling donor. The
      primary end point was 1 year progression-free survival. The secondary end points were
      complete commission rate, transplant-related mortality, overall survival, relapse rate and
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) . Following time is 2 years
