      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine plus cisplatin followed by radical liver resection
      versus immediate radical liver resection alone with or without adjuvant chemotherapy in
      incidentally detected gallbladder carcinoma after simple cholecystectomy or in front of
      radical resection of BTC (ICC/ECC)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate whether induction chemotherapy followed by radical
      re-resection (and - if possible - postoperative chemotherapy) in incidental gallbladder
      carcinoma (IGBC) or in front radical resection in biliary tract cancer (BTC) (intrahepatic
      cholangiocarcinoma (ICC)/ extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC)) prolongs overall survival
      without impaired quality of life compared to immediate radical surgery alone with or without
      adjuvant chemotherapy (investigator's choice) in patients with IGBC, or BTC (ICC/ECC). One of
      the most important secondary objectives is to raise awareness for the necessity of a radical
      second surgery as well as to improve the adherence to the treatment guidelines in IGBC.
      Further secondary objectives are safety and tolerability of the treatment as well as quality
      of life.

    <description>&quot;European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer&quot; Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30. The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients.
The QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items.
Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale.
All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level.
Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems.</description>

             CCA), for IGBC (T2-3 N- and T1-3 N+) prior Cholecystectomy is allowed.

          3. Exclusion of distant metastases by CT or MRI of abdomen, pelvis, and thorax, bone scan
             or MRI (if bone metastases are suspected due to clinical signs). Exclusion of the
             infiltration of any adjacent organs or structures by CT or MRI, indicating an
             unresectable situation.

          4. ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2.

          5. Estimated life expectancy &gt; 3 months.

          6. Female and male patients1 ≥18 years.

          7. Patient able and willing to provide written informed consent and to comply with the
             study protocol and with the planned surgical procedures

          8. No previous or preceding cytotoxic or targeted therapy for BTC or IGBC.

          9. No previous malignancy within five years or concomitant malignancy, except
             non-melanomatous skin cancer or adequately treated in situ cervical cancer.

         10. No severe or uncontrolled cardiovascular disease (congestive heart failure NYHA III or
             IV, unstable angina pectoris, history of myocardial infarction in the last three
             months, significant arrhythmia).

         11. Absence of psychiatric disorder precluding understanding of information of trial
             related topics and giving informed consent.

         12. No serious underlying medical conditions (judged by the investigator), that could
             impair the ability of the patient to participate in the trial.

         13. A) Females of childbearing potential must agree to remain abstinent (refrain from
             heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate
             of &lt;1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 7 months after the last
             study treatment.

             A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal, has
             not reached a postmenopausal state (has not had ≥12 continuous months of amenorrhea
             with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical
             sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). Examples of contraceptive methods
             with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male
             sterilization, hormonal implants, established, proper use of combined oral or injected
             hormonal contraceptives, and certain intrauterine devices. The reliability of sexual
             abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and
             the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar,
             ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable
             methods of contraception.

             B) Males must agree to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use
             contraceptive measures, and agree to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:

             With female partners of childbearing potential or pregnant female partners, men must
             remain abstinent or use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together
             result in a failure rate of 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 3
             months after the last dose of study treatment to avoid exposing the embryo. Men must
             refrain from donating sperm during this same period. Men with a pregnant partner must

             prior to randomization.

         19. No active uncontrolled infection, except chronic viral hepatitis under antiviral
             therapy (patients on long-term antibiotics are eligible provided signs of active
             infection have been resolved).

             treatment in a clinical trial within 30 days or five half-lives (whichever is longer)
