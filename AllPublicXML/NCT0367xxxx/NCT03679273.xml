  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is the leading cause of non-traumatic limb loss in adult worldwide.
      One of the major causes of limb loss in patients with DFU is poor wound healing. It is known
      that nutrition plays a key role in wound healing, not only because of the required calories,
      but more importantly for collagen remodeling by specific amino acids (arginine, glutamine,
      and β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate).

      Nevertheless, few studies have investigated nutritional supplements in patients with poor
      wound healing of DFU. Difficulties in assessing the severity of a wound and poor adherence to
      drug and food supplements at home may be important factors for the negative results shown in
      a most recent prospective randomized controlled trial. The diabetic foot center in Chang Gung
      Memorial hospital has extensive experience in caring for patients with limb-threatening DFU
      and we recently reported that poor nutritional status in our patients correlated to poor
      treatment outcomes. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and possible
      molecular mechanisms in nutritional treatment for limb-threatening DFU. A total of 70
      patients will be enrolled and randomized into study and control groups. All subjects will
      receive standard care. Additional amino acid supplements containing arginine, glutamine, and
      β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate or a control (high protein formula powder) will be given orally
      twice a day for 21 days, and the percentage change in wound size will then be measured.
      Complete healing time, recurrence or major adverse cardiac events will be recorded during one
      year of follow up. Data on wound size, nutritional status, and levels of matrix
      metallopeptidase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, nutrient molecules (measured by ABSOLUTE/DQ P180 KIT (LC
      MS/MS) will be recorded before and after the nutritional supplementation. In addition, the
      pioneer factor forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2) that binds native chromatin and bookmarks
      genomic regions for transcriptional activity may play a role in nutritional supplements in
      acute stressed diabetic patients. Therefore, we intend to conduct a pilot study on the for
      FOXA2 gene in maintaining glucose homeostasis in diabetic foot patients after nutritional
      interventions.
