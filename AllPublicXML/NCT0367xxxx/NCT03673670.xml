  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigates the effect of 3 days of twice daily treatment of two different doses
      of RPL554 (a phosphodiesterase [PDE]3/4 inhibitor) or placebo, each administered in addition
      to once daily tiotropium/olodaterol (Respimat) in patients with moderate to severe chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Patients will receive each of the three treatment
      combinations in a randomized sequence using a crossover design
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RPL554 is a dual inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) and phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) which
      are known to have a role in modulating the inflammatory airway response in respiratory
      diseases, including COPD. PDE3 inhibitors act as bronchodilators whilst PDE4 inhibitors have
      anti-inflammatory properties and there is also evidence to suggest that combined inhibition
      of PDE3 and PDE4 can have additive or synergistic anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator. The
      two doses of RPL554 (1.5 mg and 6 mg)have been selected based on the results from prior
      studies investigating single and multiple ascending doses in healthy subjects, single doses
      in asthmatics, single/multiple ascending doses in COPD patients, and 3 days of dosing in COPD
      patients. These doses were demonstrated to be both effective as a bronchodilator and well
      tolerated.

      The purpose of the study is to investigate if RPL554 has an additive bronchodilator effect
      when administered in combination with a commonly used anticholinergic/β-agonist combination
      medication, tiotropium/olodaterol (Respimat), in this patient population measured by the peak
      forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and forced vital capacity (FVC).
