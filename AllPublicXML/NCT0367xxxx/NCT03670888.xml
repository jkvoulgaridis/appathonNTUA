  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study to compare the PK,
      safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and PD of JHL1101 vs Rituxan in subjects with
      CD20-positive B cell lymphoma. The study duration is 13 weeks. Approximately 128 eligible
      subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either JHL1101 (n=64) or Rituxan
      (n=64). Each subject will receive one intravenous (IV) infusions of the investigational
      product (IP) at the dose of 375mg/m2 on Day 1. Assessments of PK, safety, tolerability,
      immunogenicity, PD, and efficacy will be collected over the following 13-week period.
