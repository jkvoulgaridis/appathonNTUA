    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving premenopausal
      and postmenopausal Chinese women plus an open-label single arm of pharmacokinetic cohort of
      LEE011 in combination with Letrozole in Chinese postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2- negative
      advanced breast cancer.

      Three cohorts of patients will be enrolled: PK cohort, premenopausal cohort, and
      postmenopausal cohort.

          -  Patient has HER2-negative breast cancer (based on most recently analyzed biopsy)
             defined as a negative in situ hybridization test or an Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
             status of 0, 1+ or 2+. If IHC is 2+, a negative in situ hybridization (FISH, CISH, or
             SISH) test is required by local laboratory testing.

          -  Patient must have either:

               -  Measurable disease, i.e., at least 1 measurable lesion as per Response Evaluation
                  Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria (a lesion at a previously

                  of progression since the irradiation). OR

               -  If no measurable disease is present, then at least 1 predominantly lytic bone
                  lesion must be present (patients with no measurable disease and only 1
                  predominantly lytic bone lesion that has been previously irradiated are eligible

             Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 Grade ≤1.

          -  Patient has a known history of Human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection (testing
             not mandatory).

          -  Clinically significant, uncontrolled heart disease and/or cardiac repolarization
             abnormality

          -  Patient is currently receiving any of the substances as defined in the protocol that

        study.

        For postmenopausal cohort:

        - Patient who received any prior systemic anti-cancer therapy (including hormonal therapy
        and chemotherapy) for advanced breast cancer.

        Note: Patients who received neo (adjuvant) therapy for breast cancer are eligible. If the
        prior neo (adjuvant) therapy included letrozole or anastrozole, the disease free interval
        must be greater than 12 months from the completion of treatment until randomization.
