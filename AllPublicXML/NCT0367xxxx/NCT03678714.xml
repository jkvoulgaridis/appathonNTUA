  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a complex hormonal and metabolic disorder that has been
      shown to affect women's fertility. It can also share many symptoms with pre-diabetes, and
      women with PCOS often have an increased risk for type 2 diabetes, heart attack and stroke.

      This study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of exercise intervention and
      increased lifestyle physical activity to improve cardiovascular disease risk factors in women
      with PCOS.

      This is a three arm feasibility study in which participants will be allocated to an exercise
      group, an increased lifestyle physical activity group, or a control group. We will determine
      the appropriateness of procedures for recruitment, allocation, measurement and retention for
      the intervention procedures in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.

      The investigators will also determine if we are able to detect changes in blood lipid
      profile, inflammation, and hormonal and metabolic profile as a result of the intervention(s)
      using blood biomarkers.
