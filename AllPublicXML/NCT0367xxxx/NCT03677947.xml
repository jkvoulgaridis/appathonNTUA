  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a highly disabling psychiatric illness, characterized
      by obsessional thoughts that cause patients to perform time-consuming and distressing
      compulsive rituals. Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) is a first-line psychological
      treatment of choice, which requires patients to face their fears by being exposed to feared
      stimuli. ERP has been shown to reduce symptoms among those who comply with treatment.
      However, there is still a significant portion of patients that do not improve, especially
      those who firmly believe their obsessions are realistic and reasonable (i.e. OCD with
      Overvalued Ideation (OVI)). Also, a large proportion of patients refuse the treatment or drop
      out during treatment due to the distress provoked by ERP. That leaves at most 3-4 out of 10
      people with OCD who benefit from ERP, and even then, residual symptoms often remain, or
      symptoms eventually reappear after treatment. One evidence-based approach to the treatment of
      OCD, termed inference-based cognitive therapy (IBCT) has been shown to be as effective as ERP
      with the potential to overcome the limitations of ERP. Since IBCT is a cognitive approach,
      the treatment does not require exposure to feared stimuli and likely more tolerable for
      patients with OCD. Also, there is evidence that IBCT is more effective than ERP for those
      with overvalued ideation, since it directly targets the distorted reasoning that is
      responsible for the intensity and persistence of the obsession. The current study aims to
      directly compare ERP with this promising evidence-based cognitive therapy, which is expected
      to be significantly more effective for those with overvalued ideation, as well as
      significantly more tolerable with lower rates of treatment refusal, drop-out and higher
      treatment satisfaction. The project is designed to maximize potential beneficial health
      outcomes and offer a new evidence-based treatment option for the large proportion of patients
      unable to benefit from ERP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a parallel-group randomized controlled trial developed in accordance
      with CONSORT quality guidelines.The RCT will compare the outcome of 16 sessions of IBCT
      compared to 16 sessions of ERP in OCD patients. The principal investigators and independent
      evaluators will be blind to the random allocation treatment conditions with a randomization
      ratio of 1:1. Both treatments will be administered by trained therapists on a weekly
      one-on-one basis over a 16-week period with 6-month follow-up conforming to current thinking
      on relapse in OCD. Conditions of treatment delivery, duration and monitoring will be
      equivalent across all groups. Both treatments are manualized and any newly engaged therapists
      will receive intensive training in one therapy protocol to ensure optimal delivery of each
      modality.

      The objective of the present study is to establish IBCT as a psychological treatment that is
      as effective as ERP, but significantly more tolerable and generalizable for the high
      proportion of patients who are unable to benefit from ERP.

      The hypotheses is IBCT is non-inferior to ERP; IBCT is superior to ERP among OCD patients
      with high levels of OVI and IBCT is more tolerable than ERP with lower rates of treatment
      refusal, drop-out and higher levels of treatment satisfaction in comparison to ERP.

    <description>The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) is a 10-item scale designed to measure the severity and type of symptoms in people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) over the past seven days. The symptoms assessed are obsessions and compulsions. This scale is useful in tracking OCD symptoms at intake and during/after treatment.
Total Y-BOCS scores range from 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating greater severity of OCD symptoms. Scores on the obsession and compulsion subscales range from 0 to 20, but only the total Y-BOCS score is interpreted. Total scores can be split into five categories, based on severity of symptoms. People who have a total Y-BOCS score:
Under 7 are likely to be subclinical, 8-15 are likely to have a mild case of OCD, 16-23 are likely to have a moderate case of OCD, 24-31 are likely to have a severe case of OCD, 32-40 are likely to have an extreme case of OCD.</description>

The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The EQ Value Average Score used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflects the participant's own judgement. The scores on these five dimensions can be presented as a health profile or can be converted to a single summary index number (utility) reflecting preferability compared to other health profiles.
The final score is a scale numbered from 0 to 100, where100 means the best health you can imagine and 0 means the worst health you can imagine.</description>

    <description>The Inferential Confusion Questionnaire-Expanded Version (ICQ-EV) is a 30-item questionnaire measuring an overreliance on imagination, a distrust of the senses, and a tendency to confuse imagination with reality during reasoning. Like the original version, the expanded version of the ICQ is a highly reliable measure that has been shown to explain a large portion of the variance in symptoms of OCD independent of negative mood states and other cognitive domains. Items are rated on a 6-point scale .</description>

    <measure>used to evaluate credibility and expectancy of treatment modality by participant</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline measure</time_frame>
    <description>The Credibility and Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ) is a 6-item measure divided into two subscales assessing treatment credibility (CEQ-Credibility) and expectancy (CEQ-Expectancy), respectively. The first three CEQ items assess credibility and are rated from 1 to 9 with total possible scores ranging from 3 to 27, where higher scores indicate greater credibility beliefs. The final three CEQ items assess expectancy, with one item rated from 1 to 9, and two items rated from 0% to 100% (values from 1 to 11). We standardized these three items into z scores before summing to create the total Expectancy score. The Expectancy scale scores ranged from −6.72 to 5.51, where higher scores indicate higher expectations.</description>

    <description>The Evaluation of Treatment Questionnaire is a 19-item subjective measure assessing treatment satisfaction. It is a qualitative and quantitative questionnaire. The first two items assess how far therapy help, their importance and the satisfaction. The second part rate what the participant think about the therapy in a 1 to 10 scale. The third part assess what participant feel about the therapy on different scale. Finally, the last part rate satisfaction, preoccupation, stress and what the less like about the therapy.</description>

    <description>ERP is a treatment developed to help people confront their fears based on the rationale that exposure to feared objects, activities, or situations in a safe environment helps reduce fear and decrease avoidance. During the treatment, patients will engage in these exposures to feared stimuli within and between sessions according to hierarchies developed during the initial evaluation sessions, and refrain from engaging in compulsive behaviour until their anxiety subsides (i.e. ritual prevention).</description>

During the treatment, participants will engage in these exposures to feared stimuli within and between sessions according to hierarchies developed during the initial evaluation sessions, and refrain from engaging in compulsive behaviour until their anxiety subsides (i.e. ritual prevention). Exercises will consist of both exposure in vivo (i.e. exposure in real life situations) and/or imaginal exposure according to recommendations.</description>
