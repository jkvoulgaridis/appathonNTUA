             -  Pharmacokinetic analysis:

      Phoenix WinNonlin software (Pharsight Corporation, version 7.0) was used to estimate and
      analyze the parameters of PK in non-atrioventricular model according to dosage. The
      pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated in actual time to fully reflect the
      characteristics of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion in human body. The
      PK parameters of each participant were calculated according to the following methods. PK
      parameters include:

      AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, Cmax, Tmax, t1/2, CL/F, Vd/F, MRT, λz; Descriptive statistics of
      untransformed data of drug concentration in plasma at each time point, AUC0 t, AUC0-∞, Cmax,
      Tmax, t1/2, CL/F, Vd/F, MRT and λz were summarized. Descriptive statistics was used in the
      analysis of Number (N), arithmetic mean, geometric mean, standard deviation (SD), CV,
      minimum, median and maximum.

      · Linear correlation analysis for dosage: The dose dependence of Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ was
      evaluated. Linear correlation analysis of main pharmacokinetic parameters and dosage was done
      for each subject by power model.

      · Safety analysis: All AE, treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE), drug-related TEAE, grade
      3 or above TEAE, serious adverse events (SAE), drug-related SAE, TEAE leading to death, TEAE
      leading to termination of trial, drug-relation TEAE leading to termination of trial and
      drug-related TEAE leading to discontinuation of use of test drug were summarized for case
      number, subject number and incidence rate. Summary of cases and incidence. P value for the
      incidence of these AEs with different classifications was calculated by Fisher's exact test.

      TEAE, SAE, drug-related TEAE, drug-related SAE, TEAE leading to the termination of the trial,
      and TEAE leading to the discontinuation of drug use were summarized and described according
      to the system organ classification (SOC), preferred terminology (PT) and study group. The
      severity of TEAE and drug-related TEAE was also summarized according to SOC, PT and study
      groups.

      The measured value of parameters and change of baseline of vital signs, 12-lead ECG, physical
      examination, clinical laboratory examination, etc. were summarized according to the planned
      time point and the study group.

      Determine dose-limited toxicity of a single dose in human (DLT); Determine the maximum
      tolerated dose of a single dose in human (MTD).
