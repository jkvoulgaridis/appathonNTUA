      This trial studies the preference of room setting and waiting time in patients with cancer
      that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes or other places in the body and their
      caregivers who are seen in the outpatient supportive/palliative care center. Room setting
      preferences of patients and caregivers may help to understand their opinion regarding direct
      rooming system in the outpatient supportive/palliative care center.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine patients and caregivers preferences regarding the rooming process in
      outpatient supportive palliative care clinic, measured by the preference to exam room versus
      waiting area.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Patients and caregiver perceptions regarding room setting and waiting time in the
      outpatient supportive care clinic.

      II. Extent/experience of team contact in the outpatient supportive care clinic. III. The
      factors associated with rooming preferences such as age, gender, symptom distress and
      performance status.

      IV. The association between level of distress (physical, psychological, and spiritual
      distress as measured by Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) and perception of usefulness
      of the visit to palliative care center.

      V. The attitudes and beliefs toward usefulness of referral to outpatient palliative care.

      VI. The correlation between the patient and caregivers preferences.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients and their caregivers complete a questionnaire over 15 minutes either in person or
      over the phone within 3 days after their supportive care center visit.

    <description>Two sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test, whichever more appropriate, will be used to compare continuous variables of interest between the preference of exam room over waiting area. Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test, whichever appropriate, will be used to test for associations between each of categorical variables and preference of exam room over waiting area. Univariate/multicovariate logistic regression analysis will be used to explore the demographics and clinical factors associated with rooming preferences.</description>
