      Influencing children's snacking habits has the potential to reap long-term rewards, yet few
      studies have focused on helping parents to provide healthier snacks for their children. The
      study tested the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of parent interventions to improve
      snacks for children ages 8-12.

      Objective. Influencing children's snacking habits has the potential to reap long-term
      rewards, yet few studies have focused on helping parents to provide healthier snacks for
      their children. The study tested the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of parent
      interventions to improve snacks for children ages 8-12.

      Methods. Parents of children enrolled in an out-of-school-time soccer program in a low-income
      school district (n 16) were recruited. A comparison of 3 randomly-assigned interventions was
      conducted: 4 parents received grocery store gift cards (Incentive); 7 received nutrition
      education videos with tip sheets (Education); and 5 received both (Combined). The
      interventions were assessed qualitatively by interviewing parents and quantitatively to
      determine motivation (psychosocial survey) and children's snack quality (web-based 24-hour
      recall).
