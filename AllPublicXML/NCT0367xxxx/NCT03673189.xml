  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SHERPAM project is part of a scientific and technological context which aim is to record,
      transmit, analyse the physiological parameters of a patient, as well as to record the
      feedback to the patient and health professional to suggest the best individualised attitude.
      The questions of SHERPAM are generic. However, two specific applications will be addressed,
      in which the partners have already acquired some expertise: the recognition and
      quantification of physical activity with energy expenditure estimation, and the assessment of
      walking ability in patients with obliterative vascular disease in the lower limbs. Another
      application concerns the monitoring of the practice of physical activity and some biological
      signs in subjects with cardiovascular risk and in cardiac patients (arrhythmogenic diseases).
      Despite various clinical contexts and health goals, a common approach will be developed.

      To assess the SHERPAM Device (DS) by the continuous acquisition and transmission of data
      (accelerations, rotations, alterations in thoracic volume, heart rate, electrocardiogram) in
      a real life physical activity practice (subjects in their living environment and during their
      usual physical practices) using the DS's real-time communication tools, automatic data
      processing, and the DS's ability to produce information.
