  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impacted canine causes many problems for patients, such as absorption and damages to the
      adjacent teeth roots, as well as aesthetic problems. Correction of this problem requires a
      lengthy time. Therefore, many methods have been suggested to accelerate the movement of
      impacted canines with the help of surgical procedures.

    <measure>Change in the Absorption to the adjacent roots</measure>
    <time_frame>T1: one day before the beginning of treatment; T2: at the end of the traction stage which is expected to occur within 10-12 months in the traditional group and 7-8 months in the accelerated group.</time_frame>
    <description>Absorption of adjacent roots will be evaluated as follows:
In the axial views: an estimation of root damage will be taken into account and will be combined with an estimation of the vertical root damage using 3D volumetric rendered models and then will be classified into one of the four categories Class I: cementum involvement only and located at the apical third of the root Class II: involvement reaching the dentin but vertically less than one-third of the root length.
Class III: involvement reaching the dentin and partially the pulp but still vertically less than one-third of the root length.
Class IV: involvement reaching the root pulp and damaging more than one third of the root length vertically.</description>
