  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate placebo mechanisms related to dry needling(DN) trying to determinate
      whether an additive effect occurs when DN is provided with an instructional set known to
      enhance placebo analgesia. External manipulation of patient expectation for receiving DN will
      be performed, in a similar way as has been already done in studies investigating the
      influence of expectation on spinal manipulative therapy interventions. The main purpose of
      this study will be therefore to determine, for the first time, how subjects' expectation
      about the effect of DN influences the resultant hypoalgesia. Analgesic effects of DN will be
      assessed using the conditioned pain modulation (CPM) paradigm, which has not been previously
      evaluated in relation to DN.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Just before DN intervention, participants will receive a positive or a neutral expectation
      instructional set regarding effects of a DN technique on pain perception. This instructional
      set will be randomly allocated to each patient.

      Participants in the positive expectation group will be told that DN procedure: &quot;is a very
      effective form of treatment used to treat neck-shoulder pain and it is expected to reduce
      your perception of pressure pain&quot;. Participants in the neutral expectation group will be told
      that DN procedure: &quot;is a form of treatment used to treat neck-shoulder pain that has unknown
      effects on your perception of pressure pain&quot;.

      DN intervention An experienced and trained physical therapist will provide DN to all the
      subjects. This researcher will be blinded to the specific expectation instructional set the
      participant receives. Participants will receive one session of DN treatment for the active
      Myofascial Trigger Points(MTrP) located at the upper trapezius muscle. They will be placed in
      a prone position on the examination table. Solid filament needles of 0.30 mm diameter and 40
      mm length will be used. The needle will be inserted into the skin over the palpated MTrP
      using pincer palpation, and slowly advanced perpendicularly until it reaches the MTrP and a
      twitch response is elicited.

    <measure>Pain Intensity: Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators use a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) to determine the intensity of the patient's current pain before, during DN and immediately after DN. We will follow the paradigm of Conditioned pain modulation (CPM) paradigm. CPM will be induced by inflating an occlusion cuff (conditioning stimulus) at the arm, at the opposite side from the affected upper trapezius.The VAS is a 100-mm line, oriented horizontally, with one end representing &quot;no pain&quot;(the best value) and the other end representing &quot;worst pain&quot; (the worse value). Subjects will be asked to rate their current pain with a mark on the scale.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Pressure Threshold (PPT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change up 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>The PPT serves to determine the sensitivity of hiperalgesic focus. The investigators will done it with one algometer.
Lower values are a worse result. Higher values are a better result.</description>
