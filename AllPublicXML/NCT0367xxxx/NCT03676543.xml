  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epileptic seizures arise from neuronal defects that often alter the capacity of the brain to
      process sensory information. During absence seizures, a frequent epileptic syndrome in
      children, the normal conscious and perceptual processes are temporarily interrupted. This is
      the result of abnormal synchronized neural activities in the thalamo-cortical loops, leading
      to bilateral spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) in the cortical electroencephalograms (EEGs).
      The brain mechanisms underlying the lack of sensory experience during absence seizures are
      disputed. Based on preliminary data, the investigators hypothesize that the alternation of
      'spike' and 'wave' patterns during seizure could cause a time-to-time inconstancy in cortical
      responsiveness, preventing conscious perception. Using a real-time closed-loop stimulation
      system, the investigators will research how the S- and W-patterns specifically alter the
      sensory-evoked responses in the EEG. During a standard EEG, visual stimulations will be
      applied between and during absence seizures to test the hypothesis that repeated sensory
      stimuli, applied with an appropriate timing relative to the seizure-related oscillatory
      cycle, could negatively interfere with the regenerative network mechanisms involved in the
      occurrence of SWDs. The completion of this project should permit to unveil a new neuronal
      mechanism supporting the lack of conscious experience during absences and pave the way for
      new clinical non-invasive strategies to interrupt ongoing seizure activity.
