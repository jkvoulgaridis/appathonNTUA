  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food allergy (FA) is a serious public health concern that causes potentially-life threatening
      reactions in affected patients. The prevalence of food allergy in the United States (U.S.)
      has increased substantially and now affects 15 million patients:4-8% of children (6 million
      children, 30% with multiple food allergies) and about 9% of adults. This is a prospective
      Phase 2, single-center, multi-allergen OIT study in participants with proven allergies to 2
      or 3 different foods in which one must be a peanut. The total of participants in the clinical
      study will be 110, ages 6 to 25 years with a history of multiple food allergies of 2 to 3
      different foods including peanut. Allergy will be confirmed by FA-specific IgE levels and
      positive skin prick test (SPT). Enrolled participants must be positive during the
      Double-blind Placebo-controlled Food challenge (DBPCFC) at or before the 300 mg (444 mg
      cumulative) dosing level of FA proteins.

      This is a prospective Phase 2, single-center, multi-allergen OIT study in participants with
      proven allergies to 2 or 3 different foods in which one must be peanut. The total population
      will be 110 participants, ages 6 to 25 years that present with a history of multiple food
      allergies of 2 or 3 different foods including peanut, food-allergen (FA)-specific IgE levels,
      and positive skin prick test (SPT).

      Enrolled participants must react positively during DBPCFCs at or before the 300 mg (444 mg
      cumulative) dosing level of FA proteins of 2 or 3 allergens in which one must be a peanut.

      There will be three study cohorts, all will be double blinded:

      Cohort A (50 participants) will be treated with omalizumab for 8 weeks followed by 24 weeks
      of treatment with placebo. Cohort B (50 participants) will be treated with omalizumab for 8
      weeks, followed by 24 weeks of treatment with dupilumab. Cohort C (10 participants) will be
      treated with placebo for 8 weeks followed by 24 weeks treatment with dupilumab. All cohorts
      will receive multifood allergen oral immunotherapy.
