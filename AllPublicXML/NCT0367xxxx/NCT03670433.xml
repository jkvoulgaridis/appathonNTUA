  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among the strategies to secure the patient's care path, medication reconciliation is a
      powerful approach for the prevention and interception of medication errors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All medication errors are not serious. Nevertheless 4 studies show that respectively 5.6%,
      5.7%, 6.3% and 11.7% of the medication errors intercepted by medication reconciliation (MR)
      could have had major, critical or catastrophic consequences for patients. If the consequences
      of a medication error have a clinical or institutional translation for the patient, they can
      also directly impact the hospital or caregivers, for example by extending the average length
      of stay or by increasing the number of consultations or readmissions.

      The efficiency of the medication reconciliation approach has never been evaluated in France
      in comparison with standard care. Before initiating cost-effectiveness studies, we propose to
      conduct a micro-costing study to evaluate the production costs of this conciliation approach.

      The costs are almost exclusively related to human resources and the present study will assess
      the time spent by the different actors involved in the process.

    <description>The MR at entry is performed by the pharmaceutical team as soon as possible after admission. The sequences of the medical conciliation are attributed to the health professionals according to the recommendations of the French National Authority for Health (HAS).
The MR at the discharge is carried out in collaboration between the pharmaceutical and medical teams. It associates the patient through pharmaceutical interview and relies on the sharing of informations related to the patient's medical treatments. These informations are synthesized in an output conciliation sheet transmitted in real time by secure messaging to the attending physician and the dispensing pharmacist. In parallel, the liaison letter and the patient discharge order are generated in order to guarantee a perfect homogeneity between all the documents transmitted at the patient's exit. MR sequences are attributed to health professionals according to the recommendations of the HAS.</description>
