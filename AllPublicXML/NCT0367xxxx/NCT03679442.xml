  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paracetamol (PCM) is a widely used over-the-counter analgesic, and overdose with PCM is a
      condition regularly seen in everyday clinical practice. Identification of the patients with
      early signs of liver injury that may develop into acute liver failure is important. Previous
      research has shown that macrophages play a role in the development of liver damage in
      PCM-induced acute liver failure, making macrophage markers interesting possible biomarkers of
      this condition. In the present study, the investigators aimed to investigate the extent and
      timing of macrophage activation in PCM-induced liver injury by measuring levels of macrophage
      markers sCD163 and sCD206 in patients admitted with PCM overdose. The investigators also
      hoped to find out whether these markers are valuable as prognostic markers of severe outcome
      in these patients.

      Furthermore the investigators examined the possible effect of antidote treatment with
      N-acetylcysteine on activation and function of macrophages by administering NAC to healthy
      subjects and measuring levels of sCD163 and sCD206 prior to and after completion of
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The part of the study concerning the patients with PCM overdose was strictly observational
      with measurement of macrophage markers and no other intervention than the NAC treatment
      administered in the setting of management of the participants PCM overdose according to best
      clinical practice.

      The interventional part of the study which is submitted for registration here concerns only
      healthy controls who were exposed to NAC treatment in order to assess the direct effects of
      NAC on macrophages. The participants received NAC treatment according to the same protocol as
      the PCM overdosed patients, and macrophage activation markers were measured prior to and
      after 16 hours of NAC treatment. Thus, the involvement of the participants in the study was
      limited to the 16 hours of NAC treatment.
