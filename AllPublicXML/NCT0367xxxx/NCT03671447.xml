  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the multi-center stepped-wedge cluster-randomized controlled trial
      ERIC is to evaluate the effects of a multi-component telemedicine-based intervention
      delivered by the ICU on the adherence to quality indicators (QI) in intensive care medicine
      compared to usual care.

      Critically ill patients treated on the interventional condition receive daily tele-medical
      rounds during their ICU stay.

      Further secondary objectives are to demonstrate whether the intervention improves patient
      outcomes 3 and 6 months post ICU discharge, compared to usual care.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale:

      Survivors of critical illness frequently develop long-term mental, cognitive, and/or physical
      impairments summarized as Post Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS). On the national society level,
      Germany uses 10 core QIs that are evidence-based to improve treatment quality at ICUs.

      Objective:

      To investigate whether a tele-medical intervention delivered at ICU improves the adherence to
      established evidence-based QIs in intensive care medicine compared to the adherence at ICUs
      delivering usual care.

      Study design:

      ERIC is a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized controlled quality improvement trial with
      participating ICUs crossing over from usual care to a multifaceted e-health intervention.
      After the rollout, all recruiting sites will have implemented the experimental intervention
      for at least 4 months. Follow-up assessments on the patient-level at month 3 and 6 after ICU
      discharge (index stay) will be conducted in the outpatient or inpatient setting (dependent on
      the patient's health status).

      Study population:

      Critically ill patients covered by statutory health insurance treated at participating ICUs
      in Berlin and Brandenburg, Germany. It is planned to recruit 1431 study patients within 16
      months.

      Intervention:

      Complex telemedicine-based intervention incorporating the use of e-health technologies
      (virtual care), supported by blended learning of ICU staff prior to the site's crossover.

      Comparison:

      Intensive care according to current practice.

      Endpoints:

      Eight co-primary endpoints will be specified. A primary efficacy endpoint is the adherence to
      a single QI in intensive care medicine (definition according to Kumpf O. et al., 2017)
      measured on a daily basis, on a patient-level.
