  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic patient education is an approach that has shown its usefulness in rheumatology,
      but the duration of its impact is limited, and therapeutic revisions are regularly necessary.
      The practice of physical activity is one of the goals of TPE in rheumatology and new
      technologies, such as SMS messages represent a possible complementary tool to amplify
      behavioral changes The study primary objective is to evaluate the impact of individualized
      SMS compared to standard SMS messages on the physical activity of patients with chronic
      inflammatory rheumatism or osteoporosis, included in a therapeutic education program. Our
      hypothesis is that individualized SMS has a higher efficiency compared to standard SMS
      messages to increase the practice of physical activity in these patients.
