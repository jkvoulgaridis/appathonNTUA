  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III randomized blind placebo-controlled study, designed to show the
      superiority of the experimental arm to the control arm.

      After surgery and checking eligibility criteria, patients will be randomized between the
      control and the experimental arms with a 1:1 ratio (randomization will take place at a
      maximum 4 weeks after surgery):

        -  Experimental Arm: Durvalumab (one dose) before chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and for 6 months
           every 4 weeks (Q4W) after CRT

        -  Control Arm: placebo (one dose) before CRT and for 6 months Q4W after CRT Radiotherapy
           planning will take place after randomization. The primary endpoint of this trial is
           disease free survival (DFS), measured from the date of randomization to the date of
           first occurrence of any loco-regional recurrence, metastatic progression, or death due
           to any cause.

Cumulative incidence of loco-regional recurrence is estimated considering death or diagnosis of distant metastases in absence of loca l or regional recurrence is considered as a competing risk event. If a recurrence is detected at the same time at both loco-regional and distant sites, this is considered as an event of interest for this endpoint.</description>
