      The overall objective of the study is to examine the effects of the Montreal Museum of Fine
      Arts (MMFA) participatory art-based activity on wellbeing, quality of life and health
      condition in older community dwellers.

      Aging is often associated with worsening health and withdrawal from social activities, both
      increasing the risk of a poor quality of life. It has been reported that the practice of art,
      especially participatory art-based activity enhances wellbeing, quality of life and health
      condition of patients and older adults. Since October 2015, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts
      (MMFA; Quebec, Canada) has successfully initiated a participatory art-based activity known as
      &quot;Les Beaux-Jeudis&quot; for older community dwellers living in Montreal. Recently, the
      investigator demonstrated that the MMFA participatory art-based activity improved wellbeing,
      quality of life and health condition of Montreal older community dwellers using a pre-post
      single arm, prospective and longitudinal design: it was not a randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) which is the gold standard to examine the effects of an intervention.

      Background. Recently, the investigator demonstrated that the Montreal Museum of Fine-Arts
      (MMFA) participatory art-based activity improved wellbeing, quality of life and health
      condition of Montreal older community dwellers using a pre-post single arm, prospective and
      longitudinal design. The main limitation of this pilot study was its design: it was not a
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) which is the gold standard to examine the effects of an
      intervention.

      Objectives. The overall objective is to examine the effect of the MMFA participatory
      art-based activity on wellbeing, quality of life and health condition in older community
      dwellers.

      The specific objectives are to compare the changes in 1) wellbeing, 2) quality of life and 3)
      health condition in older community dwellers participating in the MMFA participatory
      art-based activity (Intervention group) and in age and sex-matched older community dwellers
      who are not participants in the MMFA participatory art-based activity (Control group) during
      the same period of time. In addition, the compliance to MMFA participatory art-based activity
      in intervention will be examined.

      Methods. The design is a unicentre (Jewish General Hospital; Montreal, Quebec, Canada),
      clinical, randomized, controlled, single blinded (i.e.; investigators), superiority trial,
      with two parallel arms (Intervention and Control groups), comparative (comparison of
      Intervention and Control groups) and analyzed with the intention-to-treat.

      The participants in the Intervention group will be participants of the MMFA participatory
      art-based activity. The Control group will be composed of older community dwellers matched on
      age and sex compared to the Intervention group but who will not be participate to the MMFA
      participatory art-based activity.

      The follow-up period will be 3 months, which is the duration of a session of the MMFA
      participatory art-based activity. Assessment of wellbeing, quality of life and health
      condition will be performed at baseline, at the beginning of second and third months, and at
      the end of third month.

    <description>The intervention is a participatory art-based activity which consists in making art in group, involving the participants directly in the creative process, allowing them to become co-authors of the work. Participants will meet once per week for a 2h workshop from 2.00 PM to 4.00 PM at the MMFA in a dedicated room during a three month-period defining &quot;a session&quot;. Two successive sessions will be setup; a winter and a spring sessions. Each session will be composed of 12 consecutive workshops.</description>
