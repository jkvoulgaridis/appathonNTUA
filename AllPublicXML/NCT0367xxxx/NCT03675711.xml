  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate 2 strategies to remove central venous catheter (CVC): in one part,
      the insertion of a midline catheter and in the other part, the conventional insertion of
      peripheral venous catheter (PVC)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomised when the last indication for CVC has disappeared, which means
      parenteral nutrition or vasopressors administration.

      They will be randomised either in the midline group or in the PVC group.

        -  In the midline group, a midline catheter will try to be inserted before the 48th hour
           after last indication for CVC disappeared.

        -  In the PVC group: a PVC will try to be inserted before the 48th hour after last
           indication for CVC disappeared.

      If successful, CVC will then be removed. If not, a PVC will try to be inserted daily till
      success or worthlessness of a venous line or death.

      The presence of a CVC will be assessed at the 96th hour after disappearance of last CVC
      indication.
