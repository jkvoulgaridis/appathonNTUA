  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well electronic neurocognitive tools work in screening for mental
      capability in patients who are undergoing liver surgery. Using electronic neurocognitive
      screening tools may help to better assess mental impairment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate feasibility of the electronic batteries, measured by the completion rate and time
      to completion of the batteries.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Comparison of the completion rate and time to completion between the written and
      electronic batteries.

      II. Comparison of the scoring distribution between the screening tools.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess if a history of mental or cognitive illness or ongoing treatment with
      neuropsychiatric medications impact the ability to complete written and/or electronic
      neurocognitive screening.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive the BrainCheck cognitive assessment over 15 minutes followed by the
      paper and pen cognitive assessment within 2 months prior to surgery and within 2 months after
      surgery.

      GROUP II: Patients receive the paper and pen cognitive assessment followed by the BrainCheck
      cognitive assessment over 15 minutes 2 months prior to surgery and within 2 months after
      surgery.
