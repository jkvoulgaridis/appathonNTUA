  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Determining the best approach for a total hip arthroplasty (THA) implies that the procedure
      is kind on soft tissues, with the lowest complication rates, and easily reproducible.
      Although there have been several attempts to resolve this issue in the last decade, a
      definitive answer has not been found. Therefore, the investigators performed a prospective
      study to compare direct anterior versus posterior approach based on (1) hospital stay, (2)
      functional outcome, (3) pain, (4) implant position (5) complications and (6) surgical time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this multicentric, prospective, randomized clinical trial, 55 total hip arthroplasties
      were performed on 50 patients between February 2011 and July 2013. Patients meeting the
      inclusion criteria underwent surgical treatment using the DAA or PA, according to a
      randomization process. Radiological analysis assessed implant position, limb lengthening, and
      potential implant related complications. X-rays were performed at subsequent follow-up visits
      and consisted of an antero-posterior (AP) pelvic X-ray and a lateral projection of the hip.
      Two independent observers, not involved with patients or surgeries, reviewed all
      postoperative radiographs independently.Two fellowship-trained surgeons in two separate
      hospitals performed all procedures. Both surgeons had previously performed over 100 cases
      with each approach, before initiating this study.

      Patients underwent either the posterior or direct anterior approach.

    <masking_description>However, the decision to discharge subjects was made by physiotherapists blinded to treatment and based on objective criteria. These criteria were: 1) being autonomous for transfer from bed/chair to upright position 2) being able to walk with walking aid 3) climbing stairs in a safe way 4) having a pain level contained by painkillers. No restrictions were recommended for either group. The same rehabilitation and pain protocols were used for both approaches. In addition, statistical analyses were performed by an independent consultant who remained blinded to treatment group assignment.</masking_description>

    <description>The Harris Hip Score (HHS) was used to measure pain and function.Grading for the Harris Hip Score is interpreted on a scale of 0 to 100 as follows: results &lt;70 are Poor; 70 - 79 are Fair; 80-89 are Good; 90 -100 are Excellent</description>

    <description>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used. The pain VAS is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity, which has been widely used in diverse adult populations, including those with rheumatic diseases. The pain VAS is a continuous scale comprised of a horizontal (HVAS) or vertical (VVAS) line, usually 10 centimeters (100 mm) in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors, one for each symptom extreme. The pain VAS is a single‐item scale, anchored by &quot;no pain&quot; (score of 0) and &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot; or &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot; (score of 100 [100‐mm scale]) . It is one total score, without subscale. As the lowest score of zero means no pain, it is the best possible outcome. As the highest score of 100 means the worst imaginable pain, it is the worst possible outcome.</description>

    <description>The posterior approach to the hip has been described by many authors and yields good results. Implants used were Quadra®-H stem and Versacup® hip system, Medacta, Switzerland, with metal on polyethylene bearing. All implants were non-cemented.</description>

    <description>The modified Hueter approach, based on the Smith-Peterson approach, was performed for the direct anterior minimally invasive surgery. This approach could have some advantages as it is a muscle sparing approach, hence yielding a faster recovery. A traction table was used for DAA as surgeons were trained to use this method. No intra-operative fluoroscopy was used for implant confirmation.Implants used were Quadra®-H stem and Versacup® hip system, Medacta, Switzerland, with metal on polyethylene bearing. All implants were non-cemented.</description>
