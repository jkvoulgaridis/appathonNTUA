  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For performing subclavian venous catheterization, two approaches (supraclavicular and
      infraclavicular) have been used successfully in various clinical practice. However, there
      remains controversy concerning which approach is safer and causes less complications during
      ultrasonography-guided subclavian venous catheterization. In this context, the investigators
      sought to compare supraclavicular approach with infraclavicular approach in terms of
      post-procedural complications during ultrasonography-guided subclavian venous
      catheterization.

    <description>The overall incidence of complications will be expressed as the sum of incidences of complications which occurred during subclavian venous catheterization including arterial puncture, hematoma formation, pneumothorax, hemothorax, and malposition of catheter. Arterial puncture, hematoma formation, and malposition of catheter will be evaluated with ultrasonography, and pneumothorax and hemothorax will be evaluated by chest radiography.</description>
