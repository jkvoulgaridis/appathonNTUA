    <textblock>
      This is an single arm, open label, interventional phase II trial evaluating the efficacy of
      umbilical cord blood (UCB) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) expanded in culture
      with stimulatory cytokines (SCF, Flt-3L, IL-6 and thromopoietin) on lympho-hematopoietic
      recovery. Patients will receive a uniform myeloablative conditioning and post-transplant
      immunoprophylaxis.
