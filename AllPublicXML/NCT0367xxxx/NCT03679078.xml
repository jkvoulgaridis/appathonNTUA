      This study will evaluate the gastrointestinal (GI) tolerance, compliance , acceptability and
      safety of a ready-to-use oral nutritional supplement drink for patients with dysphagia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dysphagia is a complex condition common in a number of diagnoses including stroke,
      Parkinson's disease, head and neck cancer, dementia, learning disabilities and
      gastric/oesophageal motility disorders.

      A modified textured diet and/or fluid is considered as an effective intervention in
      management of dysphagia. The International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative (IDDSI)
      have developed a new framework around the terms and descriptors used in the management of
      individuals with dysphagia. Malnutrition is very common in patients with dysphagia and the
      use of pre-thickened oral nutritional supplements (ONS) has been found as an effective way to
      manage this. However, due to impairment in the swallow process, dysphagic patients require
      pre-thickened oral nutritional supplement to ensure safe consumption of these nutritional
      supplements.

      40 participants, requiring a new pre-thickened oral nutritional supplement in line with the
      new IDDSI framework recruited from hospitals, outpatients clinics, care homes, community
      hospitals, community dietetic/speech and language therapy services or stroke rehabilitation
      units will receive the ready-to-use oral nutritional supplement for a 4 week intervention
      period. This study aims to primarily evaluate gastro-intestinal tolerance, with secondary
      outcomes including compliance, acceptability, nutrient intake, anthropometry and safety.

    <description>Gastro-intestinal tolerance will be assessed daily throughout a 3 day baseline period before starting the study ONS and at the end of each week (day 10, day 17, day 24, day 31) using a standardised GI tolerance questionnaire including questions on number of bowel movements per day, other gastrointestinal symptoms such as flatulence, bloating, burping and abdominal discomfort. Patient-reported gastrointestinal symptoms with scale range for each symptom as s scale range minimum = none, maximum = severe.
Change of symptom from baseline scale minimum = no change, maximum = worse.</description>
