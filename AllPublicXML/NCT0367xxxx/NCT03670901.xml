  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 500 subjects will be enrolled in this study. Subjects who meet the inclusion
      criteria will be randomized (1:1) into two groups. The study group will receive JHL1101 in
      combination with CHOP regimen, and the control group will receive rituximab (MabThera) in
      combination with CHOP. The dose of 375 mg/m2 is given intravenously on Day 1 (D1) of each
      cycle, and CHOP regimen is administered after the infusion of JHL1101 or rituximab is
      completed. Efficacy evaluation will be performed at baseline, after 3 cycles treatment (D18±
      2 of Cycle 3, before the next cycle of treatment) and after 6 cycles treatment (D21±3 of
      Cycle 6). Subjects evaluated as progressive disease (PD) should be withdrawn from the study
      treatment and their subsequent treatments will be determined by the investigator. The
      analysis of primary endpoint is the ORR over the 6-cycle treatment period.
