      Placebo-controlled study to analyze the effect of perioperative intravenous lidocaine
      administration on total morphine consumption (TMC) and on pain intensity in thoracoscopic
      surgery .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thoracoscopy (thoracic surgery) is a video-assisted minimally invasive operation in thoracic
      surgery, which is associated with pain after surgery. Trial drug Lidocaine is approved as
      pain medication. This placebo-controlled study analyzes the effect of perioperative
      intravenous lidocaine administration on total morphine consumption (TMC) and on pain
      intensity in thoracoscopic surgery .

      Half of the patients will receive NaCl 0.9% (a saline solution without active ingredient)
      instead of Lidocaine.
