      Determine if use of the Medela Invia Motion NPWT system supports acceptable progress towards
      the goal of therapy when treating patients with a variety of wound types during the
      evaluation period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine acceptable progress towards the goal of
      therapy for a diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) and pressure Injuries/ulcers (PI/PU) wounds when
      using the Medela Invia Motion Endure NPWT system during 4-week study duration.

      Goal of therapy will be defined by the physician according to initial assessment:

      Endpoints (dependent on goal of therapy):

        -  Decrease in wound volume

        -  Decrease in size of the tunneling area

        -  Decrease in size of undermining

        -  Decrease in amount of slough

        -  Increase in granulation tissue

        -  The wound bed is progressing acceptably towards a transition to another treatment
           modality such as Moist Wound Healing (MWH), surgical closure, or a flap or graft.

      **Study endpoint will be determined by physician at the time of enrollment, when the goal of
      therapy is documented**

      B. Secondary Objectives

        -  To evaluate the ease of use from clinicians.

        -  To evaluate overall satisfaction from clinicians. C. Tertiary Objectives

        -  Adequate management of the exudate
