    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of FEUrea for the
      differential diagnosis of AKI in patients with cirrhosis and ascites Specifically, the
      ability of FEUrea to distinguish between ATN versus Pre renal azotemia and HRS.

      AKI according to KDIGO guidelines is defined as the followings:

        -  An increase in serum creatinine by ≥0.3 mg/dl (≥26.5 µmol/l) within 48 h

        -  An increase in serum creatinine to ≥1.5 times baseline within the previous 7 days

        -  Urine volume ≤0.5 ml/kg/h for 6 h Serum creatinine overestimates renal function in
           cirrhotic patients due to a number of factors: Creatinine production in patients with
           cirrhosis is reduced due to muscle wasting, there is an increased secretion of
           creatinine in the renal tubules, sCr may be diluted due to an increased volume of
           distribution, and finally, high bilirubin levels may interfere with the assays to
           measure its level. Recently, the International Club of Ascites (ICA) has adopted the
           concept of AKI which was developed originally to be used in general critically-ill
           patients. AKI is defined as the increase of at least 0.3 mg/dL (26 μmol/L) and/or ≥ 50%
           from baseline, within 48 hours Since urea absorption is largely modulated in the
           proximal tubules, it is not affected by diuretics acting more distally. The
           investigators therefore hypothesized that the fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea)
           could serve as a clinical aid in making an early distinction between ATN versus Pre
           renal azotemia and HRS type 1 in patients with cirrhosis and ascites presenting with AKI
           Fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea) ([urine urea nitrogen/ blood urea nitrogen)/(urine
           creatinine/plasma creatinine)] X 100) &lt; 35% is specific for prerenal azotemia, and &gt; 50%
           is specific for ATN
