      Background and purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of one acute
      exercise bout on tumor hypoxia in patients with localized prostate cancer undergoing radical
      prostatectomy.

      The primary hypothesis is that exercise reduces tumor hypoxia and that the reduction is
      greater in patients performing one acute high intensity exercise bout compared to no training
      controls.

      The investigators have not been able to identify any prior or current randomized trials
      investigating exercise and tumor hypoxia, and believe that such research is warranted and
      would be of great importance. Moreover there is a need for studies including biological
      measurements to allow a full assessment of the effect of exercise on diverse biomarkers and
      mechanistic pathways, which may influence cancer survival.

      Subjects: Patients with histologically verified prostate adenocarcinoma scheduled for radical
      prostatectomy at Urologic Department, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.

      Methods: In this randomized controlled pilot study 30 patients with localized prostate cancer
      undergoing radical prostatectomy will be included and randomized 2:1 to either one single
      acute High Intensity Interval Training bout or usual care and no training the day prior to
      radical prostatectomy.

      All patients will undergo assessment at inclusion (baseline) and the day prior to surgery.

      Assessment includes: anthropometrics; blood pressure; resting hearth rate; hip and waist
      circumference, ECG, quality of life by self-report questionnaires; fasting blood sample
      measuring PSA (prostate specific antigen), cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin, c-peptide,
      HbA1c, glucose and inflammatory markers.

      All patients will receive one dose of pimonidazole hydrochloride (500 mg per m2 body surface)
      in order to quantify tumor hypoxia by pathological analyses after removal of the prostate.

      Biological tissue from tumor (primary prostate biopsies) will also be retrieved from the
      respective local pathological departments and from the perioperative prostate specimen and
      sent to protocol analyses.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of one acute exercise bout on tumor
      hypoxia in patients with localized prostate cancer randomized to one single acute I) High
      Intensity Interval Training bout compared to (II) usual care and no training prior to radical
      prostatectomy.

      In addition to this the aim is to investigate the effect of one exercise bout on tumor vessel
      morphology and to investigate the effect of one acute exercise bout on intratumoral immune
      cell infiltration and to investigate the modulation of tumor-metabolism, -biology and
      signaling in patients randomized to either one acute High Intensity Interval Training bout
      compared to usual care and no training, the day prior to surgery.

      Moreover this study will explore the acute response in immune cells, hormones and cytokines
      in blood samples taken before, during and after a single exercise session, and will collect
      physiological (metabolic profile and metabolic inflammatory markers) and psycho-social (e.g.
      fatigue, emotional well-being, anxiety) information regarding patients randomized to either
      one acute High Intensity Interval Training bout compared to usual care and no training, the
      day prior to surgery.
