  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 2 waitlist-controlled, randomized trial is designed to compare the difference in
      proliferative index (Ki67) between carbohydrate restricted diet and usual care over a 6 month
      period in men with prostate cancer who have been placed on Active Surveillance. Eligible
      patients include men over 18 years old, BMI &gt;25, with their most recently performed biopsy
      pathologically confirming prostate adenocarcinoma who have been placed on AS. Arms of the
      trial will be randomized 1:1 in a crossover approach, with Arm A receiving a carb restricted
      diet over 6 months then SOC and Arm B receiving the waitlist control arm (i.e. SOC then
      allowed to go on diet after 6 months). Ki67 will be performed on tissue from the most recent
      biopsy at the beginning of the study and again on tissue obtained in the 6 month SOC biopsy.
      Every patient will be on the study for 12 months, and the study will continue for
      approximately 3.5 years.
