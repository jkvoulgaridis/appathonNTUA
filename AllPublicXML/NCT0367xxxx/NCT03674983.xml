  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this R34 application is to prepare for testing innovative user-centered ways
      to promote PrEP adherence at scale. Our central hypothesis is that adherence to PrEP can be
      improved among MSW if PrEP is provided for free along with highly-tailored conditional
      economic incentives (CEI). The specific aims are: Aim 1: To refine the design of PrEP
      adherence intervention with user-centered conditional economic incentives to maximize
      sustained adherence behaviors through a user-responsive computerized survey (n=200). We
      incorporate quantitatively identified preferences for CEIs through a user- responsive
      computerized survey. We use conjoint analysis to understand preferences for CEI intervention
      components and how CEIs should be integrated into an optimal combination package to be tested
      in Aim 2. Aim 2: Measure the extent to which a user-centered CEI intervention can help MSW
      increase their adherence to free PrEP in a randomized controlled pilot (n=100). Among MSW who
      accept to take free PrEP, and return at month 1 for a second pill bottle, we will randomize
      n=100 MSW to either: standard of care (SoC: information, prescription, free PrEP) or CEI (SoC
      + incentives contingent on sufficiently-high adherence to PrEP). We will assess the primary
      outcome (biomarker of adherence using scalp hair analysis) at months 3 and 6, as well as
      secondary outcomes: clinic attendance/retention, medication possession ratio, self-reported
      PrEP use, and sexual behavioral disinhibition (number of partners, condom use, incident STI).
      Aim 3: Estimate the preliminary cost-effectiveness of incentives for PrEP adherence to
      maximize future policy and practice relevance of this promising intervention strategy. Our
      working hypothesis is that conditional economic incentives for PrEP adherence will be
      cost-effective in terms of cost per fully- adherent month on PrEP, cost per HIV infection
      averted, and cost per disability-adjusted life year saved when compared to controls not
      receiving the conditional incentives. The expected outcome of this R34 is a demonstration
      that is feasible to implement user-centered CEIs in this context, as well as preliminary
      efficacy and cost-effectiveness data. The project will have positive impact because it is a
      critical step toward scaled-up implementation of PrEP in this highly-at-risk population of
      MSWs in Mexico, with implications for other concentrated epidemics among MSW worldwide.

    <intervention_model_description>Aim 1: discrete choice experiment (DCE) with n=200. Aim 2: randomly assign 100 HIV-negative MSW in a 1:1 ratio either to: the SoC group, or to the CEI group. MSW in the SoC group (n=50) will receive transport reimbursement at baseline, 3 and 6 months. MSW in the CEI group (n=50) will receive transport reimbursement at baseline, 3 and 6 months, and additional incentives based on sufficiently high PrEP adherence at months 3 and 6. All participants will provide hair samples and have optional brief counseling based on hair sample results. Those in the CEI group, will receive additional incentives if concentrations of TDF/FTC in hair samples corroborate that they have been sufficiently adherent in recent weeks. The final incentives (amounts, format, location, etc.) will be based on Aim 1 results. 1-2 weeks after study visits, participants will receive a grade depending on the drug level detected in their scalp hair. The CEI amounts will be distributed depending on grade.</intervention_model_description>
