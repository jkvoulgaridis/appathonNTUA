      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a lung disorder commonly caused by smoking,
      which makes breathing more difficult. When COPD patients exercise, they are not efficient
      breathers and this leads to serious breathing difficulties, which often causes these patients
      to stop exercise at low intensities. Even though patients with a mild form of COPD have
      relatively well preserved lung function, they still have inefficient breathing during
      exercise. The investigators think that these patients have problems exchanging fresh gas
      (i.e., oxygen) into the blood stream because of poor lung blood vessel function. The
      investigators will test whether inhaled medications, specifically nitric oxide, can improve
      lung blood vessel function and decrease breathing difficulties during exercise. With this
      research, the investigators will understand more about breathing efficiency and lung blood
      vessel function in mild COPD patients, and find out whether improving lung blood vessel
      function helps COPD patients breathe easier and exercise longer. Understanding the reasons
      behind the feeling of difficult breathing may lead to more effective therapy and improved
      quality of life in COPD patients.

      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a respiratory disorder typically caused by
      smoking and is characterized by airway obstruction. Exertional dyspnea (perceived
      breathlessness) is a hallmark of COPD regardless of severity and is the primary reason for
      exercise intolerance even in patients with mild COPD (defined using spirometric criteria as a
      forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) &lt;0.70 and a FEV1 ≥ 80%).
      Dyspnea in COPD has been shown to profoundly reduce patient quality of life, physical
      activity, and impair patients' ability to complete day-to-day tasks. Previous work in mild
      COPD has demonstrated that exertional dyspnea is the result of increased work of breathing
      during exercise, and that this increased work of breathing comes from: 1) an exaggerated
      ventilatory response to exercise (i.e. increased minute ventilation relative to carbon
      dioxide production, V̇E/V̇CO2), and 2) airflow limitation (i.e. expiratory flow limitation
      and resulting dynamic hyperinflation). A great deal of work has focused on improving airflow
      limitation in COPD; however, very little has been done to understand and treat the
      exaggerated ventilatory response to exercise in COPD.

      Several previous studies in mild COPD have consistently shown an elevated ventilatory
      response (i.e. greater V̇E/V̇CO2) during exercise. The elevated V̇E/V̇CO2 response to
      exercise appears to be clinically important, as it independently predicts mortality in COPD
      and indicates that physiological abnormalities beyond airflow obstruction are important in
      determining disease severity, dyspnea, and risk of death. This increased V̇E/V̇CO2 in mild
      COPD appears to be secondary to increased deadspace ventilation(i.e. sections of the lung
      with ventilation, but no perfusion), and this increased deadspace ventilation results in a
      compensatory increase in total minute ventilation (i.e. increased V̇E/V̇CO2) to maintain
      effective alveolar ventilation and arterial blood gas homeostasis.

      The underlying mechanism(s) for the increased deadspace ventilation and V̇E/V̇CO2 during
      exercise in mild COPD is currently unclear; however, pulmonary microvascular abnormalities
      and hypoperfusion of pulmonary capillaries are potential pathophysiologic mechanisms. Mild
      COPD patients have reduced pulmonary microvascular blood flow in nonemphysematous lung
      regions, which has led researchers to conclude that the low pulmonary perfusion in an intact
      pulmonary vascular bed is likely the result of pulmonary vascular dysfunction.
      Ventilation-perfusion (V̇A/Q̇) data in mild COPD shows substantial V̇A/Q̇ inequality at rest,
      with the V̇A/Q̇ distribution skewed towards regions of high V̇A/Q̇, which is indicative of
      increased deadspace. Consistent with this capillary hypoperfusion hypothesis, our recent work
      has shown a blunted pulmonary capillary blood volume response to exercise in mild COPD, when
      compared to age- and height-matched non-smoking controls. Importantly, the low pulmonary
      capillary blood volume was associated with increased V̇E/V̇CO2 during exercise, suggesting
      that low pulmonary perfusion (i.e. reduced pulmonary capillary blood volume) leads to
      increased deadspace.

      Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) is commonly used to test for pulmonary vasodilatory responses in
      patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), as it increases NO bioavailability and
      improves pulmonary vascular function. Previous work in PAH and heart failure (HF) patients
      has shown that standard doses (20-40 parts per million (ppm)) of inhaled NO can reduce
      pulmonary vascular resistance and increase peak oxygen consumption (V̇O2peak). If inhaled NO
      can reduce vascular dysfunction and increase perfusion in mild COPD, this would result in a
      reduction in V̇E/V̇CO2 and improved exercise tolerance.

      STUDY PURPOSE

      Purpose: To examine the effect of inhaled NO on exercise capacity (V̇O2peak) ventilation and
      dyspnea in mild COPD.

      Hypothesis: Inhaled NO will improve exercise capacity, secondary to reduced V̇E/V̇CO2 and
      dyspnea, in mild COPD, while no change will be observed in healthy controls.

      Study Design: Randomized double-blind cross-over design.

      All participants will have a pulmonary function and cardiopulmonary exercise test. The study
      procedure is briefly outlined below and is further outlined in the attached University
      Hospital Foundation Grant.

      Study Protocol: Three sessions will be completed over a 3-week period in the following order:
      Day 1) Participant enrollment, medical history, standard pulmonary function (PFT) and
      cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). Days 2 &amp; 3) Randomly-ordered experimental CPETs while
      either breathing room air or inhaled nitric oxide (room air with 40 ppm NO).

      On Day 1, participants will complete the informed consent procedure, fill out a medical
      history questionnaire and be screened for exercise using the PAR-Q exercise readiness
      questionnaire. They will undergo lung function and cardiopulmonary exercise testing on the
      same day.

      On days 2 &amp; 3 (one day per week in 2 consecutive weeks), the participants will breathe
      medical grade air (room air) or room air titrated with 40 parts per million of nitric oxide
      and have their blood flow/cardiac output evaluated, and time to exhaustion determined in a
      standard cardiopulmonary exercise test.

      On day 2, the participant will lie supine and be rested for 5 minutes. Their resting blood
      pressure will be determined using manual auscultation. Resting cardiac output will be
      evaluated using noninvasive impedance cardiography (PhysioflowTM). Following these
      measurements, the participant will begin to breathe medical grade room air. Following a 15
      minute wash-in period, cardiac output and blood gas measurements will be repeated.
      Participants will then perform a standard cardiopulmonary exercise test while continuing to
      breathe the medical grade room air. The participants will be spending approximately two hours
      in the laboratory on this testing day.

      Day 3 will be identical to day 2 except, in the place of medical grade room air, participants
      will breathe room air with 40 parts per million of nitric oxide.
