  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been much effort in recent years to better understand the causes of idiopathic
      scoliosis (IS). Some studies suggested muscle imbalance as a cause of scoliosis based on
      asymmetric muscular activation. Surface electromyography can evaluate asymmetrical muscular
      weakness. Therefore, the peak amplitude values can be used to compare the side to side
      differences in paraspinal muscles. From these findings the investigators improve the exercise
      method of IS according to muscle weakness and curve pattern.

      Design: Prospective study Setting: hospital rehabilitation department the investigators will
      check the muscular activation at bilateral paraspinal muscles with surface electromyography
      and curve type with simple radiography.

      Intervention: After that the investigators educate asymmetrical stabilization exercise
      according to muscle weakness and curve pattern.

      Main outcome measures: Cobb angle
