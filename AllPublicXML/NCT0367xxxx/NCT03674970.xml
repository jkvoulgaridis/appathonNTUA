  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine whether treatment with random nicotine delivery
      via a nicotine film both before and after the target quit date will facilitate smoking
      cessation relative to treatment with steady state delivery or placebo.

      The investigators hypothesize that smoking cessation will be greater in subjects assigned to
      a random nicotine delivery regimen (as compared to those assigned to a steady state or
      placebo regimen). The nicotine film product is not part of the standard of care and is not
      available in non-investigational settings in the United States.

    <textblock>
      This project is a prospective parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study in which 45 current cigarette smokers who are interested in quitting will be randomly
      allocated to one of three possible nicotine film treatment regimens:

        1. Random nicotine delivery (a combination of four 0 mg and 4 mg films daily not to exceed
           three non-consecutive 4 mg films in one day and to maintain an average of 8 mg of
           nicotine per day through 7 days for 6 weeks total).

        2. Steady state nicotine delivery (2, 2, 2, 2 mg films daily for 6 weeks total)

        3. Placebo delivery (0, 0, 0, 0 mg films daily for 6 weeks total)

      Prior to assignment in one of the above treatment groups, all participants will take part in
      a 1-week baseline period to assess normal smoking behavior and nicotine dependence. Following
      randomization to their assigned treatment group at Visit 2, participants will be instructed
      to smoke cigarettes as they feel necessary over the next two weeks while using the nicotine
      films as directed (i.e., one film every 3-4 hours for a total of four films per day). After
      two weeks of pre-cessation treatment, participants will be asked completely cease cigarette
      smoking and to only use their assigned nicotine films as directed. Participants will be
      supported in their quitting efforts with regular contacts both in person at the Penn State
      Milton S. Hershey Medical Center and over the phone.

    <measure>Change in number of cigarettes smoked per day (CPD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks after Target Quit Date</time_frame>
    <description>CPD is measured with the use of daily cigarette logs which are completed daily by participants and returned to the study center at each visit. The CPD measure will be the average of the past 7 days.</description>

    <measure>Change in Questionnaire of Smoking Urges-Brief (QSU-Brief) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks after Target Quit Date</time_frame>
    <description>The QSU-Brief, with a possible total score range of 10 to 70, is an instrument used to measure cigarette craving. A score of 10 on this scale indicates very low cigarette craving, while a score of 70 indicates very high cigarette craving.</description>

    <measure>Change in Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks after Target Quit Date</time_frame>
    <description>Nicotine dependence will be assessed via the FTND, a measure with total scores ranging from 0 (very low dependence) to 10 (very high dependence).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Ratings Scale for nicotine film use</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks after Target Quit Date</time_frame>
    <description>Scores for the following subscales will be calculated: satisfaction (items 1, 2, 3, and 12); psychological reward (items 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8); aversion (items 9, 10, 16, and 18); relief (items 11, 13, 14, 15, and reversed for 20). For each subscale, the scores for each item will be averaged. Greater scores equal greater endorsement of the item (ie. greater score means greater satisfaction).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Side Effects from nicotine film use</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks after Target Quit Date</time_frame>
    <description>Total score ranges from 0 - 36 with lower scores indicating lesser side effects.</description>

    <description>Three doses of nicotine films will be used in this project: 0 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg.
The active pharmaceutical ingredient in the nicotine film product is nicotine polacrilex (20%, USP). The film has a muco-adhesive property and allows nicotine to be absorbed through the oral mucosa. After placement in the oral cavity, the nicotine film dissolves in less than five minutes. The film is in the form of 1 inch x 1 inch square and weighs about 100 mg. Nicotine films are not available in the United States in a non-investigational setting.</description>
