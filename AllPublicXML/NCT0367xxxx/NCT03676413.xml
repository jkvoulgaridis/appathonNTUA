        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects (≥12 years of age) of non-childbearing or of childbearing
             potential committed to consistent and correct use of an acceptable method of birth
             control.

          2. Patients diagnosed with asthma, as defined by the National Asthma Education and
             Prevention Program (NAEPP), at least 12 weeks prior to screening.

          3. Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 of ≥40% and ≤85% of the predicted value (for age ≥18 years),
             or ≥65% and ≤90% predicted normal value (for ages 12 to 17 years) during the screening
             visit and on the first day of treatment.

          4. Currently non-smoking; had not used tobacco products (i.e., cigarettes, cigars, pipe
             tobacco) within the past year, and had ≤ 10 pack-years of historical use.

          5. ≥12% and 200 mL reversibility of FEV1 within 30 minutes following 400 mcg salbutamol
             (4 puffs) inhalation (pMDI). This may be demonstrated at the Screening Visit or this
             test may be repeated on a different day if the patient fails the first attempt anytime
             in the period leading up to Visit 2 (randomization); If reversibility is not
             demonstrated up to Visit 2 then patients may be permitted to enter the study with
             historical evidence of reversibility that was performed within 2 years prior to Visit
             1 and patients should be stable on their chronic asthma treatment regimen for at least
             4 weeks prior to enrolment.

          6. Patients who are able to discontinue their asthma medications (inhaled corticosteroids
             and long-acting β agonists) during the run-in period and for remainder of the study,
             according to investigator's judgement.

          7. Patients who are able to replace current short-acting β agonists (SABAs) with
             salbutamol inhaler for use as needed for the duration of the study (subjects should be
             able to withhold all inhaled SABAs for at least 6 hours prior to lung function
             assessments on study visits).

          8. Patients who are able to continue treatment with theophylline or montelukast without a
             significant adjustment of dosage, formulation, dosing interval for the duration of the
             study, and judged able by the investigator to withhold them for the specified minimum
             time intervals prior to each patient visit: 1) montelukast 36 hours 2) short-acting
             forms of theophylline 12 hours, 3) twice-a-day controlled-release forms of
             theophylline 24 hours, 4) once-a-day controlled-release forms of theophylline 36
             hours.

          9. Patients who are able to understand the requirements of the clinical trial and to
             agree to return for the required follow-up visits.

         10. Willing to provide voluntary written informed consent and data protection declaration
             (and in the case of a minor their parent/guardian was able to give) before any
             clinical trial related procedure is performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Life-threatening asthma, defined as a history of asthma episode(s) requiring
             intubation, and/or associated with hypercapnoea; respiratory arrest or hypoxic
             seizures, asthma related syncopal episode(s), or hospitalizations within the past year
             or during the run-in period.

          2. Evidence or history of clinically significant disease or abnormality including
             congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled coronary artery
             disease, myocardial infarction, or cardiac dysrhythmia.

          3. Historical or current evidence of significant hematologic, hepatic neurologic,
             psychiatric, renal, or other diseases that in the opinion of the investigator, would
             put the patient at risk through study participation, or would affect the study
             analyses if the disease exacerbated during the study.

          4. Hypersensitivity to any sympathomimetic drug (e.g., salmeterol or albuterol) or any
             inhaled, intranasal, or systemic corticosteroid therapy.

          5. History of hypersensitivity to lactose

          6. Medication(s) with the potential to affect the course of asthma or to interact with
             sympathomimetic amines, e.g.: β-blockers, oral decongestants, benzodiazepines,
             digitalis, phenothiazines, polycyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors.

          7. Viral or bacterial, upper or lower respiratory tract infection or sinus or middle ear
             infection within 4 weeks prior to the screening visit or during the run-in period.

          8. Asthma exacerbations within 6 weeks prior to the screening visit or during the run-in
             period.

          9. Use of oral or parenteral corticosteroids within 4 weeks prior to Screening visit
             (Visit 1)

         10. Factors (e.g., infirmity, disability or geographic location) that the investigator
             felt would likely limit the patient's compliance with the study protocol or scheduled
             clinic visits.

         11. Female Subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

         12. Women of child-bearing age that are not surgically incapable of pregnancy and are not
             willing to use an acceptable method of birth control.

         13. Current participation or not yet completed period of at least 30 days since ending
             other investigational device or drug trial(s).

         14. Unwillingness or inability to comply with the clinical trial procedures;

         15. Unwillingness to consent to storage, saving and transmission of pseudonymous medical
             data for clinical trial reasons

         16. Who are legally incapacitated
