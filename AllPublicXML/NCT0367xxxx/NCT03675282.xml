  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, single center study to determine whether the current R2* iron mapping method for
      measuring nigral iron changes in the brain can be significantly improved by using the
      Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) based iron mapping techniques with the goal of
      validating QSM for potential use in later clinical trials. Subjects with a diagnosis of
      Parkinson's Disease, Rapid Eye Movement (REM) Sleep Behavior Disorder, and Normal Volunteers
      who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be eligible for participation in this
      study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the rate of iron accumulation throughout different stages of the
      disease and compare it to controls Thus, the investigators will be able to see if iron starts
      to accumulate in those patients, way before motor symptoms of Parkinson disease develop.
      Hypothetically, an iron chelator drug could remove excessive iron from the brain and slow
      down process of neurodegeneration. A precise technique to measure iron in the brain and to
      detect small changes therefore is needed as a radiological marker of disease progression
      and/or therapeutic effect in clinical trials.

    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Assess clinical changes in disease arm, as measured by changes in unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) scale assessments at baseline and 24 Month visits. The UPDRS is used to follow the longitudinal course of Parkinson's disease.
The UPDRS is made up of 42 questions grouped into 4 sections:
Part I: evaluation of mentation, behavior, and mood Part II: self-evaluation of the activities of daily life (ADLs) including speech, swallowing, handwriting, dressing, hygiene, falling, salivating, turning in bed, walking, and cutting food Part III: clinician-scored monitored motor evaluation Part IV: complications of therapy
score for part I range is: 0-16 score for part II range is:0- 52 score for part III range is: 0-108 score for part IV range is: 0-23
The higher the score value, the worse symptoms are.</description>
