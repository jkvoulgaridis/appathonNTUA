    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot trial studies how well exercise works in improving health and quality
      of life in breast cancer survivors. Participating in an exercise program to maintain physical
      activity may help to improve health and quality of life in breast cancer survivors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the feasibility of conducting a 12-week partially randomized patient preference
      exercise intervention program in breast cancer survivors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the adherence rate of each of the three 12-week intervention programs by breast
      cancer survivors in a randomized treatment arm and a patient preference arm.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine how cardiovascular fitness, body composition, behavior change, biomarkers of
      mitochondrial function, quality of life (QoL), symptoms of autonomic regulation, cognitive
      function, and biomarkers of adrenergic stress, inflammation, and immunosuppression are
      affected by a 12-week physical activity program completed by breast cancer survivors.

      II. To compare differences in these outcomes among breast cancer survivors who complete a
      home-based walking program, a home-based Zumba program in either a video game format or a
      workout DVD (or streamed content) format, a supervised high intensity interval training
      program, and a wait-list control group.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized into 1 of 4 arms.

      ARM I: Participants wear Fitbit, receive home-based DVD containing instructions to warm-up
      and cool-down, and walk 10000 steps per day over 12 weeks in order to achieve the 150 minutes
      per week of moderate intensity exercise. Participants also undergo resistance training by
      watching the illustration video and completing 6 total blocks of 2-week per block exercise
      using the Thera-BandR exercise bands.

      ARM II: Participants wear Fitbit and receive a XBOX system and the video game to strive for
      at least 3 50-minute medium or high intensity classes per week over 12 weeks. Participants
      may also take 20-minute classes or a mixture of 50- and 20-minute classes to meet the target.
      Participants undergo resistance training as in Arm I.

      ARM III: Participants wear Fitbit and attend supervised High Intensity Interval Training
      (HIIT) exercise sessions 3 days per week over 12 weeks. Participants undergo resistance
      training as in Arm I.

      ARM IV: Participants wear Fitbit and continue their usual physical activity over 12 weeks.

      After completion of study intervention, participants are followed up at 2 weeks and 1 month.

    <description>The feasibility outcomes will be assessed by a multivariable logistic regression model for the relative odds of remaining on the study (ref: not). Each of the active treatment arms will be compared to the control. The model will be supported by the randomized patient set, counting patients who withdraw from the study as feasibility failures. No variable selection steps will be taken; inferences will be based on the estimates and 95% confidence intervals from the full model. Optimism adjusted odds ratio estimates will also be reported, to better inform design of future studies.</description>

    <description>Will be defined as the proportion of patients on study after 12 weeks who complete â‰¥ 80% of the intervention activities. One-sided 90% Jeffrey's confidence limits will define a plausible lower limit on the range of values for true (unobserved) feasibility rate for each arm.</description>
