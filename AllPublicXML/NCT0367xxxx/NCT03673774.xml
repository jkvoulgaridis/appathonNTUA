      Monocentric cohort study, prospective, evaluating the variability of cardiac output
      measurement by resting and stress impedancemetry as a prognostic factor for Pulmonary
      Hypertension

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac impedancemetry is a technique that allows an electrical representation of cardiac
      flows. To do this, 6 electrodes are applied to the thorax and a low intensity and high
      frequency electrical current is transmitted. The impedance is recorded and the variations of
      the impedance represent the changes in intra-thoracic volume and thus the volume of systolic
      ejection. This measurement can be done at rest but also during exercise during the walking
      test. A test of the NO / CO coupled transfer measurement is also performed.

      The devices that will be used in this project are the Physio-Flow® system and Masterscreen NO
      / CO coupled transfer measurement device

    <description>Monocentric cohort study, prospective, evaluating the variability of cardiac output measurement by resting and stress impedancemetry as a prognostic factor for PH. Patients are included via the competence center of the PHP of the Midi Pyrenees region. The cardiac output is measured by impedance measurement at rest and during the walking test. The NO / CO coupled transfer measurement is performed at rest. The physician performing the consultation will not know the results of the IPC and these results will not influence the subsequent management.
The patient will be followed for 18 months as part of the research.</description>
