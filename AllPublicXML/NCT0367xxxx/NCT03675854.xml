  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background According to the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD)
      recommendations, &quot;low-risk&quot; peritoneal dialysis (PD)- related peritonitis caused by
      coagulase-negative staphylococcal species, Streptococcal species, or negative bacterial
      culture should receive antibiotics for 2 weeks. However, relapsing, recurrent, or repeated
      episodes are common.

      Objectives To compare the incidence of relapsing, recurrent, and repeat peritonitis with a
      3-week course, as compared to the conventional 2-week course, antibiotic for PD-related
      peritonitis. Hypothesis Treatment of low-risk PD-related peritonitis for 3 weeks reduces the
      incidence of relapsing, recurrent, and repeat peritonitis. Design and subjects Randomized
      control trial of 310 episodes of &quot;low-risk&quot; PD-related peritonitis.

      Study instruments and interventions Patients will be randomized to receive treatment of the
      effective antibiotic according to the ISPD recommendations for 2 weeks (Conventional Group)
      or 3 weeks (Extended Group). All patients will be followed for 6 months after completion of
      treatment. Main outcome measures Complete cure of the peritonitis episode, defined as
      survival for 6 months without relapsing, recurrent, or repeat peritonitis episodes. Data
      analysis Data will be analyzed by both intention-to-treat and per protocol approach. The
      incidences of complete cure, relapsing, recurrent, and repeated peritonitis episodes will be
      compared. Expected results Based on our pilot study, we expect to find a significantly lower
      rate of relapsing, recurrent, and repeated peritonitis episodes in the Extended Group. By
      proving that &quot;low-risk&quot; peritonitis episodes require 3-week course of antibiotic therapy, our
      result will change the current recommendation and make treatment for 3 weeks course the
      standard of care.
