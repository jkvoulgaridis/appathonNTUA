      This study will compare a web-based advance directive to a standard advance directive.

    <textblock>
      Patients with GI and thoracic malignancies will be randomized to either a standard paper
      advance directive or the web advance directive (Ourcarewishes.org). Patients will be
      approached in the Cancer Center and provided the AD information to complete on their own.
      They will complete a survey at enrollment and a follow up survey administered by email. The
      primary endpoint will be proportion with new documentation in the EHR at 8 weeks. Second
      endpoints will include the change in satisfaction with end-of-life plans, AD acceptability,
      self-reported rates of completion, self-reported rate of sharing with their preferred
      surrogate decision-maker, proportion with new documentation of preferred decision-maker in
      the chart, and qualitative feedback. Patients in both groups will receive follow up reminder
      emails encouraging them to complete the advance directive.

    <description>Change in mean score on the satisfaction with end-of-life scale, adapted from doi: 10.1377/hlthaff.2012.0895, Canadian Healthcare Evaluation Project (CANHELP) questionnaire. This scale measures satisfaction with end-of-life planning on a 12-60 point scale (if all questions answered, 0 possible if &quot;don't know/refusal&quot; chosen for all 12 questions. Higher scores are considered better.</description>
