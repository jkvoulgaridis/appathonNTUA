  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized controlled trial, we intend to determine whether electrical pudendal nerve
      stimulation is more effective than intravesical instillation in urethral pain syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the 2017 edition of European Association of Urology Guideline, there is no
      specific treatment for urethral pain syndrome (UPS), and it is recommended this type of
      patients should be treated in a multi-disciplinary and multi-modal program. Since some
      mechanisms for the development of UPS suggest it may be a form of bladder pain syndrome (BPS)
      due to the intimate relation of the urethra with the bladder (both covered with urothelium),
      a combination of intravesical hyaluronic acid and lidocaine plus sodium bicarbonate, the more
      widely used regimen for BPS in China, is also applied to UPS here in China. However, the
      symptom relief of the intravesical irrigation won't last long and patients usually report
      recurrence in 2-3 weeks. Hence, the purpose of this study is to explore whether the
      electrical pudendal nerve stimulation（EPNS）, which has been proven effective in treating BPS,
      is more effective than intravesical instillation (intravesical hyaluronic acid and lidocaine
      plus sodium bicarbonate) in patients with UPS.

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This instrument consists of eight items that cover areas of pain, urgency, urinary frequency, and symptoms associated with sexual intercourse. The score ranges from 0 to 35 points. Each participant will be evaluated by using the PUF at baseline, three weeks after the treatment commencement and six weeks after the treatment commencement, and we are about to record the mean change of the overall score of this questionnaire.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale for pain</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to mark the degree of pain in urethral on a 10-mm VAS, with &quot;0&quot; indicating no pain and &quot;10&quot; indicating the worst painimaginable. Each participant will be evaluated by using this instrument at baseline, three weeks after the treatment commencement and six weeks after the treatment commencement, and we are about to record the mean change of the score.</description>

    <description>Four sacrococcygeal points were selected. Two 0.40Х100 mm needles were inserted perpendicularly to a depth of 80-90 mm 1 cm bilateral to the sacrococcygeal joint, to produce a sensation referred to the root of the penis (perineum) or the anus. Two needles of 0.40Х100 or 125mm were inserted obliquely toward the ischiorectal fossa to a depth of 90 to 110 mm about 1 cm bilateral to the tip of the coccyx, to produce a sensation referred to the root of the penis (or the perineum). Each two ipsilaterally needles were connected to one electrode from a G6805-2Multi-Purpose Health Device (Shanghai Medical Instruments High-Techno, Shanghai, China), with a frequency of 2.5 Hz and an intensity (45~55 mA). EPNS was given for 60 min a time, 3 sessions per week for 6 weeks.</description>

    <description>The patient should lie on a couch in a lithotomy position after urination. A catheter was passed through the urethra into the bladder and any residual urine should be drained. A mixture of the Cystistat (sodium hyaluronate, 50ml 40mg, Bioniche Teoranta, Ireland) solution and Lidocaine hydrochloride (40mg :20ml, Fangming Pharmacy company, Shangdong, China) is instilled through the catheter into the bladder. The catheter is then withdrawn leaving the mixture solution inside the bladder, retained for as long as possible, ideally at least 30 minutes. The instillation is once weekly for at 6 weeks.</description>
