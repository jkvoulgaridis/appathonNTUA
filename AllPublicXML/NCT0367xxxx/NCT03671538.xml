    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy is still the standard first-line treatment option for EGFR unmutated patients.
      After a randomized phase Ⅲ trial, BEYOND was presented the synergistic effect of
      progression-free survival(PFS) could be expected when chemotherapy is combined with
      Antiangiogenesis agent bevacizumab in China;Therefore,in this study, The investigators will
      investigate the efficacy and safety of Anlotinb combined With Pemetrexed and Cisplatin as
      first-line therapy in patients with chemotherapy-naive, stage IIIB or IV, non-squamous NSCLC
      without targetable EGFR or ALK genetic aberrations.

      This is a randomized, single -center study conducted in China to compare the efficacy and
      safety of Anlotinb combined With Pemetrexed and Cisplatin as first-line therapy in patients
      of Advanced Gene Negative Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

      Eligible patients will be randomized to arm A:

      Patients were instructed to take 500mg/m2 pemetrexed as a 10-minute intravenous infusion and
      Cisplatin 75mg/m2 on day 1 of a 21-day cycle and12mg Anlotinib orally daily on day 1 to 14 of
      a 21-day cycle.If there was no evidence of disease progression following a maximum of 4-6
      cycles of anlotinib plus chemotherapy, patients continued to receive single-agent anlotinib
      until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Approximately 62 patients will be
      enrolled to ensure complete treatments for primary endpoint analysis.
