  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial primarily investigates if a clinical pharmacist intervention
      can reduce drug-related readmissions among patients &gt;75 years. The intervention targets the
      transfer between hospital and primary care. In brief, the intervention includes medical chart
      reviews and patient interviews during a period of 180 days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At discharge from the hospital, patients that meet the inclusion criteria are offered to
      participate in the study. At this point the investigators will also gather baseline data
      through questionnaires on self-reported adherence (MARS-5) and quality of life (EQ-5D). The
      participants are randomized to the different study arms according to a stratified procedure
      based on their cognitive function.

      The intervention group will have their charts reviewed every second week and be contacted by
      the clinical pharmacist through phone within 7 and after 30 and 60 days respectively to
      discuss their medications. If possible drug-related problems are suspected during the
      interviews that cannot be solved immediately, the physician is contacted.

      Both groups have a follow-up time of 30 and 180 days. After 30 and 180 days, the patients
      will once again report adherence and quality of life. All other data can be gathered from the
      medical charts.
