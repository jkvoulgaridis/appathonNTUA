      This is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, pre-market study.The aim of this study is to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of LithoVue ureteroscope system in Chinese population, to
      support the regulatory approval by CFDA. The study will enroll 60 patients in 3
      investigational sites in China. The primary endpoint is procedure success rate of LithoVue
      ureteroscope system, the procedure success is defined as:Scope condition is suitable to
      complete the procedure and not requiring immediate scope substitution; it is also considered
      as a procedure success if the clinical effect is the same as that from the LithoVue scope per
      investigator's judgement in the case of a scope change (non-LithoVue).

    <description>The LithoVue System is intended to be used to visualize organs, cavities and canals in the urinary tract (urethra, bladder, ureter, calyces and renal papillae) via transurethral or percutaneous access routes. It can also be used in conjunction with endoscopic accessories to perform various diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in the urinary tract.</description>
