    <textblock>
      This project examines computer-delivered cognitive-behavioral intervention (CBT4CBT) as an
      adjunct to residential treatment for women with substance use disorders (SUD). The project
      will conduct a 2-arm randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing post-discharge relapse rates
      for treatment as usual (TAU) with access to the CBT4CBT program vs. TAU in a residential
      sample of women with SUDs.

    <textblock>
      Women with substance use disorders face unique barriers to substance use treatment, and as a
      result, are less likely to seek treatment for substance use than their male counterparts.
      Women's residential treatment settings have been shown to have higher rates of treatment
      completion and better outcomes; however, relapse rates for substance use are high, with
      estimates ranging from 40-60%. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been identified as an
      evidence-based treatment known to improve relapse rates by teaching clients how to recognize
      and respond to their cues for substance use. Women may particularly benefit from CBT, as
      their relapse risk factors include depression, interpersonal stress, and relationship
      conflict.

      Despite the effectiveness of CBT, its dissemination is hindered due to limited availability
      of trained clinicians, cost, and limited resources. Computer-based training for cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT4CBT) offers an opportunity to improve the quality and reach of
      treatment services that is both feasible and cost-effective. Studies to date have
      demonstrated the utility of CBT4CBT in outpatient settings; however, it has not yet been
      evaluated as an adjunct to residential treatment for SUDs.

      The specific aims are to: 1) Examine feasibility for use of CBT4CBT in a residential
      treatment program for women with SUDs; 2) Conduct a small RCT comparing TAU with access to
      the CBT4CBT program (CBT4CBT; intervention) vs. treatment as usual (TAU; control) using
      relapse rates and days of use as primary treatment outcomes; 3) Exploratory analyses will
      identify other correlates (e.g., coping strategies, depression) of relapse at 4 and 12 weeks
      post-discharge.

    <description>45-minute web-based modules covering core concepts to substance use treatment. The information is presented via graphics and voiceovers and key concepts are illustrated with brief videos depicting the material. Participants will be scheduled for a minimum of two sessions/week over the 3.5 weeks post-randomization (7 modules). These seven sessions will provide protected time to access the interventions, but the women will be able to access the modules and complete homework as much as they wish.</description>
