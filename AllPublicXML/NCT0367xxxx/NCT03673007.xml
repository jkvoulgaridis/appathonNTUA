  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      M-CARES will use large-scale administrative data complemented by follow-up surveys and a
      randomized control trial (RCT) to estimate the causal impact of greater financial access to
      contraception on a comprehensive set of outcomes. Outcomes include contraceptive use,
      pregnancy, childbearing, and parenting strategies; partnership decisions and relationship
      quality; health and health care use; education, labor market success, and public assistance
      receipt; financial security; neighborhood quality; mental health and stress; and life plans.
      The resulting estimates will inform a more complete understanding of the costs and benefits
      of financial access to contraception and, therefore, the investment value of related policies
      and programs.
