    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are:

        1. The investigators plan to evaluate and validate the use of a novel wireless insole
           device (Loadsol) that provides real-time biofeedback on post-operative mobility and
           weight bearing following total joint arthroplasty.

        2. The investigators plan to utilize the wireless insole device to determine if biofeedback
           is sufficient for improving gait symmetry following total joint arthroplasty.

        3. The investigators plan to determine if there is a correlation between patient reported
           outcomes and measured postoperative weight bearing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In orthopaedic and trauma surgery post-operative mobility is very important. Six-month
      mortality and patient satisfaction has been associated with mobility. Elderly patients may
      suffer from severe complications caused by immobility due to a high prevalence of
      comorbidities.

      Measuring postoperative mobility has primarily been based on advanced technology and
      complicated gait laboratories (treadmill, force plate, videoanalysis). The recent
      introduction of mobile insole force devices, such as the pedoped loadsolÂ® (Novel) may allow
      for a cost-effective and clinically relevant use of providing biofeedback.

      Using video analysis to evaluate the insole device will allow for measurements in realistic
      situations like walking stairs, stand up from a chair, sit down, turning and walking. The
      investigators had previously completed this in the lab setting and further the feedback mode
      of the loadsol will be used for training the patients in terms of symmetry after a total knee
      replacement.

      This study may have an important influence on the aftercare of the investigators patients.
      Determining the postoperative mobility and evaluating gait analysis in real time will allow
      the investigators to compare between different operative approaches, operative techniques,
      Implants and more. If the feedback mode is working as expected the investigators might use it
      in the close future in the investigators standard aftercare for all patients.
