  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I pilot trial studies how well video distraction works to decrease the use of
      sedation in pediatric participants during radiation therapy. Radiation treatment requires
      participants to lie very still (for accuracy). Many children cannot do this without sedation.
      Watching movies during radiation may distract children so they don't need sedation to
      complete treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine if the use of video distraction during radiation therapy (VidRT) during
      radiation for patients ages 3 to 13 decreases the rate of sedation use compared to patients
      previously treated without VidRT.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine which variables are associated with decreased need for sedation use.
      Variables will include patient age, length of treatment time (number of treatments and
      beam-on time), oncologic diagnosis, use of immobilization devices, pre-existing developmental
      or psychiatric diagnoses (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], dissociative
      disorders [DD], anxiety, depression, developmental delay, learning disability), pain scale
      ratings at time of first radiation treatment (0-10).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the impact of VidRT on patient-reported quality of life prior to starting,
      during, and at the end of treatment using the pediatric quality of life inventory surveys
      including the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) - 4.0 Core and Peds QL- 3.0 brain
      tumor questionnaires.

      II. To determine the impact of VidRT on patient-reported anxiety throughout radiation
      treatment as monitored by Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)
      pediatric item bank version (v) 2.0 anxiety questionnaire.

      III. To determine if workup assessment category for patient being low, medium, or high risk
      of needing sedation correlates to actual sedation use.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo daily radiation therapy and watch videos/movies of their choice during
      treatments.
