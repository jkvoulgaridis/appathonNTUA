  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Shared decision making (SDM) is a patient-centered and evidence-based model of clinical
      decision making. The feature of SDM is that clinicians work together with patients to plan
      the most appropriate and practical treatment for patients based on the patients' preferences
      and values. Recently, SDM has been implemented throughout the world to improve patients'
      health literacy and to have a better understanding of the treatment options, thereby
      improving patient-doctor communication and promoting the quality of care.

      Lumbar degenerative disease is a critical public health issue in the aging society. SDM now
      becomes an important process because there is no consensus of evidence-based practice
      guidelines among the multiple complex treatment options for patients with lumbar degenerative
      disease. In addition, there is a lack of evidence to support the effect of patient decision
      aids (PDAs) to promote the quality of healthcare for patients with lumbar degenerative
      disease in Taiwan.

      Purposes:

      This project has two purposes. The first purpose is to develop a multimedia interactive
      patient doctor communication system called the Taiwan Shared Decision Making for Lumbar Spine
      Treatment (Taiwan SDM LumST). The second and ultimate purpose is to conduct a cluster
      randomized controlled trial (cRCT) for the validation of the integrated SDM model and the
      effectiveness of SDM related outcome indicators.

      Methods:

      In the first year of the 3-year project, investigators will develop the SDM communication
      teaching materials, PDAs, as well as the computerized platform of Taiwan SDM LumST through
      focus groups and consensus meetings. In the second to third year, investigators will recruit
      130 patients with lumbar degenerative disease to participate in double blind cRCT in the
      affiliated hospitals of Taipei Medical University. Investigators will use structural equation
      modeling to validate the factors of the SDM model and adopt generalized linear regression
      models with generalized estimating equations to examine the immediate, short-term, and
      long-term benefits of the Taiwan SDM LumST in implementing the SDM model among patients with
      lumbar degenerative disease.

      Expected results:

      Investigators expect that the implementation of the Taiwan SDM LumST system will
      significantly improve the patients' decision preference, health literacy in the care of
      lumbar degenerative disease, and self-efficacy in SDM. It will also promote the health care
      quality and health outcomes (e.g., participation in SDM, quality of decisions, regret in
      decisions, health outcomes, and quality-of-life) in patients with lumbar degenerative
      disease.

      Expected impacts on the society, economy, and academic developments:

      The Taiwan SDM LumST will be an efficient and effective way to facilitate patient doctor
      communication and thereby, promote health outcomes and improve the quality of decisions made
      by patients with lumbar degenerative disease. No computerized interactive PDA of SDM system
      for patients with lumbar degenerative disease exists in Taiwan yet. Thus, our system would be
      the first in Taiwan for the lumbar degenerative population. Investigators hope that the
      Taiwan SDM LumST will not only contribute to academic research, but also facilitate SDM
      between patients and healthcare professionals in order to improve patient safety and enhance
      the quality of care in Taiwan.

    <time_frame>Before intervention, up to 12 weeks after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Use Control Preference Scale to measure the patients' preferred role whether change in making decisions with the medical provider before intervention and after intervention. It consists of five cards, each of which presents a different character in medical decision-making in a cartoon pattern, and performs a series of comparisons to rank the preference.</description>

    <measure>The Change of Patients' Decision Self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Before intervention, after intervention immediately, up to 12 weeks after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Use Decision Self Efficacy Scale to measure patients' self-confidence and belief in measuring the ability of patients to participate in decision-making. It has 11 items with 5 level Likert scale. The scale range is 0-100, higher scores indicate better decision self-efficacy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess Decision Process Quality in Making the Decision</measure>
    <time_frame>After intervention immediately</time_frame>
    <description>Assess whether the medical personnel have sufficiently communicated with patients when making the decision by 9-item Shared Decision Making Questionnaire(SDM-Q-9). It has 9 items and is divided into 0 to 5 scores, 0 points = very disagree, 1 point = roughly disagree, 2 points = partial disagreement, 3 points = partial consent, 4 points = roughly agree, 5 points = very agree. After the total score of each question is added, the initial total score is 0 to 45 points. Divide the initial total score by 9 and multiply by 20 to get the final score from 0 to 100. The higher the score means the better the decision-sharing on behalf of the patient.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess the Quality of Healthy Living About Patients</measure>
    <time_frame>Before intervention, up to 12 weeks after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Use the EQ-5D-5L scale to measure patients' quality of healthy living. It has 5 items (Mobility, Self-care, Usual activities, Pain/discomfort, Depression/anxiety). Each item contains 5 levels: 1= no difficulty, 2= slight difficulty, 3= moderate difficulty, 4= serious difficulty, 5= extremely serious difficulty. The higher the score has the worse the health. Then, the score calculation of the European Five-Dimensional Health Scale is based on the calculation formula published by the EuroQol Group. Based on 5 combinations of different severity levels, a score of 0 to 1 is obtained. 0 is the least healthy and 1 is the most healthy.</description>

        <description>Assess whether the medical personnel have sufficiently communicated with patients when making the decision by 9-item Shared Decision Making Questionnaire(SDM-Q-9). It has 9 items and is divided into 0 to 5 scores, 0 points = very disagree, 1 point = roughly disagree, 2 points = partial disagreement, 3 points = partial consent, 4 points = roughly agree, 5 points = very agree. After the total score of each question is added, the initial total score is 0 to 45 points. Divide the initial total score by 9 and multiply by 20 to get the final score from 0 to 100. The higher the score means the better the decision-sharing on behalf of the patient.</description>

        <description>Use the Decisional Conflict Scale to assess patients whether have a conflict or something not sure about making the decision. It has 16 items with 5 levels Likert scale. 0 points = yes, 1 point = about yes, 2 points = uncertainty, 3 points = probably not, 4 points = no. After the total score of each question is added, the initial total score is 0 to 64 points. Divide the initial total score by 16 and multiply by 25 to get the final score from 0 to 100. The higher the score, patients have more conflict with the decision.</description>

        <description>Use the EQ-5D-5L scale to measure patients' quality of healthy living. It has 5 items (Mobility, Self-care, Usual activities, Pain/discomfort, Depression/anxiety). Each item contains 5 levels: 1= no difficulty, 2= slight difficulty, 3= moderate difficulty, 4= serious difficulty, 5= extremely serious difficulty. The higher the score has the worse the health. Then, the score calculation of the European Five-Dimensional Health Scale is based on the calculation formula published by the EuroQol Group. Based on 5 combinations of different severity levels, a score of 0 to 1 is obtained. 0 is the least healthy and 1 is the most healthy.</description>
