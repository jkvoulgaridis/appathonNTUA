      Background: Exercise represents an important challenge for the homeostasis of the entire body
      that occurs on a cellular and systemic level in which micronutrients play an important role
      in regulating the processes that sustain athletic performance. Objective: The investigators
      measured changes in gene expression of whole blood in a group of athletes and sedentary
      participants and compared gene modulation before and after nutritional intervention with
      micronutrients. Methods: Blood samples were taken from thirteen athletes and thirteen
      sedentary age- and gender-matched participants. The study design was carried out over a
      period of 4 months where three time points were established: (T0) baseline conditions in the
      sedentary and athlete groups; (T2) after two months of supplementation; (T4) after two months
      in the absence of nutritional supplementation. Differential gene expression was evaluated in
      112 genes using RT-qPCR analysis with the QuantStudioTM 12K Flex Real-Time PCR System.

      Methods: Thirteen elite athletes and thirteen sedentary controls were enrolled in the present
      study. Blood samples were taken from athletes and sedentary age- and gender-matched subjects.
      The study design was carried out over a period of 4 months where three time points were
      established: (T0) baseline conditions in the sedentary and handball groups; (T2) after two
      months of supplementation; (T4) after two months in the absence of nutritional
      supplementation. Differential gene expression was evaluated in 112 genes using RT-qPCR
