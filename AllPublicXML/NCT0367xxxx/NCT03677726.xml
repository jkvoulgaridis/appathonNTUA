  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor sleep quality is a known risk factor for cognitive decline in the elderly. Hearteningly,
      sleep is also a prime target for behavioral modification. In this study, the investigators
      propose to test mindfulness-based training (MBT) as an intervention to improve sleep quality
      by reducing sleep fragmentation, and hypothesize that these improvements will mediate the
      beneficial effects of MBT on sustained and executive attention. MBT consists of a suite of
      techniques aimed at enhancing awareness and acceptance of one's internal (e.g., thoughts and
      feelings) and external experiences in the present moment. Learning these techniques has been
      shown to improve sleep quality in patients with primary insomnia, and in other conditions
      associated with sleep disturbance. There is also increasing evidence that mindfulness
      training enhances multiple facets of cognition, including components of attention. In this
      study, the investigators will recruit 120 participants in a randomized controlled design,
      with 60 participants receiving MBT, and 60 receiving a sleep hygiene education and exercise
      program (SHEEP). Each intervention will last 8 weeks. Before and after the intervention, the
      investigators will collect objective and subjective measures of sleep quality, resting-state
      and task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging scans, and performance on standard
      laboratory tests of attention. The investigators hypothesize that, relative to SHE, MBT will
      result in significantly greater improvements in sleep quality and attentional metrics. They
      also predict that the cognitive changes will be mediated by the changes in sleep quality. If
      a positive result is found, this would indicate the use of MBT as a cost-effective behavioral
      intervention to stabilize or even improve cognition in the elderly, thus reducing the risk of
      dementia in this vulnerable population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive decline in the elderly is a rapidly growing concern in Singapore and other
      developed Asian nations. Among the major but understudied factors that may exacerbate this
      decline is poor sleep quality. Targeting sleep to decelerate or even reverse age-related
      cognitive decline may represent a low-cost, high-return solution to a widespread societal
      problem.

      To accomplish this goal, the investigators propose to test mindfulness-based training (MBT)
      as an intervention to improve sleep quality and cognition.

      In this pilot grant, the investigators will study a group of participants (N = 120) in a
      randomized controlled design pitting MBT (N =60) against sleep hygiene education (SHEEP, N =
      60).

      Hypothesis 1: MBT will lead to significantly greater improvements in sustained and executive
      attention relative to SHEEP (measured both behaviorally and using functional magnetic
      resonance imaging).

      Hypothesis 2: Cognitive outcomes will be mediated by improvements in subjective and objective
      sleep quality.

      Good sleep is critical for cognition at all ages, and especially in the elderly

      Adequate sleep is important for optimal cognitive function across the lifespan. Although the
      association between sleep and cognitive function is bi-directional, alterations in sleep
      frequently occur prior to the appearance of cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer's Disease (AD).
      Almost 50% of older adults report at least one sleep problem, and there is growing evidence
      that sleep complaints and disturbances might have negative effects on cognition.

      Retired older adults have the freedom to sleep ad libitum but this benefit is offset by
      age-associated changes in sleep such as poorer subjective quality, increased fragmentation
      and/or altered macrostructure. Although sleep duration is the measure that has received the
      most attention, there is accumulating evidence that sleep quality (Blackwell et al., 2014)
      and sleep fragmentation in particular, can have deleterious effects on brain structure and
      cognition. A change in sleep pattern in late adulthood can foreshadow cognitive decline,
      perhaps as a result of accumulation of neurotoxic substances that are normally cleared during
      sleep.

    <measure>Change in Subjective measures of Sleep quality: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to one month</time_frame>
    <description>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Score (PSQI) is a 19-item self-rated questionnaire for evaluating subjective sleep quality over the previous month. The PSQI has a sensitivity of 89.6% and specificity of 86.5% for identifying cases with sleep disorder, using a cut-off score of 5.
The first 4 items are open questions, whereas items 5 to 19 are rated on a 4-point Likert scale. Individual items scores yield 7 components. A total score, ranging from 0 to 21, is obtained by adding the 7 component scores. A score of 5 and above suggests poor sleep quality. A decrease in PSQI score following intervention would reflect and improvement of sleep quality.</description>

    <measure>Polysomnography: objective changes in sleep onset latency (SOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>One night</time_frame>
    <description>Polysomnography is a multi-parametric test used in the study of sleep and as a diagnostic tool in sleep medicine. PSG is a comprehensive recording of bio-physiological changes that occur during sleep. It will be performed at night, at the convenience of the participants' home. PSG monitors many body functions including brain, eye movements, muscle activity or skeletal muscle activation and heart rhythm during sleep. The investigators will use a Somnimedics PSG kit. Sleep onset latency reflects the amount of time it takes to participants to fall asleep from the moment they go to bed in the evening, so higher SOL are indicative of poor sleep quality.
This objective measure of participants sleep onset latency will judge sleep quality against the subjective measures obtained through the sleep questionnaires.</description>

    <description>Wrist-worn actigraphy is a convenient and reliable way to monitor sleep. It will be performed using research-grade, wrist-worn accelerometers that are calibrated to detect sleep by inferring from movement patterns. The systems used in this proposal (Philips Respironics AW-2 or Spectrum) has been calibrated against PSG. Sleep onset latency reflects the amount of time it takes to participants to fall asleep from the moment they go to bed in the evening, on average over seven nights of recording.
This objective measure of participants sleep onset latency will judge sleep quality against the subjective measures obtained through the sleep questionnaires.</description>

    <measure>Polysomnography: objective changes in wake after sleep onset (WASO)</measure>
    <time_frame>One night</time_frame>
    <description>In addition to Sleep Onset Latency (Primary outcome 2), a second objective measure of sleep quality is extracted from the polysomnography recording: periods of wakefulness occurring after defined sleep onset. WASO is calculated by taking into account the total time spent in bed, minus sleep latency and minus total sleep time. High WASO scores reflect low sleep continuity and poor sleep quality.
This second measure of participants sleep will judge sleep quality against the subjective measures obtained through the sleep questionnaires.</description>

    <measure>Change in functional imaging measures: Resting state and Inscape</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>During two rsfMRI scans, subjects are imaged over several minutes while their eyes are open, but without performing any explicit task. It has been recognized that a person's brain activity at rest contains a rich source of information about their brain function. One of the resting state scan will show only a fixation cross on the screen (resting state), and the second one (Inscape) will show a short video developed in order to minimize the cognitive processing involved while decreasing head movement and sleepiness in the scanner.
These data are typically extracted by decomposing the time-varying signal during resting periods into independent, intrinsically connected networks. The investigators propose to use traditional connectivity analysis as well as a newer method: graph theory analysis Measure will be increase of task ready state in Dynamic Functional Connectivity, as previous literature suggested that this is positively linked with mindfulness predisposition.</description>
