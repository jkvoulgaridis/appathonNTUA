      Picoprep is a low-volume bowel preparation used to optimize visualization of the colonic
      mucosa during colonoscopy. Patients referred for a colonoscopy will be scheduled for an
      intake. During this intake patients receive education about Picoprep and will be asked about
      their health condition (medical history, medication use). Standard a face-to-face education
      is given by an intake nurse or doctor. The producers of Picoprep, Ferring BV designed an app
      including a drinking schedule adapted to the timing of the coloscopy, aiming a lag time
      between intake of the last Picoprep dose and the scopy of 2-4 hours. We hypothesize that the
      Boston Bowel Preparation Scale and patient satisfaction will be higher in patients receiving
      standard education plus using the bowel preparation app versus patients receiving single
      standard education.

    <measure>Boston Bowel Preparation Score</measure>
    <time_frame>During colonoscopy</time_frame>
    <description>Boston Bowel Preparation Score (BBPS) is a validated scale for scoring bowel preparation. Each colonic segment (ascending, transverse, descending) is scored on a scale ranging from 0 to 3, in which a higher value means a cleaner bowel segment. The total score is the sum of the three segment scores (total range 0-9).</description>

    <measure>Patient satisfaction questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>end of preparation procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction questionnaire. Several questions in our PSQ (patient satisfaction questionnaire) are based on the PSQ-18. We transformed items from the PSQ-18 to bowel preparation education purposes. The PSQ-18 yields separate scores for each of seven different subscales: General Satisfaction; Technical Quality; Interpersonal Manner; Communication; Financial Aspects; Time Spent with Doctor and Accessibility and Convenience (8, 9). Our PSQ contains items for General Satisfaction (items 3 and 6), Technical Quality (items 8 and 9), Communication (items 1 and 2), Time spent on education (item 7) and Convenience (items 4 and 5). Second, general questions are asked to determine if this was the first time patient received bowel preparation education. And last, for the app users we want to know how they rate the use of the app.</description>
