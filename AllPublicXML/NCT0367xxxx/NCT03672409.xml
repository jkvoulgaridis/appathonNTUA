  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary health care is the medical assistance available to all individuals in a community and
      is considered the core of the health system. Diabetes, among other chronic diseases, is a
      common reason for medical consultation in primary health care. Worldwide and in Mexico, the
      prevalence of diabetes has been increasing in recent decades, which also leads to an increase
      in the number of deaths. On the other hand, the annual cost of medical care for diabetes in
      the country has increased due to the exacerbation of complications and comorbidities
      associated, which are presented, among other causes, by a deficiency of knowledge in the
      diagnosis, evaluation, management and follow-up of type 2 diabetes, of health professionals
      (doctors, nurses, nutritionists) working in primary health care.

      The present study will allow evaluating the effect of a training program, is a single-cohort
      clinical study with pre- and post-intervention measurements lasting 6 weeks, including the
      initial and final measurements of health professionals currently working in primary health
      care of Hermosillo Sonora.
