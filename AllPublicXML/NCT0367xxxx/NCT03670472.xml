  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presence of a nonsense mutation leads to the rapid degradation of the carrier mRNA
      mutation by a mechanism called NMD (nonsense-mediated mRNA decay) [6, 13]. There are
      currently 3 main strategies at least for correcting nonsense mutations: exon skipping,
      inhibition of NMD and nonsense mutation readthrough.

      In the laboratory, we developed a strategy for correcting nonsense mutations combining
      inhibition of NMD and activation of translecture. For this purpose, we have constructed
      screening systems to identify NMD-inhibiting and/or readthrough enhancers. The molecules thus
      identified are then tested on cell lines and in murine models carrying a nonsense mutation.

      One of our goals is to select a set of molecules that can correct effectively nonsense
      mutations. For this we have to test these molecules on a great diversity of nonsense
      mutations.

      This work will:

        -  determine if we can correct all the nonsense mutations tested with at least one of our
           molecules

        -  determine what is common within a group of mutations corrected by a given molecule

        -  be able to assign the parameters that make one mutation is corrected by one molecule and
           not or little by another.

      This study will therefore improve our theoretical knowledge on the recognition of premature
      stop codons but also to propose therapeutic approaches for the correction of nonsense
      mutations of the CFTR gene in cystic fibrosis in a targeted way for a patient.

    <description>Patient cells with be cultured in BEGM (Lonza) medium and incubated with corrector of nonsense mutations for 20 hours and with a fluorescent molecule called SPQ (for 6-methoxy-N-3'-sulfopropylquinolinium). Iodine can bind SPQ and will quench the SPQ fluorescence. Nitrates bind SPQ without quenching SPQ fluorescence. By placing patient cells first into an iodine-rich medium to quench the SPQ fluorescence and second into a nitrate-rich medium, we will be able to measure the level of functional CFTR protein present in these cells by measuring the re-apparition of fluorescence using fluorimeter. Indeed, nitrate will be able to replace iodine on SPQ without quenching SPQ fluorescence only if iodine exits cells through CFTR channels. This assay allows determining whether a corrector of nonsense mutation is able to lead to the synthesis of functional CFTR protein</description>
