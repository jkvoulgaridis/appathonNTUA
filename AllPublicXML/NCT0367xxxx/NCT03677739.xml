      This trial studies how well Young Melanoma Family Facebook intervention or Healthy Lifestyle
      Facebook intervention works in improving skin examination in participants with melanoma and
      their families. Young Melanoma Family Facebook intervention or Healthy Lifestyle Facebook
      intervention may help improve total cutaneous examinations, skin self-examinations, and sun
      protection among first degree relatives of young onset participants and the participants
      themselves.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the efficacy of the Young Melanoma Family Facebook intervention versus the
      Healthy Lifestyle Facebook intervention on total cutaneous exam (primary outcome), skin
      self-exam frequency and comprehensiveness, and sun protection practices (secondary outcomes)
      of first degree relatives (FDRs) of young melanoma survivors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the efficacy of the Young Melanoma Family Facebook intervention on patients?
      skin self-exam frequency and comprehensiveness and sun protection habits.

      II. To examine the mechanisms of intervention efficacy.

      OUTLINE:

      PHASE I: Researchers refine content for the Facebook intervention condition and conduct
      usability testing.

      PHASE II: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants join a secret Young Melanoma Family Facebook Group and view post messages
      focusing on skin cancer for 12 weeks.

      ARM II: Participants join a secret Healthy Lifestyle Facebook Group and view post messages
      focusing on healthy lifestyle for 12 weeks.

      PHASE III: Dissemination planning.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 6 months.
