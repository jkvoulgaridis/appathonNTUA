  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, crossover design study which measures
      the effect of an available thermogenic dietary supplement on resting energy expenditure
      (REE), blood pressure and heart rate, and mood changes in moderate caffeine consumers.
      Participants will complete baseline measurements then ingest one of three pills. Once the
      pill is ingested, subjects will complete four REEs along with heart rate and blood pressure
      and appropriate questionnaires. Participants will return two more times, each after a one
      week washout period, and complete the same protocol with the remaining supplements.

      Subjects expressing interest in completing the study will be interviewed in the UMHB Human
      Performance Lab (HPL) to determine whether they qualify to participate in the study. Upon
      qualification, participants will be scheduled for their first testing session which will
      include: a body composition analysis via an InBody 770, hunger questionnaires, VAS
      questionnaires, follow up questionnaire, and 5 resting energy expenditure (REE) tests.
      Participants will be randomized into an order that determines which supplement to ingest at
      their testing sessions. Example: A, C, B will correspond to taking A the first session, C the
      second session and so on.

      Supplementation protocol: Participants will be randomized into an order that determines which
      supplement to ingest at their testing sessions. Example: A, C, B will correspond to taking A
      the first session, C the second session and so on. Subjects will take one pill with 8oz of
      water in one minute of allotted time.

      After initial REE, heart rate, blood pressure, questionnaires, and body composition tests,
      subjects will ingest the first of three supplements. After ingestion, subjects will complete
      four REEs every hour. At initial and 60 minutes post ingestion, ECG measurements will be
      recorded using the Biopac BSL. After each REE is complete, heart rate, blood pressure, and
      questionnaires will be taken and recorded. The REE will last 20 minutes, thus to ensure
      ending time is at the hour mark, the REE will be started at the 40 minute time point. Once
      testing is finished, subjects will return to the lab two more times with a one week washout
      period to ingest the remaining supplements.

      Two days prior to each of the three testing sessions, participants will record their dietary
      intake via MyFitnessPal.

    <time_frame>REE completed every hour for four hours post ingestion</time_frame>
    <description>The primary purpose of this investigation is to determine the effectiveness of commercially available thermogenic dietary supplement on changing caloric expenditure via resting energy expenditure (REE) in daily, but modest caffeine consumers. This will be accomplished by observing caloric expenditure over a four hour time period post ingestion of the supplement as compared to baseline caloric expenditure pre-supplementation.</description>

    <description>The primary purpose of this investigation is to determine the effectiveness of commercially available thermogenic dietary supplement on changing heart rate as measured by Omron HEM-907XL professional blood pressure monitor in daily, but modest caffeine consumers. This will be accomplished by observing heart rate over a four hour time period post ingestion of the supplement as compared to baseline heart rate pre-supplementation.</description>

    <time_frame>Blood pressure taken every hour for four hours post ingestion</time_frame>
    <description>The primary purpose of this investigation is to determine the effectiveness of commercially available thermogenic dietary supplement on changes in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure as measured by Omron HEM-907XL professional blood pressure monitor in daily, but modest caffeine consumers. This will be accomplished by observing blood pressure over a four hour time period post ingestion of the supplement as compared to baseline blood pressure pre-supplementation.</description>

    <measure>Effects of Ingestion of a Commercially Available Thermogenic Dietary Supplement on Mood Responses</measure>
    <time_frame>VAS values recorded every hour for four hours post ingestion</time_frame>
    <description>The primary purpose of this investigation is to determine the effectiveness of commercially available thermogenic dietary supplement on changes in mood as measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) in daily, but modest caffeine consumers. This will be accomplished by observing changes in mood over a four hour time period post ingestion of the supplement as compared to their baseline mood response pre-supplementation. The VAS measures levels of energy, focus, concentration, alertness, and fatigue.The VAS is used to measure attitudes over a continuum ranging from &quot;lowest possible&quot; to &quot;highest possible&quot;. Participants are required to mark a line along a 10 centimeter line with one end titled &quot;lowest possible&quot; and the opposite end titled &quot;highest possible&quot;. Scores for the scale range from 0 to 10 with levels of energy, focus, concentration, and alertness being towards the higher end of the scale, closer to 10. Levels of fatigue should be towards the lower end of the scale, closer to 0.</description>
