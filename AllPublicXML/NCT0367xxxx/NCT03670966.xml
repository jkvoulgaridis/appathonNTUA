  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of a radioactive agent linked to
      an antibody (211At-BC8-B10) followed by donor stem cell transplant in treating patients with
      high-risk acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome that has come back (recurrent) or isn't
      responding to treatment (refractory). Monoclonal antibodies, such as 211At-BC8-B10, may
      interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Giving chemotherapy and total
      body irradiation before a stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cells in the bone
      marrow, including normal blood-forming cells (stem cells) and cancer cells. When the healthy
      stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient, they may help the patient's bone marrow
      make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the
      transplanted cells from a donor can attack the body's normal cells, called graft versus host
      disease. Giving cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and sirolimus after a transplant may
      stop this from happening.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of astatine At 211 anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody
      BC8-B10.

      PREPARATIVE REGIMEN: Patients receive astatine At 211 anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody BC8-B10
      infusion over 6-8 hours on day -8, fludarabine intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days -6
      to -2, and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -6 and -5. Patients also undergo TBI on
      day -1.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) or bone marrow transplant on
      day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on days 3-4,
      mycophenolate mofetil IV or PO three times daily (TID) on days 5-35, and sirolimus PO daily
      on days 5-180 with taper beginning on day 84 per physician discretion. Patients also begin
      granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) IV or subcutaneously (SC) on day 5 to continue
      until absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1000/mm^3 x 3 days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at day 100, and at 6, 9, 12,
      18, and 24 months.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have advanced AML, ALL or high-risk MDS, or MPAL (also known as
             bipheontypic) meeting one of the following descriptions:

               -  AML, ALL, or MPAL beyond first remission (i.e., having relapsed at least one time
                  after achieving remission in response to a treatment regimen);

               -  AML, ALL, or MPAL representing primary refractory disease (i.e., having failed to
                  achieve remission at any time following one or more prior treatment regimens);

               -  AML evolved from myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative syndromes;

               -  MDS expressed as refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB)

               -  Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) by French-American-British (FAB) criteria.

          -  Patients not in remission must have CD45-expressing leukemic blasts. Patients in
             remission do not require phenotyping and may have leukemia previously documented to be
             CD45 negative (because in remission patients, virtually all antibody binding is to
             non-malignant cells which make up &gt;= 95% of nucleated cells in the marrow).

          -  Patients should have a circulating blast count of less than 10,000/mm^3 (control with
             hydroxyurea or similar agent is allowed).

          -  Patients must have an estimated creatinine clearance greater than 50/ml per minute by
             the following formula (Cockcroft-Gault). Serum creatinine value must be within 28 days
             prior to registration.

          -  Bilirubin &lt; 2 times the upper limit of normal.

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 2 times the
             upper limit of normal.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) &lt; 2 or Karnofsky &gt;= 70.

          -  Patients must be free of uncontrolled infection.

          -  Patients must not have an HLA-matched related donor or an HLA-matched unrelated donor
             who meets standard Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA) or National Marrow Donor
             Program (NMDP) or other donor center criteria for peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) or
             bone marrow donation.

          -  Patients must have a related donor who is identical for one HLA haplotype and
             mismatched at the HLA-A, -B or DRB1 loci of the unshared haplotype with the exception
             of single HLA-A, -B or DRB1 mismatches.

          -  DONOR: Donors must meet HLA matching criteria as well as standard Seattle Cancer Care
             Alliance (SCCA) criteria for PBSC or bone marrow donation. Preference should be given
             to donors who are mismatched at the HLA-A, -B and -DRB1 loci.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients may not have symptomatic coronary artery disease and may not be on cardiac
             medications for anti-arrhythmic or inotropic effects.

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 45%.

          -  Corrected diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) &lt; 35% or receiving
             supplemental continuous oxygen. When pulmonary function tests (PFTs) cannot be
             obtained, the 6-minute walk test (6MWT, also known as exercise oximetry) will be used:
             Any patient with oxygen saturation on room air of &lt; 89% during a 6MWT will be excluded

          -  Liver abnormalities: fulminant liver failure, cirrhosis of the liver with evidence of
             portal hypertension, alcoholic hepatitis, esophageal varices, hepatic encephalopathy,
             uncorrectable hepatic synthetic dysfunction as evidenced by prolongation of the
             prothrombin time, ascites related to portal hypertension, bacterial or fungal liver
             abscess, biliary obstruction, chronic viral hepatitis, or symptomatic biliary disease.

          -  Patients who are known to be seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

          -  Perceived inability to tolerate diagnostic or therapeutic procedures.

          -  Active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia at time of treatment.

          -  Women of childbearing potential who are pregnant (beta human chorionic gonadotropin
             [B-HCG]+) or breast feeding.

          -  Fertile men and women unwilling to use contraceptives during and for 12 months
             post-transplant.

          -  Inability to understand or give an informed consent.

          -  Allergy to murine-based monoclonal antibodies.

          -  Known contraindications to radiotherapy.
