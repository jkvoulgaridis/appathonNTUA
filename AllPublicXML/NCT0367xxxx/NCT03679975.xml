  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the effect, if any, of a single 50 mg dose of Riluzole
      Oral Soluble Film (ROSF) on swallowing safety in individuals with amyotrophic lateral
      sclerosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single site, single dose, open-label safety study. Approximately thirty (30)
      individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) will be enrolled. Subjects seen in the
      ALS Clinic at the University of Florida will be screened to determine eligibility according
      to the specified inclusion/exclusion criteria. Following enrollment and informed consent,
      subjects will undergo a clinical evaluation including the validated Amyotrophic Lateral
      Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS- R). Swallowing safety will be assessed
      using the gold standard Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study to afford direct visualization of
      the swallowing process and any episodes of penetration or aspiration quantified using the
      validated Penetration Aspiration Scale (PAS). Subjects will undergo a standardized protocol
      that includes 12 bolus stimuli presentations of different liquid and food materials to test
      the swallow across a continuum of textures and materials. Immediately following, subjects
      will be given a single dose of riluzole oral soluble film (ROSF) 50mg, placed on the median
      lingual sulcus of the dorsum of the tongue. Three minutes after the administration of ROSF,
      the identical standardized VFSS protocol will be re- administered to allow a comparison of
      swallowing safety (using the PAS scale) pre vs. post ROSF administration.

    <description>The PAS is an 8 point validated scale of swallowing safety that takes into account both degree/level of airway invasion during swallowing and the patients' response to the penetration or aspiration episode. A score of 1 means the swallowed material does not enter the airway. A score of 8 means the material enters the airway passes below vocal folds and no effort is made to eject.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects between 18-80 years of age, inclusive

          2. Subjects with a diagnosis of probable or definite ALS in accordance with the Revisited
             El-Escorial Criteria (Cedarbaum, 1999)

          3. Subjects must be currently on an oral diet and able to take foods and liquids by mouth
             equivalent to a score of 3 or above on the Functional Oral Intake Scale (Crary, 2005).

          4. Subjects with no known allergy to barium, riluzole or inactive ingredients* in ROSF

          5. Subjects or subject's legally authorized representative must be willing and able to
             give informed consent/assent and HIPAA authorization.

          6. Subjects must have the ability to comprehend and be informed of the nature of the
             study, as assessed by the PI or Sub-Investigator.

          7. Subjects prescribed riluzole at or before the dose of study drug. (The study is open
             to subjects currently taking riluzole at screening, subjects who are not currently
             taking riluzole at screening who have taken riluzole in the past, and subjects to be
             newly started on riluzole (given as ROSF in this study.)

             hospitalization

          4. Subjects with a history of clinically significant liver disease, renal disease, or any
             other medical condition judged to be exclusionary by the investigator

          5. Subjects who are unwilling to sign informed consent or subjects who for any other
             reason in the judgment of investigator are unable to complete the study

          6. Female subjects who have a positive urine pregnancy test (βhCG) at screening or Visit

             carcinoma of the skin

          8. Subjects who have taken any experimental drug within 30 days prior to enrollment or
             within 5 half-lives of the investigational drug -whichever is the longer period.
             However, subjects who have previously completed other MonoSol Rx sponsored ROSF
             clinical studies within the last 30 days prior to enrollment may be eligible for
             consideration for entry into this study.

          9. Subjects with moderate or severe renal impairment as defined by a calculated
             creatinine clearance of ≤50 mL/minute

         10. Subjects currently taking riluzole with ALT levels greater than 5 times upper limit of
             normal or with evidence of clinical jaundice. (Riluzole should be discontinued in
             these patients.)

         11. Subjects who will be receiving riluzole for the first time who exhibit baseline
             elevations of several LFTs (especially elevated bilirubin). (These findings at
             baseline should preclude the use of riluzole including ROSF).

         12. Use of potentially hepatotoxic drugs: (e.g., allopurinol, methyldopa, sulfasalazine).

         13. Subjects with clinically significant abnormal laboratory values in the judgment of the

             administration.

         15. Anything else that, in the opinion of the investigator, would place the subject at
             increased risk or preclude the subject's full compliance with or completion of the
             study

         16. Employee or immediate relative of an employee of the investigator, MonoSol Rx LLC, any
             of its affiliates or partners, or inVentiv Health.
