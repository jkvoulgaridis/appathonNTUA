  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic pain are often prescribed long-term opioid therapy, despite the serious
      risks and growing concerns related to opioid use. The Toronto General Hospital has created
      the world's first multidisciplinary perioperative Transitional Pain Service Program (TPSP)
      aimed at reducing the incidence and severity of chronic post-surgical pain. The TPSP
      incorporates a variety of mechanisms and interventions to help patients manage pain and to
      wean off opioids. The approach consists of: pain education, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
      (ACT), and an e-mobile self- management tool to help patients manage chronic pain more
      effectively. With the TPSP team, the investigators hope to continually assist patients to
      achieve a balance between the benefits and potential harms of opioid use to promote long-term
      health and well-being.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research program encompasses several study designs to evaluate the effectiveness
      and potential implementation of the TPSP across Ontario. The investigators will use three
      approaches to create a comprehensive evidence-base that can be used to guide future policy
      and programs related to the management of surgical patients with complex pain and chronic
      opioid use. In the first phase, a multicenter randomized controlled trial will be conducted
      in 5 hospital sites to evaluate the effectiveness and potential implementation of TPSP across
      Ontario. The aim is to recruit a total of 210 patients who are currently taking opioids and
      also undergoing a surgical intervention (e.g., spinal fusion, hip or knee arthroplasty, major
      cardiac surgery, hysterectomy, colectomy, cholecystectomy, major vascular surgery, hernia
      repairs, bariatric surgery, and thyroidectomies). The randomized controlled trial will
      determine the effectiveness of the TPSP at weaning patients completely off opioids while
      still managing pain after one year. Secondly, an economic and healthcare utilization analysis
      of the program via linkage to provincial administrative databases will be carried out to
      understand the impact the TPSP program has on the healthcare system as a whole. Lastly, a
      qualitative study will be conducted on both the treatment and control groups. The
      investigators hope to capture further insight to understand patients and providers
      experiences of the TPSP intervention.

    <description>Brief Pain Inventory Scale is a measure that assess the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions. Measurement of this scale is rated on a 0-10 numerical-rating-scale ( 0= No Pain to 10= Pain as bad as you can imagine or 0= Does not interfere to 10= Completely interferes). The BPI assess pain at its worst, least, average, and now. Pain Severity Score is calculated by adding the scores for questions 2, 3, 4 and 5 and then dividing by 4. This gives a severity score out of 10. Pain Interference Score is calculated by adding the scores for questions 8a, b, c, d, e, f and g and then dividing by 7. This gives an interference score out of 10.</description>

    <description>Patients in the interventional group will be given a Transitional Pain Service follow-up appointment at the following postoperative time points (2 to 6 visits for the first two months, and then 1 to 2 visits on a monthly basis until one year). At each visit, patients will meet with the clinical psychologist and chronic pain specialist. Patients in the intervention group will have access to the Manage My Pain (MMP) App. which allows people living with pain to quickly and easily track their pain and function on a daily basis on their smartphones or a browser on their desktop or mobile device. One-page clinical reports will capture the changes in patients' outcome data between clinical visits over the course in time.Clinic visits can be offered in person at the hospital or over telehealth (video conference) based on the patient's preference and clinician's judgment for telehealth suitability.</description>

    <description>The Transitional Pain Service Program enables targeted, mechanism-based, treatment innovations aimed at reducing the incidence and severity of chronic post-surgical pain, disability and enabling safe opioid prescribing/ weaning after major surgery. The investigator's TPSP intervention uses a variety of methods to support patients to manage pain and wean off opioids. This includes physician-guided opioid and non-opioid pharmacotherapy and tapering, and clinical psychology services specializing in pain education, Acceptance &amp; Commitment Therapy (ACT) and e-mobile self-management tools.</description>
