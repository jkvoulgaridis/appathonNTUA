  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this proposed study, the investigators aim to build up a large cohort of Rapid eye
      movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) to study the etiology and risk factors of
      neurodegeneration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by abnormal behavioral
      manifestations during REM sleep. Accumulating evidence suggests that RBD is implicated as an
      integral part of disease progress of Î±-synucleinopathy neurodegeneration, such as Parkinson's
      disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies.Previous studies have identified a series of
      neurocognitive, autonomic, clinical and neurobiological markers for neurodegeneration in
      iRBD, such as olfactory dysfunction, color vision deficit, autonomic dysfunction, tonic EMG
      activity during REM sleep, and psychiatric disorder. However, the prevalence rate of RBD was
      relatively low and most of the RBD studies only have 100 or below cases. and there might be
      ethic differences in RBD which indicates that the findings from western countries might not
      be applicable to Chinese. In these regards, the investigators aimed to build up a large
      cohort of Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) to study the etiology and risk
      factors of neurodegeneration.

    <description>The percentage of REM-related EMG activity (REMREEA) is the most reliable and valid marker in differentiating patients with RBD from normal controls. Both REMREEA and significant motor activity were recorded by video-polysomnography in rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder.</description>
