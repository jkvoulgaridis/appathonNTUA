      This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a Mindfulness
      for Physical Activity programme on physical activity outcomes in underactive participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, mindfulness-based approaches have increasingly been used in mental and
      physical health interventions. There appears to be some consensus about the benefits of
      standard mindfulness courses, such as Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction and
      Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy on stress, anxiety and depression, and other health
      conditions. In terms of physical activity, however, evidence for the use of mindfulness
      training to promote and improve physical activity is scarce and shows conflicting results.
      Evidence suggests that mindfulness training may enhance psychological factors related to
      exercise, such as intrinsic motivation to engage in physical activity, tolerance of physical
      activity-related discomfort, and physical activity self-regulation, which could potentially
      enhance physical activity maintenance in the long run.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in physical activity acceptance</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Physical Activity Acceptance Questionnaire (PAAQ). The PAAQ is a 10-item measure, rated on a seven-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (never true) to 7 (always true), with higher scores indicating higher tolerance for physical activity-related discomfort. Subscales include cognitive acceptance (e.g., &quot;If I have the thought 'exercising today won't be enjoyable', it derails me from my exercise plan&quot;) and behavioural commitment (e.g., &quot;Even if I have the desire to stop while I am exercising, I can still follow my exercise plan&quot;).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-reported physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). The IPAQ is a 7-item measure, giving a result in multiples of resting metabolic rate (MET), with higher MET minute values indicating more physical activity. It assesses moderate-intensity physical activity, vigorous-intensity physical activity, walking, and sitting.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 14 weeks</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in physical activity motivation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Behavioural Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ-3). The BREQ-3 is a 24-item measure, rated on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (not true for me) to 4 (very true for me), with higher scores indicating higher levels of motivation. Subscales include amotivation (e.g., &quot;I don't see why I should have to exercise&quot;), external motivation (e.g., &quot;I exercise because other people say I should&quot;), introjected motivation (e.g., &quot;I feel guilty when I don't exercise&quot;), identified motivation (e.g., &quot;It's important to me to exercise regularly&quot;), integrated motivation (e.g., &quot;I exercise because it is consistent with my life goals&quot;), and intrinsic motivation (e.g., &quot;I exercise because it's fun&quot;).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-regulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Brief Self-Control Scale (BSCS). The BSCS is a 13-item measure, rated on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (not at all like me) to 5 (very much like me), with higher scores indicating higher levels of self-control. Subscales include inhibition (e.g., &quot;I am good at resisting temptation&quot;) and initiation (e.g., &quot;I am able to work effectively toward long-term goals&quot;).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in dispositional mindfulness</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ). The FFMQ is a 15-item measure, rated on a five-point Likert Scale, ranging from 1 (never or very rarely true) to 5 (very often or always true), with higher scores indicating higher levels of dispositional mindfulness. Subscales include acting with awareness (e.g., &quot;When I do things, my mind wanders off and I'm easily distracted&quot;), non-judging (e.g., &quot;I criticize myself for having irrational or inappropriate emotions&quot;), and non-reactivity (e.g., &quot;I perceive my feelings and emotions without having to react to them&quot;).</description>
