  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The etiology of bronchiectasis, known as permanent, abnormal, and localized development of
      bronchi, varies. However, most of them are responsible for infections during childhood. The
      prevalence of bronchiectasis is particularly high in advanced COPD patients. This phenomenon,
      called COPD-bronchiectasis overlap syndrome, affects the clinic of COPD patients negatively.
      In this study; bronchiectasis in respiratory function, exercise capacity, dyspnoea and
      quality of life in COPD patients.

      The etiology of bronchiectasis, known as permanent, abnormal, and localized development of
      bronchi, varies. However, most of them are responsible for infections during childhood. The
      prevalence of bronchiectasis is particularly high in advanced COPD patients. This phenomenon,

      In this study; bronchiectasis in respiratory function, exercise capacity, dyspnoea and
      quality of life in COPD patients.

      Torax CTs of patients with COPD who are admitted to the outpatient clinic will be examined.
      There will be two groups, group 1 in patients with COPD accompanied by bronchiectasis and
      group 2 in COPD patients without bronchiectasis. In both groups, respiratory function tests,
      exercise capacities, dyspnea perceptions and quality of life will be evaluated. The data will
      be compared between the two groups.
