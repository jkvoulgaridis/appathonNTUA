    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the statistics of anti-age treatment in outpatient sites in Russia
      (involution indicators: clinical scales; instrumental diagnostics, ultrasonic scannings,
      assesment of allergic state, efficacy assesment in according with GAIS scale) in routine
      clinical practice with focus on collagen therapy.

    <textblock>
      This non-interventional study covers 60 patients (females with involuntary changes of the
      face skin) from Russian sites.

      The following data will be collected and analyzed after the end of treatment:

        -  demography

        -  assessment of allergic state

        -  safety data

        -  severity of aging effect

        -  clinical scales results before 1visit and after end of treatment

        -  GAIS effectiveness assessment

        -  instrumental diagnostic before 1visit and after end of treatment

        -  hydration

        -  elasticity

        -  microcirculation level

        -  lipofuscin level

        -  ultrasound scanning

        -  derma echo density
