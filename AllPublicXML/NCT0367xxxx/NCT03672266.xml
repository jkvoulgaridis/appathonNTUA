  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to characterize biophysiolgoical signals as a comprehensive profile
      of the nervous systems in order to understand interactions between the brain and body, while
      an individual performs naturalistic behaviors (ex. walking, pointing) and while breathing at
      a slow controlled pace. The investigators aim to study these interactions among a variety of
      populations, from healthy individuals to those with disorders such as Autism Spectrum
      Disorder(s), including those who may also have an ADHD (Attention-deficit/hyperactivity
      disorder) diagnosis, Asperger's Syndrome, Alzheimer's Disease, and/or Fragile X syndrome

      What is the study for? The goal of this study is to characterize biophysical signals
      simultaneously co-registered from the person's nervous systems. To that end the investigators
      use multiple wearable biosensors (electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram, kinematics,etc.)
      and have the person move naturally during activities that are similar to what the person
      would do in activities of daily living. These include walking, walking with a metronome in
      the background and walking while breathing at the metronome's pace. The purpose of the study
      is to learn about the inherent properties of the biorhythms of each person in order to build
      a proper neurotypical scale and measure the departure of several groups of subjects from this
      typical ranges. These include Autism Spectrum Disorder(s), ADHD
      (Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) , Asperger's Syndrome, Alzheimer's Disease, and/or
      Fragile X syndrome. This study does not provide any recommendations of diagnosis or
      treatment. It is merely a characterization of the person's biorhythms across these
      conditions.

      What will the participant do? The participant will perform naturalistic behaviors (ex. walk
      naturally around the room, point at an object) while hearing a metronome beating in the
      background. At certain points, the participant will be instructed to breathe along with the
      beat of the metronome. During this experiment, the participant will be wearing a wireless
      Electroencephalographic (EEG) cap to record brain activity, wireless motion sensors around
      the body to record movement, and wireless electrocardiogram (ECG) on the chest to record
      heart activity.The participant will also be wearing Zeblok insoles placed inside their shoes,
      to monitor their gait. The recorded biophysical signals are to be used to assess biorhythms
      of the nervous system from an already diagnosed participants and neurotypical participants,
      as this experiment is designed to study and characterize the biophysical signals of various
      populations. The study does not provide criteria for diagnosis, nor does it provide
      recommendations for treatments. The study is merely characterizing the ranges of biophysical
      data and their variability across different populations to measure departure from
      neurotypical features. Please note, wearing a wireless EEG cap will involve applying
      electrode gel (similar to hair gel) on the participant's hair.

      How long is the experiment? The experiment itself will take 45 minutes - comprising 3 walking
      trials lasting 15 minutes each - but this can be reduced depending on the participant's
      disposition. Breaks for light refreshments and sensory toys will be provided as needed. The
      setup will take an additional 15-30 minutes.

      Where/when does the experiment take place? The experiment will be conducted at the
      Sensory-motor Integration Lab, Psychology Building on Busch campus, at Rutgers University
      (152 Frelinghuysen Road, Piscataway, NJ 08854). If necessary the experiment may also be
      conducted at the participant's home. Based on the availability of the participant and the
      experimenter, the date and place can be coordinated any day and time of the week - including
      weekends. Additional members of staff can provide on-site childcare for siblings upon
      request.

    <measure>Unitless Stochastic Signatures of Biophysiological Signals, consisting of the Empirically Estimated Shape and Dispersion (scale) Parameters of Probability Distribution Functions</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Biophysical signals extracted from the brain and heart (mV) and motor kinematics (m/s) activities will be normalized and scaled to a unit-less waveform dataset. The standardized unitless data set will account for anatomical differences and will then be empirically characterized as families of probability distributions for each person, by the shape and scale parameters of continuous families of probability distribution functions with variable shapes and dispersion (noise to signal ratio). These parameters are objective biomarkers for a variety of disorders, and inform the level of noise-to-signal ratio and predictability of an individual's biorhythms (Torres, 2018).

    <measure>Brain and Body Connectivity metrics and Derived Geometric and Topological Indexes from the Network Connectivity Model and Inverse Kinematic Model</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Based on a mathematical network connectivity model (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010), the investigators will measure how the brain and body (central and peripheral networks) interact while participants perform naturalistic tasks. Based on the physiological data from the brain and heart activities (mV) and motor kinematics (m/s), the experimental analytics provide a model that measures unit-less connectivity measures between different parts of the body. Namely, they are degrees (i.e., number of links connected to a node), shortest path length (a basis for measuring integration), number of triangles (a basis for measuring segregation), and modularity. Further, analyzes of forward and inverse kinematics dynamics will be derived from the three dimensional positional and orientation data of the kinematic sensors along with the person's mass and bone-length data, using state of the art models of inverse dynamics (Torres, 2001).</description>

    <description>Based on an information theoretic model (Shannon,1956), the investigators will quantify the probability distribution function of measured biophysical signals from the brain and heart (mV) and kinematics (m/s), and characterize information passing across the central and peripheral nervous systems, including as well the autonomic nervous system.</description>
