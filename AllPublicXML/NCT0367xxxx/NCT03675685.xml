  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and Pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single 3.36-mg dose of
      Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum (CCH) in 4 quadrants concurrently, in subjects with
      Edematous fibrosclerotic panniculopathy (EFP).

      This study will provide insight to the PK profile and safety of concurrent subcutaneous
      injections of CCH 0.84 mg/quadrant into 4 quadrants.
