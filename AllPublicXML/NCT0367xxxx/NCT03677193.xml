  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The protocol aims to evaluate the feasibility and potential efficacy of an Interactive
      Computer Play (ICP) intervention. The ICP intervention is built to help youth with Cerebral
      palsy (CP) who have difficulty performing activities of daily living with their hand.

      The ICP intervention is a video game controlled by performing gestures with the non-dominant
      hand. Using Low-cost commercial technology muscle activity and arm movement is used to
      recognize the gestures which control the game. Players will get feedback in the game about
      the quality of their movements through the built-in points and rewards system. This
      repetitive practice and feedback will help the participants build strength and control in
      their arm. To evaluate this ICP intervention, 10 participants, with hemiplegic CP and 8-18
      years old, from Holland Bloorview will be recruited for a pilot feasibility study using a
      single-case experimental design (SCED). The design is as follows:

        1. Phase 1. Participants will speak with therapists / researchers in an Initial Dialogue
           to:

             1. Introduce the study/game and what it offers types of daily activities

             2. Set Performance goal areas (Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM)), and

             3. Develop an action plan to facilitate the successful achievement of their goals.

        2. Phase 2. Participants will perform baseline functional assessments including: active
           range of motion (AROM), Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA), Box and Blocks Test (B&amp;B).

        3. Phase 3. During the 4-week intervention, participants will play the ICP game from their
           home according to the goals they define during the initial dialogue. This is expected to
           be 20-30 min * 5 days per week. Once per week, participants will play the ICP
           intervention with a researcher in clinic or at home who will also measure AROM while
           recording the play session.

        4. Phase 4. After the intervention, participants will complete clinical measures of
           functional performance (AROM, AHA, B&amp;B) a final time and speak with therapist and
           researcher to re-evaluate goals (COPM).

      By leveraging the motivational and immersive aspects of ICP and combining it with
      evidence-based movement feedback this protocol has the potential to improve home-based ICP
      therapies for persons with CP.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical diagnosis of Cerebral Palsy.

          2. Age: 8-18 years. This age range was selected given the popularity of video games and
             the size of the muscle sensors available.

          3. Manual Abilities Classification System levels I-III.

          4. Have a goal relating to improving hand / wrist function.

          5. Dominantly spastic presentation

          6. Able to co-operate, understand, and follow simple instructions for game play. This
             will be assessed during the information and assent process by the researcher.

          7. Having passive ROM of at least 10Â° greater than AROM.

        Exclusion Criteria:
