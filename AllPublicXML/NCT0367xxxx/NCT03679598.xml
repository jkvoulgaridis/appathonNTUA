  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, randomized (1:1), placebo-controlled, 12-week,
      proof-of-concept study to evaluate the safety and tolerability as well as the mechanistic
      effect of oral administration of alvelestat (MPH966) in subjects with confirmed alpha-1
      (Pi*ZZ, Pi*SZ, Pi*Z Null, or Pi*Null phenotype) antitrypsin deficiency (AATD)-related
      emphysema.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is the most common genetic cause of chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD) and early-onset emphysema. AATD is characterized by low AAT levels;
      leading to excessive neutrophil elastase (NE) mediated lung destruction. Current treatment
      requires the periodic infusion of pooled AAT derived from human plasma, but this therapeutic
      approach (termed augmentation) does not definitively slow the rate of emphysema
      progressionlung function decline and is very expensive. In addition, it is not clear that the
      currently recommended dose for augmentation fully controls lung inflammation and destruction.
      Alvelestat (MPH966, formerly AZD9668) is a potent, selective, and reversible, oral inhibitor
      of human NE. Suppression of NE is expected to reduce lung damage and may slow disease
      progression. This study is to establish proof of clinical concept by investigating the
      mechanistic effect and safety of alvelestat (MPH966) in patients with AATD.
