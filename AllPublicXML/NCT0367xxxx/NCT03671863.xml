    <textblock>
      Clubfoot is one of the most common birth defects, with a prevalence in Europe estimated
      between 1 and 4.5 for 1000 live birth.

      It is useful to distinguish the forms of isolated clubfoot, and the forms related to others
      morphological abnormalities (complex clubfoot). For the complex forms, the clubfoot can be
      integrated in a syndromic association, be the consequence of a serious harm of the central
      nervous system, be associate to a genetic musculo-skeletal disease or wether be associated to
      a karyotype abnormality.

      In those cases, the prognosis depends more about the associated morphological abnormalities
      that can be the beginning of a severe disability or incompatible with life or any anomaly of
      the karyotype that clubfoot itself.

      In case of several morphological abnormalities, to propose invasive samples with realization
      of a karyotype and chromosome analysis with CGH array is a consensual attitude.

      What the investigators should recommended to the parents in case of isolated form is less
      obvious and the question of antenatal investigations can not be answered clearly in the
      literature. Thus, the management of these patients may vary from one CPDP to another.

      This study project will make it possible to analyze the management offered to patients whose
      fetuses have club feet and to study the results of the various examinations carried out in
      order to adapt the prenatal counselling and to define the best diagnostic strategy to propose
      to the future parents.
