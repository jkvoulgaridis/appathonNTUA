  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this proposed study are: 1) to evaluate feasibility and acceptability of a
      novel intervention, Regulation of Cues (ROC), and Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), and 2) to
      evaluate the efficacy of both treatments on reduction of binge eating and weight loss among
      120 Veterans with subclinical or clinical Binge Eating Disorder (BED) with comorbid
      overweight/obesity (OW/OB).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a new model for the treatment of obesity, called Regulation
      of Cues (ROC), which is based on Schachter's Externality Theory. This study will compare ROC
      with Cognitive Behavior Therapy for individuals with Binge Eating Disorder. The investigators
      will recruit and randomize 120 male and female Veterans with BED and subclinical BED with
      comorbid overweight/obesity, provide 5 months of treatment and follow participants for
      6-months post-treatment. Participants will complete assessments at baseline, mid-treatment
      (week 9), post-treatment (week 20), and 6-month follow-up (week 44). This study will be the
      first to contribute to a body of literature developing treatments for BED and
      overweight/obesity in the Veterans Affairs (VA) and/or military health care systems.

    <description>Participants are provided information about basic learning theory and how physiological responses to food cues develop and can be managed. Lack of sensitivity to appetite and satiety cues and increased sensitivity to food cues will be discussed. Coping skills are presented to assist in mastery and toleration of food cue sensitivity. Participants will complete experiential learning exercises with food, and taught to monitor their hunger, satiety, and cravings. The physical activity program will focus on increasing both lifestyle activity and structured exercise programs.</description>

    <description>Participants are taught to identify problems in eating, thinking, and mood patterns that served to trigger binge episodes through self-monitoring and to gradually develop alternative patterns aimed at facilitating healthy, binge-free eating patterns. Participants are taught to eat a healthy variety of foods and reducing the avoidance of &quot;forbidden&quot; foods that are typically consumed during a binge.</description>
