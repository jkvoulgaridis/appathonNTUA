  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will assess whether an interactive perioperative teaching platform (IPTP)
      provided to families of patients undergoing ambulatory pediatric surgery will reduce
      families' anxiety, and improve satisfaction and understanding, relative to current practice.
      The IPTP will educate patient families on the continuum of their child's surgical experience,
      from arriving at the hospital through registration, the operating room (OR), and the hospital
      floor. An active video format will be used to provide instructions for navigating the
      hospital; describe induction of anesthesia and the surgical procedure; and provide
      post-surgery and post-discharge instructions for pain management. A comparison cohort of
      patients undergoing surgery without access to the IPTP will be recruited to assess the
      benefits of the IPTP for improving metrics of family satisfaction, preoperative anxiety, and
      postoperative understanding of discharge instructions.

    <description>Family satisfaction will be assessed by a member of the research team using an adaptation of the English version of the Leiden Perioperative Patient Satisfaction questionnaire (LPPSq) recommended for research on satisfaction with surgeries involving anesthesia. The English version assesses 4 domains of satisfaction: information provision, professional competence, patient-staff relationship, and service with a total of 24 questions on these topics. It is scored on a 1-5 Likert scale (from completely dissatisfied to completely satisfied).</description>
