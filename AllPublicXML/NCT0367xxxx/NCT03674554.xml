  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On of the main fixed prosthetic options of completely edentulous patients is the
      screw-retained implant supported prosthesis which was constructed on transmucosal abutments
      with its encountered problems such as: hardness to make it passively seated with multiple
      screw fracture and loosening problems and multiple encountered veneer material fracture and
      so there effect on patient satisfaction with multiple maintenance recalls.so, the
      investigators want to try a new technique of fabrication which was proposed for reducing the
      problems of lack of passivity which is the intraoral luting cement technique on titanium
      bases with reduced screw number but, with luting cement problems as de-cementation and cement
      biological effects on soft tissues and bone and there effect on number of patient recall
      visits and maintenance and so there effect on patient satisfaction
