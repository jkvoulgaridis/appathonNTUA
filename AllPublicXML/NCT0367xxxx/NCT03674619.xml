  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the present project is to compare the effectiveness of surgery and
      nonsurgical treatment in patients with cervical radiculopathy caused by either disc
      herniation or spondylosis. Secondary aims are to evaluate cost-effectiveness and predicting
      factors of success of the two treatments, and to explore the terms success rate and
      expectations by asking the patients to fill in their expected primary outcome score at
      baseline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical radiculopathy is usually caused by disc herniation or spondylosis. Prognosis is
      expected to be good in most patients but there is limited scientific evidence about the
      indication for non-surgical and surgical treatment.

      Two randomised controlled trials comparing cervical decompression and non-operative treatment
      with cost-effectiveness analysis and assessment of expectations and predictors of outcome.
      The main research question will be evaluated at one-year follow-up.

        1. To test the hypothesis that the effectiveness of surgery as measured by the change in
           Neck Disability Index (NDI) and arm pain at 1-year follow-up in patients with cervical
           radiculopathy is not different from non-surgical treatment in:

             1. Study 1: one level disc herniation (C5/6 or C6/7)

             2. Study 2: one or two level spondylosis (C5/6 and/or C6/7)

        2. To test the hypothesis that surgery is more effective in patients with more clinical
           finding (dermatomal sensory loss, myotonal weakness and reflex disturbance) at baseline
           when adjusted for other possible predictors such as age, gender, baseline pain,
           duration, radiological findings, expectations, and psychological factors).

        3. To estimate cost-effectiveness for health care costs and societal costs (including
           sickness absence) in surgical versus non-surgical patients.

        4. To assess radiological (MRI and CT) measurements of foraminal area and nerve compression
           and if changes can predict clinical changes (NDI and arm pain) at 1-year .

        5. To evaluate treatment outcome expectations at baseline asking the patients to fill in
           their expected improvement.

    <time_frame>Follow-up at 52 weeks is the primary end point.</time_frame>
    <description>Consists of ten questions about pain related disability and include items such as by example headache, concentration, reading and sleep. Each item is rated by choosing one of five response categories and transformed to a total score from 0 to 100 (worst possible). The Norwegian version has been validated in patients with neck pain and with cervical radiculopathy.</description>

    <description>EQ-5D-5L includes five domains: mobility; self-care, daily activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression and each has three response categories. The responses are transformed into and index to value the patients' health related quality of life for the cost utility analyses. Patients score their health from 0 (as bad as possible) to 100 (best possible) by EQ-VAS. The Norwegian version has been validated in patients with back pain, idiopathic scoliosis, and cervical radiculopathy.</description>

    <intervention_name>Anterior discectomy</intervention_name>
    <description>Anterior discectomy will be performed and a microscope is used. After separation of the platysma muscle the pre-vertebral space is reached by an approach medial to the sternocleido-mastoid muscle and the carotid artery and lateral to the trachea and oesophagus. Then the disc is incided and the corpora are distracted to perform discectomy. Usually the posterior ligament is cut and the spinal root is decompressed and if necessary the arthritic rims are removed. An inter-vertebral fusion device is inserted, two levels are allowed in the spondylosis study.</description>

    <description>Patients will first attend an experienced specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation who will answer concerns and questions and if necessary repeat the information given before inclusion. The aim of the brief intervention is to promote better understanding and coping of the condition. The intervention will include supervision by a physiotherapist (6 sessions altogether) and provide advice on how to handle secondary neck muscle pain and dysfunction, reduce eventual fear avoidance, and advice to stay active.</description>
