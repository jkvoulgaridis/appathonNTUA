  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure changes in cognitive (mental) function in cancer
      survivors using a brief, reliable, game-like set of tests that can be completed outside the
      clinic, as an alternative to traditional neurocognitive assessments. This set of computerized
      tests, the Cogsuite Assessment, is expected to improve our ability to identify cognitive
      impairments in people who have been treated for cancer, so that we can (1) learn more about
      which cognitive functions are affected by cancer treatment, and (2) guide that treatment more
      effectively.

        MSK patients will be recruited through the survivorship clinics after having been
        identified via a Dataline query and/or weekly clinic schedules or through direct referrals
        from a member of the patient‟s treatment team.

             verification: For both patients and controls, prior to enrollment, all will be asked
             the following two questions by an CRC to verify English fluency necessary for
             participation in the study:

               1. How well do you speak English? (must respond &quot;Very well&quot; when given the choices
                  of Very well, Well, Not well, Not at all, Don‟t know, or Refused)

                  clearly state if the user has adequate hardware using green and red text and
                  symbols. The test URL will also return a short 5 sequence numeric validation code

                  lookup the specific hardware that was tested. Research Associates can direct
                  prospects to the test web URL during their phone screen.
