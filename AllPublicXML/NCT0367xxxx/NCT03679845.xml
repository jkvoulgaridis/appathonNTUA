      An open-label single center trial studying the efficacy and safety of sarilumab on morphea
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Morphea, like systemic sclerosis (SSc), presents with sclerotic hardening of the skin.
      However, unlike SSc, morphea has no systemic involvement. While this skin-limited, chronic
      sclerosis, has no impact on mortality, it can have significant morbidity, as lesions can
      affect joint mobility, and be disfiguring, especially when involving the face. While some
      patients respond well to use of steroids, whether topical or intralesional, antimalarials
      such as plaquenil, or traditional immuno-suppressants there is a significant proportion of
      patients who remain non-responsive to these treatments, or require high dosages of these,
      oral steroids, or experimental therapies to suppress the condition. For this group of
      patients there is a high clinical need to find alternate therapies. In addition, as the
      disease creates permanent scarring, and traditional immuno-suppressants take several months
      to take effect there is a need for medications that can act more quickly to halt the
      progression of scarring.

      Although the pathways of inflammation are poorly understood, one cytokine of potential
      interest is IL (interleukin)-6. In the bleomycin mouse model of skin sclerosis targeting IL-6
      by both passive and active immunization strategies prevented the development of
      bleomycin-induced dermal fibrosis. Dysregulation of IL-6 has also been seen in the serum of
      patients suffering from SSc. As a result, preliminary clinical trials have been undertaken in
      SSc. While results did not reach statistical significance the skin thickening was better in
      the treatment group than in placebo and the lack of signal is likely due to the late stage of
      patients skin involvement, and the slow progression of thickening in SSc. In contrast morphea
      often progresses rapidly and as such is much more likely to give a clear clinical signal.

      Recently sarilumab, an anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody, has been approved for use in severe
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) after rapid and sustained results in clinical trials. Given its
      good safety profile, its impressive response in RA, and the immunohistochemical evidence that
      IL-6 may be important in creation of sclerosis in SSc, the investigators propose a pilot
      study to determine the safety and efficacy of sarilumab in morphea.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subject 18 years of age or older

          2. Only circumscribed (plaque) morphea with at least one active morphea target lesion
             (0.5-10 cm2), with mLoSSI ≥ 5.

          3. Body surface area affected by morphea lesions: ≤ 50% at start of treatment

          4. If subject has received any morphea treatment, subject must be on a stable regimen,
             which is defined as not starting a new drug or changing dosage within 8 weeks prior to
             Day 1. Subject must be willing to stay on a stable regimen during the duration of the
             study.

          5. Willingness of subject to follow all study procedures

          6. Willingness to avoid excessive exposure of diseased areas to natural or artificial
             sunlight

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use any topical medication treating morphea within 14 days prior to Day 1

          2. Pregnancy or breast feeding

             1.5 times normal limits) or therapy that in the investigator's opinion may pose a risk
             to the subject or that could interfere with any evaluation in the study
