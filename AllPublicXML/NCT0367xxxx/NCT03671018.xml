    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of
      mosunetuzumab in combination with polatuzumab vedotin in participants with diffuse large
      B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and in participants with follicular lymphoma (FL). It will consist of
      a dose finding portion followed by an expansion phase for second line or later (2L+)
      participants with relapsed or refractory (R/R) DLBCL and 2L+ R/R FL.
