  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erectile Dysfunction (ED) is a condition with an inability to develop or maintain an erection
      of the penis upon sexual stimulation. It occurs in association with aging, chronic illnesses
      and various modifiable risk factors. Amongst the modifiable risk factors, ED shares the most
      common risk factors with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) which are smoking, hypertension and
      hyperlipidemia1. Even though it is not a part of normal aging, it is seen in 52% men in the
      age group 40 to 70 years, with a higher rate in the men more than 70 years2

      MoreNova is a Linear Shockwave (LISW) device, which incorporates a shockwave transducer
      operable to deliver shockwaves to a treatment region confined to a narrow rectangle.
      Shockwaves generation follows the electromagnetic principle.

      Linear Shockwaves (LISW), as a treatment for ED has been in evaluation in contemporary
      medicine (see section 1.4). It has been in use for the last five years.

      The present study will utilize a device called &quot;MoreNova&quot;, in which shockwaves are focused
      onto line segments for improved organ coverage. Shockwaves produced by &quot;MoreNova&quot; are aimed
      at the left and right corpora cavernosa and the crura. The study is aimed at determining the
      safety and effectiveness of this new type of LISW in the treatment of ED.

    <measure>Doppler Ultrasound - to measure blood flow</measure>
    <time_frame>13 months</time_frame>
    <description>A measure to show the way blood flows in and out of organs. Blood flow is critical for a man's erections. When a man is sexually stimulated, the arteries in his penis widen and the penis fills with blood. This blood is what gives the penis the firmness it needs. Veins in the penis constrict, holding the blood in.
The test begins with an injection of medicine, which causes an erection by widening arteries and increasing blood flow. From there, a doctor moves a small device called a transducer over against the skin of the penis. The transducer sends data to a computer so that the doctor can tell how fast blood is flowing in and out.</description>

    <description>This is a prospective, randomized, clinical study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the two treatment schedules on symptomatic ED patients. The patients are randomized in a 2:1 ratio of active to sham treatment groups. Patients randomized to the treatment group will be instructed to stop any use of PDE5i for 4 weeks prior to first treatment session and refrain from using any other ED therapy option during the study. They will be instructed to undergo a PDE5i washout period of 4 weeks prior to treatment. After the washout period and before the first treatment session, patients will answer the IIEF-EF, SEP and EHS questionnaires for baseline evaluation. Penile Doppler ultrasound will be performed by the time of enrollment, at 1,3, 6, 9 and 12 months and after treatment.</description>
