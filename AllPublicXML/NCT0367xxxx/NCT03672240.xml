    <textblock>
      A Phase Ib, open label, non randomized study to measure the safety and PK characteristics of
      APL-1202 at steady-state in adult male and female BCG resistant NMIBC patients when it is
      administered alone and concurrently with BCG.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Six eligible participants will be administered with APL-1202 one week prior to the first BCG
      instillation, during the six-week course of BCG instillation, and additional five weeks, for
      a total of 12 weeks of dosing. Safety assessment will be performed during the entire 13 week
      study duration. Plasma and urine samples will be collected from each participant at prior to
      first and fifth BCG instillations for PK analysis.
