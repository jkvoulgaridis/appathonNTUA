      TITLE: Immediate effect of Johnstone's Pressure Splint added to Stretching on the spasticity
      of elbow flexors and wrist in Cerebrovascular Disease (CVD).

      INTRODUCTION: In the rehabilitation of the upper limb post-CVD to employed exercise
      modalities such as stretching (S) to control spasticity, improve mobility and functionality.
      Also it is used the Johnstone´s Pressure Splint (JPS), which exerts circumferential pressure
      and contribute to spastic pattern inhibition, sensory re-education and increased of the
      mobility.

      OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to evaluate the immediate effect of JPS added to S on the
      spasticity of elbow flexors and wrist, the reflex excitability and the joint kinematics in
      Stroke.

      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized experimental study with two intervention groups will be
      performed. Control group (GS): Stretching and experimental group: (GJPS + S): JPS plus S.
      Measurement times: Before the intervention (T0) and immediately post- intervention (T1). The
      outcome variables are muscle tone of elbow, wrist and hand assessed with the Modified
      Ashworth Scale (MAS); H reflex of the Flexor Carpi Radialis muscle, latency (ms), duration
      (ms) and amplitude (mV) of the M and H waves, and the amplitude the Hmax / Mmax ratio (%).
      Shoulder, elbow and trunk angles (degrees), trunk displacement (cm) and duration (sec) of the
      Functional Reach Pattern (PAF) will be evaluated with the software Contemplas.

      ANALYSIS: Descriptive statistics will be applied and Shapiro Wilk test to evaluate the
      normality of the variables. Intra-group differences will be assessed with the student t-test
      paired and intergroup with the student t-test unpaired or the sum of Wilcoxon rank according
      to the distribution of the variables.

      EXPECTED RESULTS: Hypotheses and contributions to the scientific evidence on the immediate
      effect of the S and JPS will be generated, to support the JPS as a complement to the
      traditional treatment. The results will be socialized in an international scientific event
      and a publication will be submitted to an impact journal.
