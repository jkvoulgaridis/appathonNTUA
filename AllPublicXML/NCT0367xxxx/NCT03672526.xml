  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A low injection pressure is one of the safety elements to check the correct position of the
      needle during regional anesthesia. Subjective assessment of pressure during manual injection
      of local anesthetic is most commonly used. In adults, the monitoring of the injection
      pressure has already been evaluated and makes it possible to objectify the pressure of the
      injection pressure. This is possible thanks to a device named Compuflo. No study has measured
      injection pressures during a regional anesthesia in children. The main objective is to
      control the injection pressures exercised in daily clinical practice during pediatric
      regional anesthesia with the Compuflo. Regional anesthesia will be proposed and explained
      during the anesthesia consultation. The procedure will be performed according to the habits
      of the anesthesiologist in charge of the patient. Only the addition of the Local Anesthetic
      Injection Pressure monitoring (Compuflo) to the needle changes the usual setup.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usual practice using Compuflo, allowing the
      continuous measurement of the injection pressure of the local anesthetic at the needle level.
      On the day of the surgery, an anesthesiologist &quot;operator&quot; will realize the echo-guided
      regional anesthesia, qualifying aloud every injection realized (site or compartment of
      injection, and volume injected). An &quot;observer&quot; anesthesiologist will note the demographic
      data (age and weight), then the material data (minimum stimulation intensity, type and size
      of needles and syringes used), and finally he will note the maximum pressure levels reached
      during the injections performed.
