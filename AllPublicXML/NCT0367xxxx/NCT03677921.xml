  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of
      Bio-Germanium for the evaluation of efficacy on immune function and immune cell activation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate Bio-Germanium's efficacy on immune function and immune cell
      activation in healthy volunteers by assessing improvements in certain immune indices (i.e. NK
      cell activity, WBC, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IgG1, IgG2, IgM, IL-2, 6, 12).
