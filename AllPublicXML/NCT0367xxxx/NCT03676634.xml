  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2, open-label, uncontrolled study designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, and
      immunogenicity of a single dose of rBV A/B in healthy participants previously immunized with
      pentavalent botulinum toxoid (or pentavalent botulinum toxoid and rBV A/B) for occupational
      protection will be conducted to collect source plasma for potential use in the production of
      BabyBIG and to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine in these participants over a
      12-week period, with a follow-up safety assessment at 6 months.
