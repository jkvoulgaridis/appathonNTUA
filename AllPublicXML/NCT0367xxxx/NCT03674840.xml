  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to compare postoperative optical quality between two different implanting
      position of a rotationally asymmetric MIOL [SBL-3 Lenstec; +3.00 diopters (D)], angle kappa
      based implantation and 0 to 180 degree implantation, in order to find out the optimal
      implantation position for SBL-3.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SBL-3 has been proved to provide patients with good near, intermediate and distant visual
      acuity, but there is not much study on the impact of SBL-3 position on postoperative visual
      acuity.The regional refractive design of SBL-3 means it could be affected by pupil center
      shift (described by angle kappa: the difference between visual axis and pupil axis), the
      investigators assume that maintaining the ideal ratio of distant and near segment(50% vs 42%)
      in the pupil center could yield both good distant and near postoperative visual acuity
      postoperatively. Therefore, the investigators designed the implantation by placing the IOL
      based on angle kappa to make sure the ratio of distant and near segment exposure in the pupil
      center close to 50:42. In this study, the investigators assessed the optical quality in
      patients with SBL-3 implantation based on angle kappa and 0 to 180 degree to provide surgeons
      with information for choosing appropriate implantation position for optimum postoperative
      satisfaction of SBL-3.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Uncorrected visual acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of uncorrected distance visual acuity (UCVA), intermediate visual acuity, near visual acuity were measured at 5m, 80cm and 33cm respectively. All visual acuity measurements were conducted under photopic conditions (85 cd/m2) and at 100% contrast in design group and control group.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Optical quality</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>An OPD scan III aberrometer (NIDEK Co. Ltd., Gamagori, Japan) was used to evaluate postoperative mesopic and photopic pupil diameters and the quality of vision in each subject. Visual acuity was evaluated by MTF(modulation transfer function), SR(strehl ratio), intraocular total aberration, high order aberration, spherical aberration, coma aberration, trefoil aberration under 4mm pupil diameter.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Contrast sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Contrast sensitivity measures were conducted uniocularly, under photopic, mesopic (5 cd/m2), photopic with glare and mesopic with glare conditions, with the OPTEC 6500 contrast sensitivity test (Stereo Optical, USA). Contrast sensitivity was evaluated at five spatial frequencies (1.5, 3, 6, 12, and 18 cycles per degree [cpd]). Patients were allowed 5 minutes to adapt to each illumination level before testing.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Defocus curve</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Monocular defocus curves were obtained in all patients, positioned at 5m under photopic (&gt;85 cd/m 2 ) condition to measure the visual acuity with each defocus lens, representing the consecutive visual function of each eye. Negative lenses were added in 0.50 D steps and the visual acuity was recorded for each type of defocus level. The procedure was then repeated but with positive lenses. The range of defocus evaluated was from -4.00D to +2.00D.</description>
