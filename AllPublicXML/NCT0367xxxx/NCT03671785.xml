    <measure>Microbiome Diversity in Fecal Samples as Indicated by the Shannon Diversity Index</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Shannon diversity index is used to characterize species diversity in a community. Shannon's index accounts for both abundance and evenness of the species present. A high index value would represent a diverse and equally distributed community, and lower values represent a less diverse community. A value of 0 would represent a community with just one species. Typical values are generally between 1.5 and 3.5.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Parkinson's disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) is a 39 questions self-completed questionnaire that comprises 8 domains: mobility (10 items), activities of daily living (6 items), emotional well-being (6 items), stigma (4 items), social support (3 items), cognition (4 items), communication (3 items) and bodily discomfort (3 items). All items are assumed to impact Quality of Life (QoL) and must be answered to compute scores for each dimension. Questions are answered based on experiences from the preceding month using a 5-point ordinal scoring system: 0 = never, 1 = occasionally, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often, 4 = always. Overall score ranges from 0 = never have difficulty to 100 = always have difficulty. For each of the 8 domains, the domain score is the sum of scores in the domain divided by the maximum possible score of all items in the domain, multiplied by 100. The overall score is the sum of all 8 domain scores divided by 8.</description>

    <description>Smart Pill will be used to assess gastrointestinal dysmotility in PD patients before and after 12- week treatment. Smart Pill will be administered first during the run-In period clinic visit and again at Week 13 clinic visit following the completion of 12-week treatment. After an overnight fast, subjects will ingest the Smart Pill capsule with a nutrient bar (Smart Bar, 243 kcal) and will be instructed to wear a data receiver for 5 days or until the expulsion of the Smart Pill. After expulsion of the Smart Pill in approximately 5 days, subject will return the data receiver. Data receiver can either be dropped by or mailed via FedEx to the study site. Changes in gastric emptying time (GET), small bowel transit time (SBTT), colon transit time (CTT), small/ large bowel transit time (SLBTT) and whole gut transit time (WGTT) will be assessed by parameters established by the company providing the Smart Pill capsule.</description>
