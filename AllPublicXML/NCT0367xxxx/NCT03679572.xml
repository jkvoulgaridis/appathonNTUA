  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with renal cancer are commonly treated by robot-assisted partial nephrectomy. Renal
      artery clamping is commonly required inducing kidney ischemia during surgery. It impacts
      parenchymal and renal function. This study aims to compare a new surgical procedure in order
      to reduce ischemia effect and preserve renal function after partial nephrectomy for renal
      tumour.
