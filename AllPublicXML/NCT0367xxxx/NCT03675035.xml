  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery is the only effective treatment for morbid obesity and can be divided into
      restrictive surgeries (Lap Band and Sleeve gastrectomy), malabsorptive surgeries (Biliary
      pancreatic deviation and duodenal switch) or a combination of both (RYGBP).

      This later technique is the most common and most effective surgical procedure performed
      worldwide and has been processed to be an effective treatment of morbid obesity and its
      complications, achieving excess weight loss of 65 to 80 % ; 1-2 years after surgery.1
      However, after the initial weight loss induced by RYGBP; 50 % of patients regain some weight
      2 and approximately 20 % of the patients will reach again a BMI of 35 at 10 years , defined
      as a failure rate.3 The reasons for weight regain are multiple but the most two potential
      contributing factors are related with the loss of the restrictive effect of the RYGBP by
      stretching of the gastric pouch and/or the gastrojejunal anastomosis (GJA), leading to
      increased satiety.

      Surgical options available for treating weight regain after RYGBP include placement of
      adjustable gastric band, Redo of the anastomosis or Reconstruction of the pouch.4 These
      procedures are technically difficult especially in patients who had previous single or
      multiple surgical interventions leading to a morbidity of around 15 % and a mortality of 1 %;
      Which is twice the one of the original surgery. This justifies the interest in less invasive,
      peroral revisions that include injection of sclerosant or suturing the anastomosis using
      Endoluminal gastroplication device (EndoCinch; Bard) 5,6 They have been however of marginal
      effectiveness compared to the medical treatment may be because their effect is limited to the
      anastomosis and doesn't reduce the size of the stretched gastric pouch. StomaphyX
      (Endogastric Solutions, Redmond, WA) is another systems aiming to reduce the gastric pouch
      has proved initial efficacy but are disappointing on the long term by a lack of persistence
      of the plicators. 7, 8 Endomina (Endo Tools Therapeutics, Nivelles, Belgium) is CE mark robot
      driven device that may be attached to an endoscope inside the body and allows remote
      manipulation of the arms of devices during a peroral intervention. It offers the
      possibilities of making transoral surgical full thickness sutures and may allow performing,
      via a transoral route, an intervention combining anastomoses reduction and gastric pouch
      reduction. It might be an effective treatment option for patients regaining weight after
      RYGBP and having a stretched pouch and or anastomosis.
