      The Study evaluates the role of low dose epinephrine boluses in management of acute
      hypo-tension VS The Traditional management of acute hypo-tension.

      Half of the participants suffering from acute hypo-tension will receive low dose epinephrine
      boluses (≤ 5 µg/kg/dose) and the other half will receive traditional management of shock

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epinephrine, due to its alpha-1 and beta-adrenergic effects, is considered an important part
      of the management of children with hypo-tension. Epinephrine is typically used as a
      continuous infusion (0.02-0.5 μg/kg/min) for severe sustained hypo-tension and as a bolus
      (0.01 mg/kg, maximum dose = 1 mg) for bradycardia, asystole, or pulse-less arrest. There are,
      however, clinical conditions that may benefit from smaller doses of bolus epinephrine. For
      example, brief periods of hypo-tension during medical procedures, intermittent hemodynamic
      instability, and augmentation of low blood pressure in a pre-arrest condition. While a
      resuscitation (or code) dose of epinephrine would be inappropriate (as it would cause an
      unacceptable large increase in blood pressure and heart rate [HR]), a smaller dose may be
      particularly useful.

      Low-dose bolus vasopressors have been used for decades by anaesthesiologists to prevent
      post-re-perfusion injury after solid organ transplant, control cerebral oxygenation during
      anaesthesia and manage acute hypo-tension during spinal surgery. Recently, use of bolus dose
      phenyl-ephrine has been described in the emergency department setting to augment blood
      pressure during periods of hypo-tension surrounding intubation. Finally, free open access
      medical publications have provided some insight into using bolus dose pressors for acute
      hypotensive episodes in adults. However, there is few published data describing the use of
      low-dose vasopressor boluses in children.

    <description>Initial resuscitation: Push boluses of 20 cc/kg isotonic saline or colloid up to and over 60 cc/kg until perfusion improves or unless rales or hepatomegaly develop
Fluid refractory shock: Begin inotrope IV/IO. Use atropine/ketamine IV/IO/IM to obtain central access and airway if needed. Reverse cold shock by titrating central dopamine or, if resistant, titrate central epinephrine. Reverse warm shock by titrating central norepinephrine.
Catecholamine resistant shock: Begin hydrocortisone if at risk for absolute adrenal insufficiency.</description>
