  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of Periodontal Structure Repair device (PSR)
      compared to conventional periodontal therapy (scaling and root planing) for the treatment of
      periodontal pockets caused by periodontal disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open, active comparator-controlled study with
      a parallel group, subject-paired design (i.e. the effect of both treatments can be observed
      in the same subject).

      Subjects must have two quadrants of their mouth that each have at least two teeth with one or
      more pockets per tooth that are 5-8 mm in depth. Subjects having more than 2 quadrants will
      have the first 2 quadrants randomized to receive two different treatments (one quadrant root
      planing and one quadrant PSR procedure) from the group of available quadrants.

      Investigators will assess the efficacy of the Periodontal Structure Repair device (PSR) as
      measured by a reduction in pocket depth.

    <masking_description>The assessments of efficacy measurements of pocket depth and attachment gain CAL will be performed by a dental professional staff member at the investigator site who is blinded to which procedure was performed in each quadrant. Whenever possible, the same staff member will make these assessments throughout the study. The pocket depth assessments will be performed by a dental professional who has been trained on the actual method. Personnel will be trained to use the University of North Carolina (UNC) probe by the central trainer provided by the sponsor or CRO.</masking_description>

    <description>Following local anesthesia, initial pocket preparation will be done by bur abrasion utilizing specially designed burs to plane the root surface and remove the inner lining of the pocket. Following bur abrasion, thin strips of gauze sponge are placed into the created space. After removing the gauze strips, PSR is inserted to fill the spaces beginning at the pocket bottom. The final step is placing a layer of cyanoacrylate on both the gingival margin and tooth supragingivally.</description>
