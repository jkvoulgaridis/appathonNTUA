    <textblock>
      This study will explore 2 different doses of inotuzumab ozogamicin including the dose that is
      approved and a lower dose. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a dose of
      inotuzumab ozogamicin, lower than the approved dose, could be recommended for adult patient
      with relapsed or refractory ALL who may be at higher risk for severe liver problems after
      inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment and stem cell transplant (a potentially curative therapy that
      can replace cancer cells with healthy cells). Efficacy and safety of the 2 doses will be
      evaluated.

    <intervention_model_description>The study will be conducted in 2 phases: a run in phase and a randomized phase.
Run in phase: a total of up to 22 patients will be enrolled to receive the starting dose of 1.2 mg/m2/cycle (dose level 2). A Simon Two Stage optimal design will be used. If acceptable efficacy (CR/CRi and MRD negativity) is observed in the run in phase, the study will enter the randomized phase.
Randomized phase: if acceptable efficacy is observed in the run in phase, the study will enter the randomized phase. A total of approximately 80 patients will be randomized (1:1) to 1 of 2 dose levels of inotuzumab ozogamicin (40 patients per dose level).</intervention_model_description>
