  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This longitudinal study aims to countervail age-related cognitive and cerebral decline in
      healthy retired people through intensive piano / keyboard music practice in Switzerland and
      Germany.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent data suggest that music making might prevent cognitive decline in the elderly.
      However, experimental evidence remains sparse and no information on the neurophysiological
      basis has been provided, although cognitive decline is a major impediment to healthy aging.
      This study combines for the first time protocolled music practice in elderly with
      cutting-edge neuroimaging. The investigators propose a multi-site Hannover-Geneva
      longitudinal randomized intervention study in altogether 100 retired healthy elderly (64-76)
      years, 70 Geneva, 100 Hannover), offering either piano instruction or instruction on musical
      culture for one year. Participants will be tested at 3 time points on cognitive, perceptual
      and motor abilities as well as via wide-ranging functional and structural neuroimaging data
      (Magnetic Resonance Imaging, MRI). The research team expects positive transfer effects from
      intensive piano training not only on subjective well-being, but also on executive functions,
      working memory, hearing in noise and relationships of these behavioral features with
      morphological and functional brain plasticity. This study may therefore for the first time be
      demonstrate, that music making can provoke important societal impacts by diminishing
      cognitive and perceptual-motor decline underpinned by functional and structural brain
      plasticity.
