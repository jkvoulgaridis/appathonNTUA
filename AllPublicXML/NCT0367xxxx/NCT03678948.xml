  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the changes in clinical and imaging outcomes
      following arthroscopic treatment of chondral lesion(s) by Radiofrequency-Based debridement or
      Mechanical Debridement in subjects 18-50 years of age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-inferiority, prospective, single blinded, randomized, single-center study
      design with enrollment of 82 randomized subjects (to assure 70 subjects complete the study).
      The sample size of 82 participants was calculated from a power analysis. The study was
      powered to detect at least a seven point change in KOOS pain score based on achieving 80%
      statistical power to detect a non-inferiority margin. Study duration will be until the last
      subject enrolled reaches 52 weeks post-operative.

      The 82 randomized subjects will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio into the Werewolf Coblation wand
      treatment group or mechanical debridement treatment group. Subjects will be blinded to their
      treatment assignment until they complete all study visits. Upon withdraw from the study,
      termination from the study, or new or recurrent symptoms requiring a subsequent arthroscopy,
      the blinded assignment will be revealed to the subject.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Knee and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores (KOOS) activity subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at week 52 post-op</time_frame>
    <description>The previous week is the time period considered when answering the questions. Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question is assigned a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at week 52 post-op</time_frame>
    <description>Using a ruler, the score is determined by mea-suring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Marx Activity Rating Scale (MARS)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at week 52 post-op</time_frame>
    <description>MARS includes 4 items that assess the frequency of running, cutting, decelerating, and pivoting based on the subjects &quot;healthiest and most active state in the past year.&quot; A higher score indicates more functional demand on the knee joint and potentially a higher risk of injury. Each item is scored on a 5-point ordinal scale ranging from 0 (less than 1 time in a month) to 4 (4 or more times in a week), and the total scale score is obtained by summing the individual items' scores (range, 0-16).</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at week 52 post-op</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline MRI will be compared to MRI at 52 weeks to evaluate knee morphology, cartilage signal, osteophytes, bone marrow edema, subarticular cysts, effusions and loose bodies. The international cartilage repair score will be used.</description>

    <description>In this process, radiofrequency energy is used to excite the water molecules in a conductive medium, such as an electrolyte (saline) solution, to generate excited radicals within precisely focused plasma. The energized particles in the plasma have sufficient energy to break molecular bonds (16-18), excising or dissolving (i.e. ablating) soft tissue at relatively low temperatures (typically 40ºC to 70ºC).</description>
