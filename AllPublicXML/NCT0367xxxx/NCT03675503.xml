  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project proposes to evaluate the potential for nurses to assess if a patient who uses an
      ambulatory aid at home is fit to use one in the hospital, and the effect that providing
      ambulatory aids to hospitalized patients will have on reducing hospital falls, with a matched
      pair cluster-randomized controlled trial.

      Hypothesis 1: Of the patients who use an ambulatory aid at home, patients who receive an
      ambulatory aid in the hospital will have a lower fall rate as compared to patients who do not
      receive an ambulatory aid in the hospital.

      Hypothesis 2: After adequate training, nurses will be able to accurately assess whether or
      not patients need an ambulatory aid when compared to the gold-standard assessments of
      physical therapists.

      This research project proposes to study the effectiveness of a specific falls prevention
      intervention in a high risk population by providing ambulatory aids upon admission to the
      hospital to patients who previously used one at home after a standardized evaluation by a
      Registered Nurse. This will be a randomized controlled trial within three hospitals in a
      large academic medical center.

      Primary Objectives:

      Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the effectiveness in preventing falls by providing an ambulatory aid
      to patients who use an ambulatory aid at home, and who are deemed fit to use the device in
      the hospital by their nurse.

      Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the nurses' ability to assess the appropriateness of providing an
      ambulatory aid, such as a cane or walker, to a patient who uses an assistive device at home.
