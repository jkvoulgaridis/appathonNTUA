      This study will add:

      Finding out an association between Protein S activity and unexplained female infertility.

      Aim:

      Study hypothesis:

      In women with unexplained infertility protein S activity may be low.

      Study question:

      In women with unexplained infertility does protein S activity low?.

      This study aims to assess the activity of protein S activity in women with unexplained
      infertility.

      Objectives:

      The main objective of this study is:

      To determine the prevalence of Protein S activity with unexplained female infertility and to
      compare its prevalence in fertile women among women attending outpatient clinics at Ain Shams
      University Maternity Hospital.

      1. Type of Study: Case Control Study.

        2. Study Setting: Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital: outpatient Infertility clinic
           and outpatient gynecology clinic.

        3. Study Population: The study will include women with unexplained infertility (Group 1;
           cases) and fertile women who got pregnant and delivered at least once in the previous
           year with no history of recurrent abortions nor history of secondary infertility (Group
           2; control).

      Group 1: Will include 30 women with unexplained primary infertility; will be recruited from
      the outpatient infertility clinic.

      Group 2; another 30 fertile women who got pregnant and delivered at least once in the
      previous year with no history of recurrent abortions; will recruited from outpatient
      gynecology clinic as control.

      According to inclusion and exclusion criteria listed below.

      Inclusion criteria:

        1. Age: 18 - 35 years old.

        2. Normal husband's semen analysis, (WHO criteria):

             1. Count ≥ 15 million/ml.

             2. Motility: ≥ 40%

             3. Morphology: ≥ 4% normal morphology.

        3. Documented ovulation.

        4. Normal Follicle Stimulating Hormone, Luteinizing Hormone, Thyroid Stimulating Hormone,
           serum prolactin.

        5. Patent Fallopian tubes.

        6. Normal uterine cavity.

      Exclusion criteria:

        1. Patients aged less than 18 years or more than 35 years old.

        2. Secondary infertility

        3. Presence of male factor infertility

        4. Anovulatory cycles.

        5. Tubal block; Tubal disease is an important cause of infertility and should be
           speciﬁcally excluded.

        6. Medical disorder that might affect pregnancy (e.g.: Diabetes, Thyroid dysfunction)

        7. Patients with recurrent abortion.
