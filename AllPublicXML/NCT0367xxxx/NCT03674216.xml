  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the U.S. CF Foundation Patient Registry, more than 25% of children and 40% of
      adults were treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics for flares of lung disease in 2016.
      Medication for these flares is often delivered through a peripherally inserted central
      catheter (PICC). Case series have identified important complications of PICCs in CF patients
      such as blood clots and infection. The frequency of PICC-associated blood clots in CF
      patients ranges from 2 to 8%. Catheter-related complications may interfere with completion of
      therapy and lead to repeated procedures and other complex medical treatments. In some cases
      PICC complications may discourage patients from accepting future courses of IV antibiotics.
      Therefore, it is very important to identify patient- and device-related factors that are
      linked with more frequent complications and to figure out ways to reduce these risks.
      Proposed risk factors fall into several broad categories. First are catheter-related factors;
      second are patient factors; and third are catheter-management factors. To date, no
      multicenter trial has carefully studied PICC complications in a large group of adult and
      pediatric CF patients from the time each catheter is placed to when it is removed. The main
      purpose of this study is to see whether the investigators can identify important factors in
      each of the three categories (patient, catheter, and catheter management) that are linked to
      various complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to data from the U.S. CF Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR), more than 25% of
      children and 40% of adults were treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics for pulmonary
      exacerbations (PEx) in 2016; this translated to 20,286 care episodes. Case series have
      identified important complications of PICCs and TIVADs in CF patients such as deep venous
      thrombosis (DVT) and infection; central venous stenosis; and other types of mechanical
      dysfunction. The incidence of PICC-associated DVT in CF patients ranges from 2 to 8%.
      Proposed risk factors in CF patients fall into several broad categories. First are
      catheter-related factors: larger catheter size, number of catheter lumens, and catheter
      composition; second are patient factors: lung function, nutritional status, respiratory
      flora, diabetes status, thrombophilia; and number of previously placed catheters; and third
      are catheter-management factors: insertion technique and site selection, inpatient versus
      outpatient care, anticoagulant use, blood sampling practices, and duration of line use. The
      importance of some of these factors remains controversial, leading some to call for detailed
      prospective studies of PICC use in specific patient populations. To date, no multicenter
      trial has prospectively studied PICC and midline complications in adult and pediatric CF
      patients. The investigators hypothesize that the rate of PICC and midline vascular
      complications is associated with specific patient level and line level factors as well as
      with line insertion and management practices. The proposed trial is a multicenter,
      prospective surveillance study to evaluate (patient level-, catheter level- and catheter
      management-) risk factors associated with various complications of PICCs and midlines in
      pediatric and adult CF patients.
