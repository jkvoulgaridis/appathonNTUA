  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite being effective, the majority of people who would benefit from using hearing aids do
      not access them. For those who do obtain hearing aids, around 20% do not wear them regularly.
      People often do not use their hearing aids because they continue to experience difficulties
      when listening to and understanding speech in noisy situations.

      Conventional hearing aids must be programmed and adjusted by a trained audiologist with
      specialist equipment and therefore provide limited user-control over the hearing aid's
      functionality. In comparison to conventional hearing aids, Smartphone-connected hearing aids
      enable patients to adjust their programmes themselves in different situations using a
      Smartphone application. Smartphone-connectivity can supplement clinical practices, as
      patients can adjust their hearing aids without the need to visit the clinic. This has the
      potential to empower patients to be actively involved in their own hearing healthcare.

      A systematic review assessing the effectiveness of alternative listening devices showed that
      there is no published high-quality research assessing the clinical effectiveness of
      Smartphone-connected hearing aids. Furthermore, a usability research study has shown that
      patients want to personalise and adjust their own HA programmes to meet their individual
      needs. Having carried out the early development work, the next step would be to carry out a
      study to evaluate smartphone-connected hearing aids, in accordance with the MRC guidelines on
      developing and evaluating complex interventions.

      This study will assess the benefits of a smartphone application, eAdjust that has been
      developed for use with Phonak Audeo B90-Direct hearing aids. The eAdjust app connects to the
      hearing aid via Bluetooth, and enables hearing aid users to fine-tune their hearing aids via
      their smartphone. The benefits of the eAdjust app will be assessed in the real-world as well
      as in the laboratory. A mixed methods approach will be taken, using both behavioural and
      patient reported outcomes.
