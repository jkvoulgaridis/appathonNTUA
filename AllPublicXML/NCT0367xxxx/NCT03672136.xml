    <description>Radiotherapy: Thoracic radiotherapy dose will be 2.0Gy per day, given 5 days a week, to cumulative dose of 60～66Gy. If radiotherapy and chemotherapy are conducted in the same day, chemotherapy should be priority to radiotherapy.
Chemotherapy: Platinum based dual drug regime determined by researcher.After finishing concurrent chemoradiotherapy, there is no need of maintenance chemotherapy.
Anlotinib: Combined with 12mg/d QD Anlotinib on the first, second weeks and fourth, fifth weeks of radiotherapy, that is on the day1~14, day22~36.
Maintenance therapy: One month after finishing concurrent chemoradiotherapy, 12mg/d QD Anlotinib can be administrated, each cycle is defined as 2 weeks on-treatment followed by 1 week off-treatment. The treatment can continue until disease progression or treatment intolerance, but should not exceed 24 months.
During the course of study, it's not allowed to receive other anti-tumor therapy.</description>
