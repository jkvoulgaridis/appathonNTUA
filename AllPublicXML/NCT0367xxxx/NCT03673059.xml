    <textblock>
      This was a multi-center, 14-day clinical use study with a 7-day regression period, being
      conducted to assess the changes in the skin microbiome with two moisturizers in female and
      male subjects 16-50 years of age with mild to moderate eczema that experienced a recent itch
      flare up.

      In this study, subjects were divided into two groups, one group was supplied with a test
      product containing an over-the-counter (OTC) drug monographed ingredient for treatment of
      eczema. The other group was supplied with a cosmetic test product which is a standard dry
      skin daily moisturizer. Both groups were also provided with a cosmetic test cleanser to use
      in place of their normal cleanser. Subjects used the products for 14 days, followed by a
      7-day regression period (no product use).

      Subjects were assessed at Baseline and at Day 1, Day 3, Day 7, and Day 14 of product use.
      They were assessed again 7 days after stopping product use. Only the group provided with the
      test product containing the monograph ingredient for treatment of eczema were assessed for
      eczema endpoints after the Baseline visit.

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in total EASI score at Day 14. Group A only. The EASI scoring system provides a score that reflects the severity of clinical signs of eczema based on the percentage of affected area in each of 4 body regions - the head/neck, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each body region is scored for 4 parameters: erythema, edema, excoriations, and lichenification on a 0 (none) to 3 (severe) scale. The score for these parameters is summed and then multiplied by a constant that reflects the relative body area of that body region (head/neck = 0.10; trunk = 0.30; upper extremities = 0.20, lower extremities = 0.40). The total EASI score is calculated as a sum of the scores for the 4 individual body regions. The total possible score ranges from 0 (no eczema anywhere on the body) to 72 (severest eczema symptoms on all body areas).</description>
