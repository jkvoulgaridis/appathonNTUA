  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was performed in urology patients elicited for open prostatectomy or open
      nephrectomy. Comparison of analgesic effect between group (M) with spinal morphine before
      general anaesthesia and group without this intervention was measured.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients elicited for open prostatectomy or open nephrectomy were randomly divided in 2
      groups. Group M were administered preservative-free morphine 250 mcg in 2.5 ml NS intrathecal
      using 25 G needle in L1/2 - L5/S1 interspaces. Control group (C) were given no intervention.
      Placebo intrathecal injection in C was not used because of ethical reason. Standard general
      anaesthesia was used in both groups. After surgery all patients were transferred to urology
      ICU and were given standard analgesic regimen according to level of pain measured by numeric
      rating scale (NRS) 0 - 10: NRS &gt; 3 metamizol 1 g IV every 6 h., max. 4 g/24 h., NRS &gt; 3
      paracetamol 1g IV every 6 h., max. 4 g/24 h., NRS &gt; 3 lasting 30 min. after administration of
      previous ones diclofenac 75 mg IM á 12 h., max. 150 mg/24 h., NRS &gt; 4 morphine 10 mg SC á 6
      h. Personnel of ICU was blinded to the analgesic method used.

      Noticed parameters: pain intensity (NRS), time to NRS ≥ 4, time to the first morphine
      request, side effects (respiratory rate &lt;8, SpO2&lt;90 %, nausea, vomiting, naloxone
      administration for SpO2&lt;88 %, itching).

      Standard statistical analysis was used, p value &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.
