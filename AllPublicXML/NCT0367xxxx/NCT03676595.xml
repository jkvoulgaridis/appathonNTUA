    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the effects of interactive video game-based exercise (IVGB) on balance
      in diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy. Twenty-four patients were randomly assigned
      to two groups (12 participants per group). Group A received IVGB training for the first 6
      weeks, with no exercise in the subsequent 6 weeks. Group B had no exercise for the first 6
      weeks and then underwent IVGB training in the subsequent 6 weeks. Both subjective and
      objective measures were used to determine whether IVGB exercise improves balance function.

    <textblock>
      Participants in Group A received IVGB intervention for the first 6 weeks (intervention
      phase), with no exercise in the subsequent 6 weeks (control phase), whereas participants in
      Group B received no IVGB intervention in the first 6 weeks (control phase), followed by 6
      weeks of IVGB intervention (intervention phase). The IVGB intervention protocol consisted of
      30-minute training sessions comprising four tasks designed to focus on lower limb strength,
      balance, and coordination training. Balance assessments consisted of both subjective and
      objective measures, including the Modified Falls Efficacy Scale (MFES), Time Up and Go (TUG)
      test, Berg Balance Scale (BBS), and Unipedal Stance Test (UST). For all participants, these
      tests were conducted at weeks 0, 6, and 12 of the experiment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Berg Balance Scale (BBS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes/session; measured at weeks 0, 6, and 12 of the experiment</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of 14 functional tasks of varying difficulty, including sitting, standing, changing posture, transfers, reaching forward, retrieving objects, turning, tandem stance, and one-leg stance. It is a valid tool used in both clinical practice and research to evaluate the efficacy of intervention and provide a quantitative description of balance function. The ability to perform each a task is scored on a scale of 0-4, ranging from inability to independently perform the task to successfully completing it, respectively. The maximum possible score for the 14 functional tasks is 56.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Time Up and Go (TUG) test time</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes/session; measured at weeks 0, 6, and 12 of the experiment</time_frame>
    <description>Participants stand up from a 46-cm-high armchair with back support, walk straight for 3 m, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down as quickly and safely as possible. The timing starts when the investigator says &quot;go&quot; and stops when the participant sits back down on the chair. In our study, each participant had three chances to complete the TUG test in each session, and the best result was recorded for each participant.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Modified Falls Efficacy Scale (MFES) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes/session; measured at weeks 0, 6, and 12 of the experiment</time_frame>
    <description>MFES is a 14-item questionnaire related to daily indoor and outdoor physical activities. It is a 10-point visual analog scale of confidence level in completing a particular activity (item) without falling, rated from 0 to 10, where 0 denotes not confident or sure at all, and 10 denotes completely confident or sure. The total score for the 14 items ranges from 0 to 140.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Unipedal Stance Test (UST) time</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes/session; measured at weeks 0, 6, and 12 of the experiment</time_frame>
    <description>Participants raised one leg to the ankle level or higher without touching the other leg or using any assistance and then stood on that leg for as long as possible barefoot and with eyes open. The observer measured the length of time for which participants maintained balance; that is, until they were no longer able to keep the leg raised at or above the ankle level or when both legs touched the ground. The observer stopped counting at 45 seconds, recording this as the time for any participant who maintained balance for a longer time. Each participant performed the test three times for both right and left legs, with the best result for each leg recorded.</description>
