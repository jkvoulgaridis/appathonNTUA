  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot phase II trial studies how well itacitinib works in treating patients with soft
      tissue sarcomas that do not respond to treatment (refractory) and have spread to other parts
      of the body (advanced/metastatic). Itacitinib may cause changes in the immune system and the
      body's immune response to cancer, which may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive itacitinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 7 and 30 days, every 12
      weeks from baseline for up to 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.
