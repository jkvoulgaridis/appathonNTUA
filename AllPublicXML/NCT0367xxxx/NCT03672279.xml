  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the demographical development, age-related diseases will drastically increase over the
      next decades. To face this healthcare challenge, early and accurate identification of
      cognitive impairment is crucial. The assessment of neurocognitive functioning ideally
      requires a tool that is short, easy to administer and interpret, and has high diagnostic
      accuracy. In this context, the use of computerized test batteries is receiving increasing
      attention. Compared to paper-pencil tests, computerized test batteries have many advantages.
      The possibility to measure reaction times may provide additional information. Moreover, test
      questions are always presented the exact same way, examiner-related bias is eliminated, and
      results are available immediately after examination. Due to the ability to adjust the level
      of difficulty to the performance of the individual, floor and ceiling effects may be
      minimized. Additionally, costs are reduced, and fewer materials and less trained personnel
      are required. Finally, big data approaches and the use of machine learning algorithms are
      becoming more popular in the field of clinical diagnostics, and computerized cognitive test
      batteries may facilitate future data collection to this aim.

      In 2014, we developed a self-administered tablet computer program for the iPad (CogCheck) to
      assess preoperative cognitive functioning in surgery patients.

      The cognitive tests used in the CogCheck application are identical or similar to the
      paper-and-pencil tests that are currently used in dementia diagnostics. Replacing some of the
      paper-and-pencil tests by a computerized test battery may facilitate the routine
      neuropsychological examinations. Thus, we aim to investigate the diagnostic accuracy and
      user-friendliness of CogCheck when applied in a cognitively impaired patient sample. In a
      first step, the diagnostic properties of CogCheck will be investigated by differentiating
      between healthy controls and patients with mild and major neurocognitive disorders (NCD). We
      further aim to investigate the aptness of CogCheck for differential diagnostic by comparing
      the CogCheck performance of different diagnostic patient groups.

      The primary aim of our study is to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of CogCheck for mild
      and major NCD in a German-speaking population.

      Secondary aims are: (1) to examine the user-friendliness of CogCheck, (2) to study the
      CogCheck performance in different patient groups, and (3) to compare the diagnostic
      properties of CogCheck with the ones of the currently used paper-and-pencil tests.
