      This prospective randomized controlled clinical Trial will be performed in patients with
      locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The objectives of the trial
      are to compare the efficacy and safety of Capecitabine treatment with placebo as adjuvant
      therapy to patients who have received radiotherapy.
