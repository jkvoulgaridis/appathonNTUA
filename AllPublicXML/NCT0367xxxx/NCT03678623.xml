  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional and prospective cohort study using a biopsychosocial approach to
      investigate office workers at risk of standing-induced musculoskeletal pain. The purpose of
      this study is to determine which factors are associated with developing or worsening of
      musculoskeletal pain (changes in the Visual Analogue Scale from baseline) during a 60 minute
      standing paradigm.

      Background/rationale

      There is growing national and international evidence for the negative health impact of
      sedentary behaviour at work. A strategy being increasingly adopted to reduce prolonged
      sitting is to spend some of the work day in standing. However, for some adults, prolonged
      standing is associated with the development of musculoskeletal pain. We are investigating
      which factors are associated with developing of musculoskeletal pain during standing when
      using a height-adjustable desk. Previous studies have used an induced-pain paradigm to
      understand risk factors for developing musculoskeletal pain during a prolonged standing task
      that simulates the work environment (standing paradigm). Identifying those office workers who
      are at risk of developing musculoskeletal pain during standing will provide information to
      guide health professionals and individuals in making decisions about optimal workstation
      design.

      Objectives and hypothesis

        -  Cross-sectional study: Identify which factors are associated (demographic, physical,
           psychological and work-related factors) with standing-induced musculoskeletal pain in
           office workers during a standing paradigm.

        -  Prospective cohort study: Identify incidence/prevalence and risk factors of low back
           pain, and disability associated with low back pain in office workers in a 1-year
           prospective cohort.

      Methods

        -  Setting, locations and relevant dates: testing is conducted in the University of
           Queensland (Brisbane, Australia). Data collection commenced in May of 2018 until 30th of
           April of 2019 (cross-sectional study); and follow-up is from June of 2018 until 30th of
           April of 2020 (prospective cohort study).

        -  Participants: recruitment is through posting flyers on campus of The University of
           Queensland; through the weekly electronic university staff newsletter at this
           University; and through Facebook announcements. Interested participants were directed to
           an online questionnaire (hosted by Survey Monkey) to determine eligibility. Participants
           meeting the eligibility criteria were contacted via email to schedule an appointment.

        -  Variables: see &quot;outcomes measures&quot;.

        -  Study size: a convenience sample of 40 office workers will be recruited. Based on
           previous studies that have compared developers and non-developers of standing-induced
           low back pain, this sample size was considered sufficient to detect a significant
           difference in some of the physical outcome measures such as lumbar lordosis (Sorensen et
           al. 2015a); trunk muscle activation (Ringheim et al. 2015) and active hip abduction
           (Nelson-Wong et al. 2008).

        -  Statistical analysis: subjects will be separated into Pain Developers (PDs) and Non-Pain
           Developers (NPDs). A Chi-square analysis or a Fisher's Exact test will be conducted to
           test for differences in the distribution of qualitative and proportional variables in
           PDs and NPDs. Independent groups t-tests, will be conducted to test for differences in
           quantitative variables between PDs and NPDs. A Pearson correlation coefficient and
           one-way analysis of variance test will be conducted to test for differences for average
           Visual Analogue Score (VAS). A simple linear regression analysis will be performed to
           examine the degree to which biopsychosocial variables predict PDs. Statistical analyses
           will be performed in SPSS version 24 (IBM, Armonk, NY).Statistical significance for all
           tests will be set at p ≤ 0.05.

    <measure>Standing Tolerance Test (STT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Standing Tolerance Test consists of participants standing for 1-hour while performing computer tasks using a workstation table.They are required to stand in a confined working area marked on the ground (60x122 cm). During the 1-h period, participants are instructed to adopt a comfortable position that they would normally use if they are to stand for a prolonged period of time. The participant are not allowed to lean on the workstation in any way. The working surface for each participant is adjusted to a height of 5 cm below elbow height. Participants rate their musculoskeletal symptoms intensity on a scale from 0 to 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) prior to the start of, every 15 minutes during, and at the end of the 1-h standing period. Based on their VAS rating for spine, lower and upper limb, they are classified either as a Pain Developers (PDs) if they report a change in VAS of 1 or more from baseline on 0-100 scale (whatever baseline is) or a Non-Pain Developers (NPDs).</description>

    <measure>International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)-Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Questions are about physical activities(PA) (vigorous, moderate, walking) that people do as part of their everyday lives; and about the time they spent being physically active in the last 7-days. Values are computed for walking(W), moderate-intensity-activities(M), vigorous-intensity-activities(V) and a combined total physical activity score. Scores are expressed in MET-minutes/week (METs). The following values are used for the analysis: W=3.3 METs; M=4.0 METs; V=8.0 METs. There are 3 levels of PA proposed to classify populations: Low: individuals who not meet criteria for categories 2 or 3. Moderate: a)3 or more days of V of at least 20 min per day; b)5 or more days of M and/or W of at least 30-min per day; c)5 or more days of any combination of W, M or V achieving a minimum total PA of at least 600-METs.

    <measure>Quality of life related to health: SF12 questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>SF12 questionnaire. This questionnaire ask about the generic health status in 8 domains: physical function, role physical, body pain, general health, vitality, social function, role emotional and mental health. It is a shorter version of SF-36.
Physical and Mental Health Composite Scores (PCS &amp; MCS) are computed using the scores of twelve questions and range from 0 to 100, where a zero score indicates the lowest level of health measured by the scales and 100 indicates the highest level of health. Both Physical and Mental Health Composite Scales combine the 12 items in such a way that they compare to a national norm with a mean score of 50.0 and a standard deviation of 10.0.
A positive score means the person is healthier than average. A negative score means a person is less healthy than average.</description>

    <measure>Prevalence of musculoskeletal pain: Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>An abbreviated version of NMQ is used, which consists of a rear view of the human body, divided into 9 anatomical regions (3 each on the upper limbs, spine and lower limbs), asking about presence of musculoskeletal pain during the last year, the last month and today.
All response options are dichotomous (yes/no). Questions are ordered in such a way that those relating to the respondents' last year are asked first, followed by prevalence questions about last month and today. Key words are highlighted in bold. Respondents are asked to answer all questions for a body region before progressing to the next region (ie, horizontally rather than vertically). If the respondent answer no for question relating to annual prevalence, they are directed to go on to the next body region and all remaining questions for that region are automatically coded as negative responses.</description>
