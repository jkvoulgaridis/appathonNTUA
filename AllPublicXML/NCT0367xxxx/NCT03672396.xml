  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm, multi-site pilot study aims to evaluate the feasibility of recruiting and
      adherence to a 12 week home-based exercise intervention to be conducted in men with
      metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) receiving androgen deprivation
      therapy (ADT). Thirty patients will be enrolled, with the expectation that 20-25 will
      complete all follow-up measures.

      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the feasibility and adherence to a home-based 12
      week exercise intervention in mCRPC patients receiving ADT. It will also examine if a
      home-based exercise intervention can improve muscle strength, body composition, physical
      function, cardiopulmonary function fatigue, and patient reported outcomes (fatigue,
      depression, quality of life (QoL)). Finally, the effects of the exercise training on
      biomarkers of inflammation and hormonal status and their potential association with changes
      in body composition, physical function, fatigue, depression, and QoL will be explored.

    <measure>Physical Function: 6m Walk</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The time to complete (in sec) the 6m usual 6m usual and rapid walk tests will be performed and short distance gait speed (m/s) will be determined with a lower total time/higher gait speed being indicative of greater physical function.</description>

    <measure>Physical Function: Timed Up and Go</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The time to complete (in sec) the 2.44m (8 ft) timed up and go test will be performed as an indicator of agility, balance, and physical function. A lower total time is indicative of greater performance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Function: Stair Climb</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>

    <measure>Physical Function: 400m Walk</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The time to walk 400m (in sec) will be performed as an indicator of walking endurance and gait speed will be determined.

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Reported Outcomes: Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue will be measure using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue, a 1 page form that uses a rating scale that goes from 0 (no fatigue) to 10 (severe fatigue). It assesses the patient's fatigue levels in the last 7 days. It also measures how usual activities, performing work, walking, relationship, and enjoyment of life are affected by fatigue. A higher score indicates higher levels of perceived fatigue.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Reported Outcomes: Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be measured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P). The FACT-P is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include physical, social, emotional, and functional well-being, along with an assessment of prostate-specific health status. five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items. All of the scales score from 0-4 and and a high scale score represents a higher response level.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Reported Outcomes: Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Depression will be measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, a concise, self-administered 1 page form that categorizes anxiety and depression. The total score goes from 0-21, and scores are categorized from minimal to severe depression/anxiety. Higher total scores indicate greater levels of depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body Composition</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>To report changes in total and regional lean, fat, and bone mass following the intervention. Total Body Composition (measuring lean and fat mass and bone mineral density) will be completed using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) before and after the intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle Size</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle size and architecture will be analyzed using ultrasound of the vastus lateralis of the dominant leg. All assessments will be completed before and after the intervention to determine the muscle size and quality. Higher muscle mass and quality are associated with greater muscle strength, physical function, QoL, and mortality.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Upper and lower body muscle strength will be assessed using the chest and leg presses. Maximal strength is defined as the highest load (kilograms) that the participant can successfully lift one time. Greater maximal strength is associated with greater physical function and QoL.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle Endurance</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Upper and lower body muscle endurance will be assessed using the chest and leg presses. Muscle endurance is the total number of repetitions completed using 70% of maximal load determined during muscle strength testing (outcome 12). Greater muscle endurance are associated with greater physical function and QoL.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiopulmonary Function</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>To report changes in cardiopulmonary function following the intervention. Cardiopulmonary function (VO2 peak) will be assessed using a graded exercise test on a treadmill. Patients will begin the test walking slowly on the treadmill and every two minutes, the grade and speed of the treadmill will be increased in a progressive manner until fatigue occurs. Respiratory gases will be collected throughout the test and analyzed using a metabolic cart to determine oxygen utilization and carbon dioxide production. The maximal oxygen uptake that is recorded will be used as a marker of aerobic fitness.</description>

    <intervention_name>Home-based exercise</intervention_name>
    <description>The intervention consists of aerobic and strength training ~3 times per week for 12 weeks with each session lasting 1 hour. The progressive aerobic exercise will involve walking that varies from from 15 to 30 minutes done 2-4 times per week at an intensity from 40% to 65% of heart rate reserve. Therabands elastic bands will be used to perform 12 to 15 repetitions per exercise. Once a participant can comfortably complete 15 repetitions for all prescribed sets, they will increase resistance by moving up to the next band. The training volume increased from 1 set per exercise on week 1 to 3 sets by week 12.</description>
