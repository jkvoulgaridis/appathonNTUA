  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ankle arthritis is associated with debilitating pain and chronic disability. For the
      treatment of severe ankle arthritis, total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) is one treatment option.
      Postoperative pain management in joint arthroplasty is an ongoing and relevant issue. The
      purpose of this study is to examine if differences exist in postoperative pain control,
      overall patient satisfaction, and use of narcotics using an intra-articular injection in the
      operating room compared with a peripheral nerve block in patients undergoing TAA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-arm, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical study. Use of intra-articular
      injections in TAA are not widely reported in literature; however, they are commonly used
      during total knee arthroplasty's (TKAs). The purpose of this study is to examine if
      differences exist in postoperative pain control, overall patient satisfaction, and use of
      narcotics using the intra-articular injection compared with a peripheral nerve block in
      patients undergoing TAA. Results will contribute to the literature for the best surgical
      practice for pain management following a TAA for ankle arthritis.

      Patients will be randomized to receive one of the following interventions for pain control in
      the operating room:

        1. Intra-articular Injection

        2. Preoperative Peripheral Nerve Block:

      The study aims are:

        -  Aim 1: Determine if intra-articular injection as source of pain control for TAA lowers
           postoperative pain as measured by self-reported narcotic use and pain vs. the peripheral
           nerve block.

        -  Aim 2: Evaluate differences in functional outcomes and health related quality of life
           between intra-articular injections and peripheral nerve block as reported by pre- and
           post-operative patient questionnaires

      Patients who consent to participate will complete study activities pre-operatively, and at 2
      weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 months post-operatively.
