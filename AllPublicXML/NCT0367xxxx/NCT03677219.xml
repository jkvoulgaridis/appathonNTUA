  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve the lumbar puncture (LP) consent process for
      pediatric patients. Though a commonly performed and safe procedure, LP can be
      anxiety-provoking for parents. By using an educational video on a handheld device at the time
      of consent, we hope to improve parent understanding and comfort with the procedure.

      Introduction: Lumbar puncture is a safe procedure commonly performed on pediatric patients
      for a variety of indications. Parents are informed of and consented to this procedure, but
      are often left with concerns and doubts. There are no published studies of the nature of the
      concerns of parents in North America, and no studies examining a process to improve pediatric
      lumbar puncture consent. Here the investigators conduct a randomized control study of a short
      educational video on a handheld device as an adjunct to the formal consent process.

      Methods: 72 patients were enrolled, evenly divided between the control arm and video arm of
      the study. A survey was provided examining four key indices: parent self-rated understanding
      of the procedure, their perception of its safety, their perception of the painfulness and
      their overall comfort with their child undergoing LP. In addition, demographic
      characteristics such as prior experience with LP or epidural, language spoken at home, age of
      the child and indication for lumbar puncture, as well as qualitative information about parent
      concerns were collected.

    <measure>Likert Scale for Parent Understanding, Pain perception, Safety Perception and Comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>within 10 minutes of consent discussion (controls) or viewing the video (video group)</time_frame>
    <description>4 separate Likert scales from 1-10 (1 is low, 10 is high) for each of understanding of procedure, pain perception, safety perception and comfort with procedure, each individual scale will be reported. For understanding, safety and comfort, a higher score represents better outcome, for pain perception a lower score represents better outcome.</description>
