    <textblock>
      To identify preoperative predictive factors for final ureteral section invasion after radical
      cystotomie (RC) and to validate significant factors on an external independent cohort. The
      investigators retrospectively reviewed data of all consecutive RC performed for bladder
      cancer in 2 high-volume institutions. Clinical, pathological, and follow-up data were
      collected prospectively and reviewed retrospectively. Pathological evaluation was performed
      by 2 well-trained uropathologists in each center. Logistic regression analyses were performed
      to identify predictive factors for final ureteral sections involvement. Significant factors
      in cohort A were validated in cohort B. Receiver operating curve and area under curve were
      modeled to evaluate predictive accuracy of the markers

        In cohort A, most patients did not have intraoperative FS examination although it was
        performed in some cases depending on the surgeon's habits (NÂ¼92). All patients had
        intraoperative FS in the validation cohort B. All cystectomies performed for nononcological
        purposes were excluded. All patients had nonmetastatic bladder cancer on preoperative
        computed tomography (CT) scans.
