  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multimodality treatment including surgery and radiotherapy is the current standard of care in
      locally advanced rectal cancer. Most clinical trials comparing short course radiotherapy
      (SCRT) with long course chemoradiotherapy(LCRT) did not find significant differences in
      oncological outcomes and short-term outcomes even though some debates. Recently, Stockholm
      III trial comparing SCRT plus delayed surgery with SCRT plus immediate surgery and LCRT
      demonstrated no differences with respect to short-term outcomes such as complications,
      mortality, and acute toxicity. However, overall quality of life (QoL) after curative
      treatment for rectal cancer is still major concern in both SCRT and LCRT. Furthermore, daily
      hospital visits for 5 weeks may be the cause of the increase of total medical cost due to
      indirect medical expense in patients with LCRT, especially in rural area. SCRT plus
      chemotherapy followed by delayed surgery may have the possibility of reducing total hospital
      costs as well as increasing QoL by proving non-inferiority in terms of perioperative
      outcomes. The present prospective single-arm phase 2 trial was designed to validate the
      efficacy, quality of life and cost effectiveness of preoperative short-course radiotherapy
      plus XELOX chemotherapy followed by delayed surgery for high-risk rectal cancer patient based
      on magnetic resonance imaging.

Short-term outcomes including complications, TME completeness, and tumor response will be investigated. EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire scoring will be used to evaluate QoL during the treatment period and after surgery.

    <description>QOL assessed using EORTC QLQ-CR29 survey form. The EORTC QLQ-CR29 is a 29-item colon and rectum cancer site-specific supplemental module that aims to enhance the sensitivity and specificity for colorectal cancer quality of life measures. The original English version comprises 4 multi-item scales (body image, urinary frequency, blood and mucus in stool, and stool frequency) and 17 functional/symptomatic single-items(anxiety, weight, sexual interest, urinary incontinence, dysuria, abdominal pain, buttock pain, bloating, dry mouth, hair loss, taste, flatulence, fecal incontinence, sore skin, embarrassment, stoma care problem, impotence or dyspareunia), with higher scores indicating better functional or worse symptomatic status. Of these 21 scales or items, only body image, anxiety, weight, and sexual interest are functional domain scales/items, and all the remaining are symptomatic.</description>
