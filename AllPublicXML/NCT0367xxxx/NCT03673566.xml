      This study evaluates the use of a NICU clinical integration system (Dashboard and
      accessories) in improving the quality of care delivered, patient health outcomes, and parent
      and clinician satisfaction. Clinicians will be asked to follow their current standard of care
      practices with the aid of this technology. About half of participants will receive care in
      NICU rooms with the Dashboard installed while the other half will receive standard care
      without the Dashboard.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current NICU environment can be stressful and overwhelming for parents of babies admitted
      and for clinicians caring for the babies. There is a wide range of monitors in a very
      clinical environment that does not take into account the comfort of neonates.

      The Dashboard works in parallel with EHR and systems of record, and provides a cohesive view
      of the patient's status and planned clinical workflow in a single location for both parents
      and staff. Accessories such as environmental sensors and cameras are used to ensure that the
      environment is comfortable and promotes optimal development of the baby. Caregivers can
      educate and coach parents to facilitate integrating them into their infant's care. The NICU
      Dashboard also supports a family view to facilitate education and assist the family in
      tracking core measures and developmental milestones.

    <intervention_model_description>The NICU is divided into two floors. One floor will have the Dashboard installed and serve as the intervention floor, while the other will not have the Dashboard and thus serves as the Control floor. As patients are admitted, they are randomly assigned to a room based on availability. Therefore, intervention and control arms will run in parallel in a quasi-randomized fashion.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Parental Stressor Scale:Newborn Intensive Care Unit (PSS:NICU)</measure>
    <time_frame>Upon signing informed consent (baseline) and within 48 hours of discharge</time_frame>
    <description>For NICU parents 26-item questionnaire broken down into three constructs (Parental Role Alterations, Sights and Sounds of the Unit, and Infant Behavior and Appearance) designed to measure parental perception of stressors arising from the physical and psychosocial environment of the neonatal intensive care unit.
= Not at all stressful (the experience did not cause you to feel upset, tense, or anxious)
= A little stressful
= Moderately stressful
= Very stressful
= Extremely stressful Total score will be calculated by summing each item score and averaged for the group. Each subscale will also be computed by summing the items within the subscale and averaging for each group.
Higher scores represent worse outcomes</description>

    <measure>Neonatal Index of Parent Satisfaction (NIPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 48 hours of discharge</time_frame>
    <description>For NICU parents 30-item questionnaire measuring parents' satisfaction with the care their newborn child receives while in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).

    <measure>System Usability Scale (SUS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months after study initiation (mid-point) and 12 months after study initiation (completion)</time_frame>
    <description>For NICU parents and clinicians 10-item questionnaire with 2 constructs: usability and learnability 5-point Likert-scale (1) strongly disagree to (5) strongly agree The participant's scores for each question added together and then multiplied by 2.5 to convert the original scores of 0-40 to 0-100. Though the scores are 0-100, these are not percentages and should be considered only in terms of their percentile ranking. Based on research, a SUS score above a 68 would be considered above average and anything below 68 is below average, however the best way to interpret your results involves &quot;normalizing&quot; the scores to produce a percentile ranking.</description>

Caregivers educate and coach parents to facilitate integrating them into their infant's care.

    <description>The NICU Dashboard is displayed on a touch screen display mounted to the wall or on a rolling cart that will be placed near the bedside. The Dashboard will integrate information from various hospital/device sources in order to provide clinicians with one location to access and collectively interpret clinical findings and environmental factors. Parents will have their own view on the Dashboard that will allow them view their baby's progress, view educational materials, and have access to other resources at their fingertips.</description>
