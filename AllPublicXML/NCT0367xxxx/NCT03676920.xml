  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this research is to reduce financial toxicity related to the cost of
      cancer treatment in a diverse patient population. The research tests the feasibility of an
      application-based (&quot;app&quot;) communication intervention designed to improve the frequency and
      quality of patient-oncologist treatment cost discussions during clinical interactions, which,
      in turn, should improve other short- and longer-term patient outcomes, including referrals to
      economic support (e.g., social work); efficacy in managing treatment cost; treatment cost
      distress; financial toxicity; and treatment adherence. If successful, this study will result
      in an evidence-based tool that can reduce financial toxicity and improve medical outcomes for
      a diverse patient population.

    <description>If patients think they will be able to pay for the cost of their cancer treatment. This is adapted from a validated 10-item scale (Peterson AM, Harper FW, Albrecht TL, et al. Parent caregiver self-efficacy and child reactions to pediatric cancer treatment procedures. J Pediatr Oncol Nurs. 2014;31(1):18-27.) An example item is: &quot;I am confident I can pay for the costs of my treatment.&quot; Patients will respond to a scale from Strongly Disagree (1) to Strongly Agree (5) with higher values representing a better outcome.</description>

    <description>The extent to which patients are satisfied with any treatment cost discussion they had with their oncologist. This is an investigator-developed 3-item scale.

    <description>The DISCO App is an app-based and patient-focused intervention designed to improve the frequency and quality of patient-oncologist treatment cost discussions. The DISCO App allows patients to provide basic demographic information (e.g., employment status, insurance status, etc), and uses that information to provide patients with an individually-tailored list of treatment cost questions they can ask their provider.</description>
