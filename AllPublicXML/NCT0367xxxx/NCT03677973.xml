  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single- and multiple-ascending dose
      study to investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of AB680 in
      healthy volunteers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AB680 will be administered as single and multiple intravenous doses to the healthy
      volunteers. In each group of 8 participants, 6 will receive AB680 and 2 will receive matching
      placebo.

      The participants will be closely observed to monitor the general tolerability of AB680.
