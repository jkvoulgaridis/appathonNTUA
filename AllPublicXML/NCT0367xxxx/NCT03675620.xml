  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of BFR training on patient reported
      outcome measures and shoulder muscle girth in patients following glenoid labral repair. The
      investigators hypothesize that participants receiving BFR with rehabilitation will have
      greater improvements in patient reported outcome measures and shoulder muscle girth than
      participants who are treated without BFR.

      Patients between the ages of 18 and 55 who had a superior labrum anterior to posterior (SLAP)
      repair, anterior labral repair, anterior capsulorrhaphy, or posterior labral repair will be
      screened for participation in this study. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
      receive standard physical therapy with blood flow restriction training or without blood flow
      restriction. Participants will receive standard of care rehabilitation for labral repair
      regardless of group assignment. The length of each physical therapy session will be
      approximately one hour. The BFR and control group will perform leg press and leg extension
      exercises prior to shoulder strengthening. The resistance for both groups will be set as 30%
      of one repetition maximum (1-RM). The goal will be for the participants to perform 4 sets of
      repetitions sequenced 30, 15, 15, 15 of each exercise, if this is not obtainable then the
      number of set/repetitions will be decreased. The lower extremity strengthening exercises for
      this study will be performed by all participants beginning at the first physical therapy
      visit post-surgery. These exercises will be performed at each physical therapy session for 6
      consecutive weeks (approximately 2-3 sessions/week). Standard rehabilitation will continue at
      the conclusion of the 6-week intervention for all participants.

    <description>Delfi's Personalized Tourniquet System for Blood Flow Restriction will be used with leg extension and leg press exercises. Bilateral thigh cuffs will be applied to the participants and occlusion pressure will be set at 80% of total occlusive pressure as determined by the Doppler sensor. Each participant will perform 4 sets of each exercise (1 set of 30 repetitions followed by 3 sets of 15 repetitions) with resistance of 30% 1-repetition maximum. The pressure will remain through completion of the final set, but not to exceed 5 minutes. One minute rest without tourniquet application will be performed between exercises. Sets and repetitions will remain constant for each participant; however, resistance will be incrementally increased.</description>
