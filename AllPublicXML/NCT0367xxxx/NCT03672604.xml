  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, first-in-human study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of NLY01, a PEGylated form of exenatide, in healthy volunteers. NLY01 is
      being developed as a potential treatment for neurodegenerative disorders including
      Parkinson's disease. This study is intended to identify the appropriate dose-range for
      evaluation in Parkinson's disease patients.

      This is a Phase 1, first-in-human, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single and
      multiple-dose study to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of NLY01, a PEGylated form of
      the anti-diabetic peptide exenatide, when administered by SC injection in healthy subjects.

      In Part A of the study, 5 ascending-dose cohorts will be sequentially enrolled with an
      evaluation of safety and tolerability prior to each dose-escalation. Subjects in each cohort
      will be randomized to receive NLY01 or placebo. Each dose escalation and selection of doses
      for Part B will be conducted with oversight by an independently-chaired Safety Review
      Committee.

      In Part B, subjects will receive once-weekly subcutaneous doses of NLY01 or placebo for 4
      weeks. Three ascending-dose cohorts will be sequentially-enrolled with a safety review prior
      to each dose-escalation. Subjects in all Part B cohorts will receive fixed doses of NLY01 (or
      placebo) once-weekly for 4 weeks.
