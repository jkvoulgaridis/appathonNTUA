  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease with high prevalence worldwide, considered an
      important cause of morbidity, mortality and high economic costs. Aerobic physical exercise
      has great merit as non-pharmacological treatment and other exercise modalities have being
      studied. However, there are few data in the literature about the effects of Pilates method in
      patients with asthma. The objective of this study is evaluate the effects of a program of
      exercise using Pilates on health factors related to quality of life in patients with moderate
      or severe persistent asthma. Patients will be also evaluated about disease control, anxiety
      and depression symptoms, functional capacity, lung function, respiratory muscle strength,
      thoracoabdominal mechanics and level of daily life physical activity. The investigators'
      hypothesis is that strengthening of the deep trunk muscles promotes a mechanical fixation of
      the thorax, contributing to the clinical improvement of patients with asthma.

      This is a randomized, controlled and single blinded trial. Thirty adults with moderate or
      severe persistent asthma will be randomly assigned into two groups: Pilates method - PM
      (training group) or muscle stretching exercises - MSE (control group). All subjects will
      receive the same educational session and will perform the physical exercise proposed for the
      group for 12 weeks, 3 times/week, 40-minute sessions. The data normality will be analyzed by
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov, the variables obtained before interventions will be compared with the
      Student t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test. Comparisons of the initial and final data on outcomes
      will be analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA with appropriate post hoc of Holm-Sidak. The
      significance level will be set to 5% for all tests.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in health related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline after 3 months of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Health related quality of life will be assessed by Asthma Quality Life Questionnaire (AQLQ). The AQLQ is composed by 32 items rated on a 7-point scale ranging from 7 = without limitation to 1 = maximum limitation and grouped in 4 domains: activity limitations (11 items), symptoms (12 items), emotional function (5 items) and environmental stimuli (4 items). Total score will be obtained by the average of the 32 items. The score of each domain will be obtained by the average of the items that compose the domain. A higher score indicates a better quality of life in relation asthma disease and a minimal important difference of 0.5 points results in clinically improvement or deterioration for total score and for each domain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in clinical control</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline after 3 months of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical control will be evaluated by asthma control questionnaire (ACQ). The ACQ consists of 7 items rated on a 7-point scale ranging from 0 = without limitation to 6 = maximum limitation and the score will be obtained by the average of the items. A higher score indicates worse control and a change of 0.5 point after intervention is clinically important. Asthma will be considered as controlled (ACQ &lt;0.75 points), not well controlled and poorly controlled asthma (ACQ &gt;1.5 points).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the level of anxiety and depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline after 3 months of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The symptoms of anxiety and depression will be assessed by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The scale is composed by 14 items divided into 2 subscales, each containing 7 items. Each item was scored from 0 to 3, with a maximum score of 21 points for each subscale. The score of each subscale will be obtained by summing the items.</description>

    <description>The Pilates exercises will be performed in 12 weeks with 40-minute sessions, three times a week: 2 at ambulatory and 1 at home. Ambulatory sessions will be supervised by a physical therapist in non-consecutive days. Patients could be grouped in classes with a maximum of 4 subjects. The first two weeks will be spent learning the technique and, in the third week, patients will receive an exercise booklet for in-home training. Will be used the classical solo Pilates exercises, adapted for non-trained individuals. Before and after each session, patients will be evaluated in relation to expiratory peak flow, blood pressure, heart rate and asthma symptoms.</description>
