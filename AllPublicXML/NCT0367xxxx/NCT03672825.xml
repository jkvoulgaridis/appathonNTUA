  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an FDA phase I study to evaluate the safety of allogeneic culture-expanded
      adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs) combined with autologous cartilage cells to
      treat focal knee cartilage defects in one stage surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase I study will enroll 25 subjects with unilateral, symptomatic ICRS Grade III or IV
      cartilage lesions of the knee will be candidates for this study. Baseline data will include
      physical examination of the knee, clinical assessment of knee pain and function using
      validated patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), radiographs, and MRI. Tissue from
      qualified donors will be used to establish allogeneic MSC banks (using current Good
      Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) based on standard operating procedures), which will be tested
      and released for clinical use. Patients will undergo surgical debridement of their cartilage
      defect with harvest of the articular cartilage surrounding the defect rim. Following rapid
      digestion into chondrocytes and their pericellular matrix, autologous chondrons will be mixed
      in a 1:4 ratio with allogeneic AMSCs obtained from AMSC banks and suspended in fibrin glue
      for application to the debrided osteochondral defect. All patients will be clinically
      evaluated at 1-2 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 52 weeks, 18 moths, and 24 months
      post-RECLAIM for adverse events (AEs). Following completion of their respective RECLAIM
      treatment, each subject will be followed-up for study endpoints using a predetermined
      protocol, including clinical evaluation, radiography, and MRI.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        1. Male or female ages 18-50 years.

          2. Persons of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to
             receiving the study drug and will agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method or abstinence) from the time of screening to a period of 2 years
             following treatment. Females of childbearing potential are defined as premenopausal
             and not surgically sterilized, or post-menopausal for fewer than 2 years. A urine
             pregnancy test will be performed prior to the administration of the study drug to
             confirm negative results. If the urine pregnancy test is positive, the study drug will
             not be administered and the result will be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test. Urine
             pregnancy tests will be performed by qualified personnel using kit.

          3. Persons becoming pregnant during the study will continue to be monitored for the
             duration of the study or completion of the pregnancy, whichever is longer. Monitoring
             will include perinatal and neonatal outcome. Any SAEs associated with pregnancy will
             be recorded.

          4. Chronic (&gt; 3 months), unilaterally symptomatic, ICRS Grade III or IV cartilage lesions
             ranging in size from 2 to 8 cm2. Patients with episodes of contralateral knee pain
             that is asymptomatic at the time of enrollment will be eligible for inclusion.
             However, as outlined in the primary study endpoints, patients with previous episodes
             of contralateral knee pain who experience a repeat episode of contralateral pain
             similar to their established pattern of pain during the course of the trial will not
             be considered as having experienced an adverse event.

          5. Radiographic knee OA of Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 1 or less, consisting of normal knee
             radiographs (Grade 0) or doubtful narrowing of the joint space and possible
             osteophytic lipping (Grade 1)

          6. Previous 6 week or longer trial of one of the following conservative treatments:
             activity modification, weight loss, physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications or
             injection therapy (e.g. cortisone)

          7. If applicable, at least 3 months will have passed since the last target knee
             intraarticular injection prior to undergoing RECLAIM therapy and at least 6 months

          8. Able to routinely walk without assistance (e.g. cane, walker)

          9. Clinically stable target knee. Patients undergoing primary anterior crucial ligament
             (ACL) reconstruction will be eligible for inclusion if their target knee is otherwise
             stable and well-aligned.

         10. No additional surgery planned in the target knee for at least 12 months following
             RECLAIM therapy

         11. Completed general physical and well-being evaluation with primary care provider within
             12 months of enrollment

         12. Fully understanding of the requirements of the study and willingness to comply with
             the treatment plan, including laboratory tests, diagnostic imaging, and follow-up
             visits and assessments

         13. Can provide written informed consent and complete HIPAA documentation after the nature
             of the study is fully explained and prior to any study-related procedure 1.2 Exclusion
