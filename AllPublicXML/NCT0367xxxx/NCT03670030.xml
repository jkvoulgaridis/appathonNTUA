  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether ABI-009 will make advanced, malignant
      neuroendocrine tumor(s) of the lung, gastrointestinal tract and/or pancreas that cannot be
      removed by surgery smaller and slow the spread of your cancer in patients who have progressed
      or been intolerant to everolimus. All eligible participants will receive ABI-009, the study
      drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ABI-009, human albumin-bound rapamycin, is an experimental drug. &quot;Experimental&quot; means that
      the drug has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

      Rapamycin, the active part of the drug, inhibits a biological pathway (mTOR) that certain
      cancers use to grow. Rapamycin and similar types of drugs have been used in many other
      tumors, including advanced renal cell carcinoma. A standard mTOR inhibitor used in
      neuroendocrine tumors is everolimus. The human albumin component of ABI-009 may allow
      rapamycin to reach cancer cells more effectively.

      ABI-009 has not been approved for the treatment of advanced, malignant neuroendocrine tumors
      of the lung, gastrointestinal tract and/or pancreas. The information from this study might
      help us identify if ABI-009 is safe and effective in this disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Unresectable or metastatic patients with typical or atypical carcinoid tumors of the

          3. Patients must have progressed on everolimus or been intolerant to everolimus.

          4. Patients, ≥18 years old, must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
             Performance Status 0 or 1.

          5. Concurrent use of somatostatin analogs (SSAs) is allowed if currently used for symptom
             control.

          6. Adequate liver function:

               2. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤2.5 x ULN
                  (&lt;5 x ULN if the patient has liver metastases).

          7. Adequate renal function:

             a. Serum creatinine ≤2 x ULN or creatinine clearance &gt;50 cc/hr (Cockroft-Gault).

          8. Adequate biological parameters:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5 × 109/L
