        The population will include patients who had incident cancer diagnosed from the
        SEER-Medicare linked database

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  RA patients will be identified using algorithms that require ≥ 1 rheumatologist
             (physician specialty code: 66) diagnosis codes for RA (at least one of the following
             ICD9 diagnosis codes: 714.0, 714.2, 714.81) at any time before the first claim for a
             specific drug (Index date) during the study period and ≥1 physician (affiliated with
             physician evaluation &amp; management codes, listed in the appendix 2) diagnosis codes
             within 12 months before the first claim for a specific drug use. The index date is
             defined as the date of the first claim for a specific drug use, and the baseline
             period is defined as 12 months prior to specific drug use

          -  Naive users of biologics, including abatacept, anti-TNFs (i.e. etanercept, adalimumab,
             certolizumab, golimumab, infliximab), rituximab, and tocilizumab, will be defined
             specific to each drug as no claim for that therapy in any time prior to the index date

          -  Eligible subjects, including cancer patients in SEER and non-cancer beneficiaries from
             5% sample, must have been continuously enrolled in Medicare Parts A, B and D and not C
             at their index date and during baseline

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients diagnosed with any cancer (ignoring non-melanoma skin cancer, which is not
             captured within SEER) before the use of biologics under study. Cancer cases will be
             identified based on the records in SEER

          -  Patients who were younger than 18 years on the index date

          -  Patients with claims for other types of auto-immune diseases (e.g. psoriatic
             arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus) during baseline

          -  Month or year of diagnosis of malignancy in SEER was unknown

          -  Cancer cases who were identified by death certificate or autopsy only in SEER

        Other protocol defined inclusion/exclusion criteria could apply
