  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) accounts for 70-90% of all diagnosed traumatic brain
      injuries (TBI) affecting approximately 50-300 per 100.000 individuals annually. Persistent
      post-concussion symptoms are reported in 15-80% of hospital admitted and outpatient treated
      populations, affecting labour market attachment, academic achievement, income, socio-economic
      status, social interactions, home management, leisure activities and cohabitation status.

      The association between mTBI and long-term trends in cohabitation status, income, academic
      achievement and socio-economic status has not been thoroughly explored. Previous studies
      focus on children's academic performance after severe TBI and only few studies include early
      adulthood and patients with mTBI. Trends in divorce rates are frequently conducted on severe
      injuries or populations consisting of veterans. Additionally, all studies have failed to
      apply a national register based design.

      Aim The aim of the study is to examine the long-term associations between mTBI and trends in
      cohabitation status, academic achievement and socio-economic status between pre-injury rates
      and observed rates at 5 years post-injury. The hypothesis was that by 5 years mTBI would be
      associated with increased odds of marital breakdown, decreasing academic achievement,
      decreasing income, decreasing socio-economic status compared to the general population in
      Denmark.

      Methods:

      The study is a national register based cohort study with 5 years follow-up of patients with
      mild traumatic brain injury from 2008 - 2012 in Denmark.

      Population:

      Patients between 18-60 years diagnosed with concussion (ICD-10 S06.0) were extracted from the
      Danish National Patient Register between (2003-2007). Patients with major neurological
      injuries and previous concussions at the index date and 5 years before the index date
      (1998-2007) were excluded. Patients who were not resident in Denmark 5 years before and
      during the inclusion period were also excluded (1998-2007).

      Data will be retrieved from several national databases, including: the Danish national
      patient register, Danish Civil Registration System (CRS), the Danish Education Registers, the
      Income Statistics Register and the Employment Classification Module (AKM).

      One control of the general population were matched for each case on sex, age and
      municipality.

      Outcome measures are: Cohabitation status, Education, income and socio-economic status.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cohabitation status</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years follow-up (2008-2012)</time_frame>
    <description>Data comprise four definitions of married couples, registered partnerships, couples living in consensual union, cohabiting couple or being single. Data were consolidated into married/cohabiting couple or single status.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Education</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years follow-up (2008-2012)</time_frame>
    <description>The highest completed qualifying education, given at the index date was used as a measure of academic achievement. Data were categorized into high education vs. low education. Low education encompasses basic schooling, high school, trade and craft educations and high educations encompass short education, medium length education, bachelor's degree, university degrees and Ph.D.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Income</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years follow-up (2008-2012)</time_frame>
    <description>To describe long-term trends in income, we analyze data on personal gross income including revenue and social transfer income and categorized data into two income groups: Low annually income (&lt;200.000 DKK). and high annually income (&gt;200.000 DKK).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Socioeconomic status</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years follow-up (2008-2012)</time_frame>
    <description>Based on occupation and income, socio-economic status determines whether the person is employed, unemployed or outside the labour force. To measure how mTBI influences socioeconomic status (employment status) regarding occupation and labour market attachment, data were categorized into (1) Self-employed/leaders/managers vs. wage earners/enrolled in education/not economically active and (2) Gainfully employed vs. not economically active.</description>
