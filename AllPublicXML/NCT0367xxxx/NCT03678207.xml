  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elevated blood pressure is the largest contributing risk factor to all-cause and
      cardiovascular mortality. According to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, hypertension
      affects nearly 30% of the adult population. Many patients remain undiagnosed, despite the
      consensus that screening and timely diagnosis is paramount. In this study, 108 ambulatory
      surgery patients with elevated blood pressure (160/90) that are not yet formally diagnosed
      with hypertension will be enrolled and alerted of their high blood pressure by a
      co-investigator MD. They will request permission to follow-up with the patient and the
      patient's primary care provider 6 months after the initial phone call to check in on the
      status of their diagnosis and any action taken (lifestyle changes, medication) to alleviate
      their high blood pressure. Patients will receive a follow-up letter/email at 6 and 3 months
      to remind them of their potential diagnosis.

    <description>Patients receiving ambulatory surgery with no prior diagnosis of hypertension but have elevated blood pressure prior to surgery. Patients will receive a phone call from a participating anesthesiologist 1-3 days after surgery notifying them of their high blood pressure and obtaining oral consent to participate in the study. Patients will receive reminders via mail about following up with their PCP.</description>
