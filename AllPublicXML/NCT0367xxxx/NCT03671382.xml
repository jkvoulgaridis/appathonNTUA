  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite advanced cancer patients and their caregivers frequently experiencing psychological
      distress and wanting to know about their prognosis, oncologists rarely respond with empathy
      and provide adequate information regarding patient prognosis. We aim to address the
      communication gap during consultations by developing an Oncologist E-Learning Communications
      Skills Training Program guiding physicians on how to recognize and respond to
      patient/caregiver distress and to disclose prognosis; and a Patient Prompt Sheet to encourage
      discussions of psychological distress and prognosis. We will assess the feasibility of
      delivering this two-component intervention program within a cancer center in Singapore
      through a 2-arm randomized controlled trial in which 8 oncologists will be randomly assigned
      to Control Arm (n=4) and Intervention Arm (n=4). Oncologists in the intervention arm will
      receive the E-Learning Program. Their patients will also receive the Patient Prompt Sheet
      before their consultation with oncologist. After completion of oncologist intervention we
      will audio-record and survey 3 patients with Stage IV cancer and their caregivers per
      oncologist before and after their consultations. If the study is shown to be feasible and
      acceptable, then its effectiveness will be assessed in a larger trial.

    <description>The intervention being delivered is a two-component intervent. First component is the Oncologist Communication Skills Training Program. This is an e-learning module teaching oncologists to recognize and respond to patient/caregiver distress, provide information including prognosis and discuss goals of care. The second component is a patient prompt sheet which will be administered to three patients of intervention arm oncologists in the waiting area at least 30 minutes before their consultation. The sheet includes structured questions for patients to ask the oncologist about diagnosis and prognosis and will prompt patients to label and express their emotions in a direct manner.</description>
