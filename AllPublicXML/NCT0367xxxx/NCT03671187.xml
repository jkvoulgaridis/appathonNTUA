  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is known to reduce dyspnea, increase exercise capacity, reduce
      psychological symptoms and improve quality of life in COPD patients. Some patients continue
      to smoke despite their illness. Smoking does not create a contraindication to PR. There is
      insufficient evidence on the effectiveness of PR programs in smoking COPD patients. The
      purpose of this study, PR completed the program to determine the effectiveness of PR smoker
      COPD patients.

      purpose of this study, PR completed the program to determine the effectiveness of PR smoker
      COPD patients. People who have completed the PR program, smoking and not smoking will be
      included into the study.

      Data of carbon monoxide diffusion test, body plethysmography, 6-min walk test, blood gas
      analysis, mMRC dyspnea scale, hospital anxiety depression scale, SGRQ and SF-36 quality of
      life questionnaire performed before and after the program will be analyzed.
