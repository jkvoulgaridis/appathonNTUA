  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator's hypothesis is that tai chi sessions would increase physical activity of
      patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis. The main objective is to study the effect of tai chi
      sessions (16 vs.0) on total physical activity of Rheumatoid Arthritis patients, compared to a
      control group without tai chi.

      Detail protocol:

      Selection and inclusion of patients will be done by principal investigator of Rheumatology
      Department. After verification of inclusion and non-inclusion criteria by principal
      investigator and signature of consent, patients will be randomized by 1: 1 randomization
      (centralized randomization by statistician into 2 groups at Month 0). They will participate
      in sessions in a deferred manner due to two per week for each group:

        -  Interventional &quot;A&quot; group: 32 sessions (on average 2/week) performed from Month 0 to
           Month 4 in 15 patients.

        -  Control &quot;B&quot; group: 16 sessions (on average 2/week) performed from Month 2 to Month 4 in
           15 patients.

      Patients of &quot;B&quot; group will be not performing sessions with &quot;A&quot; group patients. Sessions
      lasting about 45 minutes will be proposed from Monday to Friday in a room planned from this
      activity within the CHU. Exercises will be adapted and personalized according to each one.
      Evaluations will be carried out for group 1 (interventional) before the first session of tai
      chi at Month 0, before the session at Month 2 and at the end of the protocol at Month 4. The
      same evaluations will be carried out for group B (control) at Month 0, before first session
      of tai chi at Month 2 and at the end of the protocol.

      Assessment of pain and stress will be done before and after each session. Final assessment
      will be done at 4 months after randomization. Fitness assessment and tai chi sessions will be
      conducted by APA student. Clinical examination of patient, installation and removal of cardio
      frequency meter will be performed by nurse. Data entry will be done by Clinical Research
      Associate of the Rheumatology Department. Statistical analysis will be carried out by
      biostatistician affiliated to the study.

    <time_frame>At Month 0 before the first session of tai chi and Month 2 after 16 sessions of tai chi (intervention group), measured at Month 0 and Month 2 (control group without tai chi).</time_frame>
    <description>Android application allows to estimate in usual conditions of life the energy expenditure and time spent in three intensities of physical activities: light, moderate and vigorous, as well as the time spent in sedentary behaviors. Android smartphone with application eMouve will be entrusted to patients to collect information from their physical activity (PA) for 4 days (2 days of the week and 2 days of weekend).</description>

    <measure>Change in total physical activity time expressed in MET.min/week between M0 and M2 measured by Global physical activity questionnaire (GPAQ Questionnaire (Global Physical Activity Questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Month 0 before the first session of tai chi and Month 2 after 16 sessions of tai chi (intervention group), measured at Month 0 and Month 2 (control group without tai chi).</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Global Physical Activity Questionnaire provides a longitudinal assessment of a typical week for physical activity and sedentary behaviors. It covers three areas of activities: work activity, utilitarian travel, leisure activities and home-based activities. This questionnaire provides information on time spent on different activities in each of three areas mentioned above. A specific energy expenditure is associated with each PA, which makes it possible to estimate the overall energy expenditure of the patients. It also provides information on sedentary time.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease activity, evaluated by CDAI score (Clinical Disease Activity Index) at M0, at M2 after 16 sessions and at M4 after 32 sessions (interventional group) and evaluated at M0, M2 and M4 after 16 sessions (control group).</measure>
    <time_frame>at M0, M2 and M4 after 16 sessions</time_frame>
    <description>CDAI score (Clinical Disease Activity Index) corresponds to the algebraic sum of the number of painful (N=28) and swollen (N=28) joints, of disease activity judged by patient on analogical visual scale (AVS) from 0 to 10 cm and disease activity on AVS from 0 to 10cm evaluated by the physician. Remission is defined by a score ≤ 2.8 and low activity by a score ≤ 10.</description>

    <description>Schober test consists of evaluating flexion amplitude of lumbar spine: two marks are made at L5 vertebra and 10cm above this lumbar vertebra, in a standing patient. Patient is then asked to lean forward and measure the increase in gap between two marks previously practiced. A gap of less than 3cm is considered pathological, the expected normal is +5cm.</description>
