  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12-week treatment, singlecenter, open-label, single-arm, dose-selection, proof of
      concept study to determine a dosage of HSP 90 inhibitor (CUDC-305) that is tolerable and
      demonstrates preliminary efficacy for use in future efficacy Phase 2 trials. Male or female
      subjects aged 18 years or older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis will be included in
      this study.

      Objectives are to determine the efficacy, safety and tolerability of CUDC-305 in patients
      with moderate to severe psoriasis.
