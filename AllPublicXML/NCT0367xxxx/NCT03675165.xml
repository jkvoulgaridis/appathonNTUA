  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine how the 'Best Possible Self' (BPS) intervention
      influences diabetes symptomatology over a four week period by assessing stress and resilience
      as mediatory effects. Half of the participants will receive the BPS straight away while the
      other half will be put on a waiting list and will act as the control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The BPS is a &quot;positive&quot; psychology intervention; i.e. it facilitates positive emotion in
      order to achieve psychological, behavioural, and even physiological changes. The present
      team's previous research has demonstrated that the BPS is effective at reducing certain
      diabetes symptoms, though the exact mechanisms by which it does so are unclear. According to
      the Stress Buffering Model of Physical Activity, psychological stress is the catalyst that
      triggers behavioural and physiological responses critical to health while positive emotions
      can improve health by helping people to cope. The Broaden and Build Theory of Positive
      Emotions, meanwhile, suggests that this is because positive emotions allow people to build
      resilience.

      In this study, the aim is to examine whether stress and resilience in particular mediate the
      relationship between intervention and diabetes symptoms. Research around stress and
      resilience has shown these factors to be important not only in the physical health of people
      with diabetes but for also decreasing illness symptomatology in non-clinical samples more
      generally.

    <measure>Diabetes Symptomatology (assessed using the Diabetes Symptoms Checklist - Revised)</measure>
    <time_frame>Four Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subscales assess the existence of, and the distress caused by, fatigue, cognitive, pain, sensory, cardiology, ophthalmology, hypoglycaemia, and hyperglycaemia symptoms individually. For each sub-scale, participants can score between 0 and 5, with a lower score meaning fewer symptoms and less distress caused by that subset of symptoms. Subscales do not come together to create a total symptomatology score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Reported Stress (assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Four weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Mediatory Effect. Individual scores are added up and can range from 0-40. A higher score means that the individuals perceives themselves to be more stressed.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Reported Resilience (assessed using the Six-Item Brief Resilience Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Four Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Mediatory Effect. Responses are added up to give a score between 6 and 30. The total sum is then divided by 6 (the number of questions). A higher score indicates a higher level of resilience.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Diabetes Risk (calculated using the Canadian Diabetes Risk Questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>Four Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Control Variable. A total risk score is assessed by summing up the scores of each of the 12 questions. Scores range from 0-87. A lower score indicates less risk. Participants with a score of &lt; 21 are low risk, participants with a score of 21 - 32 are medium risk, and participants with a score of &gt;32 are high risk.</description>

    <description>Participants receive a tailored version of Laura King's 'Best Possible Self' intervention: a brief, self-administered, psychological intervention. It is fundamentally a writing exercise, whereby recipients are asked to spend 10 minutes writing about their best possible future self and the steps they need to take to become that person. This helps the individual set goals while facilitating positive affect. Our version of the task has people focus on their health-related goals in particular.</description>
