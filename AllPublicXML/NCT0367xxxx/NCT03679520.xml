  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Becoming a parent is a challenging stage in life, which provokes feelings of both excitement
      and insecurity; parents strive to develop confidence in their parenting role. Studies show
      that new parents often feel inadequately prepared for early parenthood which may have a
      negative impact on adjustment to life as a parent as well as health and wellbeing for the
      whole family.

      The overall aim is to develop, pilot test and evaluate a new programme for antenatal
      preparation for the early parenthood period. The hypothesis is that expectant first-time
      parents who receive an intervention with a new programme for antenatal preparation for
      parenthood will show higher scores for parental self-efficacy in the early parenthood period
      than those who do not receive the intervention. The specific aims for the pilot study are:

        1. To assess the acceptability of the procedures for parents and providers (midwives)

        2. To estimate the likely rates of recruitment and retention of participants

        3. To estimate the effects on outcome measurements in order to calculate the appropriate
           sample size in a full scale randomized controlled trial (RCT).

      Antenatal clinics will be randomised to either intervention group, and provide a new
      programme of antenatal parental preparation, or to control group and provide a regular
      programme of antenatal parental preparation. First-time expectant parents will be invited in
      early pregnancy by the midwives at the antenatal clinics to participate in the study by
      partaking in an evaluation of the different ways to provide antenatal parental preparation.
      Parents who agree to participate will receive postal questionnaires before the antenatal
      parental preparation start and approximately four weeks after giving birth.

      Midwives working in antenatal clinics randomised to the intervention group will receive a
      one-day-education before providing the intervention antenatal parental preparation. These
      midwives will also receive questionnaires, after the education and after providing the
      antenatal parental preparation.

      All midwives, in both control group and intervention group, providing antenatal parental
      preparation will be given a form with questions related to the content in the provided
      programme to fill in.

      Development of the intervention; The development of the intervention was guided by the
      Medical Research Council's (MRC) framework for development and evaluation of complex
      interventions. The development phase involves identifying the evidence base, identifying or
      developing theory and modelling process and outcome. Based on reviews of literature and the
      results of previous studies in this project, the concept of self-efficacy in Social Cognitive
      Theory was identified as a suitable theory in the development and evaluation of the
      intervention.

      Details of recruitment and randomisation of Antenatal clinics; Antenatal clinics (ANCs),
      which offer the most common model (regular) for antenatal parental preparation, as mapped out
      in a previous study, will be invited to participate in the pilot study which will compare the
      regular programme for antenatal parental preparation (control group) with a new programme for
      antenatal parental preparation (intervention group). Cluster randomisation of ANCs will be
      used to minimise contamination between the different programmes of antenatal preparation in
      the two groups. Randomisation will be stratified according to Care Need Index (CNI) which is
      based on socio-demographic variables of expectant mothers registered with the participating
      ANCs. A mean value of the CNIs of participating ANCs will be calculated, those below the mean
      value will form one strata and those above the mean value will form the other strata. Half of
      the ANCs will be randomised to the intervention group and half to the control group.

      Details of preparations to provide the new programme intervention; A full-day education will
      be provided for midwives at the ANCs randomised to the intervention group which will include
      group leadership skills to facilitate peer learning among parents, evidence-based websites,
      framework for co-parenting and details regarding the new programme. The education to the
      midwives will be followed up with personal phone contact 1-2 months after the education, by
      the educator, in order to give opportunities for questions and clarifications in order to
      provide the intervention programme.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Parent Expectations Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks postnatal</time_frame>
    <description>The Parent Expectation Survey (PES) will be used to assess parental self-efficacy. PES exists in two versions, one for prenatal use and one for postnatal use. Both versions contain 25 items with statements related to their perceived parental skills, the phrasing of the statements in the prenatal version is prefaced with &quot;I will…&quot; and in the postnatal version &quot;I can…&quot; otherwise the statements are identical. The statements are answered on 11-point Likert-type scales ranging from 0 (Cannot do) to 10 (Certain can do). Total score range 0-250. Higher scores indicate higher parental self-efficacy. Statistical comparison will be made to assess the change of parental self-efficacy (total score) across time, from baseline to postnatal follow-up, and groups.</description>

    <measure>The Parents' Postnatal Sense of Security Instrument</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks postnatal</time_frame>
    <description>The Parents Postnatal Sense of Security (PPSS) will be used to assess parental sense of security during the early postnatal period. PPSS exists in two versions, one for mothers and one for partners. Mothers' version contain 18 items within 4 dimensions, partners' version 13 items within 4 dimensions, answered on 4-point Likert-type scales (1-4)
Mothers' version: total score range 18-72. Dimensions: a sense of the midwives'/nurses' empowering behaviour 6-24; a sense of general well-being 5-20; a sense of afﬁnity within the family 4-16; and a sense that breast feeding was manageable 3-12.
Partners': total score range 13-52. Dimensions: a sense of the midwives/nurses' empowering behaviour 5-20; a sense of the mother's general well-being including breastfeeding 3-12; a sense of general well-being 3-12; and a sense of afﬁnity within in the family 2-8.
Higher scores indicate higher sense of security. Statistical comparisons will be made at dimension levels and the total score level</description>

    <measure>The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks postnatal</time_frame>
    <description>The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) will be used to assess risk of postnatal depression. EPDS is a 10-item self-report scale specifically designed to screen for postnatal depression in community samples. Each item is scored on a four-point scale (score 0-3), the total score range is 0-30. The risk for postnatal depression increases as scores increase. Statistical comparisons will be made at the total score level.</description>
