  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infection of peritoneal dialysis fluid is a major complication in patients treated with
      peritoneal dialysis (PD). The aim of catheter emergence care is to reduce bacterial
      contamination of the peritoneum. The recommendations of the International Society of
      Peritoneal Dialysis do not provide information on the frequency of care delivery or the
      usefulness of a sterile adhesive dressing. Thus each treatment center applies a protocol of
      its own. Dressing is common practice although its safety and interest are not demonstrated.

      The usefulness of dressing is still to be demonstrated. On the other hand, the efficacy of
      the application in prevention of a cream of mupirocin at emergence on the reduction of the
      risk of infection with staphylococcus aureus (SA), the most frequent germ found in
      peritonitis, has been demonstrated. A Spanish study showed that during a peritoneal infection
      at SA the site most frequently colonized by a similar strain of SA was the emergence of the
      catheter.

      It can be considered that an infection of the dialysis liquid in PD is not only related to
      the quality of emergency care but also to manipulations during exchanges.

      Given the number of patients involved in PD in France, it is difficult to obtain sufficient
      power to formally demonstrate the non-inferiority of the absence of dressing.

      Therefore, the investigators propose a descriptive, exploratory study of events that may
      occur in PD when a dressing is not applied. This is a step prior to performing a multicenter
      randomized comparative study that will aim to show the non-inferiority of the absence of
      dressing compared to the application of a dressing on the incidence of fluid infection.

    <description>It is the historical cohort which is composed of patients over 18 years of age treated by peritoneal dialysis in the nephrology department of Universty Hospital of Caen Normandie. Patients with the same non-inclusion criteria as the experimental group will not be included. The data will be extracted from the Registry of Peritoneal Dialysis of French Language. The number of patients included from the register can not be fixed in advance; this number will correspond to the 4-year follow-up at the start date of the study to ensure at least two years of patient follow-up
Usually care
First dressing 5 or 10 days after the pose of the catheter :
Cleaning emergence with antiseptic soap
Rinsing with saline
Drying
Application of a hazelnut mupirocin on the exit-site
Application of an occlusive dressing on the exit-site Then, care is the same. Exit-site care is performed daily if the patient takes a shower or twice a week.</description>
