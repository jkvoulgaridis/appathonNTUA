      This is the second phase of a two-part study. In the first phase (Protocol ID: R34AT009170),
      the investigators refined and piloted the Relaxation Response Resiliency (3RP) intervention
      for women age 50 and over who are living with HIV, a group especially burdened by stressors
      related both to aging and to living with chronic disease. In this part of the study, the
      investigators will use data from the first phase to further adapt the intervention manual,
      and test the final product via a small randomized controlled trial in the same population.

      Overview.

      This is the second phase of a two-part study. In the first phase (Protocol ID: R34AT009170),
      the investigators adapted an existing resiliency intervention, the Relaxation Response
      Resiliency Program (3RP), to the needs of women ages 50 and over who are living with HIV. The
      investigators conducted preliminary testing of the refined group intervention via an open
      pilot study (N=13 enrolled) across two sites, MGH and Boston Medical Center), and conducted
      individual exit interviews to solicit feedback on the intervention. Based on these
      qualitative data, as well as qualitative work conducted previously with this population, the
      goal of this phase of the project is to conduct a small, randomized pilot of the intervention
      in groups of up to 10 women with HIV (total N=up to 60) to assess feasibility and
      acceptability of all study procedures.

      Study Procedures.

      Participants will be women living with HIV (N=up to 60) age 50 or over, who are recruited via
      flyers and provider referral from Boston area hospitals and health care settings, as well as
      community organizations serving individuals living with HIV. Once an individual expresses
      interest in the study, they will be screened by a study staff member, either by phone or in
      person, in order to assess study eligibility. Eligible and interested individuals will be
      invited to sign informed consent and complete an in-person baseline assessment. Participants
      will be randomized to either a 10-week intervention group (adapted 3RP intervention) or a
      10-week control group (supportive psychotherapy program). Participants will then complete a
      post-treatment assessment, an individual in-depth exit interview to provide feedback on their
      experience in the study, and a 3-month follow-up assessment. Data from this second phase of
      the study will inform the eventual development of a full-scale randomized controlled trial.

      Adapted 3RP Intervention.

      Once randomized into the intervention condition, participants will complete 10, 90-minute
      weekly group sessions of the adapted 3RP intervention. Sessions will focus on developing an
      understanding of stress sources and physiology, and on developing a regular practice of
      eliciting the relaxation response (RR) and learning cognitive behavioral and positive
      psychology skills to enhance resiliency to long-term stress. Participants will be encouraged
      to practice skills (RR practice, thoughts records to learn adaptive thinking) between group
      sessions.

      Supportive Psychotherapy Control Program.

      The control condition will be a supportive therapy program that is matched to the
      intervention for number and length of sessions. Basic principles of supportive psychotherapy
      will be followed, and the interventionist will facilitate discussion around what it is like
      to live with HIV as an aging woman.

    <time_frame>Assessed approximately 10 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will assess feasibility of study procedures by tracking the number of potential participants screened and eligible, the number of eligible participants enrolled, and the number of treatment, assessment, and make-up sessions completed by all enrolled participants. These metrics will be assessed together in order to provide a comprehensive understanding of the feasibility of this study.</description>

    <description>Investigators will assess feasibility of study procedures by tracking the time it takes to screen and enroll participants, as well as the time it takes for participants to complete each assessment. These metrics will be assessed together in order to provide a comprehensive understanding of the feasibility of this study.</description>

    <measure>Acceptability of study procedures, as assessed by the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed approximately 10 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will assess acceptability at the post-treatment visit and the 3-month follow-up visit using the eight-item Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8), a measure of how much an individual values a treatment. Items are summed to create an overall score; scores range from 8 to 32, with higher scores indicating higher satisfaction. Investigators will also ask participants at both of these visits about their perceptions of the burden of the study assessment battery.</description>

    <description>The control condition will be a 10-week supportive therapy program.

    <description>The 3RP blends stress management principles, cognitive behavioral therapy, and positive psychology. The 3RP focuses on 3 major areas: (1) eliciting the relaxation response; (2) increasing stress awareness; and (3) promoting adaptive strategies. The adapted 3RP intervention consists of 10, 90-minute weekly group sessions. Content specific to older women living with HIV, including self-compassion exercises, was added to the intervention in the first phase of this study (open pilot).</description>
