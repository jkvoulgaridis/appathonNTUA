  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain of a caesarean section may be of high intensity, especially in the first
      48 hours after the procedure, which affects the mother / newborn relationship, in addition to
      having the potential to progress to chronic pain. The use of intrathecal morphine is
      effective in post-caesarean analgesia, but carries unwanted side effects, including nausea,
      vomiting, urinary retention and pruritus. Therefore, alternative techniques of analgesia
      become necessary.

      First described in 2007, ultrasound-guided quadratus lumborum (QL) block has gained
      prominence due to its analgesic superiority to the TAP block. Besides providing somatic
      analgesia, it also seems to inhibit visceral pain because the local anesthetic reaches the
      paravertebral space, this was observed by magnetic resonance imaging with contrast medium
      injected at the QL block site.

    <textblock>
      C-section is one of the most performed surgical procedures in the world, and presents great
      potential for postoperative pain, especially in the first 48 hours. Pain in this period
      represents a risk for evolution to chronic pain, but its incidence is still very divergent
      when comparing the studies, ranging from 1% to 18%.

      The use of intrathecal morphine (MIT) is consecrated as a first-choice method of analgesia
      for post-partum cesarean delivery; however, its use carries relevant side effects for the
      puerpera, such as pruritus, nausea, urinary retention and , more rarely, respiratory
      depression. In the last decade, new adjunctive forms of postoperative analgesia have become
      more popular, such as regional blockades, highlighting the blockage of the Transversus
      Abdominis plane block (TAP) and the Quadratus Lumborum block (QL), taking as benefits the
      prolonged analgesia they provide and the low incidence of side effects. Another factor that
      contributes to the popularization of regional blocks is the increasing availability of
      ultrasound devices in the anesthetic-surgical environment. Studies evaluating TAP block after
      cesarean section performed under spinal anesthesia have shown a discrete benefit in
      decreasing postoperative opioid consumption in addition to improving pain scores. When
      comparing MIT with TAP block, the superiority of MIT is due to visceral analgesia while TAP
      block is restricted to abdominal wall analgesia.

      Ultrasound-guided Lumbar Quadrant blockade has gained prominence due to its analgesic
      superiority over the TAP block, because in addition to providing somatic analgesia it also
      seems to inhibit visceral pain since the local anesthetic reaches the paravertebral space,
      this was observed by magnetic resonance imaging with contrast injected at the site of the QL
      block.

      Reviewing the literature in 2018, there are no clinical trials comparing the use of
      intrathecal morphine with the quadratus lumborum block.
