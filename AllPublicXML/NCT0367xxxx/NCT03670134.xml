  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are trying to see if the Nvision® Imaging System (VLE) can accurately determine
      the risk of recurrent Barrett's esophagus in patients with Barrett's esophagus which have
      been clear of disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Barrett's Esophagus (BE) undergoing endoscopic therapy through our Barrett's
      Esophagus Unit will be approached for study enrollment. Patients with no endoscopic evidence
      of BE will be considered for the study. Surveillance biopsies will be obtained per standard
      clinical protocol and reviewed to confirm absence of intestinal metaplasia. Patients who have
      achieved complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia (CRIM) will be enrolled in the study
      and will undergo the Nvision® Imaging System (VLE). Patients enrolled in the study will
      undergo clinical follow-up consisting of surveillance endoscopy every 3 months for 1 year.
      Surveillance endoscopy intervals may be prolonged to every 6 months in the second year, and
      annually thereafter. At each follow-up visit, endoscopic data will be collected to determine
      if patients remain in CRIM or show evidence of recurrent disease. Patients will be followed
      for 1 year (endpoint 1) and 3 years (endpoint 2).

    <description>Measure the thickness of neosquamous epithelium (mm) with volumetric laser endomicroscopy in patients who remain free of Barrett's esophagus and in those with recurrent disease.

    <measure>Develop a volumetric laser endomicrosopy feature scoring index to stratify the risk of disease recurrence in patients with Barrett's esophagus following treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The proposed model will stratify patients into two categories (1) low risk of recurrence and (2) high risk of recurrence. Low risk of disease recurrence is defined by a rate of &lt;5% per patient-year. High risk of disease recurrence is defined by a rate of &gt;10% per patient year.</description>

    <description>Volumetric laser Endomicroscopy (VLE) will be performed by using the Nvision VLE Imaging System (Nine Point Medical, MA) consists of an imaging console, monitor and optical probe. The optical probe is centered by a balloon (diameter: 14 mm, 17 mm, 20 mm; length: 6 cm) that is deployed through a diagnostic gastroscope's instrument channel. Imaging is performed by automatic helical pullback of the probe from the distal to the proximal end of the balloon over 90 seconds.</description>
