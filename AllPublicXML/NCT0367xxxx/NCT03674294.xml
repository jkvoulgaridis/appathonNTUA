    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study whether adding Aprepitant to Palonosetron and
      dexamethasone can further prevent the incidence and severity of nausea and vomiting caused by
      FOLFIRI or FOLFOX chemotherapy regimen among gastrointestinal malignancy patients with high
      risk factors of chemotherapy-associated adverse events.

      The purpose of this study is to study whether adding Aprepitant to Palonosetron and
      dexamethasone can further prevent the incidence and severity of nausea and vomiting caused by
      FOLFIRI or FOLFOX chemotherapy regimen after curative effect among gastrointestinal
      malignancy patients with high risk factors of chemotherapy-associated adverse events.This
      study will observe and evaluate the incidence and severity of nausea and vomiting as well as
      the effectiveness of corresponding treatment(with or without Aprepitant) during Day 1 to Day
      5 from the beginning of chemotheray.
