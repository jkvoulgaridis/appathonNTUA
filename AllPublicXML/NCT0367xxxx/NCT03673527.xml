    <textblock>
      This is a phase I trial to evaluate tacrolimus blood levels after topical application of
      tacrolimus twice daily on healthy skin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to assess the safety of a topical formulation of tacrolimus.

      Tacrolimus is commonly used in T-cell medicated diseases. It is expected that 24 subjects
      will be enrolled in the trial and will be assigned to receive topical application of
      tacrolimus twice daily for 14 days.
