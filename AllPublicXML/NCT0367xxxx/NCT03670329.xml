  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The URGO2875 dressing is an innovative antimicrobial dressing made of exclusive technologies
      of TLC-Ag healing matrix and fibres. The dressing has been developed for the local treatment
      of chronic (leg ulcers, pressure ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers) and acute (burns, traumatic
      wounds, surgical wounds) moderately to highly exudative wounds at risk or with signs of local
      infection.

      The purpose of this non-comparative clinical trial was to evaluate the performance (efficacy
      and safety) of the URGO2875 dressing, on the healing process of chronic wounds presenting a
      high-risk of infection.
