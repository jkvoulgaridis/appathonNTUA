  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MyPeBS is an international randomized, open-label, multicentric, study assessing the
      effectiveness of a risk-based breast cancer screening strategy (using clinical risk scores
      and polymorphisms) compared to standard screening (according to the current national
      guidelines in each participating country) in detecting stage 2 or higher breast cancers.

      Women will be differentially screened for 4 years and then, after an end-of-study mammogram,
      they will return to the routine screening practice. The main study endpoint will be measured
      at the end of the four years of intervention.

      Furthermore, follow up data will be collected for 15 years from study entry for evaluation of
      long-term cumulative breast cancer incidence and breast cancer-specific survival

    <description>Participants will be screened for breast cancer according to current national/regional guidelines and procedures: with a mammogram and/or tomosynthesis (TS) every 1-3 years starting at age 40-50 years, up to age 69-74 years, with or without ultrasound and MRI depending on breast mammographic density and current recommendations. The national/regional guidelines in use in the including center may be subjected to changes during the study. Guidelines and procedures in the standard arm will be updated accordingly.</description>

    <description>Participants will be screened according to a personalised timetable based on their estimated 5-year risk of developing breast cancer: with a mammography and/or tomosynthesis every 1-4 years with or without ultrasound depending on breast density. Risk estimation will be performed using the following variables: age, family history, previous history of benign breast biopsy, personal hormone and reproductive history, breast mammographic density and genotyping (polygenic risk score). Risk assessment will be conducted using Mammorisk™ for women with at most one first-degree relative with breast or ovarian cancer and using Tyrer-Cuzick™ risk score for those women with more than one first-line first degree relative with breast or ovarian cancer.</description>
