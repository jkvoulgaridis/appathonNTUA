  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cluster randomised trial evaluating the safety of co-administering Azithromycin
      alongside the new IDA (Ivermectin, Diethylcarbamazine, Albendazole) combination treatment for
      LF.

      Treatment will be provided as a single dose Mass Drug Administration (MDA) to the whole
      community. Communities will be randomised to receive either treatment with IDA and
      Azithromycin on the same day or separately.

      Active monitoring for adverse events will be conducted and the frequency of adverse events
      compared between individuals receiving combined MDA or separate MDA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have shown that single-dose combination therapy with three antifilarial drugs
      (Ivermectin [IVE] + DEC + ALB) called IDA is superior to current regimens used in LF
      elimination and may help accelerate LF elimination. WHO guidelines have changed to recommend
      IDA in countries endemic for LF outside sub-Saharan Africa like Papua New Guinea.

      Additional benefits of IVE are its activity against scabies and Strongyloides. Treatment with
      IVE has shown to reduce the high prevalence of scabies in a village and in randomized control
      trials elsewhere in the Pacific. Of particular importance was the finding that IVE was highly
      effective against Strongyloides with a &gt;95% reduction in prevalence sustained for nine
      months.

      Increasingly, the desirability of linking LF programs with other public health initiatives
      also based on MDA is being appreciated. The existing programmatic infrastructure developed
      for LF campaign presents an attractive vehicle for a demonstration project of integration of
      MDAs against multiple Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). The macrolide antibiotic
      azithromycin (AZI) has been demonstrated to be highly effective as MDA for yaws control and
      AZI is a highly effective and well-tolerated antibiotic treatment for trachoma that is able
      to clear ocular infection with a single oral dose and is well tolerated.

      Currently LF/STH/Scabies/strongyloides and yaws/trachoma are treated separately. Integration
      of these existing MDA programs has the potential to be highly cost-effective as a population
      health intervention. Integration includes both the safe co-administration of medicines and
      operational planning, and it is currently advocated by WHO.

    <description>The incidence of self-reported adverse events following MDA. We will collect data on the presence of common symptoms/signs prior to drug administration. All patients will be reviewed 24-48 hours after treatment and asked to report adverse events. We will calculate the proportion of newly occurring adverse events following treatment and calculate the whether the proportion of patients experiencing an adverse event differs between study arms.</description>
