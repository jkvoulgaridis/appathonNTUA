  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether cosmetic investigational product containing
      NGF-574H is safe and effective in the treatment of androgenic alopecia in asian adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NGF-574H is a obtained by collection of paracrine factors secreted by human umbilical cord
      blood-derived mesenchymal stem cell that was exposed in vitro to an artificially designed
      environment mimicking alopecia state in hair follicles to prime the composition of the
      paracrine factors optimized for hair growth. This study is to assess and confirm whether
      NGF-574H is safe and effective in the treatment of androgenic alopecia in asian adults.
