  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will study the influence of initial fat cell size/number and adipose
      function (in particular lipolysis) on weight development over very long time periods (years).
      By comparing investigations of fat biopsies or blood samples obtained at baseline, the
      investigators will determine the association between adipose morphology/function and changes
      in weight or development of metabolic complications (e.g. metabolic syndrome, glucose
      intolerance, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia and hypertension).

      The investigators will ask all subjects that have previously been examined at the
      investigators laboratory (from 1992 and forward) in studies of adipose tissue function if
      they are interested to participate in a new study.

      Previously obtained results from examinations of adipose tissue, anthropometric measurements
      and blood samples will be used as baseline. In addition, saved blood samples and samples from
      old fat biopsies can be re-investigated in some cases.

      The new investigation includes a questionnaire that the subjects can answer by mail or email.
      In addition, anthropometric measurements and blood pressure determination will be performed
      at a primary health care center and blood samples will be collected for analysis of fasting
      glucose, HbA1C and lipids.

      Information regarding all previously investigated subjects will also be collected from
      several Swedish national patient registries such as the Patient Register, Prescribed Drug
      register and Cause-of Death register.

    <description>Body weight (in kilogram) will be assessed with a regular scale. Height will be measured with a tape measure (in centimeters). Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated with the formula weight (kg) divided by height^2 (in meter). Changes in BMI from baseline values will be analysed.</description>
