      Missed opportunity to pre-exposure prophylaxis is a survey study that will be addressed to
      newly infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) persons. The purposes of this study is
      to understand why despite the fact that pre-exposure prophylaxis exist, these persons have
      been contaminated with HIV.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre-exposure prophylaxis is a new strategy to prevent the occurrence of new cases of HIV.
      This prophylaxis strategy is based on taking antiretroviral drugs (ARV) before and after
      exposition to a risk of HIV infection which can reduce drastically the contamination with
      HIV. A certain groups of population based on their sexual orientation, for instance man who
      have sex with man (MSM), is among the groups that are highly exposed to this risk. To reduce
      this risk, French national regulatory authority (ANSM), firstly through temporary usage
      recommendation followed by a marketing authorization extension, allowed the prescription of
      these antiretroviral molecules to persons presenting eligibility criteria as defined by
      regulatory authority. Despite these preventive measures, the incidence of HIV such as the MSM
      group still high. The missed opportunity studies has as objectives to try to disentangle real
      obstacles of PrEP use in France and to optimize PrEP criteria if needed.

    <description>Better identify risk taking exposures to HIV contamination and determine the adequacy of the criteria for access to pre-exposure treatment with current practices. For this, questions concerning the frequency of unprotected sex, the number of partners and the type of sexual practices are collected in the self-questionnaire.</description>

    <description>Study the individual factors associated with the knowledge, representations, acceptance and prescription of PrEP in order to evaluate the hindrance to the establishment of PrEP and the persistence of infections despite the availability of this new strategy of preventive treatment. For this, the questionnaire asks about the knowledge of the existence of this prevention tool, the antecedent of PrEP intake, and the potential reasons for not taking PrEP.</description>

    <description>Evaluate the impact of healthcare professionals on missed opportunities for PrEP through the access to general or hospital physicians and screening history. Comparing percentage of new infections among new HIV diagnosis in order to study regional disparities in term of HIV screening access according to city/region and area.
Access to care, meaning frequency of visit to, the nature of, health care facilities (hospital, urban doctor, anonymous screening center…), discussed items during consultation with physician etc. These kind of informations will help to appreciate if access to care in all its dimension is correlated to HIV infection risk.
These different criteria will be compared by region to determine whether regional disparities in access to care occurred.</description>

    <time_frame>The needed time to answer to the questionnaire : 40 min to 1 hour.</time_frame>
    <description>Study the structural and demographic factors associated with missed opportunities for PrEP (regional disparities in access to PrEP).
A questionnaire for each participating center asks about the type of consultations offered, the presence of specific consultations and support for PrEP, the active file of people under PrEP and will determine if there is a center and / or region effect for taking PrEP. Collected information will shed the light on potential relation between logistic means and availability of PrEP</description>
