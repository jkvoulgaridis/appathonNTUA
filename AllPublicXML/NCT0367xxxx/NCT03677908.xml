  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Temporal theta slow-wave activity (TTA-SW) in premature infants is a specific signature of
      the early development of temporal networks, as it is observed at the turning point between
      non-sensory driven spontaneous local processing and cortical network functioning. The role in
      development and the precise location of TTA-SW remain unknown. Previous studies have
      demonstrated that preterms from 28 weeks of gestational age (wGA) are able to discriminate
      phonemes and voice, supporting the idea of a prior genetic structural or activity-dependent
      fingerprint that would prepare the auditory network to compute auditory information at the
      onset of thalamocortical connectivity. They recorded TTA-SW in 26-32 wGA preterms. The rate
      of TTA-SW in response to click stimuli was evalu- ated using low-density EEG in 30 preterms.
      The sources of TTA-SW were localized by high-density EEG using different tissues
      conductivities, head models and mathematical models.

    <description>The objective of this study is to evaluate the spatial organization of the specific Temporal theta slow-wave activity (TTA-SW) with the Low-Density Electroencephalography (LD-EEG) at an early stage of development in humans to demonstrate that TTA-SW were independent of auditory stimuli.</description>

        28 healthy premature infants follow-up between the Gestational Ages of 26 and 32 wGA
        between December 2014 and June 2015. These infants were divided into two groups accord- ing
        to age (26-30 wGA and 30-32 wGA).
