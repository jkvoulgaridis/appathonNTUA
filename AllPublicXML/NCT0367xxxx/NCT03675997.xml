    <textblock>
      Autograft is a technique requiring several weeks of hospitalization in a protected
      environment and can be a source of anxiety of different natures for patients. In this study,
      level of anxiety will be reported weekly throughout hospitalizations for autologous
      transplant, to detect the most stressful period.

    <textblock>
      Autograft is one of hematological malignancies treatment, such as lymphoma and myeloma. This
      technique requires several weeks of hospitalization in a protected environment and can be a
      source of anxiety of different natures for patients. According to the medical and scientific
      report of the Biomedicine Agency in 2016, 3 043 patients were involved in an autologous
      transplant, which represents a significant number of patients potentially exposed to these
      types of anxiety.

      That is why it will be interesting in this study to report weekly the level of anxiety
      throughout their hospitalization for the autologous transplant, to detect the most stressful
      period.

      A validated questionnaire will be used: the HAD (Hospital Anxiety and Depression) scale of
      anxiety and depression.

    <description>The aim of this study is to measure patients anxiety and depression, using the HAD : Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale.
Scores of the HAD scale can be defined as:
By adding the points of the answers: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13: we obtain the &quot;Total A&quot; which corresponds to the measure of the anxiety, then:
7 or less: absence of symptomatology;
8 to 10: doubtful symptomatology;
11 and above: certain symptomatology.
By adding the points of the answers: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14: we obtain the &quot;Total B&quot; which corresponds to the measure of the depression, then:
7 or less: absence of symptomatology;
8 to 10: doubtful symptomatology;
11 and above: certain symptomatology.
The minimal score is 0 and the maximal total score is 42.</description>
