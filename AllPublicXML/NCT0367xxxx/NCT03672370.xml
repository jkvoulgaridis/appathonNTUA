      The objectives of this study are to obtain survival and outcomes data on the Alloclassic
      Variall Cup ® in combination with the BIOLOX® delta Taper Liner and a BIOLOX® delta Femoral
      Head used in primary total hip arthroplasty. This will be done by analysis of standard
      scoring systems, radiographs and adverse event records.

      Two sites are involved in this study, enrolling a total of 100 patients for the study. All
      subjects were required to participate in the Informed Consent Process.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is skeletally mature.

          -  Patient qualifies for primary unilateral or bilateral total hip arthroplasty (THA)
             based on physical exam and medical history including the following:

               -  Avascular necrosis (AVN)

               -  Osteoarthritis (OA)

               -  Inflammatory arthritis

               -  Post-traumatic arthritis

          -  Patient has no history of previous prosthetic replacement device (any type, including
             surface replacement arthroplasty, endoprosthesis, etc.) of the affected hip joint(s).

          -  Patient has a Harris Hip Score &lt;70 in the affected hip

          -  Patient is willing and able to provide written informed consent.

          -  Patient is willing and able to cooperate in the required post-operative therapy.

          -  Patient is willing and able to complete scheduled follow-up evaluations as described
             in the Informed Consent.

          -  Patient has participated in the Informed Consent process and has signed the Ethics
             Committee approved informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is:

               -  A prisoner

               -  Mentally incompetent or unable to understand what participation in the study
                  entails

               -  A known alcohol or drug abuser

               -  Anticipated to be non-compliant.

          -  The patient has a neuromuscular disorder, vascular disorder or other conditions that
             could contribute to prosthesis instability, prosthesis fixation failure, or
             complications in postoperative care.

          -  The patient has a neurologic condition in the ipsilateral or contralateral limb which
             affects lower limb function.

          -  The patient has a known history of systemic disease that could affect his/her safety
             or the study outcome.

          -  The patient is known to be pregnant.

          -  The patient is unwilling or unable to give informed consent, or to comply with the
             follow-up program.

          -  The patient has an active or latent infection in or about the affected hip joint or an
             infection distant from the hip joint that may spread to the hip hematogenously.

          -  The patient has insufficient bone stock to fix the component. Insufficient bone stock
             exists in the presence of metabolic bone disease (i.e. clinical relevant
             osteoporosis), cancer, and radiation. Note: Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA)
             may be used to assess the presence of adequate bone stock.

          -  The patient has osteoradionecrosis in the operative hip joint

          -  The patient has a known sensitivity or allergic reaction to one or more of the
             implanted materials.

          -  The patient has known local bone tumors in the operative hip.
