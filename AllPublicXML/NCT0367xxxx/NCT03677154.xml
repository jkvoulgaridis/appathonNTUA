  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of
      mosunetuzumab following first-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) immunochemotherapy
      in participants with a best response of partial response, or in participants with previously
      untreated DLBCL who are unable to tolerate full-dose, first-line immunochemotherapy.
