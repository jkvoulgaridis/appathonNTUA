  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, it was aimed to investigating and comparing the postoperative effects of
      leukocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin (L-PRF) and advanced platelet-rich fibrin (A-PRF) in
      terms of pain, swelling on the cheek, and trismus after mandibular third molar surgery. The
      study included a total of 27 patients with bilateral impacted mandibular third molar which
      surgically operated at different times. Patients were evaluated in two randomly separated
      groups. For the first group; A-PRF and for the second group; L-PRF was applied into the tooth
      socket. The outcomes variables were; pain, swelling, the number of analgesics taken, and
      trismus. These variables were also assessed on the basis of; 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 7th days
      following the operation.
