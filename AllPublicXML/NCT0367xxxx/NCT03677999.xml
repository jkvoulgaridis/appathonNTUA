    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to develop and test new Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      methods that can improve the characterization of brain cancer and facilitate improved
      clinical care of these participants. More specifically, investigators are interested in
      applying novel spectroscopic and quantitative MR methods that give information beyond what is
      produced by a clinical brain MRI study and to understand the clinical correlates of the
      imaging findings. Investigators have tested these sequences in healthy volunteers. The
      investigators now wish to test these sequences in brain cancer participants in order to
      understand how these sequences can best be applied in a clinical setting.

      To acquire these data, investigators intend to perform additional MRI acquisitions on
      participants who are scheduled to receive a clinical MRI at the UMN Center for Clinical
      Imaging Research (CCIR), a facility located at the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research
      (CMRR). Since these MRIs are required for the participants' clinical care, the participant
      will not be making additional visits to the CCIR. Based on published data and pilot
      experiences reported from other institutions, the sequences are well-tolerated. The only
      imposition for the participant is that the participant will spend additional time in the
      scanner after completion of the imaging required for clinical care. An informed consent form
      describing the additional MR sequences performed will be presented to the participant.
