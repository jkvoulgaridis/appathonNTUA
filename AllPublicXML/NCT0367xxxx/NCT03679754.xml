  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study involves an investigational product: Ad-RTS-hIL-12 given with veledimex
      for production of human IL-12. IL-12 is a protein that can improve the body's natural
      response to disease by enhancing the ability of the immune system to kill tumor cells and may
      interfere with blood flow to the tumor.

      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single
      intratumoral injection of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 given with oral veledimex.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are scheduled for craniotomy and tumor resection will receive one dose of
      veledimex before the resection procedure. Ad-RTS-hIL-12 will be administered by free-hand
      injection. Patients will continue on oral veledimex for 14 days.

      The study is divided into three periods: the screening period, the treatment period and the
      follow-up period.

             and/or their compliance with the protocol. Examples may include, but are not limited
             to, colitis, pneumonitis, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, myocardial
             infarction within 2 months of screening, and ongoing maintenance therapy for
