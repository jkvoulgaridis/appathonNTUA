      This phase I trial studies the side effects and how well light dosimetry system works during
      photodynamic therapy with porfimer sodium in treating participants with malignant
      mesothelioma or non-small cell lung cancer with pleural disease undergoing surgery. Light
      dosimetry measures the amount of laser light given during photodynamic therapy. Photodynamic
      therapy uses a drug, such as porfimer sodium, that becomes active when it is exposed to
      light. The activated drug may kill tumor cells. Using light dosimetry for intraoperative
      photodynamic therapy may help doctors estimate how much light is delivered during
      photodynamic therapy and decide if the treatment should be stopped or continued.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate that our light dosimetry system is safe and effective in guiding
      intraoperative photodynamic therapy with porfimer sodium (Photofrin).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). II. To examine the
      relationship between immune biomarkers and response.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive porfimer sodium intravenously (IV) over 3-5 minutes and receive
      intraoperative photodynamic therapy (IO-PDT) via a light dosimetry system 24-48 hours later.

      After conclusion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days, within 4 weeks
      from surgery and PDT and every 6 months for 2 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed mesothelioma or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with
             pleural disease without distant disease.

          -  Subjects must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale of 0-2.

          -  Subjects of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraceptive methods
             (e.g., hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry
             and for 6 months after surgery. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform
             her treating physician immediately.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          -  White blood cell (WBC) &lt; 4,000.

          -  Serum creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dL.

          -  Alkaline phosphatase &gt; 3 times the upper normal limit.

          -  Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) or serum glutamate pyruvate
             transaminase (SGPT) &gt; 3 times the upper normal limit.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant or nursing female subjects.

          -  Unwilling or unable to follow protocol requirements.

             candidate to receive porfimer sodium.

          -  Received an investigational agent within 30 days prior to enrollment.
