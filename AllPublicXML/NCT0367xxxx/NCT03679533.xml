  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tremendous progress has been made in characterizing the interactions between the central
      nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. This concept of a gut-brain axis suggests that
      influencing bacteria in the gut is a promising approach for developing new ways of benefiting
      brain function. This is particularly relevant for an ageing population for which cognitive
      decline is a common symptom and can be an indicator for the development of neurodegenerative
      conditions such as dementia. There is good evidence already that nutrition can delay the
      development of cognitive decline in ageing, in particular for ageing-sensitive brain regions
      such as the medial temporal lobe, however this has been little explored for cranberry intake.
      Cranberries are high in plant-derived nutrients called polyphenols, which have been suggested
      to promote brain function and protect against disease-causing mechanisms. In the proposed
      project we will pioneer work to investigate the impact of cranberry intake on gut bacteria
      and how it relates to cognitive performance in ageing and associated regions in the brain.

      This study is being conducted by Chief Investigators Dr David Vauzour and Prof Michael
      Hornberger at the University of East Anglia. Sixty participants (i.e. n=30 control and
      treatment groups) aged 50-80 years old, with no memory complaints will be recruited for this
      12-week double-blind placebo-controlled parallel intervention of cranberry flavonoids.
      Freeze-dried cranberry or a matched placebo will be taken twice daily for the duration of the
      trial. Blood, urine and faecal samples will be collected for microbiome, DNA, biochemical and
      nutritional analysis. Participants will also undergo cognitive testing, as well as MRI
      scanning to detect changes in brain physiology.
