        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

          2. Patients must have received previously standard therapy for that malignancy or
             declined to chemotherapy/radiotherapy.

          3. Estimated life expectancy &gt; 3 months

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0,1 or 2.

          5. Age 18~75 years old

          6. Next-generation sequencing identified tumor mutation burden higher than 9 Muts/MB in
             tumor tissue or peripheral blood samples.

          7. Available for the adequate surgical or core-needle biopsy specimens from primary or
             metastasis lesions to manufacture the DC vaccines.

          8. Measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
             criteria

          9. Adequate hematologic function, with WBC ≥ 3000/microliter, hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL (it is
             acceptable to have had prior transfusion), platelets ≥ 75,000/microliter; PT-INR &lt;1.5
             (unless patient is receiving warfarin in which case PT-INR must be &lt;3), PTT &lt;1.5X ULN

         10. Adequate renal and hepatic function, with serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL, bilirubin &lt;
             1.5 mg/dL (except for Gilbert's syndrome which will allow bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL), ALT
             and AST ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a history of autoimmune disease, such as but not restricted to,
             inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis,
             scleroderma, or multiple sclerosis. Autoimmune related thyroid disease and vitiligo
             are permitted.

          2. Patients with serious intercurrent chronic or acute illness, such as cardiac disease
             (NYHA class III or IV), hepatic disease, or other illness considered by the Principal
             Investigator as unwarranted high risk for investigational drug treatment.

          3. Patients with a medical or psychological impediment to probable compliance with the
             protocol should be excluded.

          4. Concurrent (or within the last 5 years) second malignancy other than non melanoma skin
             cancer, cervical carcinoma in situ, controlled superficial bladder cancer, or other
             carcinoma in situ that has been treated.

          5. Presence of an active acute or chronic infection including: a urinary tract infection,
             HIV (as determined by ELISA and confirmed by Western Blot). Patients with HIV are
             excluded based on immuno-suppression, which may render them unable to respond to the
             vaccine; patients with chronic hepatitis are excluded because of concern that
             hepatitis could be exacerbated by the injections.

          6. Patients on chronic steroid therapy (or other immuno-suppressives, such as
             azathioprine or cyclosporin A) are excluded on the basis of potential immune
             suppression. Patients must have had 6 weeks of discontinuation of any steroid therapy
             (except that used as pre-medication for chemotherapy or contrast-enhanced studies or
             for acute treatment (&lt;5 days) of intercurrent medical condition such as a gout flare)
             prior to enrollment.

          7. Pregnant and nursing women should be excluded from the protocol since this research
             may have unknown and harmful effects on an unborn child or on young children. If the
             patient is sexually active, the patient must agree to use a medically acceptable form
             of birth control while receiving treatment and for a period of 4 months following the
             last vaccination therapy. It is not known whether the treatment used in this study
             could affect the sperm and could potentially harm a child that may be fathered while
             on this study.

          8. Patients with acute or chronic skin disorders that will interfere with injection into
             the skin of the extremities or subsequent assessment of potential skin reactions will
             be excluded.
