  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether a Brief Mind-Body Bridging Intervention for
      Suicidal Ideation (MBB-SI) will result in short or longer-term reduction of psychological
      factors associated with suicidal ideation (SI) and/or suicide-related behaviors (SRB's)
      compared to Treatment as Usual (TAU).

    <description>Determine if there is a significant difference in the frequency and/or intensity of suicidal ideation, as measured by the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS) among the MBB-SI + TAU cohort compared to the TAU. We will use the total BSS score, ranging from 0 to 38. Increased scores reflect greater suicide risk.</description>

Each group will involve up to 15 participants and will be led by a trained MBB facilitator. Participants will receive a workbook at the beginning of the training that contains an explanation of all the major concepts involved in Mind Body Bridging. The workbook has homework assignments to be completed daily between group sessions.</description>
