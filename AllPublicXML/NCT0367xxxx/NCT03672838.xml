  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with clinically confirmed neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or neurofibromatosis type 2
      (NF2) or a known neurofibromatosis (NF) mutation aged 5 years and above will be eligible to
      participate and will be recruited from the neurofibromatosis clinic. Given the need for
      identifying measures that can reliably and sensitively measure focal muscle weakness and
      allow for measuring muscle strength as a functional outcome in therapeutic clinical trials in
      NF, this pilot study will assess the reliability of measuring muscle strength in NF1 and NF2
      using a hand-held dynamometer.
