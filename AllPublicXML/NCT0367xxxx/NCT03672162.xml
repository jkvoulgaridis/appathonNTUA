      Comparison of effectiveness of preoperative Gabapentin with Celecoxib in reducing acute
      postoperative pain in abdominal hysterectomy, A randomized double blind controlled trial
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) is the most common gynecological operation worldwide.Some
      studies noticed about overused of opioids in postoperative care , leaded to more adverse
      effect of opioids , slowly recovery , prolong length of hospitalized stay and consequently
      increase unnecessary cost of treatment.

      ERAS guidelines has considered to use preoperative analgesics for reducing post-operative
      opioids consumption, including Gabapentin and Celecoxib.

      Gabapentin and celecoxib widely used for treatment of pain and many studies have demonstrated
      the preoperative efficacy and safety of Gabapentin and Celecoxib in variety procedures
      involving hysterectomy.However, no definite conclusion of optimal dose and timing for
      preopearive uptake ,apart from no good evidences based supported preoperative Gabapentin or
      Celecoxib in hysterectomy in Thailand . In addition, the protocol for preoperative analgesics
      in hysterectomy, has not been performed in the investigator's center.

      Therefore the aim of this study is to assess and compare the efficacy and safety of
      preoperative Gabapentin and Celecoxib to reduce acute postoperative pain in non-gynecological
      cancerous woman undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy
