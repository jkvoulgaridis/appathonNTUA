  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lifestyle factors, such as diet, physical activity and sleep, are associated with the
      development of many chronic diseases. The objective of The Manitoba Personalized Lifestyle
      Research (TMPLR) study is to understand how these lifestyle factors interact with each other
      and additional factors, such as an individual's genetics and gut microbiome, to influence
      health. This is an exploratory cross-sectional observational cohort study of adults, with
      extensive phenotyping by objective health and lifestyle assessments, and retrospective
      assessment of early life experiences, with retrospective and prospective utilization of
      secondary data from administrative health records. A planned non-random convenience sample of
      840 Manitobans aged 30-46 recruited from the general population, stratified by sex (equal
      males and females), body mass index (BMI; 60% of participants with a BMI &gt;25 kg/m2), and
      geography (25% from rural areas,). These stratifications were selected based on Manitoba
      demographics. Lifestyle factors assessed will include dietary pattern, physical activity,
      cardiovascular fitness and sleep. Additional factors such as medical history, socio-economic
      status, alcohol and tobacco consumption, cognition, stress and anxiety, and early life
      experiences will also be documented. A maternal survey will be performed. Body composition
      and bone density will be measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Blood pressure, pulse
      wave velocity, and augmentation index will be measured on two consecutive days. Chronic
      disease risk biomarkers will be measured in blood and urine samples. DNA will be extracted
      for genetic analysis. A fecal sample will be collected for microbiome analysis. Participants
      may provide their Manitoba Personal Health Information Number (PHIN) to link their study data
      with administrative health records.

        A sample of 800 Manitobans aged 30-46, stratified by sex, BMI, and geography are being
        recruited. Participants must have lived in Manitoba for a minimum of 5 years. Women who are
        pregnant or lactating are not eligible to participate. Additionally, because it is expected
        that very few of the 800 Manitobans who join TMPLR study from the general public will have
        reduced kidney function (eGFR &lt;30 ml/min), 40 participants (20 female, 20 male, with no set
        stratification based on BMI or geography) who have severely reduced kidney function are
        being recruited from the renal health clinic at Seven Oaks General Hospital (Winnipeg,
        Manitoba).
