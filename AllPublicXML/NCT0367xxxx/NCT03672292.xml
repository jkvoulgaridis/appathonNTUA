      Study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of coadminstration of SCY-078 with a mold-active
      azole (voriconazole) compared to voriconazole in patients with invasive pulmonary
      aspergillosis.

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, two-arm study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, efficacy and PK of the coadministration of SCY-078 plus voriconazole compared
      to those of voriconazole in male and female subjects 18 years of age and older with a
      hematological malignancy (HM) or a myelodysplastic syndrome or aplastic anemia or
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and a probable or proven invasive pulmonary
      aspergillosis based on EORTCMSG criteria. In addition, all subjects must be positive (≥0.5)
      for serum GMI.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is a male or female adult ≥18 years of age on the day the study informed
             consent form (ICF) is signed.

          2. Subject has a probable or proven IPA based on EORTC-MSG criteria.

          3. Subject has a result of a serum GMI ≥0.5 from a sample obtained within the 96 hours
             preceding enrollment into the study (Baseline/Treatment Day 1).

          4. Subject has a diagnosis of a hematological malignancy or a myelodysplastic syndrome or
             aplastic anemia or has undergone hematopoietic cell transplantation OR

          5. Subject who either recently resolved or ongoing neutropenia (neutropenia defined as
             absolute neutrophil count &lt; 0.5 x 109/L [&lt; 500/mm3] for &gt; 10 days), temporally related
             to the onset of fungal disease OR

          6. Subject who received treatment with other recognized T-cell immunosuppressants (such
             as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, monoclonal antibodies or nucleoside analogs) during the
             past 90 days including solid organ transplant patients OR

          7. Subject with inherited severe immunodeficiency (e.g. chronic granulomatous disease,
             severe combined immunodeficiency)

          8. Subject has not received more than 4 days (96 hours) of prior mold-active antifungal
             therapy for the treatment of the IPA episode in the 7 days preceding enrollment into
             the study (Baseline/Treatment Day 1). However, subjects who have received more than 4
             days but less than 7 days of prior mold-active antifungal therapy for the treatment of
             the IPA episode in the 7 days preceding enrollment into the study may be enrolled but
             will require approval from the study medical monitor, who will evaluate each subject
             on a case-by-case basis.

          9. Subject has an IPA episode that, in the investigator´s judgement, requires antifungal
             therapy and may be adequately treated with voriconazole (i.e., the IPA is not a
             breakthrough infection while receiving a mold-active azole antifungal [voriconazole,
             posaconazole, isavuconazole or itraconazole] that requires therapy with a non-azole
             antifungal agent).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has a fungal disease with central nervous system involvement suspected at
             Screening.

          2. Subject is receiving, has received or anticipates to be receiving concomitant
             medications that are listed in the prohibited medication list (Appendix A in full
             protocol) within the specified washout periods.

          3. Subject has a Karnofsky score &lt;20.

          4. Subject is expected to die from a non-infectious cause within 30 days from the day the
             study ICF is signed.

          5. Subject is under mechanical ventilation.

          6. Subject has abnormal liver test parameters: AST or ALT &gt;5 x ULN and/or total bilirubin
             &gt;2.5 x ULN.
