  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Capillary refill is used clinically to assess multiple things in children. This is a
      prospective observational study of the correlation between capillary refill time and degree
      of dehydration in children seen in a pediatric ED.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patient presenting to the pediatric ER at OHSU less than 10 years are eligible to be
      enrolled if being seen for a condition putting them at risk for dehydration including emesis,
      diarrhea, etc. Children will have their capillary refill time measured and then sent home
      with a digital scale to track their weight. This will serve as the standard for calculating
      percent dehydration. When a patient has reached a stable weight at 1 week we will assume this
      is their healthy weight. There is no intervention in the study.
