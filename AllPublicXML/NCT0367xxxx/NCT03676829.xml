  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to test a new treatment method, arterial embolization of the shoulder (AES), to
      reduce the severity of pain and improve range of motion (ROM), and to see if it can be
      performed safely.

      Purpose: The primary aims of this study are to determine if arterial embolization of the
      shoulder will reduce the severity of pain as well improve Range of Motion (ROM) caused by
      adhesive capsulitis and if it can be performed safely. The secondary aim is to determine if
      AES can result in the decreased necessity for ongoing conservative therapies, such as
      medication therapy and joint injections.

      Participants: Twenty patients with adhesive capsulitis, resulting in shoulder pain that is
      refractory to conservative therapies, who are not planning to undergo surgery within 6
      months.

      Procedures (methods): This will be an open label 24-month pilot study with a small population
      undergoing AES to determine safety and efficacy. Clinical procedures and evaluations will
      consist of a preoperative screening assessment to determine if the potential study subject
      meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria, enrollment, surgical procedure for arterial
      embolization of the shoulder, and follow-up visits at 24 hours, 1, 3 &amp; 6 months. An MRI will
      be performed at the 1-month visit to detect a change in capsular vascularity and to exclude
      complication.

    <description>The pain intensity is assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS), which is a horizontal line 100 mm in length. Subjects mark the VAS with a single vertical line to indicate their current pain level, with 0 mm representing &quot;No Pain&quot; and 100 mm representing &quot;Worst Possible Pain&quot;. Pain will be assessed at each of the patient's follow-up visits and used to measure the change from baseline (prior to the AES procedure). The investigators will use this to measure if the patient's pain level decreases.</description>

    <measure>Patient Function</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Shoulder Score (ASES) will be used to measure function. This is a score derived from a questionnaire in which the patient answers questions regarding range of motion, stiffness, and pain and how it affects the ability to function.</description>

    <description>Arterial Embolization of the Shoulder (AES) is a new procedure that is being used to reduce pain and improve range of motion (ROM) caused by adhesive capsulitis. Embolization is a procedure where physicians intentionally block the blood vessels to specific areas of the body to prevent blood flow to that region. By doing this, the decrease in blood flow will decrease the size of the area of interest. In this case, the goal is to decrease the size of inflammatory tissue around the shoulder, resulting in improvement of pain, stiffness and from adhesive capsulitis.</description>
