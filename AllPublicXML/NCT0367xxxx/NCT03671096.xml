  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
      intrastromal implantation of the Allotex TCA for improving distance vision in hyperopic
      subjects.

      The overall objective with respect to visual outcome is to provide improved vision without
      the requirement of additional visual aids.

      This research provides a method to primarily correct refractive error by implanting a natural
      tissue graft. The level of correction will range from +1.00 to +6.00D which represents a
      range of refractive error that is difficult to manage using the same refractive surgical
      techniques used to correct myopia.

      The other objective is to assess graft tolerance and safety so it can be applied to subjects
      that require other forms of visual correction.

      This technique also permits the potential for graft removal if required and the patient
      should revert back to their previous prescription as no tissue is removed when applying this
      technique.

      Beginning in 1949 with the pioneering work of Jose Barraquer, there has been an interest in
      using natural corneal tissue to change the refractive properties of the eye. In recent years,
      non-allogenic, synthetic corneal implants have received marketing approval in the United
      Stated and Europe for refractive purposes. Although synthetic implants are made of
      biocompatible materials they are not equivalent to an allogenic implant in terms of
      biocompatibility. The Allotex TCA is a piece of acellular cornea, sterilized with electron
      beam radiation and shaped to a particular shape using a laser. The availability of precise
      laser shaping systems and sterile corneas are the key factors that make the use of allogenic
      implants possible.

      The implant is placed on the posterior surface of Bowmans layer of the cornea, in a corneal
      flap formed by a femtosecond laser.

    <description>The primary effectiveness endpoint is predictability of the refractive error within ±1.00 D of the intended refractive outcome at 6 months post-operatively. A minimum of 65% of eyes should have an achieved manifest refraction within ±1.00 D of the intended refractive outcome.</description>
