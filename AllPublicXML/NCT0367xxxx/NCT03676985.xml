  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1+2, open-label, dose-escalation, and multidose study, aiming to investigate
      the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ZKAB001 (a fully human monoclonal antibody
      targeting the Programmed Death - Ligand 1 (PD-L1) membrane receptor on T lymphocytes and
      other cells of the immune system) administered every 14 days in subjects with limited stage
      of high-grade osteosarcoma of maintenance therapy after adjuvant chemotherapy.

      The study will consist of 4 periods: Screening (up to 28 days), Lead-in period (Day -28),
      Treatment (up to 24 cycles or 1 year, whichever occurs first), and Follow-up (up to 2 years).
      There will be a lead-in period on Day -28 for each dose escalation cohort in which the
      single-dose pharmacokinetics(PK) of ZKAB001 will be characterized prior to initiation of
      continuous dosing in the first cycle of treatment. The lead-in period duration, PK
      time-points, doses and/or regimens used in subsequent cohorts may be modified based on the
      exposure (AUC) observed during the lead-in period (although the number of PK samples will not
      be increased). Treatment of continuous dosing is up to 24 cycles or 1 year, until as per
      investigator's opinion, subjects experience disease progression (evaluated by RECIST 1.1), no
      clinical benefit, or intolerable toxicity. If investigators suspect subjects experience
      pseudoprogression or has evidence to prove &quot;mixed response&quot;, subjects can continue to accept
      treatment as investigator decided.
