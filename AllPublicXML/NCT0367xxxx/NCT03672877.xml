  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial, comparing 3 months of intensive leg exercise to
      standard physiotherapy care for the improvement of gross motor function in young children
      with spastic diplegia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children born prematurely are at risk of brain injury that can result in cerebral palsy, most
      often affecting both legs. Current treatment is largely passive, including leg braces,
      repeated injection of a paralyzing agent (botulinum toxin) in muscles that are abnormally
      active, and surgery as deformities occur. Active, physical therapy for weak muscles is
      infrequent, occurring twice a month or less. Yet, recent work in mammals show that early
      brain injury can be alleviated by intensive exercise therapy, but only while the animal is
      very young.

      Building on our success with early, intensive therapy for children with perinatal stroke, we
      will apply intensive therapy for the legs in children with cerebral palsy involving both
      legs. Children (8 mo - 3 yr old) will be randomly assigned to start treatment immediately or
      delay treatment for 6 months. The delay period controls for improvement without treatment.
      The children in the Delay Group will have the option to receive the same treatment after the
      delay period. The therapy will be guided by physical therapists, and centered on play.
      Measures will be taken before, during and after the delay and treatment periods. Measures
      will include clinical scores of motor development, proficiency of walking, participation at
      home, and physiological measures of motor and sensory function. All children will be followed
      until they turn 4 yr old, to determine if there are long term benefits. The
      cost-effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated by a health economist. We anticipate
      that early intensive exercise will improve mobility, facilitate earlier and better walking,
      and that the effects will be enduring.

    <description>The portable spasticity assessment device (PSAD) will be used to measure response to stretch in the ankle plantarflexors. A hand-held segment of the device is applied to a limb segment to measure the forces applied by the hand to the limb and the motion of the limb. Disposable, surface electromyographic electrodes are applied to the skin of the limb to measure the muscle activity.</description>
