      The objectives of this study are to obtain survival and outcome data on the Allofit IT Shell
      in combination with the BIOLOX® delta Taper Liner when used in primary total hip
      arthroplasty.

      This will be done by analysis of standard scoring systems, radiographs and adverse event
      records. Data will be used to monitor pain, mobility and survivorship, and to confirm the
      safety and performance of the Allofit IT Ceramic Bearing System.

      A total of 200 patients will be enrolled in this study that will last 12 years (2 year
      enrollment plus 10 years follow-up) with the following visits at 6 months, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and
      10 years post-operatively.

    <measure>&quot;Harris Hip Score&quot; is a SINGLE form to measure the functional outcome of the patient.</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Harris Hip Score is a questionnaire filled by the surgeon with the patient who received a hip implant. The domains covered are: pain (44 points), function (47 points), range of motion (5 points), and absence of deformity (4 points). Patients select a discrete set of answers which correspond to predefined point allocations based on the category. To obtain a final score, these values are summed. The scale then ranges as Excellent: 90 - 100, Good: 80 - 89, Fair: 70 - 79, Poor: &lt; 70.</description>

    <measure>Subject quality-of-life determined by the SF-12 score</measure>

    <description>The SF-12 is a 12-item questionnaire in accordance with the &quot;quality of life&quot; questioning standards of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Committee for Outcomes Research. The questions determine the patient's physical, emotional and social health and will be used to calculate a physical and mental functional score. This form is completed by the patient.</description>

        The study population will be comprised of 200 males and females who require primary total
        hip arthroplasty. Subjects will be enrolled at 4 investigative centers. Subjects must be
        geographically accessible throughout the study and be willing and able to attend required
        follow-up appointments. Candidates who express interest in study participation will be
        offered informed consent, and eligibility will be determined based upon the
        inclusion/exclusion criteria.

          -  Patient qualifies for primary unilateral or bilateral total hip arthroplasty (THA)
