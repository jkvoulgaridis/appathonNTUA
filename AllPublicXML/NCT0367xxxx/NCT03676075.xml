    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators establish a model for the early diagnosis of colorectal
      cancer based on the detection of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) in training group and
      validate the effectiveness of the model using a validation group recruited from multiple
      centers.

    <textblock>
      According to precious studies, 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC)
      are both important epigenetic markers whose changes are associated with many kinds of
      diseases, including cancers. This changes may help diagnose cancer. The new detection method
      for 5-hmC can meet the requirements of liquid biopsy.

      The traditional diagnostic methods for colorectal cancer is colonoscopy and pathology which
      are inconvenient and unpleasant, and sometimes, it is difficult for the very patients to get
      tissues or get enough tissues to confirm the pathologic diagnosis. In addition, other
      screening methods for colorectal cancer,such as guaiac-based fecal occult blood testing and a
      blood test for methylated SEPT9 DNA, have the shortcomings of relatively low sensitivity and
      specificity. As a result, it is imperative to find a new detection method for early diagnosis
      of colorectal cancer with the advantages of high sensitivity and specificity, minimally
      invasive and convenient.

      The aim of this multi-center research is to establish a model for the early diagnosis of
      colorectal cancer by the detection of 5-hmC in plasma cell-free DNA. Patients who are
      diagnosed with colorectal cancer by colonoscopy and pathology and not received any anti-tumor
      therapy (Arm A) will be eligible for inclusion. In addition, patients who suffer with adenoma
      and not received endoscopic resection (Arm B) will be eligible as well as healthy individuals
      with normal colonoscopy (Arm C). Then, 5-hmC in plasma cell-free DNA will be detected and
      compared among the three arms of patients (training group) to establish a model to diagnosis
      other individuals (validation group) who may suffer from colorectal cancer or adenoma.
