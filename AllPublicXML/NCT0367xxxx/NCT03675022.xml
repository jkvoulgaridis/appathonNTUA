    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a common disorder with serious consequences that remains
      underrecognized, with &gt;80% of OSA patients undiagnosed, and undertreated due to inadequate
      treatment options. The development of additional treatments for OSA, such as pharmacotherapy,
      are critically needed.

      The collaboration between Regeneron and Sanofi are funding this project. Regeneron will be
      providing the drug and the contract will be with Regeneron. Both companies are involved as it
      is a collaboration across the companies.

    <textblock>
      Clinical Background on OSA OSA is a prevalent disorder, with roughly 1 in 5 adults estimated
      to have at least mild OSA and 1 in 15 estimated to have at least moderate OSA. Furthermore,
      OSA causes a number of adverse cardiovascular, neurocognitive, and daytime functional
      consequences. As a result, understanding the pathophysiology and developing treatments is a
      major public health goal. Unfortunately, only approximately 50% of patients tolerate the main
      therapy for OSA, Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP). Therefore, new therapeutic
      approaches are clearly needed.

      OSA is caused by collapse of the pharyngeal airway during sleep due to the sleep
      state-related loss of pharyngeal muscle activity. High nasal resistance can contribute to
      pharyngeal collapse as well by increasing the suction pressure downstream in the velo- and
      oropharynx. In fact, a recent study in 139 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS)
      demonstrated an extremely high prevalence of OSA (65% of the CRS patients had OSA compared to
      a prevalence in the normal population of 5-15%). Therefore, a drug that reduces nasal
      congestion and pharyngeal edema, such as dupilumab, could potentially improve OSA in some
      patients.

      Immunologic Background on OSA and role of Type 2 inflammation Indeed, preliminary
      patient-reported outcomes data from early clinical trials with dupilumab have shown that
      dupilumab treatment of patients with sinus disease reduces reports of nocturnal awakenings,
      as well as sleep-related outcomes on the SinoNasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22). In addition to the
      known effects of dupilumab on the reduction of nasal polyp size/volume, there is ample
      evidence to propose that the specific anti-inflammatory effects achieved with IL-4Rα blockade
      will be particularly relevant to a potential therapeutic effect of dupilumab on OSA in
      patients with comorbid CRS. There are a number of Type 2 inflammatory markers that are
      increased in patients with CRS and OSA, which taken together suggest that OSA in these
      patients is truly an inflammatory disease, and not solely a disease of abnormal anatomy.
      Serum IL-4 levels are elevated in patients with rhinitis and OSA, and those levels are
      negatively correlated with time spent in REM sleep. Furthermore, two inflammatory markers of
      mast cell activation, urinary leukotriene E4 and urinary prostaglandin D2, are also known to
      be elevated in OSA, likely due to the increased chronic mast cell stimulation afforded by the
      high circulating IL-4 levels. Strikingly, both urinary leukotriene E4 and prostaglandin D2
      levels correlate with OSA severity, as measured by either percentage of overnight time spent
      with SaO2 &lt;90% or the apnea/hypopnea index (AHI).

      There is additional clinical evidence to suggest that OSA may be more than &quot;just&quot; an anatomic
      disease. Although endoscopic sinus surgery to remove inflamed sinus tissue in patients with
      OSA and CRS does improve OSA symptoms, non-surgical anti-inflammatory treatments, including
      intranasal steroids and leukotriene modification with montelukast, have also been found to
      improve OSA symptoms and decrease the AHI.

      Given these immunological findings, the investigators suspect that extensive Type 2
      inflammation is a major contributing factor for patients with CRS and OSA, and that IL-4Rα
      blockade will be a powerful therapeutic tool in sleep apnea. In combination with the
      preliminary patient-reported outcomes data suggesting that dupilumab improves sleep quality,
      the investigators feel confident that dupilumab will successfully provide a
      clinically-quantifiable therapeutic improvement on the severity of OSA in patients with CRS
      and OSA. As there are currently no FDA-approved medications for the treatment of OSA, and 65%
      of all patients with CRS suffer from OSA, the investigators feel as though positive results
      from this pilot trial would be a powerful step towards providing a new biologic therapy to an
      underserved medical population.

    <description>Epworth Sleepiness Score (ESS) - The ESS asks the respondent to rate on a 4-point scale (0-3) their usual chances of having dozed off or fallen asleep while engaged in eight different activities that differ widely in their somnificity. The total ESS score (the sum of 8 item-scores) gives an estimate of a more general characteristic, the person's 'average sleep propensity' or ASP, across a wide range of activities in their daily lives. Scores range from 0 to 24, 0 being not sleepy at all and 24 being the most sleepy.</description>

    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) - The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is an effective instrument used to measure the quality and patterns of sleep in adults. It differentiates &quot;poor&quot; from &quot;good&quot; sleep quality by measuring seven areas (components): subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction over the last month. A total score of &quot;5&quot; or greater is indicative of poor sleep quality. If you scored &quot;5&quot; or more it is suggested that you discuss your sleep habits with a healthcare provider. Each item is weighted on a 0-3 interval scale. The global PSQI score is then calculated by totaling the seven component scores, providing an overall score ranging from 0 to 21, where lower scores denote a healthier sleep quality. A higher score indicates that a person generally has difficulty carrying out certain activities because you are too sleepy or tired.</description>
