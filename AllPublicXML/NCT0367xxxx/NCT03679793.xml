  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trigger finger, also known as trigger digit or stenosing tenovaginitis, is caused by a size
      mismatch between the flexor tendon and the A1 pulley, which is generally characterized by
      pain, swelling, the limitation of finger range of motion and a symptomatic locking or
      clicking sensation. Conservative treatment options include the application of non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), physiotherapy, electrotherapy, splinting and corticosteroid
      injection but not always effective with regard to frequent recurrence. Open surgical release
      of the A1 pulley remains the gold standard of treating symptomatic trigger finger. While
      percutaneous release is a minimal invasive alternative and gaining popularity for the index,
      middle ring and little fingers, investigations for the surgical efficacy on thumb is few and
      far between. Investigators believe that a carefully conducted operation with proper
      positioning of the thumb, wide-awake approach and meticulous technique can achieve similar
      efficacy and safety in terms of possibly less intraoperative pain, imperceptible scar and
      early return to daily activities and routine work.

      The hypothesis of this study is that by using a proper positioning of thumb, wide awake
      approach and meticulous technique in conducting percutaneous release of trigger thumb can
      achieve similar efficacy and safety compared to that of open release surgical method.
      Moreover, percutaneous release of trigger thumb can generate less intraoperative pain,
      imperceptible scar and promote early return to routine work.

      Hence, the objective of this study is to investigate and compare the safety, effectiveness
      and outcome of percutaneous release versus traditional open release for trigger thumbs.
