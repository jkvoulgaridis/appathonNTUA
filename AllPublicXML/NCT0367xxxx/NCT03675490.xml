  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults who are referred to home care physiotherapy often only get to see the
      physiotherapist three to five times and are expected to continue exercising on their own. We
      have developed an interactive technology called ABLE that helps older adults do exercise in
      their homes by making it fun and interactive. We want to see if we can help 25 older adults
      to exercise with ABLE for three months and if exercising with ABLE for three months changes
      older adults' strength and balance. A physiotherapist will visit the older adults three times
      in their homes and show them how to use ABLE and which exercises to do. We will measure older
      adults' strength and balance before and after using the program and ask them and their family
      members for feedback about using ABLE. The results of our study will help us decide if we can
      do a bigger study to test the effect of using ABLE in a larger group of older adults, and to
      see what effect ABLE might have on strength and balance. The study will also help us
      incorporate feedback from the older adults and their families to improve ABLE for the next
      study.

    <description>Participants will engage in a physiotherapist-prescribed home exercise program with ABLE, the interactive technology. The exercises that will be prescribed are designed to improve functional mobility via challenging lower extremity strength and balance in a multicomponent exercise program. The difficulty of each exercise will be chosen at the discretion of the physiotherapist based on the participants' performance on the baseline assessments. The exercises will be prescribed at a moderate intensity (moderate balance challenge, 8-12 repetitions for strength exercises with the last few repetitions being challenging) and will be progressed over the study duration to ensure they remain a moderate challenge.</description>
