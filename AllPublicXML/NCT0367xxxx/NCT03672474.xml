  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      REGEnLIFE RGn530 is a photobiomodulation medical device, consisting in a modular helmet and
      abdominal panel, composed of near-infrared low-level lasers (LLLT), near-infrared and red
      LEDs as well as a static magnetic field. RGn device application on both head and abdomen have
      demonstrated striking efficacy in preclinical studies. The investigator's results clearly
      indicated that RGn treatment produces a normalization of all parameters that are strongly
      modified in the model, including memory performances associated to oxidative stress,
      neuroinflammation or apoptosis markers, microbiota composition and specific markers related
      to the amyloid or tau processes (Blivet et al., Alzheimers Dement (NY), 2018).

      Following such promising results, this pilot clinical study will evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of REGEnLIFE RGn530 device on cognitive performances evolution from mild-to-moderate
      Alzheimer's disease patients. The double-blind, randomized, monocentric sham-controlled
      clinical trial will be performed at the CHU de Montpellier. 64 patients will be enrolled: 32
      in photobiomodulation group and 32 in sham group. Each patient will follow 8 weeks of
      treatment with 5 sessions of 25min per week (total of 40 sessions) and will undergo, for a
      total period of three months, series of clinical examinations including cognitive evaluation,
      biological and electrophysiological analyses, sleep recordings, and imaging assessments.

      REGEnLIFE RGn530 medical device will follow EC labelling if proven to be safe and effective.
      In the light of anti-amyloid therapeutic approaches lack of success, RGn530 dual treatment is
      hoped to be particularly valuable as an innovative and extensive treatment strategy for AD.

      Design : Prospective monocentric double-blind pilot study with 2 parallel groups of 32
      patients. One with photobiomodulation (device set up and activated), the other with
      placebo-sham procedure (device set up but not activated). The study will consist of an
      inclusion visit (V0, D-30 to D-10), a photobiomodulation start visit (V1, D0), followed by 3
      follow-up visits (V2 to D30, V3 to D60 and V4 to D90).

      Dispositive : Photobiomodulation device developed by REGEnLIFE, RGn530 consisting of a
      modular helmet and an abdominal modular panel each comprising modules composed of low
      intensity infrared lasers (LLLT - Low Level Laser Therapy), infrared and red LEDs and a
      static magnetic field. The helmet and abdominal panel devices are connected to a steering
      console. Activation of the device will be done by personnel trained for this purpose by
      REGEnLIFE.

      Originality and innovation : This study proposes to evaluate a new medical photobiomodulation
      device in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. These techniques have shown positive and
      promising results in the following areas: wound healing, pain management, inflammation,
      tissue regeneration, and the following disciplines: neuropsychiatry, dermatology and
      neurology.

      Photobiomodulation is a technology of the same family as phototherapy, also called LLLT (Low
      Level Laser Therapy). It can be defined as the directional use of monochromatic or
      polychromatic light from low energy lasers and / or LEDs, in wavelengths included in the
      visible, infrared and near infrared, to modulate a function or induce a therapeutic effect in
      an athermal, non-invasive and non-destructive manner.

      This pilot study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this new non-invasive
      pre-marking device in patients with mild to moderate AD. To date, no study has been published
      with this device on this typology of patients.

      Duration of treatment : 8 weeks with 5 sessions of 25 minutes per week, for a total of 40
      sessions.

      Study population : Patients with international AD diagnosis criteria according to McKhann et
      al., 2011 at mild to moderate stage (MMSE score between 16-26), having agreed and signed free
      and informed consent to participate in this study, without contraindications to the carrying
      out of the complementary investigations necessary for the evaluation of the efficiency and
      the tolerance of the RGn530.

      Schedule of visits : Each patient will be followed for 3 months at the rate of 5 visits:
      inclusion V0 (D-10 to D-30), V1 (D0), V2 (M1), V3 (M2) and V4 (M3).

      Number of patients : 64 patients will be included in this study: 32 in the photobiomodulation
      group and 32 in the placebo-sham group.

      Duration of patient follow-up : Each patient will be followed for a total duration of 3
      months with visits involving clinical, biological, electrophysiological, imaging, tests and
      questionnaires to assess the efficacy and tolerance of RGn530.
