    <textblock>
      The investigators now know that treating chronic kidney disease in its early stages can
      prevent dialysis and reduce heart problems that go along with kidney disease. Computerized
      tools may help primary care doctors to diagnose the disease earlier and computer reminders
      may help doctors to prescribe the best treatments for hypertension (HTN) which will prevent
      dialysis and heart problems. In this project the investigators will create computer reminders
      and the investigators will test them in clinics to see if they improve treatment of high
      blood pressure in early chronic kidney disease.

      Hypothesis: The mean systolic blood pressure of the chronic kidney disease (CKD) population
      can be decreased by an intervention with three innovative features: 1) methods to synthesize
      electronic health record (EHR) data in order to identify under-diagnosed chronic conditions,
      2) iterative improvement in clinical decision support (CDS) content through human factors
      methods to maximize the &quot;informativeness&quot; of the CDS, and 3) the use of behavioral economic
      principles to create behavioral &quot;nudges&quot; internal and external to the CDS.

      Specific Aim 1: To develop and validate the intervention. Specific Aim 1a: To develop and
      validate the CDS that will: 1) synthesize existing laboratory tests, medication orders, and
      vital sign data; 2) increase recognition of CKD, 3) increase recognition of uncontrolled HTN
      in CKD patients; and 4) deliver evidence-based CKD and HTN management recommendations. The
      validation will consist of an 8-week silent run-in period and chart review.

      Specific Aim 1b: To improve the &quot;informativeness&quot; of the content of the CDS using human
      factors methods, specifically by conducting a &quot;think-aloud&quot; study.

      Specific Aim 1c: To develop a &quot;wrap-around&quot; intervention including three behavioral &quot;nudges&quot;:
      1) pre-checked default orders, 2) an in-person conference with PCPs to obtain their
      commitment to follow the CDS recommendations, and 3) a required &quot;accountable justification&quot;
      if the PCP does not follow the CDS recommendations.

      Aim 1a Study Procedures:

      The investigators will modify the CDS rules for diagnosing CKD from the &quot;Maintaining Accurate
      Problem Lists in the EHR&quot; study. Then, they will create rules for automated diagnosis of
      uncontrolled hypertension (HTN). They will implement the CDS in &quot;silent mode&quot; for the control
      arm. This means that the investigators will identify control patients in real time according
      to the same inclusion criteria as intervention patients.

      Develop Rules for Evidence-based Recommendations for HTN in CKD: The investigators will
      leverage past work that they have done in a study that delivered recommendations based on
      national guidelines. An example of one of the rules is to determine whether anti-hypertensive
      agents have been prescribed but are not at highest potency. If so, the CDS will deliver a
      recommendation to increase the dosage. The investigators will also include one-click access
      to documentation and orders relevant for CKD. For example, a message that gives a specific
      diagnosis, &quot;This patient has stage 3b CKD with unknown level of albuminuria&quot;), as well as an
      actionable order, &quot;Click here to order a urine microalbumin to creatinine ratio test.&quot; The
      CDS will include a blood pressure (BP) entry field in which a primary care physician (PCP)
      can record a repeat BP reading. If the PCP enters a BP reading, it will automatically be
      recorded in the vital signs flowsheet and vice versa.

      Implementation: The CDS will be moved to the Production environment in &quot;silent mode&quot; eight
      weeks before the scheduled start date of the trial, where it will record when it would fire,
      but it will not be displayed to the user. This step will allow us to validate that the rules
      are accurately identifying patients and producing the correct recommendations through a chart
      review. The investigators will review 10 charts of patients with CKD and uncontrolled HTN per
      clinic for a total of 150 charts. The CDS will be activated in the Production environment on
      the start date of the clinical trial in Aim 2.

      Aim 1b Study Procedures:

      Task Scenario Development, Pilot Test and Usability Test Procedure: Usability testing
      clinical scenarios will be developed by two subject matter experts. Tasks will include adding
      CKD to the problem list, placing lab and/or medication orders, and printing patient education
      handouts. The usability test will be piloted with a PCP and the investigators will ask for
      feedback on the usability test procedure, as well as content and wording of test scenarios.

      The goal of Aim 1b is to iteratively improve other important aspects of the CDS that
      contribute to the overall informativeness of the CDS. The investigators will conduct
      usability tests with ten PCPs. After each test, the research team and Epic build specialist
      will make iterative changes to the content of the CDS and layout of information.

      Qualitative analysis: Qualitative methods will be employed to analyze the data. The
      transcripts will be organized by task and participant and then quotes will be identified that
      illustrate a user expectation, frustration, or misinterpretation of content or functionality.

      Aim 1c Study Procedures:

        1. Pre-checked, no-action default: The first nudge will be part of the CDS. The
           investigators will display the CDS with certain options pre-selected. They plan to
           include addition of the CKD diagnosis to the problem list and addition of a patient
           education handout to the after-visit summary.

        2. In-person meeting to obtain commitment from PCPs to follow the CDS recommendations: As a
           starting point, the investigators need to ensure that PCPs are aware of the clinical
           practice guidelines. The PI will visit each clinic and invite the intervention arm PCPs
           to a lunchtime session where she will present an overview of the guidelines and will ask
           each PCP to sign a short statement committing to change their CKD management in
           accordance with the CDS recommendations.

        3. Accountable Justification: The CDS will include an accountable justification prompt. If
           the PCP deselects the default options and/or does not interact with the CDS, the
           accountable justification prompt will appear. If the PCP enters a repeat BP measurement
           or prints a patient handout, these actions will silence the alert.

      Implementation guide: After the investigators conduct the qualitative study in Aim 1b and the
      in-person meetings, they will develop an implementation guide. They will include the
      implementation guide as an appendix to a manuscript describing the intervention and clinical
      trial protocol.

      Specific Aim 2: To test the effectiveness of the intervention. Specific Aim 2a: To evaluate
      whether the intervention developed in Aim 1 significantly decreases mean systolic blood
      pressure in a population of CKD patients with blood pressure &gt; 140/90, N=2,350 (N derived
      from EHR data about primary care patients at 15 clinics). They will evaluate the
      effectiveness of the intervention in a pragmatic, cluster-randomized controlled trial,
      randomized at the level of the physician (180 PCPs). Secondary outcomes will include
      hypertension-specific process measures, such as treatment intensification.

      Specific Aim 2b: To evaluate whether the intervention improves process measures for quality
      of CKD care including: documented CKD diagnosis, annual serum creatinine test, and annual
      urine albumin test.

      Specific Aim 2c: To perform a cross-over study in order to evaluate the effect of the
      intervention on PCP behavior and PCPs' intention to change behavior.

    <intervention_model_description>PCPs will be stratified based on two factors (size of CKD panel and mean SBP). Within these strata, PCPs will be randomized to intervention and control arms in a 1:1 ratio. At study start, each CKD patient seen by a participating PCP will be assigned to the same arm as their PCP. The intervention will be in place for 12 months and data collection will continue for an additional 12 months. In the second phase of the study, we have embedded a one-way (unidirectional) cross-over design (i.e., the PCPs cross over in one direction only, from control to intervention). The second phase of the study will allow us to detect secular trends and contamination, which will serve as preliminary data for future trials.</intervention_model_description>
