    <description>The treatment combination period should start the day after the planned dose of venetoclax is reached. The initial schedule will be a 21-day cycle with a weekly regimen for S64315 and a daily regimen for venetoclax.
S64315 should be administered 2 to 4 hours after venetoclax intake, via IV infusion. The dose escalation will start at 50 mg once a week and doses up to 1000 mg once a week might be explored.
Venetoclax will be administered orally once a day. The dose escalation will start at 100 mg daily and doses up to 600 mg daily might be explored. Venetoclax must be taken with a meal (ideally during breakfast) in order to avoid reduced efficacy.</description>

                  syndrome, who are excluded if total bilirubin &gt; 3.0 x ULN or direct bilirubin &gt;
                  1.5 x ULN
