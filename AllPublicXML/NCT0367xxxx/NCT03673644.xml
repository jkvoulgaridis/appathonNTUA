  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mobility refers to a person's purposeful movement through the environment from one place to
      another and can be conceptualized as a continuum from bed bound (immobility) on one extreme
      to making excursions to distant locations on the other extreme. Primary open-angle glaucoma
      (POAG) is a chronic, progressive optic neuropathy that can lead to gradual loss of vision in
      the peripheral field and central vision. Older adults with POAG have an increased risk for
      motor vehicle collisions and falls. Moreover, existing studies suggest that patients with
      POAG exhibit more postural sway while standing as measured by a balance platform and also
      tend to walk more slowly than those who are normally sighted and free of ocular disease.
      While these disturbances likely influence mobility, there has been little research directly
      assessing the impact of POAG on mobility. This study will assess the impact of POAG on life
      space (one aspect of mobility) and will determine whether difficulties with life space are
      associated with difficulties experienced under conditions of dim lighting.

      Aim 1: To examine the extent of life space in older adults with POAG using the Life Space
      Questionnaire and to examine whether life space in persons with POAG is associated with the
      magnitude of visual field impairment.

      Aim 2: To examine difficulties seeing under dim illumination and at night in older adults
      with POAG using the Low Luminance Questionnaire and to examine whether greater difficulty in
      seeing under dim illumination and at night is related to the magnitude of visual field loss.

      Aim 3: To examine the relationship in older adults with POAG between visual problems seeing
      under dim illumination and at night (Low Luminance Questionnaire) and their life space (Life
      Space Questionnaire).

    <description>The Life Space Questionnaire is a 9-item questionnaire that assesses how much a person gets out and about and the spatial extent of the person's typical life space, i.e., what is the usual range of places in which the person engages in activities within the designated time frame. Patients are asked to respond either Yes or No.</description>

    <time_frame>Day one</time_frame>
    <description>The Low Luminance Questionnaire is a 32-item questionnaire that assesses problems that involve vision under different lighting conditions or feelings about vision under different lighting conditions. The range of responses is different for different questions, with the overall pattern being that &quot;1&quot; means &quot;No difficulty at all&quot; and that increasingly higher numbers mean increasingly more difficulty.</description>
