    <textblock>
      Adult patients with r/r acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (stratum I), r/r Non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma (NHL) including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
      (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL) or mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) (stratum II) as well as
      paediatric patients with r/r ALL (stratum III) will be treated with autologous T-lymphocytes
      transduced by the third-generation RV-SFG.CD19.CD28.4-1BBzeta retroviral vector. The main
      purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and feasibility of escalating CD19.CAR T cell
      doses (1-20×10^6 transduced cells/m^2) after lymphodepletion with fludarabine and
      cyclophosphamide.
