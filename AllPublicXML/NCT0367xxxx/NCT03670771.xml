      This study is conducted to evaluate the incidence and prognostic significance of IAH in
      medical ICU patients.

    <textblock>
      Increased Intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in
      ICU patients with consequent pulmonary, hepatic, central nervous and renal system
      impairments.

      The increase in IAP is rarely diagnosed in ICU and the lack of diagnosis of this condition
      may lead to the worsening of patient prognoses because of retardation of appropriate
      interventions .

      The current literatures show conflicting cutoff values of IAP that predict AKI, possibly due
      to the fact that many studies were conducted before publishing of the first Consensus of
      IAH/ACS, which standardized the measurement method of IAP.

      Intra-abdominal hypertension is defined as a sustained or repeated pathologic elevation of
      intra-abdominal pressure greater than 12 mmHg [Malbrain et al 2004, cheathamML et al 2007].
      Intra-abdominal hypertension is graded as follows:

        -  Grade I Intra-abdominal pressure 12-15 mmHg.

        -  Grade II Intra-abdominal pressure 16-20 mmHg.

        -  Grade III Intra-abdominal pressure 21-25 mmHg.

        -  Grade IV Intra-abdominal pressure greater than 25 mmHg Various risk factors contribute
           to the development of IAH in medical ICU including; massive fluid resuscitation (&gt; 3500
           ml/24 h), ileus, respiratory, renal, or liver dysfunction, hypothermia, acidosis,
           anemia, oliguria, and hyperlactatemia .

    <description>IAP obtained by using patient own urine as the transducing medium. One clamps the Foley catheter just above the urine collection bag. The tubing is then held at a position of 30-40 cm above the symphysis pubis and the clamp is released. The IAP is indicated by the height (in cm) of the urine column from the pubic bone. The meniscus should show respiratory variations.</description>

        all patients admitted to ICU due to medical cause irrespective of age or sex will be
        included in the study with detailed history and compelete examination will be done ,ECG
        will be done

        , SPO2 and arterial lactate concentrations and blood gases will be recorded twice daily,
        intraabdominal pressure wil be measured every at ltime of admission and every 6 hours until
        discharge or death occured.
