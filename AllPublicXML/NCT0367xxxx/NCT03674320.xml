  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the
      airways and/or damage to the lungs which leads to progressive impairment in airflow and the
      ability to breathe. COPD affects 6 to 20% of the US population and is among the leading
      causes for mortality in men and women. While COPD is principally a pathology of the airway,
      skeletal muscle wasting is a widely recognized comorbidity contributing to frequent and
      expensive hospital visits.

      Hospital readmission rates among COPD patients are high and the majority of the readmissions
      are considered preventable. The reasons COPD patients lose muscle are still poorly understood
      although reduced pulmonary function has been associated with reduced testosterone levels.
      Muscle building treatments, including testosterone therapy, with and without exercise, have
      consistently been shown to promote improvements in body composition, exercise capacity, and
      health related quality of life of COPD patients.

      The overall goal of this investigation is to provide an effective long-term treatment
      strategy that prevents the advancement of COPD in men and women through a safe, cycled
      administration of testosterone during the early stages of disease.

      Male and female COPD patients participating in a 12 week pulmonary rehabilitation program at
      the University of Texas Medical Branch enrolled in the study will be randomized into either
      placebo or testosterone enanthate (100mg men, 25mg women) treatment. Testosterone and placebo
      will be given in a cyclic fashion during the pulmonary rehabilitation with single injections
      given on weeks 2, 3, 6, 7, 10 and 11. Baseline (during week 1 of rehabilitation) and post
      (during week 12 of rehabilitation) study testing will measure the effectiveness of
      testosterone on several measures listed in the outcome section.

             within the last 12 months

          8. LDL cholesterol greater than 200 mg/dL as testosterone administration may elevate LDL
             cholesterol levels 9. Hematocrit greater than 51%
