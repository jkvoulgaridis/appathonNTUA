    <intervention_model_description>This will be a multiple-dose trial of OPC-167832 with 2 stages.
Stage 1 is a multiple ascending dose trial planned to be conducted in 4 sequential cohorts of 18 participants each. There will be 2 arms (OPC-167832, RHEZ) in each cohort.
Stage 2 will be a parallel group comparison of 4 treatment regimens: 1) low dose OPC-167832 plus delamanid 2) high dose OPC-167832 plus delamanid 3) delamanid only 4) RHEZ.</intervention_model_description>
