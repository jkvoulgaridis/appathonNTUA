  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cushing's syndrome (CS) and acromegaly determine myopathy and muscle weakness which persist
      long-term after control of hormone excess. Fatty infiltration in skeletal muscle
      (myosteatosis) is associated with muscle atrophy, frailty, and increased morbidity and
      mortality in several human models. The study is aimed at evaluating muscle structure in
      patients with controlled CS and acromegaly, and correlate it with functional tests of muscle
      strength. In addition, circulating molecules potentially mediating persistent myopathy in
      these patients will also be assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior chronic exposure to glucocorticoids or growth hormone (GH) determines fat infiltration
      and persistent impairment of muscle structure in &quot;cured&quot; patients with CS or acromegaly,
      respectively. All this leads to irreversible changes in muscle strength and performance,
      markedly affecting morbidity and quality of life of these patients. In particular, muscle
      weakness would contribute significantly to the development of severe arthropathy associated
      with excess GH, as well as deterioration of bone status and increased risk of fracture, as
      described in patients with either CS or acromegaly in remission. Our aim is to evaluate
      whether muscular MRI is a useful tool for the assessment of myopathy and myosteatosis in
      these patients. If this is the case, we would have identified a non-invasive test that would
      allow the follow-up of patients at risk of developing functional motor problems, anticipating
      the onset of muscle weakness or fatigue and consequent deterioration of their quality of
      life. On the other hand, we will examine the role of microRNAs, which can suppress the
      process of myogenic differentiation, as potential modulators of myopathy in these conditions.
      Indeed, microRNAs could be used in clinical practice as markers to identify patients at risk
      of myopathy, and develop strategies for their prevention. Clarifying the impact of muscle fat
      infiltration on muscle strength would allow us to better understand the interaction between
      muscle and adipose tissue, encouraging research on potential mediators of this relationship,
      such as myostatin (MSTN) (able to direct the mesenchymal cell muscle towards the formation of
      adipocytes at the expense of myocytes) and adiponectin (ApN) (which keeps the levels of fat
      in the muscle low while favoring the formation and regeneration of muscle tissue).

    <description>A bioinformatic study will be carried out to select a set of miRNAs differentially expressed in acromegaly and Cushing's syndrome as compared with controls. The miRNAs will be selected according to the pathophysiological pathways (GO, KEGG) in which they are involved and taking into account the pathophysiology of Cushing's syndrome and acromegaly. Differentially expressed miRNAs will be then related to primary outcome measures.</description>
