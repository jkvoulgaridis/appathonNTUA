      To evaluate the efficacy of sentinel lymph node policy in patients with intermediate-risk

      Surgical assessment for staging of endometrial carcinoma during primary surgery remains one
      of the most varied practices worldwide, as it may include no nodal assessment, sentinel node
      mapping, and complete pelvic and aortic lymphadenectomy up to the renal vessels. Since
      lymphadenectomy is significantly associated with longer operating time, higher surgical
      costs, greater rate of infection, as well as the occurrence of lymphocysts and lymphedema,
      gynecologists agree that pelvic and aortic lymphadenectomy should be routinely performed in
      high-risk patients (grade 3, deep myometrial invasion, type 2 cancer). However, whether
      lymphadenectomy is required in patients with endometrioid endometrial cancers of grade 1 or 2
      and with less than 50% myometrial invasion is controversial. Then, the investigators
      conducted this prospective cohort study to investigate the efficacy of sentinel lymph node
      policy in patients with intermediate-risk endometrial carcinomas (grade 1 or 2, &lt; 50%
      myometrial invasion, and a tumor diameter ≥ 2 cm) as well as their outcomes.

      Surgery should be performed within a maximum of 4 weeks from the patient's first
      consultation.

    <description>Experimental:
Intra-operative sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping with indocyanin green injected into the stroma of the cervix.
Full bilateral laparoscopic lymphadenectomy and hysterectomy:
If bilateral SLN are detected, all positive SLN will be removed. Then the surgeons proceeds to a total hysterectomy.
If only unilateral SLN are detected, surgeons will proceed to pelvic lymphadenectomy on the opposite side.
If non SLN are detected, surgeons will proceed to a total hysterectomy, a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, a complete and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy.</description>

    <description>Intra-operative SN mapping with indocyanin green: Intracervical injection will be performed by the surgeon. Sub-mucous injections will be performed with 50% diluted dye at 3 and 9 o'clock positions. 1ml injection contained infracyanine green will be injected deeply into the stroma of the cervix (1cm-depth), and another 1ml will be injected superficially (2mm-depth). The time between the injection and the search for SLN must be as soon as possible.</description>
