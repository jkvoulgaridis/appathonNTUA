  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mood disorders occur in 25-30% of stroke patients and are associated with lower quality of
      life, higher mortality, increased healthcare utilization, and higher costs. Cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions have been shown to both treat and prevent post-stroke
      mood disorders, thus having the ability to improve quality of life and reduce costs. This
      study aims to test the feasibility of internet-based CBT combined with a telephone/email
      based coaching service after stroke.
