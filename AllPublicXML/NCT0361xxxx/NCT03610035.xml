  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single dose of NPT189
      in healthy volunteers. The study will also evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of
      NPT189.

    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single dose, dose
      escalation safety and tolerability study of NPT189 in health subjects. Six dose cohorts are
      planned each with a maximum of 8 participants per cohort. Participants will receive NPT189 by
      intravenous (IV) or a matching placebo by intravenous infusion. Safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics will be assessed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects between the ages of 18 and 65 years (inclusive);

          -  Has provided written informed consent to participate in the study;

          -  Weigh ≥ 45kg and ≤ 120kg with Body Mass Index of 18-32 inclusive;

          -  Subject Rescreening: This study does not permit the re-enrollment of a subject who has
             discontinued from the study as a pre-treatment failure without approval from the
             sponsor unless the reason they were not included was because the required number of
             subjects needed at the time of randomization had already been met. Rescreened subjects
             must continue to meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria. All screening procedures
             must be performed within 28 days of dose administration

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential (defined as not surgically sterile or at
             least two years postmenopausal confirmed by a Screening Follicle Stimulating Hormone
             (FSH) level of &gt; 40) must agree to use one of the following forms of contraception
             from 60 days prior through 90 days following the dose of Study Drug: hormonal (oral,
             transdermal, implant, or injection), barrier (condom, diaphragm with spermicide),
             intrauterine device (IUD), complete abstinence, or vasectomized partner (6 months
             minimum) or male subjects who are sexually active with women of child-bearing
             potential must agree to complete abstinence or to use a condom for 90 days following
             the dose of Study Drug;

          -  No clinically significant abnormal findings on physical examination, vital signs, ECG,
             or clinical laboratory evaluation during screening; and systolic blood pressure
             between 140 mm and 90 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure between 90 mm and 45 mm Hg.

          -  Can understand and sign the informed consent document, can communicate with the
             investigator, and can understand and comply with the requirements of the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a past or present serious medical illness or other medical or social reason that
             in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, would jeopardize the safety of the
             subject or impact the validity of the study results;

          -  Participation in a clinical trial (other than a screening visit) within 60 days of
             study drug administration;

          -  Use of any over-the-counter or prescription medication within 14 days prior to the
             dose of Study Drug or during the study, with the exception of hormonal contraceptives
             for women of childbearing potential, unless approved by the Principal Investigator or
             use of beta-blockers within 30 days prior to dose of Study Drug or during the study;

          -  Donation of blood or plasma within 30 days of the dose of Study Drug and throughout
             the duration of the study and for male subjects, donation of sperm through the
             duration of the study;

          -  Women who are nursing, pregnant, suspected of being pregnant, or trying to become
             pregnant, or are lactating, have a positive serum pregnancy test at screening or urine
             pregnancy test prior to administration of Study Drug regardless of childbearing
             potential;

          -  Positive blood screen for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen (HbSAg), or hepatitis C as
             Screening, or a positive urine screen for alcohol (Day -1 only) or, drugs of abuse, or
             cotinine at Screening and on Day -1;

          -  Have clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory values as judged by the
             clinical investigator;

          -  Have a history of alcoholism and/or drug abuse;
