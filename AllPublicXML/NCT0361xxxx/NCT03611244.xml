      This study will be conducted without blind method. The portable seat device devised to
      maintain lumbar lordosis will be made within 1 year after the loss of ambulation in the
      participants with Duchenne muscular dystrophy with prospective design.

      In the control group, the presence of scoliosis will be calculated 5 years after the loss of
      ambulation in participants with Duchenne muscular dystrophy through analysis of retrospective
      medical records who had not been applied the portable seat device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the retrospective data of Seoul National University Children's Hospital, the incidence of
      5-year scoliosis in the control group in the past using steroids alone was 70% in patients
      with confirmed Duchenne muscular dystrophy. When applying the portable seat device
      (experimental group), the incidence of scoliosis is expected to decrease to 50% (ie, 35%
      because of 50% of 70%) compared with using steroid alone.

      In this study, investigators will enroll 70 control subjects who did not use the portable
      seat device through retrospective data. The number of subjects required to show the
      difference between the significance level of 5% and the power of 80% was 19, and 28
      participants with DMD are required considering 30% dropout rate.

    <description>The posterior lumbar spine pads are used to maintain lumbar lordosis and fix it with the shoulder strap so that the hip does not slip forward (so that it does not become a sacral sitting posture).
The seat is equipped with a 5 cm air filled villus cushion to relieve pressure on the ischial tuberosity when sitting for a long time. The portable seat device can be moved so that the DMD can sit on the device even when sitting in a wheelchair or a chair for home, school, or outdoors, so that the lumbar lordosis can be constantly maintained.</description>
