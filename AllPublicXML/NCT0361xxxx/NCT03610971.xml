  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if adding Ruxolitinib to a Tyrone Kinase Inhibitor
      (TKI), prior to a second attempt at stopping a TKI will lead to prolonged treatment free
      remission (TFR).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will have a confirmed diagnosis of chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia
      (CML) and must have previously attempted to discontinue TKI therapy. All participants must be
      restarted on a TKI at the time of relapse in order to be eligible for this trial.

      After completion of 12 cycles of combination therapy, eligible participants will remain in
      the TFR phase of the study for up to 36 months, and will have central polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) testing during the first 24 months. Therefore, the total duration of the trial
      will be approximately 48 months (12 months on combination treatment phase + 36 months in the
      TFR phase).

    <description>Combination therapy followed by treatment free remission (TFR) phase.
Combination Therapy: Ruxolitinib plus BCR-ABL Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs).
All eligible patients will begin ruxolitinib in combination with their BCR-ABL TKI on cycle 1 day 1 of the combination phase. They will continue combination therapy for a total of 12 cycles. Each cycle will be 28 days. At the end of 12 cycles ruxolitinib will be discontinued and any patient who has met the criteria for the treatment free remission (TFR) screening phase will enter into the TFR phase. Once in the TFR phase, participants will discontinue their BCR-ABL TKI and be monitored off treatment.</description>
