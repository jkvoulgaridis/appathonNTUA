  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in Switzerland and still more
      than a quarter of the Swiss population smokes cigarettes. Recently, electronic nicotine
      delivery systems (ENDS; also called vaporizer or electronic cigarette) have become popular
      with smokers who want to stop smoking or reduce their exposure to inhaled chemicals since
      ENDS use appears to be safer than tobacco smoking.

      Smoking induces inflammation leading to acute and chronic oxidative stress, both evidenced in
      in vitro and in vivo studies. Tobacco-smoke contains free reactive radicals that generate
      reactive oxygen species (ROS). Afterwards ROS in turn induce oxidative stress, which likely
      plays a key role in causing airways and related pathologies linked to tobacco-smoke exposure.
      Acute and chronic oxidative stress can be measured by quantifying two biomarkers in urine
      samples: 8-iso-prostaglandin F2Î± (8-isoprostane) and 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG).
      8-isoprostane, a marker of lipoperoxidation, results mainly from the non-enzymatic action of
      free radical attack on arachidonic fatty acids. 8-OHdG is a marker of DNA oxidation caused by
      ROS, and a predictor of lung cancer.

      Oxidative stress between smokers who quit (with or without ENDS) and those who use ENDS for a
      long time have not yet been assessed in the setting of a randomized controlled trial (RCT).
      This study will therefore test the efficacy of ENDS for cigarette smoking cessation, the
      safety of ENDS on adverse events, the exposure to inhaled chemicals and the effect of ENDS on
      health-related outcomes, in particular by measuring oxidative stress in urine samples.

      For this trial, cigarette smokers motivated to quit smoking cigarettes will be included.
      Participants in the intervention group will receive an ENDS and nicotine-containing
      e-liquids, which they will be allowed to use ad libitum. Additionally, they will receive
      smoking cessation counseling. Participants in the control group will receive smoking
      cessation counseling only. All participants will be followed over a 24-month period. Measures
      of oxidative stress by means of exhaled breath condensates and urine samples will be assessed
      at baseline and at 6-, 12- and 24- months' follow-up.
