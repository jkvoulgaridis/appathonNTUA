  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a strategy that infuses a fecal suspension
      containing a healthy donor's microbiota into a patient's gut to restore his/her intestinal
      microbiome. FMT has a higher cure rate than standard antibiotic treatment for recurrent
      Clostridium difficile infections,and shows promising results in Inflammatory bowel
      disease（IBD）.However, few studies have evaluated whether FMT is effective to treat Irritable
      bowel syndrome(IBS).The investigators propose to determine the efficiency and safety of FMT
      in patients with Irritable bowel syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present clinical trial aims to re-establish a gut functionality state of intestinal flora
      through FMT as a therapy for Irritable bowel syndrome(IBS). We established a standard
      microbiota isolation from donated fresh stool in lab. Then the microbiota is transplanted to
      the whole colon through a tube. Patients from Guangzhou First People's Hospital in this study
      will be assigned to receive FMT at least two times according to associated guidelines and
      follow-up for at least six months. Questionnaires will be used to assess participants at
      study start and at study completion.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Irritable Bowel Syndrome assessed by Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline; one month;three months;six months</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire was used for assessing IBS severity. Scores of five questions were calculated with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scale: the severity of abdominal pain, the frequency of abdominal pain, the severity of abdominal distention, dissatisfaction with bowel habits and interference with quality of life. The scores ranged from 0 to 500, a higher score indicating worse condition :&lt;75 indicated remission; 75-175 indicated mild IBS;176-300 indicated moderate IBS; and &gt; 300 indicated severe IBS .</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Irritable Bowel Syndrome assessed by Quality of Life (IBS-QOL) Questionnaire Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline; one month;three months;six months</time_frame>
    <description>The IBS-QOL questionnaire consisted of 34 items, covering eight aspects (dysphoria, interference with activity, body image, health worry, food avoidance,social reaction, sexual dysfunction, and relationships). Each item was rated on a 5-point Likert scale(1 = not at all, 5 = a great deal). Total scores were transformed to a 0±100 scale ranging from 0 (maximum quality of life) to 100 (poor quality of life).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Depression and Anxiety assessed by Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale(HAMA)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline; one month;three months;six months</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) were used to evaluate the mental and psychological states of patients. HAMD scores were graded as follows: 8-19, mild depression; 20-34, moderate depression; ≥35, severely depression. HAMA scores were graded as follows: 14-20, mild anxiety; 21-28, moderate anxiety;≥29 , severe anxiety.</description>
