  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Symptoms are common among patients with advanced malignancy undergoing treatment, and yet
      often go unrecognized by treatment providers. In addition to contributing to morbidity,
      poorly controlled symptoms drive emergency room utilization and hospital admission in this
      population, representing significant cost to patients, families, and the health care system.
      Systematic collection of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) has been proposed as a way to arm
      providers with the information necessary to intervene early, intensify symptom management,
      and improve symptom control. Recent research suggests that a standardized, web-based program
      of weekly patient-reported symptom monitoring leads to improved health-related quality of
      life and reduced acute care utilization; it may also prolong overall survival. Despite
      mounting evidence supporting its use among oncology patients, systematic PRO collection is
      lacking at most cancer centers, and optimal models for collection of PROs are poorly
      understood. The objective of this study is to evaluate prospectively the feasibility of a
      novel mobile phone-based intervention of weekly symptom reporting, among patients undergoing
      treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
