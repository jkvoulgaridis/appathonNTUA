  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many hospitals and medical groups have developed transitions of care (TOC) programs or
      procedures in an attempt to reduce hospital readmission and reutilization rates of patients
      discharged from the hospital. As healthcare's most accessible practitioners, Community
      Pharmacists have a unique opportunity to assist with reducing unnecessary hospital
      re-utilization (re-admissions and emergency department visits) after hospital discharge. The
      purpose of this study is to conduct and evaluate the implementation of a Community
      Pharmacy-based Transitions of Care (TOC) Program for high-risk post-discharge patients of PIH
      Health Hospital-Whittier (PIH). The primary objective will be to compare the proportion of
      patients with hospital re-utilization (readmission, observation status, ED visits) during
      30-days post hospital discharge between patients randomly assigned to the PHARMD-TOC group
      vs. the historic rate at PIH. Secondary analyses will examine differences between groups and
      describe implementation details of the PHARMD-TOC model of patient care.
