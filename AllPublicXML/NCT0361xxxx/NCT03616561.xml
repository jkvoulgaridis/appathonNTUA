      Prospective open label non-randomized study, using Apremilast according to the manufacturer's
      Summary of Product Characteristics for 52 weeks, in patients with moderate to severe plaque
      psoriasis and nail psoriasis The study will be carried out in two hospital centers with
      experience in the management of patients with psoriasis and in the use of ultrasound of the
      nail apparatus. Visits and ultrasound would be performed by prescribing doctors themselves in
      their outpatient offices. Prior to the start of the study, the two doctors of each center
      will conduct a study to see the intraobserver and interobserver agreement on the ecographic
      parameters. The medication would be dispensed and controlled in the centers themselves and
      self-administered by patients at home. Each visit includes a ultrasound assessment of a
      target nail and measures of different scales: NAPSI, NAPPA.

      Primary objective:

      - Determine the percentage of patients with at least a 20% improvement over the baseline
      visit of the NAPPA-PBI scale in weeks 4, 16, 24, 38 and 52.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Determine the percentage of improvement with respect to the baseline visit of the NAPPA
           QoL and CLIN scale in weeks 4, 16, 24, 38 and 52

        -  Determine the percentage of patients, regarding baseline visit, who reach a NAPSI 50 and
           changes in the NAPSI scale, in weeks 4, 16, 24, 38 and 52

        -  Determine the percentage of improvement or change of the nail ultrasound variables with
           respect to the baseline visit in weeks 4, 16, 24, 38 and 52

        -  Explore the possible correlation between clinical (NAPSI / NAPPA-Clin) and ultrasound
           variables before and after treatment

        -  Determine the percentage of patients with sonographic signs of enthesopathy of the
           distal interphalangeal joint before and after treatment

        -  Determine differences in clinical and sonographic parameters before treatment in good
           responders (NAPSI 50) compared to non-responders

    <description>Nail assessment in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (NAPPA) is a modular instrument for the assessment of clinical and patient-reported outcomes in nail psoriasis. NAPPA comprises three components: NAPPA-QOL measuring nail-specific quality of life, NAPPA-PBI reflecting patient-relevant needs and treatment benefits, NAPPA-CLIN recording objective nail status. NAPPA-PBI questionnaire is a 24-item questionnaire which assesses patient-defined needs before and patient-rated benefits after treatment. The answers are given in Likert scales from 0 to 4, and a global score is calculated based on the importance-weighted benefit items. The principle of PBI is an advanced mode of goal attainment scaling with standardized goal items. range from 0 to 96. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>

    <description>NAPPA-QOL questionnaire is a 20-item nail specific quality of life questionnaire which assesses specific quality of life conditions in the past week. Answers are given in Likert scales from 0 to 4. Factor analysis revealed three scales named 'Signs' (nail status), 'Stigma' (nail impact: stigma and emotional status), and 'Everyday life' (nail impact: everyday life). For use in clinical trials, a global score including all items without weighting is used and mean values are determined. range from 0 to 80. Higher values represent a worse outcome</description>

    <description>NAPPA-CLIN score is a simplified version of the NAPSI which only assesses the least and the worst involved nail of both hands, or both feet, respectively. Thus, the NAPPA-CLIN scores for hands or feet range from 0 to 16 respectively. Higher values represent a worse outcome</description>

    <description>Nail psoriasis severity index (NAPSI) is a nail psoriasis-specific score, which in its original version comprises the assessment of matrix and nail bed involvement in every finger and toe by 8 criteria for each nail (0-8 point scale for every nail) .The NAPSI score will be determined using all 10 fingernails and toenails, on a 0-80 point scale (respectively). Higher values represent a worse outcome</description>

    <description>Target nail ultrasound will be performed in patients on apremilast by two expert dermatologists and each one will determine the ecographic parameters described in the protocol. These variables would be measured in one target nail in each patient, the greatest and most severely affected, at the investigator's criterion. The same nail will be assessed in all visits of the study (baseline, weeks 4, 16, 24, 38 and 52) . The ultrasound study will be performed with the same device in both hospitals: Esaote's MyLab ultrasound with a 20 MHz transducer. Prior to the start of the study the investigators evaluated the ultrasonographic inter-intraobserver concordance.</description>
