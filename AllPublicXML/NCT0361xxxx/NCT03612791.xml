  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this randomized phase II trial is to evaluate the clinical benefits
      of the addition of atezolizumab to standard chemoradiotherapy (CRT) (first given concurrently
      with CRT, then continued as adjuvant treatment), compared with CRT alone, on
      investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS), as per Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1).

    <description>Radiotherapy (RT):
Pelvic +/- para-aortic EBRT (IMRT): 45 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks (Weeks 1-5, with simultaneously integrated boosts to macroscopically involved lymph nodes, if any, in order to deliver a total dose of 60 Gy to macroscopic lymph nodes (including the dose delivered by brachytherapy).
Uterovaginal brachytherapy (Week 7; maximum interval between EBRT and brachytherapy: 14 days). If appropriate and feasible, dose escalation will be assumed, particularly for advanced disease, with the objective to deliver a total dose of 85 Gy (equivalent dose in 2-Gy fractions with α/β=10 Gy) to 80% of the High Risk-Clinical Target Volume (HR-CTV), including 45 Gy through EBRT. The total dose might be lower in case of close proximity to organs at risk (OARs).
Total duration of RT (including brachytherapy) should be ≤ 55 days.
Chemotherapy:
- Cisplatin infused 40 mg/m2 (maximum 70 mg) weekly IV during EBRT (Weeks 1-5).</description>
