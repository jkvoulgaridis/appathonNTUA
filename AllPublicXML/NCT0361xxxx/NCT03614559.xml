      In order to know more about contemporary clinical treatment ,epidemiological characteristics,
      and long-term outcomes in patients with Coronary Chronic Total Occlusion（CTO）in China, the
      study through collecting and effective analyzing basic information, cardiovascular
      characteristics, contemporary clinical treatment , and long-term outcomes of CTO patients ,to
      describe the relevant risk factors ,the contemporary incidence of CTOs and the success rates
      of CTO percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), as well as the complications and long-term
      outcomes of these patients, to explore the relevant factors which affecting the success rates
      of PCI therapy and to provide safer and more effective advice for the treatment of CTO.

      Study Center : Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital

      Study Purpose : Through collecting and effective analyzing basic information, cardiovascular
      characteristics, contemporary clinical treatment , and long-term outcomes of CTO patients ,to
      describe the relevant risk factors ,the contemporary incidence of CTOs and the success rates
      of CTO percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), as well as the complications and long-term
      outcomes of these patients, to explore the relevant factors which affecting the success rates
      of PCI therapy and to provide safer and more effective advice for the treatment of CTO.

      Study Design : A Retrospective Observational Study
