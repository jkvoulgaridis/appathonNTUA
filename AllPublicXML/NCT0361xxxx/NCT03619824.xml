    <textblock>
      This trial plans to enroll 40 patients with stage III-IVA (AJCC 8th, except T3N0-1 or T4N0)
      locoregionally-advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Patients will receive 3 cycles of
      induction chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin and concurrent cisplatin-radiation. All
      patients will receive intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Sintilimab will begin on day 1
      of induction chemotherapy and continue every 3 weeks for 6 cycles.

          5. Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)/Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) ≤2.5×upper limit of
             normal (ULN), and bilirubin ≤ 1.5×ULN.

          6. Adequate renal function: creatinine clearance rate ≥ 60 ml/min (Cockcroft-Gault
             formula).

          7. Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and give written
             informed consent.

             adhere to effective contraception during treatment and for 1 year after the last dose
             of study drug. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must be willing to adhere to
             effective contraception during treatment and for 1 year after the last dose of the
             study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &gt; 65 or &lt; 18.

          3. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody positive

          4. Has active autoimmune disease, except type I diabetes, hypothyroidism treated with
             replacement therapy, and skin disease that doesn't require systemic treatment (e.g.,

          5. Has a known history of interstitial lung disease.

          6. Has any condition that required systemic corticosteroid (equivalent to prednisone
             &gt;10mg/d) or other immunosuppressive therapy within 28 days before informed consent.

             topical corticosteroid will be allowed.

          7. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days before informed consent or will receive a
             live vaccine in the near future.

             non-melanoma skin cancer, and papillary thyroid carcinoma.

             patient's ability to sign informed consent, cooperate and participate in the study, or
             interferes with the interpretation of the results.
