  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is a subjective feeling,and pain experts have been trying to assess it using objective
      methods. Pain index (PI) is extracted from electroencephalographic as an objective diagnostic
      tool for chronic pain. This study is a diagnostic test aims to explore the reliability and
      validity of PI, with numerical rating scale(NRS) as the gold standard.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain outpatients between 18 and 80 years old, NRS ≥4 at first visit and receive
      injection or shockwave therapy will be included. After informed consents signed, the age,
      gender, dominant hand and hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) will be collected.
      Each patient will be connected with a multifunctional monitor HXD-1 for 8 minutes to access
      EEG in a quiet environment before pain treatment and 30 minutes after pain treatment. NRS
      will also be recorded before pain treatment and 30 minutes after pain treatment. PI will be
      extracted from EEG by analysts.

      In order to reduce environmental effects, the same quiet research environment will be used
      throughout the study. All data will be obtained and recorded by the same person, and all PI
      will be analyzed and calculated by the same person.

      SPSS 20.0 will be used to analyze the data, Pearson's correlations and Kappa consistency test
      to analyze the validity and reliability of PI. The receiver operating characteristic curve
      will be use to analyze the sensitivity and specificity of PI to evaluating moderate and
      severe pain(NRS≥4). A multiple linear regression equation with PI as dependent variable and
      anxiety score and depression score as independent variables will be used to evaluate the
      influence of anxiety and depression on PI.

    <description>Validated Chinese version of Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Scale is completed by the trained doctor.The HAD scale contains two sub-scales of anxiety and depression, consisting of 14 items, of which 7 items are rated as depression, 7 items are assessed as anxiety.Each item is scored from 0 to 3 points.Therefore, the anxiety subscale ranges from 0 to 21,and higher values represent a worse outcome: 0~7:asymptomatic, 8~10:suspicious presence; 11 to 21: existed.The depression subscale is scored in the same way as the anxiety scale.</description>

        The sample capacity calculation is based on the sensitivity/specificity of the diagnostic
        test allowed a minimum sensitivity of 80%, a minimum specificity of 80%, a significance
        level α of 0.01, an allowable error of 0.1 strictly.The estimated sample is 107 patients.
        Considering a predicted shedding rate of 10%, 118 patients will be enrolled.
