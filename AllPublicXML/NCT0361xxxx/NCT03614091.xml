    <textblock>
      postoperative pain following Modified radical mastectomy is severe specially after dissection
      of tissues .paravertebral plane block provides an excellent postoperative analgesia for
      women's,but it carry the risk of pneumothorax which it reported in some cases.Erector spinae
      plane block is a recent block has been mentioned in many case reports as a safe,quick and can
      be used in outpatient setting. we use a comparative study to compare the postoperative
      analgesia between both blocks and the affection of postoperative pain following both blocks
      if any on pulmonary functions.

      Postoperative pain is one of the commonest problems encountered by anesthesiologists in their
      practice, especially after radical mastectomy surgeries , in which post-operative pain would
      cause a restrictive respiratory dysfunction, which is associated with poor postoperative
      outcomes.

      Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) are the leading cause of death and increase
      hospital care expenditures in cardiothoracic and non- cardiothoracic surgery. Included under
      the heading of (PPCs) are respiratory failure, pneumonia, atelectasis, and exacerbation of
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

      Modiﬁed radical mastectomy, usually performed for the treatment of breast cancer, is
      associated with considerable acute postoperative pain and restricted shoulder mobility An
      estimated 40% of women report significant pain symptoms following mastectomy Poor pain relief
      has been associated with additional healthcare costs, resource utilization and prolonged
      inpatient stay after surgery.

      the thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) is the most widely used technique to provide
      postoperative analgesia after breast surgeries Advantages of a TPVB technique include reduced
      postoperative pain, analgesic consumption and shorter post anesthesia care unit (PACU) stay
      There is also evidence to suggest that TPVB may have a favorable impact on cancer recurrence
      after mastectomy. Paravertebral blockade results in somatosensory and sympathetic blockade
      after injection of local anesthetic solution to the paravertebral space posterior to the
      pleura.

      Erector spinae plane (ESP) block is a recently described technique which may be an
      alternative to PVB for providing thoracic analgesia. Numerous case reports and case series
      describe ESP block for the management of acute and chronic thoracic pain. It involves
      injection of local anesthetic into the fascial plane deep to erector spinae muscle.

      Radiological imaging in a cadaver model has demonstrated that a single injection at the level
      of the T5 transverse process produced cranio-caudal spread between C7 and T8 . This accounts
      for the extensive sensory block that has been observed in case reports and is at least as
      extensive as the spread seen with TPVB ESP is a more superficial block with a better defined
      end-point - injection between the bony transverse process and erector spinae muscle. A more
      superficial ultrasound-guided block will be faster to perform and less painful for the
      patient. Furthermore, ESP does not have the same risk of pneumothorax as TPVB. There have
      been no randomized controlled trials involving ESP to date. All descriptions of the technique
      have been in case report / series format.

      The investigators hypothesize that ESP block efficacy is not inferior to TPVB with reference
      to dermatomal sensory spread and analgesic efficacy, while being easier to perform, has less
      associated discomfort and fewer complication risk ESP has been no randomized in many case
      trials and they found that it effective as postoperative analgesia in modified radical
      mastectomy.

    <description>The TPVB will be administered at the T4 level with the patient in the sitting position.The ultrasound probe will be placed 5 cm from the midline in the craniocaudal direction and moved medially to identify the transverse process and parietal pleura. The superior costotransverse ligament was identified as a collection of homogeneous linear echogenic bands alternating with echo-poor areas running from one transverse process to the next. Bubivacaine0.5%, 20 ml will be deposited in the space between the pleura and the costotransverse ligament.</description>

    <description>the transducer will be placed in a transverse orientation to identify the spinous process, lamina,and transverse process.The tip of the transverse process will be centered on the ultrasound screen, and the transducer will be rotated 90 degrees into a longitudinal orientation to obtain a parasagittal view. Depending on the level imaged, 2 or 3 hypoechoic muscle layers were identiﬁed overlying the tip of the transverse processes. From T1 to T5 the erector spinae, rhomboid major and trapezius muscles are visible posterior and superfacial to the transverse processes. An 8cm 22-gauge block needle will be Inserted in-plane to the ultrasound beam in a cephalad-to-caudad Direction to place the needle tip between the posterior fascia of Erector spinae and the tip of the targeted transverse process.following which a total of 20 mL of 0.5%bupivacaine will be injected.</description>
