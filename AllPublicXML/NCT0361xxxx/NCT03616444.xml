  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is no internationally recognized standard treatment for the prevention of recurrence of
      colorectal adenomatous polyps.

      Based on TCM,previous studies have found that Xiaoai Jiedu Decoction can significantly reduce
      the recurrence and deterioration rate of colorectal adenomatous polyps,reduce the
      proliferation of tumor cells and promote apoptosis of tumor cells.
