  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled study is to determine whether the serratus anterior
      plane block reduces pain more than the usual treatment for rib fractures in the same amount
      of time.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with unilateral rib fractures in the Highland Hospital Emergency Department who
      agree to participate will be randomized 1:1 to either the control group or the experimental
      group. Those in the control group will receive the usual oral and/or IV pain medication as
      needed. The experimental group will receive an ultrasound-guided serratus anterior plane
      block. Numerical pain rating scale scores at rest and when taking a deep breath will be
      recorded pre-intervention and at times 0, 20, 40, and 60. At time 60, patients who received
      the SAPB will receive sensory testing. Patients will be offered additional pain medication as
      needed at times 20, 40, and 60.

    <description>Patient will be positioned supine or in the lateral decubitus position on the side contralateral to the fracture(s). A 3.5 in 20-gauge needle, extension tubing, and a 30 mL syringe loaded with 0.25% bupivacaine and 3 mL of 1% lidocaine loaded in a 5 mL syringe with a 27-gauge needle will be prepared. The ribs, teres minor, latissimus dorsi, and serratus anterior will be identified with bedside US and the site of entry marked along the lateral aspect of the 4th-5th rib. The skin will be sterilized and lidocaine placed at the site of entry. The needle will be introduced at a steep angle and advanced in-plane, under US-guidance, to the plane superficial to the serratus anterior muscle. A test dose of normal saline will confirm proper needle tip placement with opening of the intramuscular layer. Injection with aliquots of 3-5 mL after negative aspiration will continue until 30mL of 0.25% bupivacaine are administered.</description>
