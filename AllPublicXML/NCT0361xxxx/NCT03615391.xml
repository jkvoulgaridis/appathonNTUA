      The HuR protein binds to AU-rich elements in the untranslated 3' region of messenger RNA,
      thus allowing their stabilization. Its targets include multiple cell cycle regulating
      proteins, cytokines and growth factors. In some cancers, its overall expression level but
      especially its cytoplasmic expression are correlated to a higher grade and constitute a poor
      prognostic factor. To date, HuR's deregulation mechanisms remain poorly understood. A few
      experimental studies have shown the role of certain microARNS, or of post-translational
      modifications. In brain tumours, HuR expression, its prognostic value and its deregulation
      mechanisms have been little studied to date.

      The first part of the project will be a monocentric retrospective study of human brain tumour
      samples collected during biopsies or surgical removal. We will first evaluate HuR expression
      in 140 brain tumors, including 40 meningiomas and 100 gliomas of increasing grade, and look
      for a correlation with histological grade and survival. We will then apprehend the
      consequences of its deregulation by analyzing different factors involved in the cell cycle
      and stress response markers. Finally, we will study the mechanisms of HuR deregulation by
      analyzing the expression level of several microRNAs (miR16, miR519) and the methylation state
      of HuR.

      The second part of the project will focus on cell lines from human brain tumours. We will
      first attempt to confirm the interactions between HuR and markers involved in the cell cycle
      and stress response, then the regulation of HuR by its methylation and by microRNAs (miR16
      and miR519). We would also like to study the consequences of HuR inhibition and
      overexpression on cell proliferation, under various conditions of induced stress
      (pharmacological agents, physical stress). Finally, we will study the consequences of an
      experimental vitamin B12 deficiency on HuR expression and tumor cell adaptation to stress.
