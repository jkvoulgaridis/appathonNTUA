    <textblock>
      A prospective, double-blinded randomized controlled, 1-year follow-up study was designed to
      compare the analgesic effect of serratus plane block (SPB) after breast cancer surgery. Women
      undergoing radical mastectomy were dIvided into Control group and SPB group. The
      postoperative acute pain was evaluated by numerical rating scale (NRS) and the effect of
      preventing chronic pain was assessed at 3, 6, 12 months after surgery by NRS.
