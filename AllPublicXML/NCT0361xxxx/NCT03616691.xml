  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab and
      bevacizumab combination therapy (stage 2) after radiologic progression of atezolizumab
      monotherapy (stage 1) in Korean patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have
      progressed during or following a platinum-containing regimen. Initially, patients will be
      treated with Atezolizumab 1200mg every 3 weeks as a single agent (stage 1). After radiologic
      progression from atezolizumab monotherapy, patients will be consequently treated with
      atezolizumab (1200mg every 3 weeks) and combination with bevacizumab (15mg/kg every 3 weeks).
      Exploratory biomarkers will be observed in order to identify predictive biomarkers correlated
      to response and to evaluate the changes of local and systemic immune profile between baseline
      and at the time of progression.
