      There is no information on the effect of pregabalin in patients with neuropathic pain in
      cervical myelopathy under routine clinical practice.

      The investigators will conduct this prospective, randomized trial to determine the efficacy
      of pregabalin for neuropathic pain in cervical myelopathic patients in order to validate or
      refute this popular practice. The primary aim of this study was to compare Leeds assessment
      of neuropathic symptoms and signs scale (LANSS) scores of neuropathic pain in cervical
      myelopathy patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuropathic pain is a well-recognized clinical entity. It is defined as pain caused by the
      lesion or dysfunction of the peripheral or central nervous system, and it can be diagnosed by
      well-established clinical criteria. Neuropathic pain is caused by lesions or dysfunction of
      the nervous system and is initiated by several cellular and molecular mechanisms. Compression
      of neural and neurovascular structures may result in neuropathic pain. Although a number of
      therapies are available for neuropathic pain, including antidepressants, tramadol, opioids,
      and different antiepileptic drugs, the results of a recent systematic review suggest that, in
      view of their balance between efficacy and tolerability, pregabalin can be regarded as first
      line treatments for peripheral pain with a neuropathic component.

      Pregabalin is one of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) that have been studied in the treatment of a
      wide variety of disorders, such as neuropathic pain, epilepsy, spasticity, and anxiety. The
      use of AEDs in the treatment of neuropathic pain is based on a number of similarities in the
      pathophysiologic and biochemical mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain and epilepsy. Its use
      for the treatment of several neuropathic pain syndromes is common, and it is approved by the
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy, post-herpetic
      neuralgia, fibromyalgia and spinal cord injury, a model of central neuropathic pain. The
      off-label use of pregabalin for the various pain syndromes in general, and for neuropathic
      pain in particular, is ubiquitous. However, minimal support for this practice exists in the
      literature and its cost is perhaps exorbitant. There is no information on the effect of
      pregabalin in patients with neuropathic pain in cervical myelopathy under routine clinical
      practice.

    <measure>Leeds assessment of neuropathic symptoms and signs (LANSS) and visual analogue scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The LANSS pain scales are used globally to screen for the presence of pain of neuropathic origin because they have high sensitivity and specificity compared with other available tools. It rages from 0 to 24. The LANSS scores ≧12 suggest the presence of neuropathic pain.
The visual analogue scale or visual analog scale (VAS) is a psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. It is a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured. When responding to a VAS item, respondents specify their level of agreement to a statement by indicating a position along a continuous line between two end-points. It ranges from 0 to 10 (0 means no pain, 10 means worst pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>neck disability index (NDI) and EuroQol- 5 Dimension (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The NDI is a modification of the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index. It is a patient-completed, condition-specific functional status questionnaire with 10 items including pain, personal care, lifting, reading, headaches, concentration, work, driving, sleeping and recreation. It ranges from 0 to 45 (0 means no disability, 45 means severe disability).
The EQ-5D is a generic, self-completed, easy-to-use questionnaire. The EQ-5D comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Rated level can be coded as a number 1, 2, or 3, which indicates having no problems for 1, having some problems for 2, and having extreme problems for 3. As a result, a person's health status can be defined by a 5-digit number, ranging from 11111 (having no problems in all dimensions) to 33333 (having extreme problems in all dimensions). There are potentially 243 (=35) different health states.</description>
