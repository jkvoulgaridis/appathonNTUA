  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tumor derived cell free DNA (cfDNA) is increasingly used in the clinic to obtain genotype
      information about lung cancer, but its concordance with concurrent tumor-derived sequenced
      data is not known. The purpose of the trial is to determine the non-inferiority of
      cfDNA-based vs. tumor tissue-based genotyping as it pertains to the detection of National
      Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)-recommended biomarkers in first line, treatment naive,
      non-squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).

    <description>The proportion of subjects for whom a genetic alteration is found in at least one of seven genes (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, MET, ERBB2, RET) by testing tumor tissue will be compared to the proportion of subjects for whom a genetic alteration is found in at least one of the same genes by testing cfDNA.</description>

    <description>The proportion of subjects deemed to have quantity not sufficient for tumor tissue testing of any of seven genes (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, MET, ERBB2, RET) due to any of the following reasons: 1) insufficient tumor specimen for the genotyping tests to be performed, or 2) tumor cellularity below lab-dictated minimal requirements, or 3) no results available within 45 days of enrollment.</description>

    <measure>Sensitivity, Specificity, and Diagnostic Accuracy of Non-NCCN Biomarkers on the Guardant360 Panel</measure>
    <time_frame>34 months</time_frame>
    <description>This objective applies to genes included in the Guardant360 panel other than EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, MET, ERBB2, RET and to subjects for whom both cfDNA and tumor tissue testing results are available. Diagnostic accuracy will include calculations for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value comparing tissue to cfDNA results and vice versa.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with NSCLC, which is: (1) Biopsy-proven (confirmatory biopsy must have been
             collected within 12 months prior to enrollment), (2) Metastatic (Stage IV, Stage IIIB
             when curative intent is not an option, or relapsed/recurrent disease after original
             diagnosis of Stage I-IIIA), (3) Non-squamous histology (mixed squamous and
             adenocarcinoma is allowed), (4) No prior treatment for advanced stage NSCLC: (a)

          -  Prior treatment for metastatic NSCLC including but not limited to: (1) Systemic

             Radiation of a metastatic lesion or resection bed if given to the only measurable site
