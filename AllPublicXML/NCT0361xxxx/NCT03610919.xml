  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to examine effects of different dose frequencies of repeated
      oxytocin administration on neural and behavioral markers of oxytocin in healthy male
      subjects. In addition modulatory effects of autism traits and oxytocin receptor genotype
      (OXTR) will be explored.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, healthy male subjects will be screened according to the study inclusion
      criteria. After enrollment buccal swaps will be collected for genotyping and subjects will be
      randomly assigned to three experimental groups that will receive treatment for 5 subsequent
      days: (1) placebo for five days, (2) oxytocin on days 1, 3 and 5, or (3) oxytocin for five
      days. Behavioral measures, task-based and resting fMRI will be assessed after the first
      treatment (acute effects) and the last treatment (chronic effects). The task-based fMRI will
      employ an implicit emotional face processing paradigm and ratings of the facial emotions will
      be collected after the fMRI.

      Moreover, to control for potential confounding effects of relevant traits all participants
      will complete the following questionnaires: Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI),Beck
      depression inventory (BDI), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). To explore potential
      modulatory effects of trait autism, all subjects will be administered the Autism Spectrum
      Quotient (ASQ) scale to assess pre-treatment autism traits.
