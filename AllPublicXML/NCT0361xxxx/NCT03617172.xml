  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 440 patients meeting enrollment criteria with a primary episode of C. Difficile
      Infection (CDI) will be enrolled across 3 sites. The total study time period for study
      procedures followed by clinical monitoring is anticipated to be about 24 months (biomarker
      assays and other analyses may be completed after the 24 month time period). All participants
      will receive oral antibiotics for CDI under the care of their physician. After consenting to
      participate in the study, participants will be randomized to receive either misoprostol (200
      mcg po BID) or matching placebo for 14 days. Participants will be monitored for a total
      time-period of approximately 9 weeks with the goal of monitoring for recurrence of CDI during
      an 8-week follow-up period from the time that the course of antibiotic treatment is
      completed. Patients will have blood and stool samples (or rectal swabs if participants are
      unable to provide a stool sample) collected throughout the study to assess adherence,
      biomarkers, and to confirm recurrence of CDI (if necessary).
