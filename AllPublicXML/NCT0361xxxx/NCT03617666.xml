      This is a phase II, non-randomised, multicentre study to assess the safety and efficacy of
      the PD-L1 inhibitor, avelumab, in a previously untreated fit population of high risk stage
      II, stage III and stage IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma.

      This phase II study investigates the safety and efficacy of the PD-L1 inhibitor, avelumab, in
      a previously untreated fit population of high risk stage II, stage III and stage IV classical
      Hodgkin lymphoma.

      Patients with newly diagnosed high risk stage II, stage III or stage IV cHL staged by
      18FDG-PET/CT will receive 4 doses of single agent avelumab every 2 weeks. After the 4th dose
      of avelumab patients will have a PET-CT scan. All patients will then receive 2 cycles of ABVD
      followed by a PET-CT scan and further treatment will be guided in a risk-adapted manner based
      on the results of the RATHL. That is, patients who achieve PET CMR (defined as Deauville
      score 1-3) will receive 4 cycles of AVD and will undergo a CT scan. Patients with Deauville
      score 4-5 will receive 4 cycles of BEACOPP-14 or 3 cycles of escalated BEACOPP (at
      Investigators discretion and as per standard local policy) and will then undergo a further
      PET scan. Patients who are Deauville score 1-3 at this point will receive 2 further cycles of
      BEACOPP-14 or 1 cycle of escalated BEACOPP (at Investigators discretion and as per standard
      local policy). Patients who are Deauville score 4-5 at this point will receive further
      treatment at Investigators discretion and as per standard local policy. Radiotherapy to sites
      of residual avidity, initial bulk or as part of salvage treatment, is recommended (but not
      mandated).
