  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the link between the lungs and rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA). Additionally, to understand why RA patients get lung disease, how to treat,
      and prevent the disease.

      This study is to learn more about the risk factors for the development of lung disease among
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an auto-immune disease. Additionally, those at
      heightened risk of developing RA such as in the pre-RA period. This is a prospective and
      retrospective study, which 420 patients will be enrolled into the study. In-person
      participation will be up to 4 years, completing different standard of care assessments
      yearly. Additionally, quality of life questionnaires will be completed every 6 months at 4
      time points. Lastly, an extended follow-up will be performed yearly for an additional 6
      years, an overall 10 year participation.
