  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the restorative efficacy of the cosmetic product
      &quot;Onco-Repair&quot; vs placebo of the most affected palmer face in subject with grade 2 HFS induced
      by targeted therapies or conventional chemotherapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HFS, also known as Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysethesia, is a common adverse event observed in
      subjects under anti-tumor therapy with conventional chemotherapy or targeted th√©rapies. The
      initial symptoms are dysesthesia and tingling in the palms, fingers and soles of feet and
      erythema, which may progress to burning pain with dryness, cracking, desquamation, ulceration
      and oedema. Sensory impairment, paresthesia and pruritus have also been reported. Palms of
      the hands are more frequently affected than soles of the feet, and might even be the only
      area affected in some subjects.

      Although HFS is rarely life-threatening, the skin changes are often painful and debilitating
      and can impair with the general activities of daily living and quality of life. No standard
      prevention for HFS has not been established yet.

      Onco-Repair is a nourishing and repairing cream specially formulated to treat grade 2 HFS
      which demonstrate skin tolerance, hypoallergenicity and efficacy through several preclinical
      and clinical studies on healthy subjects.

      Therefore, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will be conducted to evaluate
      efficacy and safety of topical cream 'Onco-Repair' on HFS.

    <description>A subject is considered to have attained success if he achieves at least one grade improvement in HFS for the most affected palmer face according to the National Cancer Institute CTCATE V5.0 at any time during study period (28 days).
The subjects will be defined in success or failure according to the following rules:
Success: switch from grade 2 to grade 1 or grade 0 Failure: switch from grade 2 to grade 3 If subjects remain at grade 2 at the end of the study, they will be classified as either success or failure according to the evolution of clinical signs and / or quality of life assessed using the Dermatological Life Quality Index (DLQI) scale from D0 to D28.</description>
