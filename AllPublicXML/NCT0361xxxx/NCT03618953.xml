  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/1b open-label dose escalation trial of Ad/MG1-E6E7 and sequential treatment
      with atezolizumab in patients with HPV associated cancers. This study will consist of two
      arms. Both arms will dose escalate (MG1-E6E7) using a 3 + 3 design in Phase 1 to establish
      initial safety and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) / maximum feasible dose (MFD).

        -  Arm 1 - intravenous (IV) administration of MG1-E6E7 following intramuscular (IM) AD-E6E7
           priming and subsequent treatment with IV atezolizumab.

        -  Arm 2 - intratumoral (IT) and IV injection of MG1-E6E7 following (IM) Ad-E6E7 priming
           and subsequent treatment with IV atezolizumab.

      In the Phase 1b expansion for each arm, additional patients will be enrolled at the MTD as
      determined in Phase 1 in order to more thoroughly explore immune response,
      pharmacokinetics/dynamics, and safety for the patient populations with Cervical cancer, HPV
      positive (HPV+) Oropharyngeal cancer (Phase 1B, Arm 1, Cohorts A and B respectively) and HPV+
      tumors with injectable lesions (Phase 1B, Arm 2, Cohort 3).
