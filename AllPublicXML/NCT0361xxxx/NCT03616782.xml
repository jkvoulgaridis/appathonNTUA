      1. Induction chemotherapy 1)
           RCHOP(Rituximab+Cyclophosphamide+Doxorubicin+Vincristine+Prednisone) 2) VR-CAP
           (Bortezomib+Rituximab+Cyclophosphamide+Doxorubicin+Prednisone)

           Patients who have received induction chemotherapy will be evaluated for responses and
           those who achieved more than PR(Partial response) or PR will be eligible for this study
           after receiving informed consents.

        2. Experimental step Maintenance ixazomib beginning at least 8 weeks after completion of
           induction chemotherapy, patients receive ixazomib per oral 3 mg on day 1, 8, and 15 for
           4 weeks. And the dose of ixazomib can be escalated to 4mg by response such as partial
           response or MRD positive. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 24 months in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are screened and sign the informed consent after completion induction chemotherapy
      (RCHOP or VR-CAP) with more than PR or PR confirmed. It is likely to take approximately 8
      weeks in performing above procedures.

      Patients start maintenance therapy at least 8 weeks and also can be allowed for the extension
      of 4 weeks because of delayed response evaluation, recovery toxicities of chemotherapy, and
      official process including agree with informed consent. Recently, ongoing studies about
      maintenance therapy in lymphoma have window periods of 8-12 weeks.

      Ixazomib maintenance should continue for 2 years.

             hybridization, or polymerase chain reaction)

          3. In all patients, a paraffin-embedded biopsy tissue block or slides (preferably of
             lymph node origin or bone marrow) was sent to central laboratories (Diagnostic
             Cytology Laboratories or department of pathology) for confirmation of diagnosis of
             MCL.

          4. Stage II, III, or IV

          5. Patients who received RCHOP or VR-CAP induction chemotherapy for 6 cycles confirmed
             response as more than PR or PR after induction therapy and who are ineligible for

          6. No clinical evidence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement by lymphoma

          7. Patients must have measurable disease; CT scans at baseline are required to define the
             extent of measurable disease; the scans must be obtained within 6 weeks prior to
             registration; combined CT/PET scans may be used for the baseline and subsequent
             evaluations if accurate tumor measurements can be obtained from the CT component

          8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2

          9. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1,000 mm^3 (unless low count due to marrow
             involvement or splenomegaly)

         10. Platelets &gt; 75,000 mm^3 (unless low counts due to marrow involvement or splenomegaly)

         11. Creatinine clearance of ≥ 30 mL/min

         12. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x the upper limit of normal (may be up to 3.0 mg/dL if due to
             Gilbert's disease or due to liver involvement by lymphoma), alanine transaminase level
             ≤3 times the upper limit of normal; aspartate transaminase level ≤3 times the upper
             limit of normal

         13. Patients over the age of 45 must have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of
             greater than 45% documented within 90 days prior to registration

         14. Female patients had to be post-menopausal for ≥1 year, surgically sterile, or
             practicing an effective method of birth control (as described in the protocol), and
             have a negative serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin or urine pregnancy test at
             screening; they also had to agree to continue using birth control measures for ≥6
             months after terminating treatment. Male patients had to agree to use an acceptable
             method of contraception for the duration of the study.
