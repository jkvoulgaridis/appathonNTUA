  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optiflow (high flow humified nasal oxygen) is used in several settings frequently (ICU,
      during elective general anaesthesia- commonly here on the TOE list, in certain ENT patients,
      and more commonly now in obese or obstetric patients for preoxygenation). To the
      investigators knowledge no one has quantified the common complications associated with it
      (based on a literature search in November 2017 using PubMed and Google; using the search
      terms &quot;high flow nasal oxygen&quot; combined with &quot;complications&quot;, &quot;side effects&quot;, &quot;nasal dryness&quot;
      and &quot;epistaxis&quot;). The investigators were unable to find any existing research that examined
      the days following HFNO use and specifically looked for minor side effects) The investigators
      have had anecdotal feedback from patients that they tend to experience respiratory symptoms
      post HFNO.

      THe investigators would like to determine how often this occurs and how long it lasts for
      which would be pertinent to consent, and informing patients prior to the procedure, and also
      serve to improve the literature on this up and coming technique.

      The study aims to evaluate what is the frequency and severity of respiratory tract symptoms
      following the use of high flow nasal humidified oxygen? Participants will be from 2 sub
      groups:

        1. Patients already undergoing TOE (as this is the most common and consistent group who
           have optiflow- about 4-5 patients per week)

        2. Volunteers (staff) who would agree to experience the optiflow whilst awake for the same
           period as those undergoing TOE

      The study will involve a 7 day follow up survey to see if they had experienced complications
      (runny nose, nasal discomfort, sore throat, epistaxis), what their severity was and how long
      they lasted for.
