  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple encounters of pregnant women with the health care system during the late antenatal
      and immediate postpartum period provide a gateway for postpartum family planning counselling.
      Counselling on family planning services during this time is considered effective and
      cost-efficient for promoting healthy timing and spacing of pregnancies. This research aims to
      test the effectiveness of mobile phone-based interventions in promoting use of postpartum
      contraception.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a three-arm, 10-month, multicentre, parallel-group, randomized controlled
      trial which will be conducted at 15 Suraj social franchise(SF) health facilities in Punjab
      province of Pakistan. Pregnant women aged 15-44 years who are in their first or second
      trimester and have a mobile phone for their own use will be eligible to participate in this
      study. The participants will be randomly allocated to one of three study arms: a) voice and
      text messages; b) interactive telephone-based counselling; or c) control arm (no additional
      phone-based support). The intervention counselling module will be developed based on the
      Integrated Behaviour Model which was recently adapted, and tested for the family planning
      context in Pakistan. It will broadly cover birth-preparedness, birth spacing and
      contraception, and postnatal care. The phone-based intervention aims to improve women's
      ability to use contraception by providing them with information about a range of methods,
      access to family planning methods through outlets such as Suraj SF providers, connecting them
      with MSS field health educators to help them reach the centres, motivation by re-enforcing
      the benefits of contraceptive use on women's quality of life, and dispelling myths and
      misconceptions about modern contraceptive methods. Risk differences will be used as the
      measure of effect of the intervention on the outcomes.
