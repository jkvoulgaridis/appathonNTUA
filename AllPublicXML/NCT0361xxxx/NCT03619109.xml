      The purpose of this clinical study is to determine the normal reference range of the Nanōmix
      eLab® (eLab) C-Reactive Protein, Procalcitonin and Lactate Assay, whereby collected blood
      samples are used to characterize the distribution of C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Procalcitonin
      (PCT), and Lactate (LAC) in a population of healthy subjects. Approximately 4 mL of whole
      blood will be collected by venipuncture from normal healthy volunteers and tested with the
      eLab C-Reactive Protein, Procalcitonin, and Lactate assay within 30 minutes of collection.
      Following the whole blood test, the sample will be spun down to plasma and a plasma sample
      will be tested on the eLab with the eLab C-Reactive Protein, Procalcitonin, and Lactate
      assays within 30 min of the whole blood test. Demographic and health information will also be
      collected from each participant by having them complete a questionnaire. The test results
      will be collated to establish the normal range (2.5 - 97.5th percentile) for each analyte.
      The remaining plasma will be frozen and stored at -80° C.
