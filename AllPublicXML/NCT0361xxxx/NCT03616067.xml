  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy is the first cause of motor disability in developed countries. It is
      associated with altered motor function but also with mental, sensorial and behavior
      deficiencies. Drooling frequently occurs in children with cerebral palsy (37 to 58%). It
      causes multiple medical and social complications which can all increase disability and reduce
      quality of life for the patients and their family. Drooling treatments are various and
      includes orofacial rehabilitations, anticholinergic medications, botulinum toxin A and B
      salivary gland injections. Surgeries could also be used, but their benefits are often
      outweighed by the risk.

        -  Orofacial rehabilitation is firstly recommended, even if few studies evaluated its
           efficacy.

        -  Medication by Scopoderm®, a cutaneous anticholinergic drug, is frequently used in spite
           of frequent side effects and a lack of evidence regarding efficacy.

        -  Botulinum toxin salivary gland injections (Botox®) were shown to be effective in
           reducing the severity of drooling consequences for the patient quality of life up to 12
           months after the injections (Reid 2008).

      A recent survey carried showed that treatment by Botox® injection would be preferred by
      professional to Scopoderm® patch, because of better tolerance and efficacy, even if
      Scopoderm® remained more used by professionals (Chaleat-Valayer 2016). However, a Cochrane
      review (Walshe 2012) concluded that there is 1) no strong consensus regarding assessment or
      the timing of all treatments 2) not enough efficacy studies with high level of evidence, 3)
      mostly efficacy studies vs placebo or no intervention 4) a lack of long term treatment
      assessment 5) a lack of studies on the patient quality of life.

      Our study will be a comparative randomized clinical trial with an active control arm. The
      hypothesis is that therapeutic treatment of drooling in children with cerebral palsy
      consisting of a standardized rehabilitation treatment associated with a botulinum toxin A
      injection (Botox®) in the salivary glands is more effective than the same rehabilitation
      treatment associated with a treatment by scopolamine patches (Scopoderm®).

      The main outcome will be assessed 15 months after initiation of treatment to evaluate
      long-term effectiveness. Patients from both arms of the trial will received rehabilitation,
      in order to compare treatment efficacy as it is done in real conditions of treatment. The
      efficacy of the treatment will be assessed on the impact of the drooling perceived by the
      patients and their family rather than on the measure of salivary production, as recommended
      (Walshe 2012).
