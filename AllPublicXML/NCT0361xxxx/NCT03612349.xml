  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, participants will complete a behavioral economics laboratory task and
      validation field assessments to understand how menthol cigarette policy restrictions may
      affect tobacco product purchasing and use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will enroll 60 smokers who will complete four lab sessions and two field assessments.
      Participants meeting initial eligibility criteria over the phone will complete an in-person
      screening visit. Breath carbon monoxide and alcohol tests will be collected. Participants
      will answer questionnaires on the computer and via interview about their tobacco use and
      medical history. Eligible participants will remain in the lab to complete additional baseline
      questionnaires and will be given the opportunity to sample alternative tobacco products, such
      as LCCs, smokeless tobacco, electronic cigarettes, and nicotine replacement.

      During the next two lab sessions, participants will complete a behavioral economics
      assessment, the Experimental Tobacco Marketplace task, designed to simulate purchasing
      tobacco products online. Participants will be given 'coupons' to obtain tobacco products from
      the online experimental marketplace. After these lab sessions, participants will be provided
      with the tobacco products they selected from the online experimental marketplace to use
      during 3-day field assessments to validate the task. Participants will be told to only use
      tobacco products provided by the lab during the field assessments. At both lab sessions,
      participants will complete questionnaires about their tobacco use, mood, and reactions to the
      alternative tobacco products. At the final lab session, a qualitative interview will be
      conducted to learn more about the participants' experiences selecting and using tobacco
      products.
