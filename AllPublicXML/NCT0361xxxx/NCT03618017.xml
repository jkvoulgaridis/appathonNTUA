  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an NCI-funded, randomized control pilot trial to evaluate: (1) the feasibility
      and acceptability of a web-based, personalized navigation tool (ConnectedCancerCare) and (2)
      explore whether the tool improves delivery of team-based survivorship care for women who have
      recently finished primary breast cancer treatment.

    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized control pilot trial involving 60 women newly diagnosed with
      early-stage breast cancer who are finishing primary treatment. Participants will be
      randomized either to the intervention arm (CCC website that provides information on
      team-based follow-up care for both cancer surveillance and preventive care) or the control
      arm (static online survivorship care plan template, adapted from the ASCO breast cancer
      survivorship template). The feasibility and acceptability of the tool and correlations with
      patient-reported outcomes will be assessed 3 months following the completion of a baseline
      survey via an online follow-up survey.

    <intervention_model_description>A randomized control pilot trial of a web-based, personalized navigation tool to support the continuing and team-based care of early-stage breast cancer patients who have completed their primary cancer treatment. Patients will be randomized to either the intervention (n=30), a personalized website that guides team-based, survivorship care or to the control (n=30), an static online survivorship care plan.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Participants will be randomized to the intervention (website) or control (informational template) after completing an online questionnaire; they will not be informed of which arm of the study they are participating.

    <measure>Number of breast cancer patients successfully recruited to participate in the study</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Survey: 3-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>We anticipate a response rate of 80% enrollment (n=60). We will assess the number of patients successfully recruited who enroll and complete the baseline survey.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants rating the Intervention (CCC web-based, survivorship care plan) as acceptable and usable assessed by a 5-point (1-5) Likert scale according to 6 key factors identified below.</measure>
    <time_frame>Follow-Up Survey: 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants in the intervention arm will rate their experiences with the CCC tool according to the following factors:
Ease of use
Helpful during the transition to survivorship
Helpful in terms of planning when to see my PCP and when to see my Oncologist
&quot;Would recommend CCC to other patients&quot;
Length of time it took to go through the website
Amount of information on the website
Based on prior work, a cut off of 50% or more reporting a score of 3 or higher will be used to measure acceptance within each domain. Higher scores (3, 4, 5) represent better acceptance and usability of the CCC website. We will then create a summary score of acceptability by averaging the responses to the 6 items, with a score of 3 or higher indicating the tool was acceptable to the majority of patients.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients Reporting a Preference for an Oncologist vs. PCP for their Continuing Cancer Care Services</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>An 8 item list of continuing care services adapted from the CanSORT Provider Roles Scale (iCanCare Study) is used to assess participants' preferences for seeing their Oncologist or PCP. The proportion of patients who report a preference for PCP vs. oncologist for each aspect of care (i.e. screening for other cancers, general preventative care, managing physical side effects, managing endocrine therapy) will be assessed and compared between the intervention and control arms.</description>

    <description>The proportion of patients who report scheduling of a PCP appointment after completing their primary cancer treatment and viewing the CCC website will be compared between the intervention and control arms.</description>

    <measure>Patient-Reported Satisfaction with Oncologist/PCP Coordination of Care</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>A 5-point scale will be used to ask patients' to rate their satisfaction with the coordination of care provided by their Oncologist and PCP. The rating scale will range from a value of 1 ('not at all') to a value of 5 ('extremely satisfied'), with a higher numeric value representing greater satisfaction with coordination of care. The mean satisfaction scores will be compared between the intervention and control arms.</description>

    <description>The intervention, ContinuingCancerCare (CCC) Website is a personalized, navigation tool that is tailored to patients' preferences for provider roles in follow-up care, their satisfaction with their current primary care provider, and their worry about cancer recurrence. It involves a personalized, patient-facing website which includes a baseline survey, tailored educational modules, and a guide for their survivorship care, as well as a text or email based reminder system. The intervention also includes a provider-facing summary document, which will be faxed to both the oncology and primary care teams.</description>
