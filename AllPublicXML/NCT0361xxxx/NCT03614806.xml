  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyper Ventilation Syndrome is a frequent disease affecting adults whose diagnosis is often
      belated or even unrecognized due to the lack of &quot;gold standard&quot; criteria. Its diagnosis
      currently relies on the Nijmegen score associated with a PetCO2 assesment using a
      hyperventilation provocation test. Correlation between Nijmegen Questionnaire scores and
      PetCO2 appears highly variable. PtcCO2 monitoring is a noninvasive alternative method
      providing a continuous estimation of arterial CO2 pressure (PaCO2) which could represent an
      advantageous alternative to PetCO2 measurements. Several reports have demonstrated that
      PtcCO2 monitoring reflects more faithfully PaCO2 than PetCO2, no study have evaluated its
      value in this indication.

      The primary aim of the study is to compare the diagnostic value of PtcPCO2 monitoring with
      PetCO2, the method currently used.

      Included patient will be invited to fill in the Nijmegen questionnaire and an ambient air gas
      measurement will be performed. PtcCO2 (mmHg) will be simultaneously measured during
      hyperventilation test. Nijmegen score signs reproduced by the test will be analysed. HVS
      diagnosis will be assessed by usual criteria (PetCO2 &lt;30 mmHg at the end of hyperventilation
      test or under the PetCO2 value at rest, Nijmegen score&gt; 23).

      PtcCO2 data will be blinded interpreted later. We will compare if PetCO2 and PtcCO2 leads to
      the same diagnosis or not.

      Primary Goal:

      Show that the use of either of the two pCO2 measurements leads to the same diagnostic
      conclusion in HVS diagnosis with a likelihood greater than 80 %.

      Evaluate the correlation between PtcCO2 and PtcCO2 measurements Evaluate tolerance to the
      hyperventilation test
