  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to study if lower doses of chemotherapy will help babies with SCID to
      achieve good immunity with less short and long-term risks of complications after
      transplantation. This trial identifies babies with types of immune deficiencies that are most
      likely to succeed with this approach and offers them transplant early in life before they get
      severe infections or later if their infections are under control. It includes only patients
      receiving unrelated or mismatched related donor transplants.

      The study will test if patients receiving transplant using either a low dose busulfan or a
      medium dose busulfan will have immune recovery of both T and B cells, measured by the ability
      to respond to immunizations after transplant. The exact regimen depends on the subtype of
      SCID the patient has. Donors used for transplant must be unrelated or half-matched related
      (haploidentical) donors, and peripheral blood stem cells must be used. To minimize the chance
      of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), the stem cells will have most, but not all, of the T
      cells removed, using a newer, experimental approach of a well-established technology. Once
      the stem cell transplant is completed, patients will be followed for 3 years. Approximately
      9-18 months after the transplant, vaccinations will be administered, and a blood test
      measuring whether your child's body has responded to the vaccine will be collected.

      This is a prospective, multicenter, phase II, open-label study of two reduced busulfan dose
      levels in newborns identified at birth with SCID of appropriate genotype/phenotype and
      clinical status, undergoing either haploidentical related or well-matched unrelated donor
      TCRαβ+/CD19+ depleted HCT. Subjects will be enrolled on either of 2 strata according to
      genotype (defects of cytokine receptor function i.e. IL2RG or JAK3 and defects of receptor
      recombination i.e. RAG1 or RAG2). Thus up to 32 subjects on each of 2 strata or 64 subjects
      total would be enrolled over 4 years with 3 years follow-up.

      Patients with IL2RG/JAK3 would be randomized to receive busulfan targeted either to
      cumulative exposure of 25-35 mg*h/L or 55-65 mg*h/L with Thymoglobulin. Patients with RAG1/2
      would be randomized to receive busulfan targeted to cumulative exposure of 25-35 mg*h/L or
      55-65 mg*h/L, in conjunction with fludarabine, thiotepa and Thymoglobulin. Safety/feasibility
      of the novel TCR αβ+/CD19+ depleted allogeneic HCT strategy will be monitored on an ongoing
      basis using stopping rules for lack of neutrophil engraftment and other important short-term
      toxicities.

      Donor selection would be determined clinically at the discretion of the treating clinicians
      at each site. Pharmacokinetic monitoring of busulfan exposure will be performed per local
      practices at CLIA-certified laboratories. Patients will receive busulfan and pharmacokinetic
      measurement to individualize dosing. Time-concentration data of the initial dose and
      subsequent doses will be reviewed centrally (Dr. Janel Long-Boyle) using a cloud-based
      application (InsightRx) to guide dose adjustment in real-time (Long-Boyle, Chan, Keizer,
      2017, ASBMT Tandem abstract accepted). Clinical and laboratory data will be collected at
      defined time points over 3 years and entered in an electronic data capture system using
      study-specific case report forms. These data will be used to measure the outcomes including
      the primary outcome (cAUC of busulfan that promotes humoral immune reconstitution at 2 years
      post HCT with acceptable regimen-related toxicity at 42 days post HCT) and secondary outcomes
      (the quality of donor cell engraftment and immune function achieved in B and T cell
      compartments and survival). Mechanistic studies supporting the exploratory endpoints will be
      conducted centrally in designated laboratories.

    <description>Humoral immune reconstitution by 2 years post HCT, defined by specific antibody response to tetanus toxoid. Criteria for evaluation of humoral immune response are the following:
Donor T cell chimerism ≥50%
B cell count ≥50 cells/microliter
IVIG independent for ≥12 weeks
Subjects meeting the criteria receive 3 doses of tetanus toxoid at least 4 weeks apart, followed by measurement of tetanus titer at least 4-6 weeks after the 3rd dose. Those who achieve tetanus titer of ≥0.15 IU/ml after vaccination will meet the primary endpoint.

             Coordinating Center, and enrollment will be put on hold until the infection resolves.
             Ideally enrolled subjects will not have had any infection. If patients have
             experienced infections, these must have resolved by the following definitions:

             a. Bacterial i. Positive culture from a sterile site (e.g. blood, CSF, etc.): Repeat
             culture(s) from same site must be negative and patient has completed appropriate
             course of antibacterial therapy (typically at least 10 days).

             signs (e.g. erythema, tenderness, etc.) and patient has completed appropriate course
             of antibacterial therapy (typically at least 10 days).

             iii. Pneumonia, organism not identified by bronchoalveolar lavage: Complete resolution
             of clinical signs (e.g. tachypnea, oxygen requirement, etc.) and patient has completed
             appropriate course of antibacterial therapy (typically at least 10 days). If possible,
             radiographic resolution should also be demonstrated.

             b. Fungal i. Positive culture from a sterile site (e.g. blood, CSF, etc.): Repeat
             culture(s) from same site is negative and patient has completed appropriate course of
             antifungal therapy (typically at least 14 days). The patient may be continued on
             antifungal prophylaxis following completion of the treatment course.

             c. Pneumocystis i. Complete resolution of clinical signs (e.g. tachypnea, oxygen
             requirement, etc.) and patient has completed appropriate course of therapy (typically
             at least 21 days). If possible, radiographic resolution should also be demonstrated.
             The patient may be continued on prophylaxis following completion of the treatment
             course.

             d. Viral i. Viral PCRs from previously documented sites (blood, nasopharynx, CSF) must
             be re-tested and are negative.

             ii. If re-sampling a site is not clinically feasible (i.e. BAL fluid): Complete
             resolution of clinical signs (e.g. tachypnea, oxygen requirement, etc.). If possible,
             radiographic resolution should also be demonstrated.
