      This procedure will be applied to all patient with P.F.O.A who received conservative and
      physical therapy treatment that was ultimately unsuccessful and the clinical manifestations
      still present which includes recurrent swelling and pain in the knee joint aggravated by
      ascending/descending stairs, squatting down, or standing up, Positive patellar grinding
      tests, pain mainly located at patellar edges, varying degrees of quadriceps femoris atrophy
      and a sense of joint friction during activities Knee‑joint X‑ray showed that the space
      between the patellofemoral joint was narrowed, and osteophytosis was present These patients
      will be treated by arthroscopy (circumpatellar denervation, partial and lateral patellar
      facetectomy) then compare between pre and post-operative results in pain reduction, improving
      knee joint function, quality of life by using 2 knee scores

        1. Scoring of patellofemoral disorders( Kujala) score

        2. Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)

      Patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis (P.F.O.A) is a highly prevalent disease and an important
      source of anterior knee pain and Disability during daily activities (kneeling, squatting,
      climbing stairs, getting up from low chair).

        -  Patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) occurs due to the loss of the cartilage of the
           patella and the trochlear groove. It has been reported that valgus knee alignment,
           dysplasia of the patella or trochlea, malrotation of the tibia, and direction or force
           of the quadriceps femoris can influence the progression of this disease.

        -  In approximately half of the patients diagnosed with P.F.O.A there is no any structural
           changes or significant pathological changes in articular Cartilage Therefore, PFOA is a
           diagnosis of exclusion. )

        -  Isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis is not rare and radio-graphic evidence of
           deformity can be observed in 17.1-34% of female patients and 18.5-19% of male patients
           in the age of ≥55 or ≥60 years old. According to some studies it is reported that
           patellofemoral osteoarthritis in 79% of 100 cadavers aged ≥65 years.

        -  In spite of its high prevalence, treatment of this painful disorder is challenging due
           to the diversity of causes of the disorder and the lack of knowledge on articular
           regeneration, little information is available in the literature about the best
           conservative or surgical treatment options.

        -  Non-operative treatment options for patellofemoral osteoarthritis include patellar
           bracing, physical therapy intervention, corticosteroid injections, patellar taping, and
           strengthening of the quadriceps muscle. Although a significant reduction in
           patellofemoral pain after a 6-week physical therapy regimen has been reported, this is
           considered a potential short-term fix for many patients. Ultimately, surgical treatment
           is necessary to provide a long-term solution.

        -  Arthroscopy is one of The surgical options is which is minimal invasive and effective in
           selected patients. Arthroscopic partial lateral patellar facetectomy with circumpatellar
           denervation, this joint-preserving technique provides relief of anterior knee pain by
           eliminating excessive pressure on the lateral facet of the patella and improving
           patellar mobility. Moreover, this technique features a faster recovery period after
           surgery and less morbidity.

        -  The indications for this procedure are isolated P.F.O.A in patients with an overhanging
           lateral facet of the patella with anterolateral knee pain and no response to
           conservative treatment. (Gang Zhao et al., 2015 Jun)
