  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metalloproteinases (MMPs) constitute a family of endopeptidases that cleaves the
      extracellular matrix as collagen included in the eardrum. Activity of MMP has been shown in
      some otitis media with effusion (OME) fluids. These enzymes could be directly linked to the
      prosnostic of OME as it may damage the eardrum and leads to tympanic atrophy.

      The main goal of the study is to find out the correlation between activity of MMPs and
      tympanic atrophy. The investigator will also study if there is any clinical predictive
      factors in relation to the level of MMPs.

      The investigator will include 35 children under 12 years old with OME and who need
      tympanostomy or tube placement under general anesthesia. Middle ear effusion will be
      collected, divided in two and frozen.

      The investigator will perform ELISA tests to measure the level of MMP2 MMP9 MMP7 et TIMP2
      (inhibitor of MMPs). The investigator want to compare the level of MMPs between healthy
      eardrum and atrophic membrane.

      Clinical data will be collected such as age, gender, chronicity of the OME, quality of the
      eardrum and middle ear effusion type to see if there is any difference when MMPs level is
      higher.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - every children under 12 yo operated on in Gui de Chauliac Hospital

        Exclusion criteria:

        - when effusion is not possible to collect (too thick or amount of fluid not enough)

        Collection of both MEE on each ear when OME is bilateral. We will perform the tests on only
        one ear. The other one will be kept in case of technical issue. A random draw will
        establish which ear will be tested.
