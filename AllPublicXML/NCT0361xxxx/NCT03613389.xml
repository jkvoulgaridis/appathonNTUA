      Statement of problem Oral mucositis is an inflammatory condition that affects mucosa of the
      oral cavity. The etiology of this kind of aggravation is related to the introduction of
      radiotherapy or chemotherapeutic medications. (Alvarino et al., 2014, Rohani et al., 2015)
      With the prevalence of mucositis up to 80% in pediatric patient (Cheng et al., 2004).

      Clinically, oral mucositis is a painful situation that significantly affects patients'
      quality of life. The severe cases are associated with ulcerated mucosa and secondary
      infection which may led to life-threatening sepsis. (Kolokythas , et al., 2010) Oral
      mucositis is one of the most debilitating complications following chemotherapy, its remains
      an unresolved clinical problem, and it has physical and psychosocial implications for
      patients. The ulcerative lesions are often very painful, requiring treatment with analgesics
      and supportive nutrition, and the cancer treatment may need to be interrupted or modified.
      All these conditions may increase treatment costs, preclude further treatment and alter the
      quality of life of the patient. (Sonis et al., 2001) There are many oral care regimens
      including prophylactic antibacterial and antifungal drugs, Levofloxacin is antibacterial drug
      causing inhibition of cell wall synthesis agent, Levofloxacin failed to show any significant
      difference in mucositis or oral ulceration (Bucaneve et al., 2005). While voriconazole is
      antifungal that has been noted to cause transient visual disturbances and A major drawback is
      potential interactions with certain chemotherapy agents (Marks et al., 2011).

      Vitamin E is an antioxidant agent which may limit tissue damage from free oxygen radicals
      and, thus, may reduce the severity of mucositis during cancer treatments and protect cell
      membranes from radiation damage (Alterio et al., 2007). It has a very low toxicity and is
      generally well-tolerated (Geeraert et al., 2015).

      Rationale

      There is no enough studies about vitamin E effect in reduction of oral mucositis.

      El -Housseiny et al., (2007), recommend that oral mucositis is successfully treated by the
      topical application of vitamin &quot;E&quot;, compared to its systemic administration. Vitamin &quot;E&quot;
      alone is not enough for the treatment of infected lesions; further studies using vitamin &quot;E&quot;
      to treat the infected lesions are needed.

      Also based on the recommendation of Wadleigh et al., (1992) who was the first one to study
      the topical effect of vitamin &quot;E&quot; on oral mucositis; however, they did not know whether the
      effect was due to the topical application or the systemic absorption of the vitamin when
      applied topically.

      Benefit to patient and population:

      The vitamin E is nontoxic, odorless, tasteless, and well tolerated by the patients, reduce
      nutritional compromise, maintain impact on quality of life, and reasonable economic costs.

      Benefits of practitioners and clinicians:

      The use of vitamin E is easy to apply, not technique sensitive and it is cheap and readily
      available reducing clinical time.

           Topical Vitamin E Versus Voriconazole and Levofloxacin in Pediatric Cancer Patients
           Receiving Chemotherapy. According previous researches and books as Isaac and Michael
           (1995) 10-30 participants will be satisfactory.

           Recruitment strategy:

           Pediatric Cancer patients attending in and Out Pediatric Oncology Units at the National
           Cancer Institute in Cairo, seeking chemotherapy. Patients will be enrolled in the study
           if they are compatible with the eligibility criteria.

           Randomization &amp; allocation concealment:

           A) Sequence generation:

           - Computer sequence generated random numbers will be used.

           - Randomization is done by computer software www.random.com.

           - The sequence generates 2 codes (A &amp; B).

           - Each code stands for either intervention or control.

           - The table with the numbers will be with the assistant supervisor.

           B) Allocation concealment mechanism:

             -  A telephone call to the assistant supervisor will be done to know the group of the
                patient.

           C) Implementation:

           - Sequence will be generated by the assistant supervisor and provided through a
           telephone call.

           Bias:

        1. Selection bias: is reduced by randomization using random number generator and allocation
           concealment.

        2. Performance bias: One operator will perform the trial with a standardized method for all
           patients.

        3. Detection: All outcomes will be detected.

        4. Reporting: All outcomes will be reported.

           Blinding:

           - Blinding for outcome assessor and the statistician

           Data management:

           Data will be stored on the investigator's personal computer, secured with a password
           with backup for the data on Google Drive, on hard copy and backup external hard drive.

           Monitoring:

           The study work results will be monitored regularly by the supervisors.

           Statistical method:

           Data will be analyzed using IBM SPSS advanced statistics (Statistical Package for Social
           Sciences), version 24 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Numerical data will be described as mean
           and stander deviation or median and range. Categorical data will be described as number
           and percentage. Data will be explored for normality using Kolmogrov-Smirnv test and
           Shapiro-Wilk test. Comparisons between two groups for normally distributed numeric
           variable will be done using the student's test while for non normally distributed
           numeric variables will be done by the Mann-Whitney U test, Comparisons between
           categorical variables will be performed using the chi square test A p-value less than or
           equal to 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. All tests will be two
           tailed.

           Harms:

           Vitamin E is considered to have a very low allergic effect and is generally
           well-tolerated.

           Any modifications to the protocol which may impact the conduct of the study, potential
           benefit of the patient or may affect patient safety, including changes of study
           objectives, study design, sample sizes, study procedures, or significant administrative
           aspect will require a formal amendment to the protocol. Such amendment will be agreed
           upon by the Council of Pediatric Dentistry and Dental Public Health Department.
