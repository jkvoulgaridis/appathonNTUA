      This study is retrospective study. The purpose of this study is checking the effect of
      sugammadex on the outcome after colorectal surgery. The outcome is compared among the 2
      groups, sugammadex group and non-sugammadex group. The primary parameters of outcome are
      length of stay, readmission rate, postoperative complications, time interval for first
      successful oral intake.

      Abdominal surgery, like colorectal surgery, needs more than moderate neuromuscular block
      during surgery. After the surgery, reversal agent of neuromuscular blocking agent is given
      almost every pateints who underwent general anesthesia.

      Classic reversal agent is cholinesterase inhibitor, like pyridostigmine and neostigmine. Its
      action mechanism is competetive antagonist of rocuronium. But cholinesterase inhibitor cannot
      make complete reversal in moderate or deep neuromuscular block. Its incomplete reversal which
      is called residual block cause respiratory complications and prolongation hospital stay.

      Sugammadex has different mechanism compared to cholinesterase inhibitor. It captures
      neuromuscular agent, especially rocuronium, and prevent rocuronium's action. Even in deep
      neuromuscular block, sugammadex can reverse the action of rocuronium, and its reversal effect
      is fater and more reliable compared to cholinesterase inhibitor.

      Previous studies focused on only short term outcome of sugammadex, like postanesthetic care
      unit (PACU) discharge time, respiratory complications in PACU.

      But in this study, longer term outcome will be comapred between sugammadex group and
      cholinesterase inhibitor group (pyridostigmine).
