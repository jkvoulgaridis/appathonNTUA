      This randomized phase II study compare survival outcomes and toxicity of two chemotherapy
      regimens (etoposide plus lobaplatin or etoposide plus cisplatin) in combination with
      concurrent thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) for limited stage small cell lung cancer.

      Lobaplatin is a platinum complex with DNA alkylating activity that was developed by ASTA
      Medica (Degussa) for the treatment of cancer. Lobaplatin as the third-generation platinum
      antineoplastic agent, showed promising antineoplastic effects in variety of preclinical test
      tumor models. A randomized, multicenter phase III study showed that Lobaplatin plus etoposide
      (EL) regimen is not inferiority to cisplatin plus etoposide (EP) regimen in terms of PFS, the
      tolerance and QOL with EL regimen are better than that with EP regimen. Thus, we perform this
      study was to compare the efficacy and safety of EL and EP regimens concurrently with thoracic
      radiotherapy in patients with limited-stage SCLC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Newly diagnosed SCLC

          -  Either sex, age between 18 to 75 years

          -  Limited stage: AJCC (8th edition) Stage I-III (T any, N any, M0) that can be safely
             treated with definitive radiation doses. Excludes T3-4 due to multiple lung nodules
             that are too extensive or have tumor/nodal volume that is too large to be encompassed
             in a tolerable radiation plan.

          -  Performance status ECOG grade 0-1. Patients with PS 2 whose general condition is
             explained by obstructive/bulky disease likely to improve after the first cycle of
             chemotherapy can be included at the discretion of the local investigator. Patients
             with PS 2 as a result of comorbid conditions will be excluded.

             the institutional normal range, total bilirubin ≤1.25× the upper limit of the
             institutional normal range, and creatinine concentration ≤120 μmol/L

          -  No history of thoracic surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy

          -  Had measurable or assessable disease

        Exclusion Criteria:
