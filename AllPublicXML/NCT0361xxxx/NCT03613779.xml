  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization among adults &gt;65 years of
      age. Discharge from a heart failure hospitalization is followed by a 30 day readmission rate
      of ≈24%. Readmissions for heart failure are typically preceded by a gradual rise in
      ventricular filling pressures that begins days or weeks before any detectable changes in
      clinical status.

      Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a tool that is easily available at bedside and shows superior
      sensitivity for the detection of pulmonary congestion when compared with X ray or physical
      examination, even in the absence of symptoms.

      Pulmonary congestion assessed by LUS identifies a subgroup with worse prognosis and a higher
      rate of readmission and mortality. Whether the implementation of lung ultrasound in the
      follow up of heart failure patients may reduce the rate of readmissions is unknown.

      Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate a protocol of lung ultrasound guided therapy
      to prevent readmissions in heart failure outpatients.

      Study design: the design of the investigator's study is a single center, single blinded,
      randomized controlled clinical trial.

      Eligibility criteria: patients older than 18 years of age, who have been hospitalized for an
      acute heart failure syndrome. Exclusion criteria are life expectancy of less than 6 months, a
      surgically correctable cause of heart failure or uninterpretable lung ultrasound.

      Eligible patients will be randomized into either &quot;LUS-guided therapy group&quot; or &quot;control
      group&quot; at hospital discharge. Follow-up visits will be scheduled at 15 days, 45 days, 3
      months and 6 months after hospital discharge. LUS will be performed in all patients at
      hospital discharge and in every follow-up visit, but only in those allocated to the
      &quot;LUS-guided therapy group&quot; the information will be provided to the treating physician.

      In the &quot;LUS-guided therapy group&quot;, a prespecified diuretic dose will be administered to
      patients depending on the degree of ultrasonographic pulmonary congestion: if congestive (3
      or more B lines, in total) a high dose (80-120mg furosemide PO/day) will be prescribed; if no
      congestive (less than 3 B lines, in total) a low dose (up to 40mg PO/day) will be prescribed.

      Primary outcome will be the composite of hospital readmission + mortality. This study
      complies with the Declaration of Helsinki and the study protocol is being evaluated by the
      Ethic Committee of our institution.
