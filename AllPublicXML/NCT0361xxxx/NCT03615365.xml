  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to collect capnometric (tidal breathing CO2) data using the CRiL
      N-Tidal C Data Collector Device. The data collected will be examined for correlation with
      currently accepted assessment techniques for COPD (spirometry, vital signs and pulse
      oximetry) and the patient's clinical condition (stable, worsening, improving). The patient
      numbers and study duration have been determined by power calculations to provide a
      statistically significant sample size, based on expected number of exacerbations (mild,
      moderate and severe) from the patient cohort. The data will also be examined to assess the
      predictive possibility of a non-invasive self-care personal CO2 monitoring device to identify
      COPD exacerbations.

      Study Design: This is an uncontrolled, non-randomised, un-blinded longitudinal observational
      data collection study with the N-Tidal C Data Collector Device in patients with COPD.

      Patients will be identified from the Cambridge COPD Centre. This unit sees patients following
      emergency admissions, GP referrals and has a regional referral base for complex COPD.
      Patients' medical records will be reviewed and classified according to GOLD criteria. Those
      patients who are classified as COPD with appropriate inclusion criteria (below) will be
      invited to participate. Patients who give informed consent will be screened for the study.

      The N-Tidal C Data Collector Device will be explained to the patients and they will be
      trained how to use it. All patients will complete a short daily diary record.

      Patients will undergo a clinical assessment of COPD during screening at Addenbrooke's
      Hospital. All patients will be assessed five times: at the start, 2 weeks, 10 weeks, 18 weeks
      and at the end of the 26 week study period. A brief follow-up telephone review will be
      conducted approximately 2 weeks after the end of the monitoring period. At each assessment,
      capnometry measurements will be taken in addition to vital signs and pulse oximetry. The
      study will not interfere with routine management of the patient's condition.
