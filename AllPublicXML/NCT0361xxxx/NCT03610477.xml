  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human gut microbiome is the community of bacteria that reside within the human intestine.
      These microbes are constantly exposed to the end-products and partial break-down-products of
      digestion from the foods consumed each day. Very little is known about the complex
      interaction of specific dietary components with the microbiome over time in one individual.
      In order to produce robust analysis of these interactions, longitudinal samples with detailed
      dietary intake information from healthy human subjects are needed.

      The complex relationship between dietary intake and the microbiome, and the potential health
      implications of human exposure to microbial metabolites, are only beginning to be understood.
      It is well known that altered dietary intake can trigger rapid, although transient, changes
      in the composition of the microbiome in as little as 1 to 2 days. The biggest factors in
      determining microbial response to diet are thought to include an individual's starting
      microbiome, long-term dietary habits, and environmental exposures.

      It is not well understood how small dietary differences from day-to-day impact the
      microbiome. A longitudinal dataset with accurately recorded dietary data and multiple samples
      over 17 days will provide valuable insight into the changes that occur at the individual
      level over time, while controlling for dietary trends and initial microbiome composition.

      Medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) have systemic beneficial effects and increase survival in
      rats by preventing gut injury and permeability following lipopolysaccharide administration,
      preventing alcohol-induced liver injury, and protecting against the development of colitis in
      a model of Crohn's disease. Understanding the interaction of MCTs with the microbiome in
      humans could lead to important advancements in the understanding of how diet impacts the
      microbiome composition, and ultimately, human health. This proposed study is designed to
      evaluate the effect of MCTs compared with long chain triglycerides on the normal structure of
      the microbiome and data will not be used to diagnose, prevent, cure or treat disease.

      The purpose of this study is to: 1) investigate the role daily dietary variation plays in
      microbiome composition and stability, and 2) explore the effect of MCT supplementation on
      microbiome composition in healthy adults.
