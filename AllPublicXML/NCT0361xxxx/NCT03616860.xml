  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption
      in adult patients with a first presentation of a glioblastoma (GBM) following a maximal safe
      surgical resection and standard chemo-radiation with temozolomide (TMZ) protocol and ready
      for the maintenance phase of the Stupp protocol with TMZ.

      This is a prospective, single center, two-arm study to establish the safety, feasibility, and
      effectiveness of BBB disruption along the periphery of the tumor resection cavity using the
      ExAblate Neuro Model 4000 Type 2.0 (220 kHz) system and DEFINITY ultrasound contrast in
      patients with GBM. Adult patients with a first time diagnosis of GBM, whom have undergone
      maximal safe surgical resection and have safely completed the initial phase of concurrent
      chemo-radiation therapy, will be recruited for this study. Ten patients will undergo serial
      treatments with FUS coincident with their standard TMZ cycles. Another 10 patients who are
      eligible for the maintenance phase of TMZ will be followed without intervention for disease
      status over time.
