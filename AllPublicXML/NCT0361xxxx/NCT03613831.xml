    <textblock>
      This study is an observational study without any hypothesis testing. It intended to observe
      the clinical application of electrophysiological mapping and catheter ablation of atrial
      tachycardia post atrial fibrillation ablation or cardiac surgery guided with Rhythmia System.

        An arbitrary sample size of 100 should be enough for this registry study which may cover
        the focal, macro-reentry, micro-reentry and other types of atrial tachycardia. Assuming
        that the one-year recurrence rate post complex atrial tachycardia ablation is 30%, the 95%
        confidence interval of 100 samples shall be 21.2-40.0% (binomial distribution exact
        method).

        As per the current actual situation in China, it is predicted that 70-80 cases may be
        included for the atrial tachycardia post atrial fibrillation ablation, while 20-30 cases
        may be included for post cardiac surgery.
