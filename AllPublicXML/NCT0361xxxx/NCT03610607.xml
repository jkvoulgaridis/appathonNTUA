  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators hypothesize that good oral hygiene may inhibit P. gingivalis, a keystone
      periodontal pathogen, entering mature dental plaque, which leads to a higher ratio of S.
      cristatus and P. gingivalis. Investigators will educate and train periodontitis patients
      following periodontal therapy to maintain periodontal health. Initial and intense education
      of periodontal health maintenance will be provided and the ratio of S. cristatus and P.
      gingivalis in dental plaques will be compared and analyzed for correlation between patient's
      execution of periodontal health maintenance and education tools or the ratio of S. cristatus
      and P. gingivalis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The periodontal health maintenance will be evaluated by plaque index, periodontal pocket, and
      gingival inflammation status. Participants will be assigned into two groups after the second
      dentist visit based on their execution of periodontal health maintenance. Participants whose
      number of P. gingivalis is unchanged or higher compared to that found at baseline will be
      considered poor maintenance. Those not having maintained a good dental hygiene will further
      be randomly assigned to two groups. One group will be given more intense oral health
      education, while the other one will receive the same education as post therapy. The result of
      intensive education and a shift in ratio of S. cristatus and P. gingivalis will then be
      measured for both groups at the third dentist visit (9 months after initial periodontal
      treatment) and the effectiveness of the intervention will be tested at this stage.

    <description>1. Improvement of periodontal condition Response to periodontal treatment will be determined by a composite measure including 1) Plaque Index; 2) Gingival index; 3) Cemento-enamel junction, gingival margin, probing, and bleeding on probing from six sites on all teeth. The patients will be considered to have improved, non-changed, and worsening periodontitis, according to clinical measurements and comparison them with those before treatments.</description>

    <description>we will inform patients with their own data including the number of P. gingivalis and ratio of S. cristatus and P. gingivalis detected immediately after periodontal treatment and 3 month after the treatment. Explaining these data in detail, in terms that the patient can understand, are equally as important as teaching the plaque control techniques.</description>
