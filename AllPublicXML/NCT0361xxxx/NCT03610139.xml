    <textblock>
      This is a longitudinal single blind randomized trial to test the effects of high compared to
      low dose vitamin D3 supplementation on cognitive performance at 6 and 12 months, and MRI
      measures of 12 months duration. A cognitive assessment battery will be administered at
      baseline, 6 and 12 months. Related clinical data and information on depression and anxiety,
      lifestyle, and food sources of vitamin D and sun exposure among other variables will also be
      collected.

      Background: Multiple Sclerosis is strongly associated with low serum 25 hydroxy-vitamin-D
      (25(OH)D) and impaired cognitive performance. In our previous research, participants with low
      serum 25OHD levels showed significant improvements in visuo-spatial memory delayed recall
      after 3 months of vitamin D3 supplementation. In addition, serum 25(OH)D was significantly
      associated with this memory function at baseline and at 3 months. Therefore, the aim of this
      proposed study is 1) to evaluate the long-term effects 6 and 12 months of high (50,000 IU
      weekly then 10,000 IU weekly) compared to low dose (800 IU daily) vitamin D3 replacement on
      cognitive function in MS, and 2) to correlate it with the MRI brain measurements of the
      hippocampus and the frontal cortex volumes, as well as brain parenchymal fraction, and
      cerebellum. The investigators will then explore these MRI measures in MS patients with
      deficient 25(OH)D levels at baseline and at 12 months, and correlate it with their cognitive
      performance.

      Methods: This is a longitudinal single blind randomized trial to test the effects of high
      compared to low dose vitamin D3 supplementation on cognitive performance at 6 and 12 months,
      and MRI measures of 12 months duration. A cognitive assessment battery, comprised of the
      Montreal Cognitive Assessment (only at baseline), Stroop, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, Brief
      Visual Memory Test, and Verbal Memory Test in Arabic, will be administered at baseline, 6 and
      12 months. Related clinical data and information on depression and anxiety, lifestyle, and
      food sources of vitamin D and sun exposure among other variables will also be collected.

      Expected results: MS patients with serum 25(OH)D deficiency who receive high dose vitamin D3
      supplementation will demonstrate decreased cognitive impairment at 6 and 12 months post
      supplementation when compared to those who received low vitamin D3 dose and to their
      pre-supplementation status. The MRI findings are expected to be associated with cognitive
      performance at baseline, and serum 25(OH)D levels at baseline, and 12 months.

    <measure>Change from Baseline Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R) scores at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is a visuospatial memory test that is comprised of three memory trials (10 seconds each) followed by delayed recall trial after 25 minutes. It has been widely used as a quick measure of memory at bedside and in MS patients. The minimum score on each trial is 0 and the maximum score on each trial is 12. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Arabic Verbal Memory Test (VMAT) scores at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is a verbal memory test. It consists of 45 words that are distributed among 3 lists (List A, List B, and a Recognition List). Lists A and B are each composed of 15 words belonging to 3 semantic categories: vegetables, animals, and stationary. The recognition list is composed 45 words that include homonyms, shared or related words and unrelated words with respect to the previous two lists. The VMAT is administered as follows: List A Immediate Free Recall (5 trials) - List B Immediate Free Recall Trial - List A Short Delay Free Recall Trial - List A Short Delay Cued Recall Trial - List A Long Delay Free Recall Trial - List A Long Delay Cued Recall Trial. After 25 minutes of the last trial, List A Delayed Recognition Trial is administered. For each trial, the minimum total score is 0 and the maximum total score is 15. Higher scores represent a better outcome. For each trial except the recognition trial, repeated and intrusive words are counted separately.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is a known and widely used speed of processing test. Oral SDMT will be administered; it does not require translation and has been used in Lebanon before. It consists of one trial. The minimum total score is 0 and the maximum total score is 110. Higher scores represent a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline Stroop test scores at 6 months</measure>

    <description>It is a highly established test of attention. Subject is given a list of colors in black ink to read (Stroop 1), then a list of colors in their corresponding ink color (Stroop 2), and then finally a list of colors with incongruent ink colors (Stroop 3), the participant is expected to read the word without being affected by interfering mismatching color. The number of words read in a minute (minus the errors) is the dependent measure and interference will be calculated using the following equation: Interference = Stroop 3 - [(Stroop 1+Stroop 2)/2]. For each of the 3 lists, the minimum total score is 0 and the maximum total score is 100. Higher scores represent a better outcome. For the interference, the minimum score is -100 and the maximum score is 0. Higher scores represent a better outcome.</description>
