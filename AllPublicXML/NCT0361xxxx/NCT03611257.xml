  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the use of direct rapid antibiotic
      susceptibility test (dRAST), in addition to the current standard antibiotic susceptibility
      test, can increase the proportion of patients with hematologic disease who received
      appropriate antibiotics in early period of bacteremia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  patients with hematologic diseases who have high risk of bacteremia, because of immune
           suppression treatment or intensive chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation which
           these patients had received, will be recruited in tertiary referral medical centers.

        -  All the participants will be randomly assigned into either dRAST group or current
           standard antibiotic susceptibility test group.

        -  All the participants in the both arms will receive antimicrobial stewardship by
           infectious disease specialists. Antimicrobial stewardship will be performed at each
           timepoint of Gram stain results reporting, dRAST results reporting, and current method
           reporting.

        -  Target numbers are 58 and 58, respectively.

        -  All the participants will be monitored for general medical conditions such as vital sign
           and response to antibiotic treatment by infectious disease specialists for 1 week.

        -  The percentage of patients who received optimal targeted antibiotics 72 hours after
           blood collection for blood culture will be evaluated.
