  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genital prolapse is a common pathology with a prevalence ranging from 2.9 to 11.4% or 31.8%
      to 97.7%, depending on whether a questionnaire or clinical examination is used. The use of
      pessary in the treatment of prolapse remains discussed despite a satisfaction rate of 50 to
      80% in the literature and a minimal complications rate.

      The main objective of this study is to assess the satisfaction of patients carrying a pessary
      in the first year after the laying.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational cohort conducted at the Universitary hospital of Caen
      over a total period of 5 years.

      Patients with a symptomatic genital prolapse will all be offered the installation of a
      pessary. If they agree to participate in the study, they will be asked to respond to
      validated questionnaires: symptom questionnaires (PFDI-20, ICIQ-SF, USP), a sexuality
      questionnaire (PISQ-12), a quality of life questionnaire (PFIQ-7, BIS) and Satisfaction
      (PGI-I), several times: Before the installation of the pessary, at one month, at 6 months,
      then annually over 5 years
