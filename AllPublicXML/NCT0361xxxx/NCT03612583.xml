  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test a proposed strategy for lung- and diaphragm-protective
      ventilation (LDPV) in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Ventilation and
      sedation will be titrated to evaluate whether it is feasible and safe within this patient
      population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung injury and diaphragm injury incurred by mechanical ventilation have very serious adverse
      effects on patients with acute respiratory failure. Lung injury results from excessive
      mechanical stress and strain applied to the lung by the ventilator and/or respiratory
      muscles, while diaphragm injury results from either insufficient or excessive inspiratory
      effort.

      The objective of this study is to investigate a new LDPV strategy designed to prevent both
      disuse-mediated and load-induced diaphragm injury, while also preventing excess global and
      regional mechanical stress and strain in the injured lung. To achieve these goals, the
      following specific targets to be met are: (1) respiratory muscle effort similar to that of
      healthy subjects breathing at rest, (2) lung stress within safe limits, and (3) clinically
      acceptable gas exchange.

      Targets are assessed through measurements of global lung stress, tidal recruitment,
      inspiratory effort, diaphragm contractile effort and adequacy of respiratory muscle and
      systemic tissue perfusion. Measurements commence at enrollment and continue for 24 hours
      consecutively.

    <description>Ventilation and sedation will be progressively modified according to the LDPV algorithm to achieve targets. Patients will be crossed-over to the opposite PEEP strategy. LDPV titration will then be repeated to achieve LDPV targets. After establishing a combination of ventilation and sedation settings at which LDPV targets are achieved, the targets will be maintained over a 24-hour period.</description>
