  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      rhThrombin is a serine protease from human.The study is to assess the Safety, Tolerability,
      Immunogenicity and efficacy of rhThrombin.

    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, single-blind,blank controlled phase 1&amp;2 trial ,including 3
      independent parts toevaluate the safety,efficacy and immunogenicity.

      The first part is ascending dose,blank control tolerability and safety study. The Starting
      doses from 500IU/ml to 1000IU/mL and 2000IU/mL to evaluate the safety,efficacy.

      The second part is randomized, single-blind, blank controlled study to evaluate
      safety、efficacy and immunogenicity. Doses settings :1000IU/mL , 2000IU/mL and blank group
      which with absorbable collagen sponge when used.

      The third part is randomized, single-blind, blank controlled study to evaluate
      safety、efficacy and immunogenicity. Doses settings :1000IU/mL , 2000IU/mL and blank group
      which directly sprayed on hemorrhagic point when used.

             aspirin、clopidogrel、ticlopidine、dipyridamole、ginkgo biloba
             extract、heparin、warfarin、citrates、hemocoagulase、VitK、ethamsylate and Vitc,etc);

          5. Complicated with other serious diseases(active infections,uncontrolled diabetes and
             hyperthyroidism);

          6. Be allergic to thrombin(human)、serum(snake) and proteins (hamster);

          7. Female subjects are in lactation or serum pregnancy test are positive;

          8. Take part in other clinical trail within 4 weeks before geting into the study;

          9. Using the Thrombin products and Antithrombin antibodies or Coagulation V factor
             antibodies are positive before, after using rhthrombin, it may generate an immune
             response.
