  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the Mycoplasma pneumoniae-specific circulating antibody-secreting cell (ASC)
      response and Mycoplasma pneumoniae-specific interferon (INF)-γ-secreting T cell response,
      along with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology, in a cohort of children with
      community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and controls.

    <description>The ASC ELISpot will be developed based on the improved methods recently described [Nat Protoc 2013;8:1073-87]. This protocol allows rapid (6-8 h) detection of specific ASCs in small volumes (1-2 ml) of blood. M. pneumoniae protein P1 (50 μl/ml) will be used as antigen. The optimal concentration of coating antigen will be assessed in advance in two-fold serial dilutions for clear spot definition. The M. pneumoniae-specific T cell ELISpot will be developed based on methods recently described [Nat Protoc 2009;4:461-9].</description>

        CAP cohort:

        There will be a consecutive ongoing recruitment through the project leader or instructed
        physicians of the department of infectious diseases and emergency in daily clinical
        practice.

        Healthy control cohort:

        The project leader will be informed by the local surgeons about a planned elective surgical
        procedure, unrelated to respiratory tract disease, and will include children during the
        pre-operation discussion. Samples will be collected by the anaesthesist prior to the start
        of the surgical procedure, while the child is under general anaesthesia and has an
        intravenous line. In a subgroup of such children undergoing planned adenotomy, the removed
        adenoids will be collected after surgery.

        Family control cohort:

        Family members will be included simultaneously with the index CAP patients.
