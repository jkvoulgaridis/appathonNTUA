  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study proposed in this protocol aims to document the effect of Floatation-REST (reduced
      environmental stimulation therapy) on symptoms of anorexia nervosa.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Flotation-REST (reduced environmental stimulation therapy) alters the balance of sensory
      input by systematically attenuating signals from the visual, auditory, thermal, tactile,
      vestibular, and proprioceptive systems. Previous research has shown that this heightens
      interoceptive awareness and reduces anxiety in clinically anxious populations. Anorexia
      nervosa (AN) is characterized by elevated anxiety, distorted body image, and disrupted
      interoception, raising the question of whether floatation therapy might positively impact
      these symptoms. A recent safety study found that Floatation-REST was well tolerated by
      individuals weight-restored outpatients with current or prior AN. Additionally, participants
      reported improvements in affective state and body image disturbance following floating,
      raising the possibility that this intervention might be investigated for clinical benefit in
      more acutely ill cases.

      The primary aim of this study is to begin to examine the effect of Floatation-REST on body
      image disturbance in inpatients with AN. Secondary aims including determining whether
      Floatation-REST has an impact on anxiety, emotional distress, eating disorder severity,
      functional ability, and interoception.

    <intervention_name>Floatation-REST plus usual care</intervention_name>
    <description>Individuals will receive Floatation-REST plus usual care. Floating creates an environment with minimal visual, auditory, tactile, proprioceptive, and thermal input to the brain. The float rooms are lightproof and soundproof. A high concentration Epsom salt water solution allows individuals to effortlessly float on their back while remaining completely still, reducing both proprioceptive and tactile input to the brain. The temperature of the water is calibrated to the temperature of the skin (~94Â° F) and the temperature of the air is calibrated to the temperature of the water, making it difficult to discern the boundary between air and water, thus reducing thermal input to the brain while minimizing the need for thermoregulation of the skin.</description>
