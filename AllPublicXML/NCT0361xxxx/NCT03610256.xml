  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major public health problem worldwide. Bariatric surgery has proved to be the
      most effective treatment of morbid obesity in terms of weight reduction and remission of
      co-morbid conditions during long-term follow-up. Nowadays, France is ranked 3rd in terms of
      bariatric surgeries performed per year.

      Since the laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) was described in 1977, this
      restrictive and malabsorptive procedure has become a gold standard for morbid obesity with an
      average Excess Weight Loss % (EWL%) of 72% at 2 years, and a strong metabolic effect,
      especially with regard to type 2 diabetes remission. Nevertheless, failures are observed (up
      to 20%), particularly in super obese patients, which are then difficult to manage. In this
      population, biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS) is indicated due to its
      stronger weight loss and metabolic effect, but is still little performed worldwide because of
      its higher morbidity, surgical complexity and risk of malnutrition.

      A novel technique combining the physiological advantages of pylorus preservation and the
      technical benefits of single-loop reconstruction was introduced in 2007 by Sanchez-Pernaute,
      who described the single-anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy (SADI-S) as
      an evolution of the BPD-DS. With a 2.5-meter common channel, SADI-S seems to offer good
      results for the treatment of both morbid obesity and its metabolic complications, with an
      EWL% of up to 95% at 2 years and potentially less nutritional consequences.

      To date, there is only one Spanish randomized trial comparing SADI-S to BPD-DS, whereas
      BPD-DS represents less than 1% of bariatric procedures in France and is only allowed in super
      obese patients. Thus only preliminary data of poor scientific value exists. Nevertheless,
      facing very encouraging short-term outcomes, there is a real need for a prospective trial
      comparing SADI-S to a standard bariatric procedure.

      The aim of the investigator's study is to assess weight loss efficiency and the
      morbi-mortality of the SADI-S in comparison to a standard (RYGB), in order to validate this
      procedure among bariatric techniques

      HYPOTHESIS SADI-S is superior to the standard RYGB for weight loss, increasing the EWL% by
      10% (82% vs 72%, respectively) at 2 years.

    <description>The evolution of food choices and preferences will be measured before surgery and 3, 12 and 24 months after surgery using a computerized test: the &quot;Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire (LFPQ).
The Leed Food Preference Questionnaire provides measurements of different components of food preference and food reward, and is a computerized questionnaire. Participants are presented with an array of pictures of individual food items common in the diet. Foods are chosen from a validated database to be either predominantly high (&gt;50% energy) or low (&lt;20% energy) in fat but similar in familiarity, protein content, sweet or not-sweet taste and palatability. Responses are recorded and used to compute mean scores for high fat, low fat, sweet or savory food types (and different fat-taste combinations).
This assessment will be performed only in the coordinating center</description>
