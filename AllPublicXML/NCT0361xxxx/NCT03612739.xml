      This open-label Phase I study aims to define the recommended dose for further clinical
      development the NKR-2 treatment administered concurrently with AZA in treatment-naïve AML/MDS
      patients not candidates for intensive chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation.

      This Phase I study is divided into three sequential cohorts evaluating three different
      dose-levels of NKR-2 (1x108, 3x108 and 1x109 NKR-2 per injection) using a 3+3 design
      evaluate. Further patients will be enrolled at the RecD to reach 9 evaluable patients in
      total at the RecD.

      The study consists of a screening phase, a treatment administration phase and a follow-up
      phase divided into treatment follow-up (TFU) and long-term safety follow-up (LTSFU). For each
      patient who received at least one NKR-2 administration, the overall study duration will be 15
      years after first NKR-2 administration.

      This open-label Phase I study aims to define the recommended dose for further clinical
      development the NKR-2 treatment administered concurrently with AZA in treatment-naïve AML/MDS
      patients not candidates for intensive induction chemotherapy. The treatment consists in six
      consecutive cycles of AZA, administered at days

        1. to 7 of a 28-day cycle. Patients will be treated with 8 injections of NKR-2 at day 9 and
           23 of AZA cycles 2-3-4 and 5.

             treatment period, and the treatment follow-up period, he/she will have to be monitored
             for a Long-Term Safety Follow-Up (LTSFU) for up to 15 years after enrollment.

          2. Both men and women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible.

          3. The patient must be ≥ 18 years old at the time of signing the ICF.

          4. The patient must be treatment-naïve with a confirmed diagnosis of either:

        4.a. WHO-confirmed de novo or secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with intermediate- or
        adverse-risk cytogenetics. Note: Patient with AML M3 are excluded. or 4.b. WHO-confirmed
        myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with Revised International Prognostic Scoring System
        (R-IPSS) criteria [97] for Intermediate, High-risk or Very High-risk (High-grade) disease
        or refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB-1 and RAEB-2).

        5. The patient is not eligible for intensive induction chemotherapy. Note: The patient is
        defined as not eligible for intensive induction chemotherapy on the basis of Investigator's
        assessment of age, ECOG performance status, comorbidities, regional guidelines, or
        institutional practice, or all these.

        6. The white blood cell-count should be &lt;15x109 cells/L prior to 1st infusion of NKR-2.
        Note: Use of hydroxyurea (up to C1-D10) is permitted to achieve this concentration (see
        Section 6.4).

        7. The absolute bone marrow blast count should be &gt; 5%. 8. The patient must have an Eastern
        Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2. Note: Patient with anemia
        resulting in an ECOG performance status 3 is also eligible.

        9. The patient must have adequate hepatic and renal functions described in Table 1, as
        assessed by standard laboratory criteria (with LLN/ULN being the lower/upper limit of

        ml/min Total serum bilirubin ≤ 2.0 x ULN Or ≤ 3.0 x ULN with direct bilirubin within normal
        range in patients with well documented Gilbert's Syndrome, hemolysis or transfusion
        dependence ALT ≤ 3 x ULN AST ≤ 3 x ULN ALT: alanine aminotransferase; AST: aspartate
        aminotransferase; ULN: upper limit of normal 10. The patient must have a left ventricular
        ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≥ 40%, as determined by echocardiography or a multigated
        acquisition (MUGA) scan.

        11. The patient must have a good pulmonary function with a Forced Expiratory Volume in the
        first second (FEV-1)/Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) ≥ 0.7 with FEV-1 ≥ 50% predicted as

        the AML/MDS disease as judged by the Investigator.

        12. Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use effective contraception
        before, during and for at least 2 months after the last study treatment administration.

        Notes: Adequate contraception is defined as methods of birth control that, alone or in
        combination, result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used
        consistently and correctly. These include established use of oral, injected or implanted
        hormonal methods of contraception; placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine
        system; male sterilization, true abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and
        usual lifestyle of the patient).Women of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the
        study. Non-childbearing potential is defined as the consequence of hysterectomy,
        ovariectomy or post-menopause.

        visit schedule and all study procedures described in this protocol.
