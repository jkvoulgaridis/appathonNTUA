  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the impact of two interventions against
      insulin resistance on the composite endpoint of 10% improvement in baseline six minute walk
      distance or improvement in World Health Organization (WHO) functional class in humans with
      pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to test the hypothesis that interventions to improve insulin
      resistance will improve exercise capacity and World Health Organization (WHO) functional
      class in PAH. The investigators propose three specific aims to test this 1) A prospective 2x2
      factorial design 12-week clinical trial of metformin or placebo and activity intervention or
      usual care to assess effect on six minute walk and WHO functional class, 2) Assessment of the
      interventions in Aim 1 in a subset of patients on right ventricle (RV) and peripheral muscle
      function and lipid content and markers of pulmonary vascular disease to define how these
      interventions may work in PAH and 3) Identify and prospectively test peripheral blood markers
      of metformin response in PAH. The broad goals of this work are to demonstrate the efficacy
      and mechanisms of interventions against insulin resistance in PAH and to identify which
      patients are most likely to benefit from these interventions, moving to precision medicine in
      PAH.

      The investigators are planning a factorial design trial. Patients will be randomized twice.
      The first is metformin or placebo and is quadruple randomized. The second is mobile health
      (mHealth) intervention via texts or standard of care and is not blinded to the patients, but
      is to the investigator and thus is triple randomized.
