  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes distress (DD) is a negative emotional reaction to a diagnosis of diabetes and
      concerns about the burden of managing diabetes, the risk of complications, and inadequate
      support system. DD is common among people with diabetes and is strongly associated with poor
      diabetes self-care and poor diabetes control. Reducing DD should thus be an important
      component of diabetes management. In line with the growing evidence, the American Diabetes
      Association now recommends that providers &quot;routinely monitor people with diabetes for
      diabetes distress, particularly when treatment targets are not met&quot;. Despite increased
      recognition of the need to manage DD, interventions that are both feasible and effective for
      reducing DD in routine care settings are not yet known. A pilot study showed that health
      coaching (HC) has some efficacy in addressing DD but no adequately powered study has
      implemented a pragmatic research design capable of assessing the real-world effectiveness of
      HC in reducing DD.

      This study seeks to assess whether HC effectively reduces DD among primary care patients with
      diabetes, and whether HC is more effective than an educational program targeting DD. The
      investigators hypothesize that over a 6-month period, patients with poorly controlled
      diabetes and DD who enroll in and complete at least five HC sessions will achieve higher and
      clinically significant reductions in DD and HbA1c, and greater compliance with diabetes
      self-care recommendations than those who receive only an educational program targeting DD as
      part of usual diabetes care.

      The two-arm randomized controlled trial for patients with poorly-controlled diabetes is
      taking place at an academic family medicine practice in Houston, Texas. Both arms will
      receive usual care, which includes education about DD. In addition, the intervention arm will
      receive eight HC sessions over a five-month period. The primary outcome measure is reduction
      in DD over a six month period. Additional outcome measures include changes in glycemic
      control (HbA1C) and self-care practices (medication adherence, dietary, and physical activity
      behaviors). The study will also measure satisfaction and willingness-to-pay for HC to
      determine the extent to which HC, if effective for reducing DD, can be operationalized in
      similar healthcare settings.

    <masking_description>Due to the nature of the behavioral intervention, neither participants nor clinic staff can be blinded to allocation. However, to avoid bias in assessing outcomes, the analyst who will abstract the outcomes data from the electronic health record will not have access to information about the allocation. Hence retrieval of data on baseline and follow up diabetes distress scores, HbA1c, and diabetes self-management behaviors, and the creation of the analysis dataset will be done without knowledge or consideration of allocation status.</masking_description>

    <description>Change in diabetes distress score as measured by the diabetes distress scale (DDS). DDS scores range from 1 to 6, with scores that are less than 2.0 being indicative of little or no distress. Hence scores of 2.0 and above are significant and higher values are indicative of worse outcome.</description>

    <description>The intervention will seek to help participants express their diabetes emotional needs and to work with them to figure out what can be done to meet those needs. Depending on the unique needs of each participant, the coaching approach for this study will include: improving motivation and self-efficacy for diabetes management using motivational interviewing and appreciative inquiry; building trust and rapport through mindful listening, open-ended inquiry, and perceptive reflections; and expressing empathy through nonviolent communication. Each participant will receive eight individual coaching sessions over a five month period. All coaching sessions will be delivered over the phone (i.e. telecoaching). The coaching intervention will be done by a certified health and wellness coach.</description>
