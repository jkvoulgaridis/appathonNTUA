    <measure>Proportion of subjects achieving clinical response on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>CGI scale is used to assess the clinical response to treatment. CGI has five categories: very much improved, much improved, minimally improved, no change, and worsened. Clinically meaningful response is defined as &quot;very much improved', &quot;much improved&quot;, minimally improved&quot; on CGI severity index scale.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment emergent AEs are defined as a new event that occurs during or after first dose of study treatment, including any clinical significant laboratory values and vital signs.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in total and individual components of modified Japanese Dermatology Association Severity Index (mJDA) for GPP.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The modified JDA severity index has seven components: erythema, erythema with pustules and edema, fever and WBCs, CRP, and serum albumin. Skin lesions each score 0-3, each parameter (fever, WBCs, CRP, albumin) score 0-2, and the total mJDA severity score ranges 0-17.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Dermatology Life Quality instruments (DLQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is a 10-item questionnaire to assess limitations related to the impact of skin disease. The aim is to measure how much the skin condition has affected the subjects life including daily activities, work/school, personal relationships and treatment. The total score has a possible range of 0 to 30, with higher score corresponding to the worst quality of life.</description>
