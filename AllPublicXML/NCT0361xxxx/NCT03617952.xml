  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Despite their potential health and social benefits, adoption and use of improved cookstoves
      has been low throughout much of the world. Explanations for low adoption rates of these
      technologies include prices that are not affordable for the target populations, limited
      opportunities for households to learn about cookstoves through peers, and perceptions that
      these technologies are not appropriate for local cooking needs. The P3 project employs a
      novel experimental design to explore each of these factors and their interactive effects on
      cookstove demand, adoption, use and exposure outcomes.

      Methods:

      The P3 study is being conducted in the Kassena-Nankana Districts of Northern Ghana.
      Leveraging an earlier improved cookstove study that was conducted in this area, the central
      design of the P3 biomass stove experiment involves offering stoves at randomly varying prices
      to peers and non-peers of households that had previously received stoves for free. Using
      household surveys, electronic stove use monitors, and low-cost, portable monitoring
      equipment, we measure how prices and peers' experience affect perceptions of stove quality,
      the decision to purchase a stove, use of improved and traditional stoves over time, and
      personal exposure to air pollutants from the stoves.

      Discussion:

      The challenges that public health and development communities have faced in spreading
      adoption of potentially welfare-enhancing technologies, like improved cookstoves, have
      highlighted the need for interdisciplinary, multisectoral approaches. The design of the P3
      project draws on economic theory, public health practice, engineering, and environmental
      sciences, to more fully grasp the drivers and barriers to expanding access to and uptake of
      cleaner stoves. Our partnership between academic institutions, in the US and Ghana, and a
      local environmental non-governmental organization creates unique opportunities to disseminate
      and scale up lessons learned.

    <description>S1 group households located in 25 clusters that were included in a prior cookstove study: selected households are nearest neighbors (peers) of households who received free stoves in that prior study. This group is used to represent a potentially high peer influence on the adoption of improved cookstoves.
The P3 Bio Intervention is implemented in this group.</description>
