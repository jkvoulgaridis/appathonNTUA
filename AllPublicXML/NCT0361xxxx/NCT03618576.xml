  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall functional gain by balance rehabilitation after hip fracture surgery has not yet
      been fully investigated. Therefore, clinical studies should be conducted to evaluate the
      effectiveness of systematic and safe balance rehabilitation in patients after hip fracture.
      Investigators aim to evaluate the effect of computer-based balance specific exercise on the
      performance and balance ability of the elderly women who underwent hip fracture surgery.
      Investigators also investigate the intervention can reduce their fear of falling and coping
      ability. This study was designed as a prospective, open-label, single-center trial at a
      tertiary hospital setting. During the 2-week postoperative intervention period, patients will
      participate in the hospital's exercise program beginning 5-7 days after hip fracture surgery.
      All participants will follow the computer-based balance specific exercise program. Functional
      outcomes will be measure periodically for 6 months after surgery.

    <description>Balance specific exercise consists of total 10 days' physical therapy (PT) sessions (twice per day for 60 min) after surgery. It will be conducted with a computed posturographic system for diagnostics of balance and movement skills (Balance Master® System NeuroCom®) designed to objectively quantify balance and postural function of different origin. PT (weight-bearing, strengthening, gait training, aerobic, and functional exercises) was gradually increased based on the patient's functional level. Intensive patient education by multidisciplinary rehabilitation members was also provided.</description>
