      This is a Phase 1, open-label study of SH-1028 with dose escalation cohorts in locally
      advanced solid cancer patients who have progressed following prior therapy with an epidermal
      growth factor receptor(EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) agent or standard treatment.

             disease, radiation pneumonitis which required steroid treatment, or any evidence of
             clinically active interstitial lung disease.

         14. Refractory nausea, vomiting, or chronic gastrointestinal diseases, inability to
             swallow the study medication, or previous significant bowel resection that would

         15. History of hypersensitivity to any active or inactive ingredient of SH-1028 or to a
             drug with a similar chemical structure or class to SH-1028.
