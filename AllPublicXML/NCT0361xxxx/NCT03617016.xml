  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy of domperidone in treatment of
      functional dyspepsia (FD) in Chinese participants and identify sub-populations (subtype of
      the disease) who are sensitive to domperidone treatment.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Each Average Symptom Score Decreased at least 2 Points Compared to Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1 to Day 7 and Day 8 to Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Participants on every need will rate the severity of functional dyspepsia (FD) symptoms (postprandial fullness, early satiation, epigastric pain, epigastric burning, belching, epigastric bloating, nausea and vomiting) on a Likert scale of 7-point using e-diaries, the score range is 1 to 7. The higher the score, the more serious the outcome is.. For each FD symptom, the percentage of participants with each average symptom score (average of Day 1 through Day 7 and Day 8 through Day 14) decreased at least 2 points compared to baseline will be calculated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Frequency of Each FD Symptom</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 7 and Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>Participants on every need will rate the severity of functional dyspepsia (FD) symptoms (postprandial fullness, early satiation, epigastric pain, epigastric burning, belching, epigastric bloating, nausea and vomiting) on a Likert scale of 7-point using e-diaries, the score range is 1 to 7.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Disease-SpeciÔ¨Åc Quality of Life (QoL) in FD as Assessed by Nepean Dyspepsia Index (NDI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>QoL will be assessed by using the NDI questionnaire. The NDI is a reliable and valid measure of quality of life in FD. The NDI originally contains 42 items designed to measure impairment of a subjective ability engaged in relevant aspects of their life because of dyspepsia. The score range is 0 to 100. The higher the score, the more serious the outcome is.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must meet the diagnostic criteria for functional dyspepsia (Postprandial Distress
             Syndrome [PDS] and/or Epigastric Pain Syndrome [EPS]) according to Rome IV diagnostic
             criteria for functional gastrointestinal disorders before and through screening

          -  Must have had an upper endoscopy that shows no evidence of structural change that is
             likely to explain the dyspepsia symptoms. If the participant has had the upper
             endoscopy performed within 3 months before screening, no re-test is needed

          -  Must have an abdominal ultrasonography that shows no evidence of organic disease that
             is likely to explain the dyspepsia symptoms. If the participant has the abdominal
             ultrasonography performed within 3 months before screening, no re-test is needed

          -  A woman of childbearing potential must have a negative serum (beta human chorionic
             gonadotropin [beta-hCG]) pregnancy test at Screening

          -  A woman must agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purposes of assisted
             reproduction during the study and for 30 days after receiving the last dose of study
             drug

          -  Otherwise healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs,
             and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening. If there are
             abnormalities, they must be consistent with the underlying illness in the study
             population. This determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents
             and signed by the investigator. Specifically, for vital signs, the participant must
             have blood pressure (after participant has been supine for 10 minutes) between 90 and
             140 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) systolic (inclusive) and between 60 and 90 mmHg
             diastolic (inclusive)

             limited to) cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac disease, hematologic disease,
             coagulation disorders (including any abnormal bleeding or blood dyscrasias), lipid
             abnormalities, significant pulmonary disease (including bronchospastic respiratory
             disease), diabetes mellitus, renal or hepatic insufficiency, thyroid disease,

             syndrome, long QT syndrome, sudden unexplained death at a young age (less than or
             equal to [&lt;=] 40 years); or a history of second- or third-degree heart block

          -  Has clinically significant electrolyte disorders or conditions that result in
             electrolyte disorders, such as severe dehydration, vomiting, malnutrition, eating
             disorders, renal diseases, or the use of potassium-wasting diuretics or insulin in
             acute settings

          -  Has a history of esophageal, gastric, or duodenal surgery, including endoscopic
             surgery

          -  Has any condition in which stimulation of gastric motility might be dangerous, for

             obstruction, or perforation

          -  Has used any of the following medications 7 days before screening: proton pump

             drugs, cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs),
             nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, aspirin (including low-dose aspirin),
