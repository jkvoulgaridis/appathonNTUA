      The purpose of this study is to assess whether intravenous peri-operative Dexmedetomidine
      reduces opioid requirements and or improves pain control after Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty
      (UPPP) in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

      BACKGROUND/STUDY SIGNIFICANCE

      Patients with OSA undergoing surgery have increased surgical risk compared to patients that
      do not have OSA . Perioperative medication such as benzodiazepines and opioids can decrease
      upper airway tone, inhibit central respiratory drive and inhibit upper airway reflexes. The
      supine position may also worsen the severity of the OSA. Additionally, this group of patients
      is more likely to have a higher incidence of complications, particularly post operative
      hypoxemia , difficult intubation , and complicated extubation course .

      Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) along with other tongue base procedures are commonly
      performed surgical procedures used to help alleviate the symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea
      (OSA). Postoperative management of oropharyngeal pain is challenging since narcotic
      administration may compromise respiratory status in OSA patients. The Anesthesiology and
      Otorhinolaryngology communities have begun to rethink acceptable narcotic use in OSA patients
      especially following the recent FDA announcement highlighting serious adverse effects related
      to codeine consumption in children who had undergone tonsillectomies.

      Dexmedetomidine (Precedex) is a sedative with minimal respiratory depression. Its mechanism
      is via alpha 2 agonism and has 8 times the affinity for the alpha 2 adrenoreceptor than
      clonidine. It has been shown to have sedative, analgesic, and anxiolytic effects. It produces
      a predictable and dose dependent decrease in heart rate and blood pressure. Dexmedetomidine
      undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver and is then eliminated as methyl and glucuronide
      conjugates mostly via the renal system. The pharmacokinetics are markedly affected by hepatic
      insufficiency .
