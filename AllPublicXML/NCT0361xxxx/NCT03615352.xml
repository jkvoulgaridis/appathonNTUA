    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy versus
      aspiration and coagulation on ovarian reserve and pelvic pain in cases of ovarian
      endometrioma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients are presenting with ovarian endometrioma. They are all subjected to informed
      written consent, full history, general examination, local examination and transvaginal
      ultrasound. Follicular stimulating hormone (FSH), Lutenizing hormone (LH), Anti Mullerian
      hormone (AMH), Antral follicular count (AFC) and chronic pelvic pain which is assessed by
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of pain scoring system ,all are to be determined before and after
      laparoscopic surgery (postoperative three months); for two groups (Group A) cystectomy and
      (Group B) aspiration and coagulation. Histopathological examination was done to the
      cystectomy group to confirm endometriosis and detect the presence of healthy ovarian tissue
      in the excised cyst wall.

    <measure>Exploration of the impact of laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy versus aspiration and coagulation on Antral Follicular Count (AFC) as a measurement of ovarian reserve.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after laparoscopy</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of ovarian reserve by assessment of Antral Follicular Count (AFC) by measuring the number of visible ovarian follicles (2-10 mm mean diameter) that are observed during transvaginal ultrasonography in the early follicular phase (cycle days 2-5) in both ovaries. It is done before laparoscopy and after the surgery by 3 months.</description>

    <measure>Exploration of the impact of laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy versus aspiration and coagulation on chronic pelvic pain.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after laparoscopy</time_frame>
    <description>Pelvic pain is measured by Visual analogue scale of pain (VAS) which is a continuous scale comprised of a horizontal (HVAS) or vertical (VVAS) line, usually 10 centimeters in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors, one for each symptom extreme &quot;no pain&quot; (score of 0) and &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot; or &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot; (score of 10-cm scale).
The pelvic pain is assessed before laparoscopy and after laparoscopy by 3 months.</description>
