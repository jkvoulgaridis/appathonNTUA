  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optimal surgical therapy (debridement in chronic osteomyelitis; device exchange in patients
      with chronic prosthetic joint infection [PJI]) could be sometimes non-feasible, especially in
      the elderly population. Therefore, a medical therapy with oral prolonged suppressive
      antibiotic therapy (PSAT) seems to be an option to prevent recurrence and prosthesis
      loosening. Unfortunately, some patients are infected with resistant pathogens for which oral
      antibiotics are not suitable. Subcutaneous (SC) administration of injectable intravenous
      antibiotics as PSAT could be a convenient way to limit catheter-related complications and
      facilitate ambulatory care.

      However, there are few data concerning the development of resistance under subcutaneous
      prolonged treatment with betalactamine.

      The aim of this study is is just to constitute a biological collection from samples from the
      GUT microbiote in patients having a bone or joint infection treated by a suppressive
      subcutaneous antibiotherapy with betalactamine. Later analysis will be led on those samples
      to detect the acquisition of resistance or not.
