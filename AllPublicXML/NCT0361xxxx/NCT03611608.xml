    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess study drug activity by giving LY3316531 or placebo
      into a vein in the arm and then measuring blood flow to the skin, after capsaicin is applied
      to skin's surface. The study will last about 16 weeks inclusive of the screening period.
