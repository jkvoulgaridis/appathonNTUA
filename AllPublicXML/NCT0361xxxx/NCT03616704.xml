  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ARDS is the most common acute respiratory failure in the ICU and the mortality rate is still
      as high as 40%. Mechanical ventilation(MV) is the major supportive treatment for ARDS, but
      inappropriate ventilator setting could lead to patients suffering from Ventilator-Induced
      Lung Injury(VILI).

      VILI is an important factor in the aggravation of lung injury during MV. The main mechanism
      of VILI is the unreasonable pressure change (stress) causing excessive local stretch of the
      lung (strain), which eventually exceeds the capacity of the lung.

      The protective strategies during MV (limited platform pressure, low tidal volume, suitable
      PEEP) are important means of avoiding VILI during MV. The essences of these strategies are to
      limit the stress and strain of the lung during MV. However, these lung protective ventilation
      strategies only start from a single indicator and have certain limitations. Considering the
      various shortcoming of the current strategies, Amato et al. combined two indicators and
      proposed the concept of driving pressure(driving pressure=tidal volume/respiratory
      compliance). Several studies also confirmed that limiting the driving pressure can
      significantly improve patients' outcomes. But the concept of driving pressure and its safety
      threshold have certain limitations.

      Taking into the limitations of existing low tidal volume, limited platform pressure, and
      restricted driving pressure strategies in lung protection ventilation, Gattinoni et al. first
      integrated the all factors such as driving pressure, respiratory rate, airway resistance,
      respiratory rate and PEEP together and the concept of mechanical power was formally
      proposed.There is a good correlation between mechanical power and lung strain in a certain
      PEEP range. Cressoni et al. demonstrated through animal experiments that excessive mechanical
      power during MV caused significant VILI in animals; Guérin et al. also found that mechanical
      power was closely related to patient outcome in patients with ARDS. Not only that, but
      Gattinoni reanalyzed Güldner's experimental data and found that mechanical power is more
      valuable in reflecting lung damage than driving pressure. Mechanical power is a good
      indicator of response to patient VILI.

      Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that only limiting the driving pressure during MV
      of patients could not achieve ideal lung protective ventilation. Mechanical power may be a
      better indicator of response VILI; and the safety threshold of driving pressure based on
      retrospective analysis may not be suitable for patients with severe ARDS, and a lower driving
      pressure can protect patients with severe ARDS. This study intends to use a single-center,
      self-controlled study design to reflect lung injury through stress and strain and mechanical
      work of the lungs, to verify the safety of different driving pressures for severe ARDS, and
      to further find a safer driving margin for patients with severe ARDS

    <description>Global stress(cmH2O) and strain are currently recognized as the gold standards for responding to ventilator-induced lung injury, but it's difficult to monitor in clinic. In fact, small tidal volume(ml), driving pressure(cmH2O), etc. all lung protective ventilation strategies through indirectly reflecting stress and strain. This trial intends to calculate the correlation between the driving pressure and mechanical work(J/min) with stress and strain by changing the tidal volume, using the esophageal pressure（cmH2O） and the end-expiratory volume （cmH2O）of the lung to calculate the stress and strain.</description>
