  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep invasive endometriosis (DIE) includes lesions of the rectosigmoid. Theses lesions are
      associated with painful symptoms that can alter quality of life. High Intensity Focused
      Ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive ablative procedure using a high-intensity ultrasound
      probe to induce tissue devitalization using acoustic cavitation and thermal ablation. Focal
      One® is a transrectal HIFU device, which is validated to treat prostatic cancer.

      The primary objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the ability of the Focal One®
      HIFU device to detect and target posterior DIE lesions with intestinal involvement. The
      secondary objectives are to perform a HIFU lesion, to evaluate morphological modifications of
      the nodule in post-therapeutic imaging scans, to assess evolution of gynecological symptoms,
      intestinal symptoms, and patients' quality of life after treatment by HIFU and to collect
      safety data.

      20 Subjects with deep invasive endometriosis (DIE) will receive the HIFU treatment with Focal
      One® device.

      Subjects harboring an isolated recto-sigmoid DIE lesion with a persistence of symptoms
      despite hormonal treatment will be installed on the Focal One® device to:

        -  Evaluate its ability to locate and assess the volume of the endometriosic lesion

        -  Treat the targeted lesion by HIFU energy application. Real-time guided ultrasonography
           will be used to determine the location of the endometriosic nodule. Succession of HIFU
           exposure will be then used to treat maximum lesion volume, excluding a security margin
           of 3 mm with the digestive mucosae to prevent risk of fistulae.

      Patients will fill-out questionnaires on gynecological and intestinal symptoms and on quality
      of life before treatment and at 1 and 6 months after HIFU procedure. Imaging follow-up scans
      will be organized at 1 and 6 months and by a pelvic MRI scan at 3/6 months.

    <description>Endometriosic lesion localization and HIFU treatment will be conducted with the Focal One® device. The treatment area will be defined using sonography, pelvic MRI and a transrectal sonography data. Once the pre-defined lesion will be located with Focal One device, succession of HIFU exposure will then be used to treat maximum lesion volume, excluding a security margin of 3 mm with the digestive mucosae.</description>
