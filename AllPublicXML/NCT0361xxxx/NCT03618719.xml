    <textblock>
      Patients with treatment-naive obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) who need continuous positive
      airway pressure (CPAP) therapy on clinical basis are included as well as healthy controls
      without OSA. 15 cc peripheral venous blood is drawn on the date of diagnosis of OSA and 3-6
      months after CPAP therapy. Granulocytes are harvested and tested for its function, such as
      phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and bacteria-killing ability.
