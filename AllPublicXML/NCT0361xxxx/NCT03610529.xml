  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, controlled, comparative clinical trial of a new ECG monitoring system
      CardioSenseSystem prior CE marking. The aim of the study is to demonstrate that the
      CardioSenseSystem's cable-free ECG monitoring system (investigational device) is equivalent
      or better than traditional and accepted industry standard for cable-based ECG monitoring
      system (control device). In this study accepted industry standard is Philips Intellivue. In
      order to investigate this, the study will measure ECG monitoring interruptions, management
      time and alarm performance. The study population will consist of sixty (60) adult subjects
      requiring ECG and that are fulfilling the eligibility criteria for study participation. The
      subjects will be using both the investigational device and the control device simultaneous
      for measuring data loss, management time and alarm function up to 24 hours.

      A prospective, controlled and comparative clinical trial before CE marking of a new ECG
      monitoring system CardioSenseSystem. The study population will consist of sixty (60) adult
      subjects requiring ECG and that are fulfilling the eligibility criteria for study
      participation. The subjects will be monitored by both the investigational device and the
      control device for measuring data loss, management time and alarm function up to 24 hours.
      The duration of the study is estimated to 4 months.

      CardioSenseSystem is designed to provide wireless high-quality ECG monitoring. The system
      developed by Novosense AB consists of three components: the CardioPatch, the Novosense Base
      Station and the Back-End System. The CardioPatch is a wireless sensor capable to record and
      transmit ECG data. The CardioPatch send ECG data to the Novosense Base Station, which is the
      receiving unit. The Back-End System is used for presentation, storage and processing of ECG
      information. The CardioPatch sensor is applied to the body with an adhesive in the same way
      as a traditional ECG electrode. In contrast, the CardioPatch is a fully integrated unit
      containing electrodes, ECG amplifier and a radio transmitter. Novosense's wireless ECG
      sensors, CardioPatch, transmits the ECG signal 24 hours to the Novosense Base Station
      receiver.
