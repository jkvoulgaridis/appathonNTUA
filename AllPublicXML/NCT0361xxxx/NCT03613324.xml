  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prevalence rates of bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) and detrusor underactivity (DU) and
      their related clinical and urodynamic findings in women with ≥ pelvic organ prolapse
      quantification stage II cystocele are important for clinical consultation. Thus, the aim of
      this study was to elucidate the above findings and between-group associations.

    <textblock>
      Between November 2011 and January 2017, medical records of all women with ≥stage II cystocele
      who underwent 20 min pad testing and urodynamic studies in a medical center were reviewed.
      Only those with complete data of maximum flow rate (Qmax) and detrusor pressure at maximum
      flow rate (PdetQmax) were enrolled. ANOVA test and post-hoc testing with bonferroni's
      correction were used for statistical analysis. Woman were defined as having DU when Qmax was
      &lt;12 mL/s and PdetQmax was &lt;10 cmH2O, and were defined as having BOO when Qmax was &lt;12 mL/s
      and PdetQmax was ≥25 cmH2O with sustained detrusor contraction during voiding cystometry.
