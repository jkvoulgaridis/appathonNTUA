  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled trial designed to investigate whether the use of virtual
      reality immersive relaxation during hand/arm operations can allow for a relaxing operating
      room experience for patients while potentially reducing anesthesia requirements.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients in the experimental group will wear a headset and be immersed in a virtual reality environment during their surgery. There are various short videos and environments such as sitting on a beach that are designed to promote relaxation and calmness.
Throughout their surgery patients will be monitored according to current anesthesia standards. The relaxation programming will run for the duration of the operative procedure. At the end of the procedure the headset will be removed and standard postoperative care will commence.</description>

    <description>Patients in the usual care arm will undergo the current standard of care for hand/wrist surgery and postoperative recovery. They will be asked to refrain from using a virtual reality headset during their surgery.</description>
