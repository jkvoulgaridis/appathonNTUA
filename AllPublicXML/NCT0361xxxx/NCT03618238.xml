      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anlotinib in patients
      with stage IV extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTCL), nasal type, is a rare subtype of
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with relatively high incidence in China. L-asparaginase based
      chemotherapy improved overall response and prolonged the long-term survival for patients with
      stage IV. But the treatment for the patients with advanced disease and resistant to
      L-asparaginase based chemotherapy has not been established. The overall survival for these
      patients are very poor. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      anlotinib in patients with stage IV ENKTCL and refractory to L-asparaginase based
      chemotherapy.
