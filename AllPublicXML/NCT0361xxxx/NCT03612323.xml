      Comparing the efficacy of intra-ligamentary Piroxicam and intra-ligamentary Articaine on pain
      during and after endodontic treatment of mandibular molars with symptomatic irreversible
      pulpitis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Owing to the painful nature of endodontic treatment in teeth with symptomatic irreversible
      pulpitis and difficulty in achieving effective anesthesia particularly in mandibular molars
      due to various factors such as different bony landmarks, anatomical variations, needle
      deflection, accessory innervation, so local anesthesia isn't enough in such cases. Piroxicam
      is a long-acting potent analgesic non selective oxicams derivative, has a half-life of 50 hrs
      in the plasma.The onset of action of oral Piroxicam is 2-4 hrs, but it is anticipated that
      injectable piroxicam could produce more rapid onset of action. It could favourably overcome
      the intense pain up to 48 hrs following the treatment. It is also postulated that the
      intraligamentary injection enables the application of anti-inflammatory agents in the
      periapical intraosseous region. Moreover, intra-ligamentary injection of local anesthesia was
      reported to be an effective and easy way to control severe pain during endodontic treatment
      mainly in mandibular teeth which are more difficult than maxillary teeth , thus piroxicam may
      be effective as an adjuvant drug to support the action of local anesthetics.
