      This Phase 2, open-label study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, antitumor activity,
      and pharmacokinetics (PK) of Tomivosertib (eFT-508) in subjects who have initiated
      anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 monotherapy and either developed progressive disease (PD) per Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 on therapy or have undergone 12 weeks of
      anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 therapy with no evidence of partial response (PR) or complete response
      (CR).
