      Protein supplementation may promote increases in strength and hypertrophy in the context of
      resistance training (RT) and reduce markers of inflammation, while sufficient levels of
      protein are necessary for healing certain wounds and maintenance of muscle mass in a protein
      depleted state. Protein supplementation could be useful to improve clinical outcomes.

      Protein supplementation may promote increases in strength and hypertrophy in the context of
      resistance training (RT) and reduce markers of inflammation, while sufficient levels of
      protein are necessary for healing certain wounds and maintenance of muscle mass in a protein
      depleted state. Despite this, no studies have investigated the role of protein provision in
      the context of physical therapy (PT) or musculoskeletal rehabilitation, including following
      surgical interventions. Survey data of Americans in the highest protein consuming age range
      (19-30 year old consuming 91 g/kg body weight/day), show they have an adequate protein intake
      to maintain nitrogen balance at baseline (85 g/kg). However, if patients under consume
      protein, as apparent in older adults (mean intake of 66 g/kg) these individuals will require
      more during times of tissue healing or could benefit with more in attempting to build back
      their strength through RT or PT. Thus, protein supplementation could be useful to improve
      clinical outcomes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must not have other ligamentous involvement, or complications during the
             surgical procedure.

          -  They must not have had a concurrent meniscal repair (debridement is acceptable).

          -  They must not have post-operative limitations that interfere with rehabilitation.

          -  Patients determined by the referring surgeon to be poor candidates for the study for

             disease, food allergies, lactose intolerance, kidney or liver disease) or other
             reasons that deem them inappropriate to complete the intervention (driving distance

             will be excluded.
