  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Testing for vestibular dysfunction often induces dizziness and nausea, to the point that
      testing cannot be completed. The investigators will use a &quot;transcranial vibration system&quot;
      that has shown promise in improving comfort during testing for vestibular disorders.

      The investigators hypothesize that with this &quot;transcranial vibration system&quot;, the dizziness
      and nausea associated with caloric testing will be significantly reduced, while the clinical
      measures derived from the test will not be statistically significantly altered.

    <intervention_model_description>First phase: test 20 subjects. They will undergo the &quot;caloric testing&quot; part of the standard vestibular testing, with and without our transcranial vibration system (10 with device on then off, 10 with device off then on) and will describe their state on a &quot;visual analog scale&quot; (both dizziness and nausea) at the end.
Success is 1) substantially reduced dizziness ad nausea, 2) statistically unchanged clinical measures.
If (and only if) the first phase is successful, we proceed to the second phase. Second phase: identical to first phase, but is conducted with patients coming in the clinic for vestibular testing.
The order (&quot;device on&quot; first, or second) will be randomly assigned.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Subject in both phases will immediately know whether the transcranial vibrating system is on.
Analysis of outcomes (1-dizziness, 2-nausea, 3-clinical measures from vestibular nystagmography resulting from the caloric testing) will be blinded.</masking_description>

    <description>Visual Analog Scales (VAS, adapted from &quot;Visual Vertigo Analogue Scale&quot; for dizziness and &quot;Baxter Retching Faces (BARF)&quot; for nausea) will be filled out by the subject ten minutes after each phase of the caloric testing, i.e. &quot;with&quot; and &quot;without&quot; the transcranial vibration system.Each phase of the caloric testing itself takes approximately 30 minutes.
These Visual Analog Scales range from 0 to 10 (None to Agonizing). They will provide independent measures of the effectiveness of the transcranial vibration system.</description>

    <description>Transcranial vibrating system will be on then off (or off then on in a random order) during a repeated application of the &quot;calorics testing&quot;stimulus, i.e. warm or cold water irrigated in the left (then right) ear canal. The effect of the vibrating system on 1) resulting dizziness and nausea often experienced by patients and 2) clinical parameters measured by caloric testing will be quantified.</description>
