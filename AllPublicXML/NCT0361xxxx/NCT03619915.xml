  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several complications and comorbidities are frequently found in patients admitted to an
      Intensive Care Unit (ICU), including acquired ICU muscle weakness and physical and cognitive
      limitations. These issues lead to impaired quality of life and post-discharge functional
      independence. Thus, it is important to evaluate these factors in order to verify the effects
      of long-term hospitalization. Objective: To relate functional independence to the degree of
      pulmonary involvement in adult patients three months after discharge from the ICU. Methods:
      This will be a retrospective study with data collected from January 2012 to December 2013,
      that will include patients who underwent spirometry and answered the Functional Independence
      Measure Questionnaire. Patients will be divided into groups according to the classification
      of functional independence and spirometry.

    <time_frame>Three months after ICU discharge</time_frame>
    <description>The spirometry will follow the norms of the American Thoracic Society and reference values relative to the Brazilian population. The tests will be performed by physical therapists using the One Flow FVC® portable spirometer (Clement Clarke, England) and met the criteria for acceptance and reproduction of manoeuvres.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Independence Measure (FIM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months after ICU discharge</time_frame>
    <description>FIM will be use to evaluate the functional independence of patients containing eighteen items encompassing six dimensions. Each item can receive scores of one to seven, where one corresponds to total dependency and seven to full independence. Each dimension is analysed by the sum of the items that compose it and the total FIM score is given by the sum of each dimension, being able to vary from 18: complete dependence; 19 to 60: greater dependence (assistance of up to 50% of tasks); 61 to 103: less dependency (assistance of up to 25% of tasks); and 104 to 126: independent.</description>
