  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study adopts a strategy that has arisen from basic neuroscience research on facilitating
      adaptive brain plasticity and applies this to rehabilitation to improve functional recovery
      in peripheral nervous system injuries (including hand transplantation, hand replantation, and
      surgically repaired upper extremity nerve injuries). The technique involves combining
      behavioral training with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)â€”a non-invasive form
      of brain stimulation capable of facilitating adaptive changes in brain organization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will implement and evaluate an innovative program of post hand transplant
      rehabilitation; one that harnesses recent discoveries in neuroscience to facilitate
      long-term, experience-dependent adaptations within the brain's sensory and motor systems. The
      current approach to rehabilitation of function in allogeneic hand transplant recipients is
      largely the same as standard-of-care following hand replantation (re-attachment) and
      peripheral nerve repairs. This involves an eclectic combination of traditional therapies. In
      seeking to improve on this approach, there is potentially much to be gained by considering
      evidence that limb amputation not only impacts the peripheral nervous system but also the
      brain, and tailoring interventions accordingly.

    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after end of intervention (+/- 3 days).</time_frame>
    <description>The Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) measures limb function by having participants pick up various objects of different sizes, different weights, and different shapes (e.g., a glass of water, a cricket ball). This secondary outcome measure will investigate any change in participant performance between pre- and post-intervention sessions of the ARAT.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline upper limb movement as measured by actigraphy-derived variables during everyday life at periodic intervals after intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post intervention at week 1, post intervention at 1 month, post intervention at 3 months, post intervention at 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>This secondary outcome measure will employ actigraphy on participants to measure limb movement in everyday life before and after the intervention. Participants will wear wrist-watch like devices that contain accelerometers on each upper extremity in 24-72 hour sessions. Two primary variables will quantify upper limb activity from accelerometer data: the Bilateral Magnitude and the Magnitude Ratio. The Bilateral Magnitude quantifies the intensity of activity across both limbs, whereas the Magnitude Ratio quantifies the contribution of each limb to activity.
This outcome measure will investigate the change in the Bilateral Magnitude and Magnitude Ratio between a baseline pre-intervention test and post-intervention actigraphy sessions performed within one week of completion of the intervention, at 1 month post-intervention, 3-months post intervention, and 6-months post intervention.</description>

    <intervention_name>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a portable neurostimulation method that modulates cortical excitability. The technique involves placing two saline-soaked electrodes (anode and cathode) on the scalp and passing a small direct current (1.5 milliamps; mA) between them. Cortex underlying the anode is more easily excited due to lowered thresholds for depolarization of glutamatergic neurons, while thresholds are increased in neurons beneath the cathode, making them less excitable. Sham stimulation is easily implemented, and the technique can be effectively double-blinded.</description>
