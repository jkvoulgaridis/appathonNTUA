  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast surgery is known being associated to a high risk of persistent post-operative pain,
      which has been related, among other factors, to a poorly treated acute pain. Paravertebral
      block has been successfully employed for anesthesia and analgesia after breast surgery,
      however its impact on persistent post-operative pain has rarely been investigated. Aim of
      this study is to assess prevalence, characteristics and consequences of post-discharge pain
      and its correlation to the incidence of persistent post-operative pain development in a
      continuous cohort of patients undergoing breast surgery with a paravertebral block.

      Investigators designed a prospective, observational study on a continuous cohort of adult
      patients undergoing breast surgery with a standardized thoracic paravertebral block performed
      before general anesthesia induction. Patients were subsequently interviewed 6 months after
      hospital discharge in order to assess the incidence, features and duration of post-discharge
      pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women, with an incidence of more than one
      million new cases per year. In the majority of cases surgery is part of the treatment and
      prognosis has progressively improved during last years. Attention is thus being increasingly
      focusing on these patients' quality of life and chronic postsurgical pain, defined as pain in
      the area of surgery lasting beyond 3 month from the operation, has emerged as a frequent
      long-term complication, with prevalence up to 60%. This often-disabling condition has been
      shown to significantly affect cancer survivors' quality of life and to have a heavy economic
      impact on the healthcare system.

      Many potential risk factors have been proposed for the development of chronic post-breast
      surgery pain. A Cochrane systematic review has addressed the role of regional anesthesia in
      preventing the development of chronic postoperative pain, suggesting that &quot;paravertebral
      block may reduce the pain after breast cancer surgery in about one out every five women
      treated&quot;, these results being however weakened by the often poor quality and inadequate power
      of the studies available. Many predictors of chronic postoperative pain have been identified,
      one of them being a poorly treated acute pain; in this perspective, regional anesthesia could
      possibly play a role in preventing nervous system remodeling with resultant hyperalgesia,
      allodynia and sustained wound pain.

      Even if chronic postoperative pain has been progressively recognized as an issue after breast
      cancer surgery, its link to poorly treated acute postoperative pain and post-discharge pain
      (PDP) has been poorly investigated. Single shot paravertebral block is an effective technique
      to provide both anesthesia and good analgesia after breast surgery, but its benefits duration
      is still debated.
