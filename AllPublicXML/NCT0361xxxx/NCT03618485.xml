  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a group of clonal hematologic malignancies with great
      variation in reported patient life expectancy and are characterized by a relatively indolent
      course which can be complicated by thromboembolic events and transformation to acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML).

      The MPNs in the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of myeloid neoplasms
      consist of polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), primary myelofibrosis
      (PMF) including prefibrotic/early stage and over fibrotic stage, chronic myeloid leukemia,
      other (rare) disorders such as chronic neutrophilic leukemia and chronic eosinophilic
      leukemia and MPN unclassifiable (MPN-U).

      The prevalence and genetic characteristics of patients with MPNs in Taiwan are still unknown.
      Molecular tests which are required for the diagnosis of MPNs are not available in many
      hospitals which hamper the accurate diagnosis and subtype classification of MPNs. Moreover,
      the information of current therapeutic strategy for MPNs in most medical centers in Taiwan is
      also not available. The purpose of this MPN registry is to collect clinical data, molecular
      characteristics, treatment details and response to therapy, occurrence of complications
      during the course, disease progression to secondary myelofibrosis from PV or ET and secondary
      AML (sAML) transformation as well as survival. The clinical and molecular data including the
      high molecular risk (HMR) genes will be examined and correlated with treatment outcomes in
      Taiwanese MPN patients.

      The Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital-Linkou is a College of
      American Pathologists (CAP)-accredited lab which provides high quality of molecular genetic
      tests for hematologic malignancies. The three driver gene mutations are the major criteria
      for the diagnosis of MPN, the methodologies of mutational analyses have been well set up for
      the clinical use in this lab. In addition, this lab is also equipped with facilities for the
      detection of mutated genes which were recently identified as HRM category (presence of any of
      ASXL1, EZH2, SRSF2, IDH1 or IDH2), and mutations of other epigenetic regulators or splicing
      factors.

        Adult patients with MPNs newly diagnosed and followed in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and
        cooperative hospitals.Registry will be limited to patients newly diagnosed between 2016 and
        2019. Newly diagnosed means having the first bone marrow biopsy within 12 months from
        diagnosis.
