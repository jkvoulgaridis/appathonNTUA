  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the early stages of assisted reproductive technologies (ART), oocyte retrieval was
      performed via laparoscopy, a cumbersome and expensive process requiring general anesthesia.
      Today, transvaginal oocyte retrieval for ART is a routine procedure performed under
      ultrasound guidance. Double-lumen retrieval needles, which are capable of flushing ovarian
      follicles, were developed to overcome the possibility of oocyte retention within the ovarian
      follicles and retrieval collection system. Single lumen needles have been introduced and are
      routinely used by most groups due to their supposed ability to retrieve the same number of
      oocytes in a shorter operation time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After a long period in which Humanitas department used double lumen needles for oocytes
      retrieval in the last four years the choice of the needle is an operator choice, usually
      influenced by the number of follicles present at human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) trigger.

      This prospective randomized controlled clinical trial is designed to highlight differences
      between Double Lumen Aspiration Needle and Single Lumen Needle among 2 double lumen and 2
      single lumen needles commonly used in Humanitas' clinical practice in terms of:

      Number of oocytes retrieved, oocyte recovery percentage per aspirated follicles, recovery
      time for single oocyte, percentage of Metaphase II (MII) oocytes retrieved.

      Standard protocols will be used for controlled ovarian hyper stimulation. Trans vaginal
      ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval will be performed 36 hours ± 2 after hCG injection with
      the patient under deep sedation.

      One hundred patients per each needle will be enrolled in this trial.
