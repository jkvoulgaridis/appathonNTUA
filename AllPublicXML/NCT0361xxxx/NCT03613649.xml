      The Phase I Thorough QT/QTc (TQT) study will be performed in a single center, the Vince &amp;
      Associates Clinical Research, Inc., clinical trials unit (CTU), in 72 healthy male or female
      subjects, aged 18 to 45 years inclusive, to evaluate the effect of zoliflodacin on the
      corrected QT interval of the electrocardiogram (ECG) using Fridericia's Formula (QTcF) and
      other ECG parameters; the correlation of the drug concentrations (and pharmacokinetic (PK)
      profile) with time-matched, placebo-corrected, baseline-adjusted difference in QTcF interval
      (delta delta QTcF); and the PK and safety profiles of the new zoliflodacin formulation. Each
      subject will receive one dose of each of four treatments: zoliflodacin 2 g orally,
      zoliflodacin 4 g orally, placebo for zoliflodacin 4 g orally, and moxifloxacin 400 mg orally.
      The study will last approximately 12 weeks with a subject participation duration of up to 55
      days. The primary hypothesis to be tested is that following administration of zoliflodacin 2
      g and 4 g, the upper bound of the one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) of treatment effect
      on delta delta QTcF is &gt; / = 10 msec for at least one of the ECG assessments, against the
      alternative hypothesis that all mean effects are &lt; 10 msec. The primary objective is to
      evaluate the effect of zoliflodacin on the corrected QT interval of the ECG using
      Fridericia's formula (QTcF).

      The Phase I Thorough QT/QTc (TQT) study will be performed in a single center, the Vince &amp;
      Associates Clinical Research, Inc., clinical trials unit (CTU), according to a randomized,
      double-blinded (except for the use of moxifloxacin), placebo-controlled, four-period,
      four-treatment, crossover design balanced with respect to first-order carryover effect in 72
      healthy male or female subjects, aged 18 to 45 years inclusive, to evaluate the effect of
      zoliflodacin on the corrected QT interval of the electrocardiogram (ECG) using Fridericia's
      Formula (QTcF) and other ECG parameters; the correlation of the drug concentrations (and
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile) with time-matched, placebo-corrected, baseline-adjusted
      difference in QTcF interval (delta delta QTcF); and the PK and safety profiles of the new
      zoliflodacin formulation. Each subject will receive one dose of each of four treatments:
      zoliflodacin 2 g orally, zoliflodacin 4 g orally, placebo for zoliflodacin 4 g orally, and
      moxifloxacin 400 mg orally. The study will last approximately 12 weeks with a subject
      participation duration of up to 55 days. The primary hypothesis to be tested is that
      following administration of zoliflodacin 2 g and 4 g, the upper bound of the one-sided 95%
      confidence interval (CI) of treatment effect on delta delta QTcF is &gt; / = 10 msec for at
      least one of the ECG assessments, against the alternative hypothesis that all mean effects
      are &lt; 10 msec. The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of zoliflodacin on the
      corrected QT interval of the ECG using Fridericia's formula (QTcF). The secondary objectives
      are: 1) to evaluate the effects of zoliflodacin on other ECG parameters (PR, QRS, and RR
      intervals, and heart rate (HR)); 2) to evaluate the sensitivity of QTcF measurement using
      moxifloxacin; 3) to evaluate the effect of zoliflodacin on T-wave morphology; 4) to evaluate
      the PK of 2 g and 4 g oral zoliflodacin under fasting state; 5) to evaluate the relationship
      between zoliflodacin PK and time-matched QTcF pharmacodynamics (PD); 6) to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of 2 g and 4 g oral zoliflodacin.

Power Calculation:
Enrollment of 72 subjects would provide at least 84% power to conclude a negative effect, given that up to 16 subjects may withdraw early prior to beginning to replace subjects (at least 56 subjects evaluable), and assuming a standard deviation of ΔΔQTcF of 7 msec and an underlying effect of 5 msec.</groups_desc>

        <title>Incidence of Abnormal T-wave Morphology Following Administration of Zoliflodacin</title>
        <description>Categorical T-wave morphology analysis was collected in three ECG replicates at each timepoint (Baseline, 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 12 h, and 24 h post-dose). Abnormalities present in any one or more of the baseline timepoint replicate ECGs recorded for a particular period was considered to be present at baseline for post-dose ECGs from that specific period. If a subject had an ECG morphological abnormality in more than one replicate ECG of a study timepoint, the subject was counted only once for that timepoint. Flat is defined as T amplitude &lt;1 mm (either positive or negative) including flat isoelectric line and Biphasic is defined as T-wave that contains a second component with an opposite phase that was at least 0.1 millivolts (mV) deep (both positive and negative/positive and polyphasic T-waves included).</description>

          <description>Change from baseline calculated by subtracting the Day -1 (baseline) hematology measurement from the 24 h post dose, and a follow up hematology measurement. Follow up is defined as either the check-in visit for the next period or the final visit. Hematology parameters included white blood cell count, and differential (absolute counts of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils).</description>

        <description>Urine for the clinical laboratory test was collected on Day -1, 24 hour post dose and the check in for the following dosing period. The results for glucose dipstick, protein dipstick and occult blood - dipstick were reported in categorical results. The possibilities were negative, trace, 1+, 2+, and 3+. If the dipsticks were 1+ or greater, microscopic evaluations were performed for erythrocytes, leukocytes and bacteria. For microscopic results to be deemed abnormal, the results must be reported 6 or greater per high power field.</description>

        <title>Changes From Baseline in ECG Measures: PR Interval, QRS Duration, QT Interval, QTcF Interval and RR Interval</title>
        <description>Change from baseline in ECG is calculated by subtracting the baseline (pre-dose) measurement from the post-dose measurement. Post-dose measurements were taken 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 24 h after dosing and prior to the next dose (follow up). The following ECG Parameters were analyzed: PR Interval (Interval From Onset of P-wave to the Onset of the QRS Complex), QRS Duration (Time From the Start of the Q-wave to the End of the S-wave), QT Interval (Interval From Onset of the Q-wave to the End of the T-wave), QTcF Interval (QT Interval Corrected by Fridericia's Formula) and RR Interval (Interval From the Peak of the R Wave of a QRS Complex to the Peak of the R Wave of the Next QRS Complex).</description>
