  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persons traumatized through sex trafficking can demonstrate similar neurobehavioral and
      executive function (EF) deficits as persons with cortical injuries. In this pilot study,
      occupation-based activity (OBA) programming was implemented at a residence for females who
      had been trafficked. The study hypothesis was that OBA would facilitate development of EF
      skills in these clients, enabling more successful occupational performance. Method: Eight
      women engaged in OBA sessions over the course of eight months. Session objectives were to
      maximize independence in daily life skills and to foster EF component skills such as
      problem-solving, decision-making, cooperation, direction following and appropriate
      self-expression. Outcome measures used were the Executive Function Performance Test (EFPT),
      the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) and the Occupational Therapy Task
      Observation Scale (OTTOS). Results: Gains were seen from baseline to final session in COPM
      score changes meeting minimally clinical difference, and OTTOS scores showing significant
      improvement: t(7)= -2.49, p=.04. Preliminary findings suggest that occupation-based
      programming may facilitate development of EF skills in sex-trafficked women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals who are sex-trafficked experience a combination of sexual violence, emotional
      trauma, and physical injuries that lead to high rates of depression, anxiety and post
      traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Prolonged stress and adverse learning experiences can also
      cause use-dependent brain changes that influence executive functioning (EF) development.
      Other distressing situations, such as living in poverty or in dangerous environments and
      experiencing early sexual trauma, can result in interrupted development of executive
      functioning skills Although the current OT literature in the area of human and sex
      trafficking provide recommendations regarding areas of advocacy, education and
      occupation-based interventions, there is no empirical evidence to date investigating the
      efficacy of occupation-based interventions with survivors of sex trafficking (SST). The
      research question addressed in this pilot study was whether occupation-based interventions
      would improve the overall occupational performance of SST living in a residential program.
      Therefore, the purpose was to objectively determine the efficacy of occupation-based activity
      to improve EF skills in SST; the researchers expected that an improvement in EF skills would
      translate to improved occupational performance.

      This pilot study used a one-group, pretest-posttest design. Participants in the study were
      residents of a local residential program for survivors of sex trafficking (SST). Eight women,
      average age, 20 to 50 years who were living in the home during the eight-month project
      period, engaged in the occupation-based intervention groups provided and completed assessment
      outcome measures (Canadian Occupational Performance Measure and the Executive Function
      Performance Test) before and after completing the program. Group behavior was scored at each
      session attended with the Occupational Therapy Task Observation Scale (OTTOS). Group sessions
      consisted of specific tasks performed to completion that emphasized problem-solving,
      decision-making, frustration tolerance and cooperation.

      Current performance level rating and performance satisfaction scores from the COPM, as well
      as scores from each area of the EFPT, were collected upon initial evaluation and at the end
      of the eight-month intervention period. OTTOS scores were recorded during each group
      intervention for individual clients and graphically recorded to demonstrate individual
      changes over time; day one OTTOS scores were compared to the OTTOS score of the final
      intervention. All comparisons were completed using two-tailed, paired t-tests with a .05
      alpha level for significance.

    <description>The EFPT is a task-based measure where clients engage in actual functional tasks, including a simple cooking activity, use of telephone to obtain public information, organization of a medication routine, and money management. The number of cues needed to perform each task and the type of cue used is recorded. The EFPT measures the construct of executive function.</description>

    <measure>The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The COPM measures the construct of occupational performance. The tool consists of an unstructured interview whereby the rater assists the client in articulating current daily activities in the domains of self-care, work, and leisure. From this list of activities, the client rates the importance of each activity and her current satisfaction with performance on each task. A prioritized list of the five most important activities is created and associated satisfaction levels are assigned. The list can serve as a foundation for intervention planning and creation of client-centered goals.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Occupational Therapy Task Observation Scale (OTTOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The OTTOS evaluates task and general behavior. Skills subsumed under task behavior measured by the OTTOS include 1) engagement; 2)coordination, 3) follows directions, 4) quality of work, 5) independence, 6) initiative, 7) decision making, 8) concentration, 9) frustration tolerance, and 10) problem solving; skills subsumed under general behavior include 11) appearance, 12) activity level, 13) expression, 14) cooperation, and 7) socialization. Each skill is scored on a 10-point rating scale, 0 being dysfunctional, and 10 being functional. A total score for task behavior is generated (max 100) and a total score for general behavior is multiplied by 2, to also obtain a max of 100. The tool is frequently used with clients having psychiatric disorders and has shown a high correlation (0.92) between occupational therapist raters.</description>

    <description>Group sessions consisted of specific tasks performed to completion that emphasized skills such as problem-solving, decision-making, frustration tolerance, appropriate pacing, attention, inquiring, sequencing, gathering, organizing, adjusting, responding, enduring, initiating and cooperating. Examples of tasks included projects that the women were specifically interested in learning such as jewelry making, holiday decorations, clay work and other home d√©cor projects. Investigators observed these and other behaviors during the group sessions, and scored individuals using the OTTOS instrument.</description>
