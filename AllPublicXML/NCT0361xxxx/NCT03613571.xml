  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a single-centre, open single-arm study in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral
      Sclerosis (ALS) of intermediate progression rate. Eligible subjects will be administered
      weekly doses of ILB. A total of 5 subcutaneous (s.c.) doses will be administered at the study
      clinic.

      The study consists of 10 visits; One 2-part screening visit, 5 ILB administration visits, and
      3 follow-up visits. Each individual patient's study participation will be 4 months, including
      the screening and follow-up visits. Fifteen patients are planned to be included.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ILB in
      patients diagnosed with ALS.

      ILB is a solution for subcutaneous (s.c.) injection in saline solution. The dose administered
      will depend on the subject's body weight at the second study visit, prior to the first ILB
      administration.

      No formal sample size calculation has been performed for this study. The proposed sample size
      is considered sufficient in this early phase 2 development to provide adequate information on
      the patients. Categorical data will be presented as counts and percentages. Continuous data
      will be summarised using descriptive statistics.

    <description>The ALSFRS-R provides a physician-generated estimate of the patient's degree of functional impairment, which can be evaluated serially to objectively assess any response to treatment or progression of disease. The ALSFRS-R includes questions that ask the physician to rate his/her impression of the patients level of functional impairment in performing one of twelve common tasks. Each task is rated on a five-point scale from 0 = can't do, to 4 = normal ability. Individual item scores are summed to produce a reported score of between 0=worst and 48=best

The Norris rating scale includes questions that ask the physician to rate his/her impression of the patients level of functional impairment in performing one of 34 common tasks and bodily functions. Each task or function is rated on a four-point scale from 0 = can't do, to 3 = normal ability. Individual item scores are summed to produce a reported score of between 0=worst and 100=best
