    <description>Pretreatment：patients enrolled in this study will receive 20 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide for solid tumor or 20-60 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide for hematological tumor once daily for 3 times. NK cells infusion is allowed within 2-14 days after treatment.
NK cells infusion：30-60 minutes before infusion，ant-allergic agents are applied (promethazine 25mg,i.m. ; Cimetidine 0.4g i.v. ; diphenhydramine 50mg po.). NK cells are intravenously infused into patients with 15-30 minutes every other day for one to three times. The number of every infused NK cells is 1-3×10^7/kg, counted as the number of CD56+ cells. Patients with severe pleural or ascites can also receive pleural or abdominal cavity perfusion simultaneously. The total number of infused NK cells is no more than 5×10^9 cells. 4 hours after NK cells infusion，IL-2 is applied every other day for six times</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with advanced malignant tumors diagnosed by pathological histology and/or
             cytology who have failed multi-line therapy and have no standard treatment method are
             unable to undergo surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy;

          2. Age 18-75 years old (≥18, ≤75);

          3. ECOG: 0-1;

          4. Priority should be given to the inclusion of ovarian cancer, malignant leukemia,
             lymphoma, etc. that have been shown to respond well to NK cell therapy;

          5. Expected survival period ≥ 3 months;

          6. Hematology tests also meet the following requirements:

        1) WBC≥3×109/L, ANC≥1.5×109/L, Hb≥90g/L, PLT≥100×109/L; 2) TBIL ≤ 1.5 × ULN (normal upper
        limit), ALT and AST ≤ 2 × ULN (if there is liver metastasis, then ≤ 5 × ULN); 3) Endogenous
        creatinine clearance ≥ 60 ml/min (calculated based on Cockcroft-Gault formula); (7) Length
        of solid tumors do not exceed 6 cm; (8) Signing of informed consent from each patient

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of other malignancies with a disease-free period &lt;5 years (except for cured
             basal cell carcinoma of the skin, cured carcinoma of the cervix in situ, and
             gastrointestinal tumors proven to be cured by endoscopic mucosal resection);

          2. Patients with brain metastases (unless the investigator believes that brain metastasis
             is currently stable, it is generally not recommended for enrollment);

          3. Transplant recipients;

          4. T-cell lymphoma patients;

          5. Allergies to biologics used in this treatment;

          6. Patients with HIV and syphilis;

          7. HBV carriers;

          8. Patients who are undergoing radiation therapy or immunotherapy within 4 weeks;

          9. Patients who have undergone high-dose radiation therapy on the lung and liver within 4
             months;

         10. Patients with pulmonary inflammation determined by chest radiography;

         11. Oxygen saturation ≤ 90% on room air;

         12. Patients with cachexia caused by advanced tumors;

         13. Long-term use of immunosuppressive drugs or patients who are using immunosuppressive
             drugs;

         14. Those with serious autoimmune diseases;

         15. Patients with organ failure (grade 4 of heart function; liver function with Child
             class C or above; brain metastasis with disturbance of consciousness; severe
             respiratory failure symptoms);

         16. Active infections (including intra-abdominal infections).

         17. Researchers consider it inappropriate to participate in the trial
