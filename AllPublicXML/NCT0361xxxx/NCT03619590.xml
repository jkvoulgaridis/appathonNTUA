  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Twinrix Pregnancy Registry is to prospectively collect data describing
      exposure to Twinrix before or during pregnancy, potential confounding factors (such as
      exposure to other medications) and information related to the outcome of the pregnancy.

      This is a prospective, voluntary, observational, exposure-registration study. Twinrix is
      designated as Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Pregnancy Category C, which means that its
      safety in human pregnancy has not been determined. The Registry is intended to provide an
      early signal of potential risks in advance of results from formal epidemiologic studies.
      Registry statistics can supplement animal reproductive toxicology studies and assist
      clinicians in evaluating the potential risks and benefits of vaccination for individual
      patients.

      The Twinrix Pregnancy Registry will be maintained by GSK Vaccines Clinical Safety and
      Pharmacovigilance. Enrolment in the Registry will begin at the time of commercial launch of
      Twinrix in the United States (US). At the time of initiation of the Registry, pre-existing
      reports of pregnancy from clinical trials will be evaluated and enrolled when the criteria
      for registration are met. Reporting of exposed pregnancies is voluntary. Pregnancies will be
      registered following maternal exposure to Twinrix within 28 days prior to conception or
      during pregnancy. Registration of pregnancies is prospective, i.e., reported during pregnancy
      before the pregnancy outcome is known. Retrospective reports, in which the pregnancy outcomes
      are known at the time of reporting, will also be reviewed to assist in the detection of any
      unusual patterns that may exist among the reported birth defects. However, because there is
      no denominator from which risk can be calculated, these reports will be excluded from the
      analysis.

    <description>Participants were followed from registration upon exposure to Twinrix within 28 days prior to conception until data on pregnancy outcome was obtained. Follow-up via telephone or a form mailed to the contact was sought in the month of the estimated date of delivery.
Pregnancy outcomes were stratified by the trimester of exposure, with an additional stratum for preconception exposure with no subsequent administration during pregnancy; multiple exposures were classified by the earliest trimester of exposure. Gestational weeks were counted from the date of the last menstrual period. The second trimester was considered to begin at week 14, and the third trimester beginning at week 28.
Pregnancy outcomes were dichotomized according to the presence or absence of birth defects and further categorized as: Live births, Spontaneous abortions (i.e., pregnancy losses), Induced abortions and Fetal deaths.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Study population included pregnant women who prospectively reported exposure to Twinrix within 28 days prior to conception or at any time during pregnancy. 245 pregnancies were prospectively registered in the study. 142 pregnancies were lost to follow-up. Outcomes were reported for 103 pregnancies. Hence, the number of subjects started is 103.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 105 outcomes were reported for 103 pregnancies due to 2 sets of twins, one each from pregnancies with reported exposure during the first trimester and an unspecified trimester, respectively.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Number of Outcomes From Pregnancies With Reported Exposure Within 28 Days of Last Menstrual Period</title>
        <description>Participants were followed from registration upon exposure to Twinrix within 28 days prior to conception until data on pregnancy outcome was obtained. Follow-up via telephone or a form mailed to the contact was sought in the month of the estimated date of delivery.
Pregnancy outcomes were stratified by the trimester of exposure, with an additional stratum for preconception exposure with no subsequent administration during pregnancy; multiple exposures were classified by the earliest trimester of exposure. Gestational weeks were counted from the date of the last menstrual period. The second trimester was considered to begin at week 14, and the third trimester beginning at week 28.
Pregnancy outcomes were dichotomized according to the presence or absence of birth defects and further categorized as: Live births, Spontaneous abortions (i.e., pregnancy losses), Induced abortions and Fetal deaths.</description>

        <title>Number of Outcomes From Pregnancies With Earliest Reported Exposure During the Third Trimester</title>
        <description>Participants were followed from registration upon exposure to Twinrix during third trimester of pregnancy until data on pregnancy outcome was obtained. Follow-up via telephone or a form mailed to the contact was sought in the month of the estimated date of delivery.
Pregnancy outcomes were stratified by the trimester of exposure, with an additional stratum for preconception exposure with no subsequent administration during pregnancy; multiple exposures were classified by the earliest trimester of exposure. Gestational weeks were counted from the date of the last menstrual period. The second trimester was considered to begin at week 14, and the third trimester beginning at week 28. Pregnancy outcomes were dichotomized according to the presence or absence of birth defects and further categorized as: Live births, Spontaneous abortions (i.e., pregnancy losses), Induced abortions and Fetal deaths.</description>

        <population>Analysis was performed on the outcomes reported for the pregnancies with exposure to Twinrix within 28 days prior to conception or at any time during pregnancy. A total of 105 outcomes were reported for 103 pregnancies due to 2 sets of twins, one each from pregnancies with reported exposure during the first trimester and an unspecified trimester.</population>
