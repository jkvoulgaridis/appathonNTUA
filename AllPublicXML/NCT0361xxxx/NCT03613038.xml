  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to improve the fundamental knowledge about articulatory motor performance in
      people with Lou Gehrig's disease (also known as ALS) and Parkinson's disease (PD), in order
      to develop more sensitive assessments for progressive speech loss, which may lead to the
      improved timing of speech therapies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal is to optimize dysarthria assessment by improving the early detection and
      tracking of articulatory performance in progressive dysarthrias. The short-term goal of the
      proposed cross-sectional study is to focus on ALS and PD and quantify articulatory kinematic
      performance as a function of phonetic complexity, which is experimentally manipulated based
      on theoretical principles of speech motor development. The research strategy is to use 3D
      electromagnetic articulography to examine phonetic complexity effects of single word stimuli
      at the articulatory kinematic level in 15 talkers each with preclinical, mild, and moderate
      dysarthria, relative to 45 controls. The central hypothesis is that as dysarthria severity
      increases the discrepancy in articulatory performance, indexed by movement speed, distance,
      coordination, and variability, between people with dysarthria and typical controls will
      significantly increase at a lower phonetic complexity level.

    <description>Conduct a comprehensive kinematic assessment using state-of-the art 3D speech tracking technology on individuals with ALS and PD as well as healthy talkers to identify articulatory motor disturbances as a function of phonetic complexity and dysarthria severity. Phonetic complexity will be experimentally manipulated using the consonant and vowel complexity classification system proposed by Kent (1992) that takes into account the underlying articulatory motor adjustments required to produce various speech sounds.</description>

    <ipd_description>The data collected during this study, especially from people with ALS, cannot be easily duplicated so it will be readily shared with other researchers conducting motor speech research. In addition, few investigators have access to tongue tracking technology; therefore, making the tongue kinematic data available will allow other investigators to answer pertinent questions related to speech decline in progressive dysarthrias. Both the raw data and processed data will be made available to interested investigators but will be devoid of identifiers in order to protect the privacy of the participants. Data documentation such as descriptors and units will also be shared to prevent misinterpretation or confusion. Besides the data itself, the PI is willing to share the stimuli as requested by other investigators.</ipd_description>
