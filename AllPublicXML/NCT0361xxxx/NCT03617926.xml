      The present study is set-up to compare in vivo clinical performance and safety of the test
      product versus an in the US commercially available, pyrethrum-based product (RID® shampoo).
      The study will be performed in subjects ≥2 year of both genders with confirmed diagnosis of
      head lice infestation. To support safety, local and global tolerability, skin and ocular
      irritation will be assessed and adverse events (AEs) will be registered.
