      This is a multi-center convenience sample prospective study comparing the results of the
      Verify Now® Aspirin Test and PRUTest® Platelet Reactivity Tests with the Japan
      investigational reagents to reagents registered in Japan in the expected population receiving
      aspirin (ASA) and the P2Y12 inhibitor clopidogrel.

      -  The Primary Objectives of this study are to compare the results of:

        -  The VerifyNow Aspirin Test with AA, an investigational reagent as defined in Japan,
           against LTA with AA investigational reagent as defined in Japan (study reference
           reagent), in subjects receiving DAPT (ASA and clopidogrel or subjects taking no platelet
           inhibitors including ASA;

        -  The VerifyNow Aspirin Test with AA, an investigational reagent as defined in Japan,
           against LTA with collagen (study reference reagent),

           o In subjects receiving DAPT (ASA and clopidogrel) or in subjects taking no platelet
           inhibitors including ASA

        -  The VerifyNow PRUTest with ADP, an investigational reagent as defined in Japan, and
           PGE1, against LTA with ADP, an approved reagent in Japan (study reference reagent) and
           PGE1, and

        -  The VerifyNow PRUTest with ADP (an investigational reagent as defined in Japan) and PGE1
           against LTA with ADP reagent approved in Japan (study reference reagent) with no PGE1, o
           in up to 75 subjects receiving DAPT (ASA and clopidogrel) and in up to 55 subjects
           taking no platelet inhibitors (total up to 130 subjects).
