    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn if Ixazomib maintenance treatment (chemotherapy) works
      to control the disease. Through this study, the investigators hope to learn more about ways
      to prevent or delay relapse of AL Amyloidosis.

                  red staining with exhibition of an apple-green birefringence

               -  If clinical and laboratory parameters insufficient to establish AL amyloidosis or
                  in cases of doubt, amyloid typing may be necessary

               -  Measurable disease as defined by serum differential free light chain
                  concentration (dFLC, difference between amyloid forming [involved] and non
                  amyloid forming [uninvolved] free light chain [FLC]) ≥ 50 mg/L) (or M-protein of
                  0.5g/dl) prior to initial therapy.

               -  At least one organ involved with AL amyloidosis including renal, cardiac,

          3. At least a hematologic partial response (PR) defined by the updated AL response
             criteria (Pallidini et al. JCO 2012) to one line of initial therapy (may include

             corticosteroids, proteosome inhibitors, IMIDs - including in combination) or upfront
             ASCT (with or without preceding induction). Patients who receive ixazomib as part of
             initial therapy are eligible.

          6. Patients must be within 12 months of the start of initial therapy.

                  program, if applicable, OR

               -  Agree to practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and
                  usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation,
                  symptothermal, post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods
                  of contraception.)

               -  Have a negative serum pregnancy test done ≤ 7 days prior to registration, for
                  women of childbearing potential only

          9. Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status post-vasectomy), must agree
             to one of the following:

               -  Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study

               -  Must also adhere to the guidelines of any treatment-specific pregnancy prevention
                  program, if applicable, OR

               -  Agree to practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and
                  usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,
                  symptothermal, post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods
                  of contraception.)

         10. Patients must meet the following clinical laboratory criteria:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000/mm^3

             or use of St. John‟s wort.

          9. Known allergy to any of the study medications, their analogues, or excipients in the
             various formulations of any agent.

             previously diagnosed with another malignancy and have any evidence of residual
             disease. Patients with early stage prostate cancer, non melanoma skin cancer or
             carcinoma in situ of any type are not excluded; patients with malignancies that have
             undergone complete resection are not excluded.

         12. Patient has &gt; Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy, or Grade 1 with pain (not controlled with

         13. Participation in other clinical trials, including those with other investigational
             agents not included in this trial, within 21 days of the start of this trial and
