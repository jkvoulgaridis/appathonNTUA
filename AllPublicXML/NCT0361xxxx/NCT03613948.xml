        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inherited retinal disease

          -  Age between 4 months and 75 years

          -  Subject who has clinically confirmed visual impairment including night blindness or
             photophobia. Subject should meet one of the following criteria

          -  pigmentary retinopathy in both eyes

          -  reduced response in photopic or scotopic electroretinogram in both eyes

          -  photoreceptor degeneration in optical coherence tomography in both eyes

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  unilateral retinal disease

          -  Subject who had previously confirmed genetic testing

          -  Age less than 4 months or more than 75 years

          -  When congenital infection or trauma are suspicious for the cause of retinal disease

          -  When age-related macular degeneration, myopic degeneration, autoimmune origin are
             suspicious for the cause of retinal disease

          -  No visual impairment or normal electroretinogram (e.g., benign fleck)

          -  Illiterate subject who can not understand informed consent
