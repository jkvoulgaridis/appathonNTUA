    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II study compare survival outcomes and toxicity of two chemotherapy
      regimens (irinotecan plus lobaplatin or irinotecan) for the second-line treatment of
      recurrent small-cell lung cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most widely applied first-line treatment mode for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients
      was chemotherapy as initial treatment. Etoposide with cisplatin or carboplatin were
      considered the standard first-line regimen in SCLC. As for second-line chemotherapy, single
      regimen irinotecan or a combined regimen containing irinotecan were one of preferred regiems.
      While there still is no consensus on second-line therapy. Clinical studies have demonstrated
      that the combination of irinotecan and carboplatin or cisplatin did not improve outcome in
      recurrent SCLC patients compared with irinotecan alone. One of the main reasons is that
      carboplatin or cisplatin has been used in the first-line treatment, and SCLC showed
      cross-resistance to carboplatin and cisplatin.

      Lobaplatin is a platinum complex with DNA alkylating activity that was developed by ASTA
      Medica (Degussa) for the treatment of cancer. Lobaplatin as the third-generation platinum
      antineoplastic agent, showed promising antineoplastic effects in variety of preclinical test
      tumor models, which overcomes some forms of cisplatin or carboplatin resistance in
      preclinical tumour models. Retrospective studies also have demonstrated the efficacy of
      Lobaplatin in patients with relapsed SCLC. Thus, we perform this randomized study to compare
      the efficacy and safety of irinotecan plus lobaplatin versus irinotecan in patients recurrent
      SCLC.
