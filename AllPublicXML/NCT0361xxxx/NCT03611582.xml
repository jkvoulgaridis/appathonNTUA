    <textblock>
      This study will look at the change in participant's body weight from the start to the end of
      the study. This is to compare the effect on body weight in people taking semaglutide (a new
      medicine) and people taking &quot;dummy&quot; medicine. Together with the medicine, the participant
      will also be part of an intensive lifestyle program where the participant will have talks
      with study staff about healthy food choices, what the participant can do to lose weight and
      be more physically active. The participant will either get semaglutide or &quot;dummy&quot; medicine -
      which treatment the participant gets is decided by chance. The participant will need to take
      1 injection once a week. The study medicine is injected with a thin needle in a skin fold in
      the stomach, thigh or upper arm. For the first 2 months the participant will be on a low
      calorie diet. The diet is made up of bars, shakes and 1 low calorie pre-prepared meal for
      each day. The study will last for about 1.5 years. The participant will have 32 clinic visits
      with the study doctor.
