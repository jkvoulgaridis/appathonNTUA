  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The introduction of penile implants has revolutionized the management of male erectile
      dysfunction. However, a number of intraoperative complications may occur, which have a major
      impact on clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction such as bleeding, infection and urethral
      injury.

      Patients undergoing penile implant surgery with fibrotic corpora (e.g., after priapism, after
      infection, or with Peyronie disease) have a higher risk rates of urethral perforation. This
      may be related to previous scarring, the difficultly in dilating scarred and fibrotic corpora
      and its inherent risk of corporal crossover and urethral perforation.

      This work examines the efficacy of pre-operative urethral sterilization in rendering the
      urethra as sterile as the skin of the genital area, with the skin sterilized as per the ISSM
      guidelines for penile prosthesis implantation, thereby allowing primary repair of urethral
      injuries should they occur, and implantation in the same setting, without a higher risk of
      infection.

      The study will involve 100 male patients undergoing aseptic surgery (regardless the
      procedure). Patients will be divided into two groups:

      Group 1: control group, n=50 Group 2: Chlorhexidine group (Ch group), n=50 Pre-operatively,
      urethral instillation with Chlorhexidine gel will be performed for the Ch group, while for
      the control group, instillation will not be performed.

      After conclusion of surgery and with the patient on the operative table, the following swabs
      will be obtained:

        -  A penile skin swab.

        -  A urethral swab. Skin and urethral swabs will be compared for bacterial colonization by
           culture and sensitivity, across the two groups.

      study design Comparative experimental (interventional) study Sample size

      The study will involve 100 male patients undergoing aseptic surgery (regardless the
      procedure). Patients will be divided into two groups:

      Group 1: control group, n=50 Group 2: Chlorhexidine group (Ch group), n=50

      Pre-operatively, urethral instillation with Chlorhexidine gel will be performed for the Ch
      group, while for the control group, instillation will not be performed.

      Chlorhexidine gel will be prepared according to an international product; Instillagel®, used
      prior to urethral catheterization as analgesic / anti-septic, with the following composition:

      6ml of Instillagel® gel contain: 117.6mg lidocaine hydrochloride, 3.1mg chlorhexidine
      digluconate, 3.8mg methyl hydroxybenzoate (E218), 1.6mg propyl hydroxybenzoate (E216) 11ml of
      Instillagel® gel contain: 215.7mg lidocaine hydrochloride, 5.8mg chlorhexidine digluconate,
      6.9mg methyl hydroxybenzoate (E218), 2.9mg propyl hydroxybenzoate (E216)

      The other ingredients are:

      Hyetellose, propylene glycol* (E 1520), sodium hydroxide and purified water.
      Intra-operatively, the Ch group will receive Chlorhexidine instillation again before surgery,
      while the control group will not.

      For both groups, skin sterilization will be performed according to the ISSM &quot;International
      Society of Sexual Medicine&quot; guidelines for skin preparation before penile prosthesis surgery
      (Darren J. Katz et.al 2012)

      After conclusion of surgery and with the patient on the operative table, the following swabs
      will be obtained:

        -  A penile skin swab.

        -  A urethral swab.
