  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Negative outcomes impact individuals with a history of ACL reconstruction (ACLR) despite
      completion of formal rehabilitation and clearance to return to physical activity (PA).
      Focused exercises and targeted health education may improve these negative outcomes and
      increase quality of life. The purpose of this study is determine the effects of an 8-week
      rehabilitation program on strength, sensorimotor function, functional performance and
      patient-reported outcomes in patients with a history of ACLR. A secondary aim will be to
      identify baseline PA levels and dietary intake patterns in these individuals. Participants
      will complete standard knee radiographs and all baseline measures, and resume normal
      activities of daily living for one-week while wearing an accelerometer to quantify PA levels
      and complete two, 24-hour dietary recalls to examine dietary patterns. After one-week,
      participants will come back to the laboratory and complete the pre-intervention assessments
      prior to randomization to the exercise or control group. After 8-weeks, participants will
      complete all outcome assessments 24-48 hours, 1-month and 3-months post exercise completion.
      The investigators hypothesize the intervention group will have significantly better outcomes
      post-intervention compared to the control group. In addition, the investigators hypothesize
      areas of educational and behavioral intervention related to PA engagement and dietary
      strategies to support weight management will be needed.

    <measure>Change in Joint Specific Self-Reported Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, pre-intervention (one week later just prior to the initiation of the intervention), 24-48 hours post-intervention, 1-month and 3-months post</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome (KOOS) survey to assess self-reported knee joint function across five domains (pain, symptoms, activities of daily living, sport and recreation, and quality of life). The questionnaire will include 42 questions across the domains, that are scored on a 5-point Likert scale. Each subscale is scored separately, and range from 0-100 (100=perfect self-reported knee function). The scores are transformed for each subscale as follows: 100-(actual raw score x 100)/ possible raw score. Participants will complete the survey at the time of consent, one week later just prior to the initiation of the intervention, up to 48 hours after completion of the intervention, then at 1 and 3 month follow up visits. Data will be presented longitudinally as the change in self-reported function over the duration of the study, up to three months.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, pre-intervention (one week later just prior to the initiation of the intervention), 24-48 hours post-intervention, 1-month and 3-months post</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the Fear Avoidance Belief Questionnaire (FABQ) to evaluate fear avoidance during activities of sport and physical activity. The FABQ is a 15-item survey, scored on a 6-point Likert scale where 6 is completely agree and 0 is completely disagree. There are 5 items in the FABQ-PA section and 10-items in the Sport section. Higher scores indicate elevate levels of fear avoidance beliefs. Participants will complete the survey at time of consent, one week later just prior to the initiation of the intervention, up to 48 hours after completion of the intervention, then at 1 and 3 month follow up visits. Data will be presented longitudinally as the change of fear avoidance beliefs over the duration of the study and up to three months after the intervention.</description>

    <measure>Change in General Health-Related Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, pre-intervention (one week later just prior to the initiation of the intervention), 24-48 hours post-intervention, 1-month and 3-months post</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the modified Disablement in the Physically Active Scale (mDPA) to evaluate general health related quality of life. This questionnaire will include 16 questions across two domains (physical and mental) and is scored on a 5-point Likert scale, where 0 indicates no problem and 4 indicates severe problem. The mDPA-physical component has 12-items, and scores can range from 0-48 while there are 4 items on the mDPA-mental and scores range from 0-16. Higher scores indicate decreased health-related quality of life. Scores are simply added for each component to get a final score. Participants will complete the survey at the time of consent, one week later just prior to the initiation of the intervention, up to 48 hours after completion of the exercise regimen (intervention), then at 1 and 3 month follow up visits. Data will be presented longitudinally as the change in self-reported health related quality of life over the duration of the study, up to three months.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete the Knee Self-Efficacy Scale (KSES) to evaluate their knee-related self-efficacy. This questionnaire will include 22 questions, each scored on a 0-10 scale where 0-not at all certain and 10-very certain. There are four sections: Daily activities, sport and leisure activities, physical activities and knee function in the future. The sum of the items is calculated and then divided by the total number of items to get a total score. Higher scores indicate greater levels of knee self-efficacy. Participants will complete the survey at the time of consent, one week later just prior to the initiation of the intervention, up to 48 hours after completion of the exercise regimen (intervention), then at 1 and 3 month follow up visits. Data will be presented longitudinally as the change in knee-related self-efficacy through the duration of the study, up to three months.</description>
