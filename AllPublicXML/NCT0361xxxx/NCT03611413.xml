  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study was designed with a prospective cohort of all patients undergoing urgent surgery for
      left colon perforation between March 2014 and June 2017 who were treated according to a
      specific ERAS programme (ERAS group/29 patients). This group was compared with a historic
      case-matched control group with conventional care (CC group/21 patients). The main endpoints
      were postoperative 30-day morbidity, length of postoperative hospital stay, rate of
      readmission within 30 days, and mortality. The inclusion criteria were patients over 18 years
      old with a low-moderate risk of mortality according to a Peritonitis Severity Score (PSS)
      between 6-11 points.
