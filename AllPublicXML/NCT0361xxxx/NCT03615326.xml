  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will compare the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab plus trastuzumab in
      combination with standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy versus trastuzumab in combination with
      SOC chemotherapy in participants with HER2-positive gastric cancer. The primary hypotheses of
      the study are that pembrolizumab plus trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy is
      superior to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in terms of 1) progression free survival (PFS) per
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by blinded
      independent central review (BICR), and 2) overall survival (OS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pembrolizumab (200 mg) or placebo will be administered intravenously [IV] on day 1 of each
      3-week cycle. Trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose, 6 mg/kg maintenance dose) will be
      administered IV on day 1 of each 3-week cycle. SOC chemotherapy for the global cohort will
      either be FP (80 mg/m^2 cisplatin administered IV on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle and 800
      mg/m^2 5-fluorouracil [5-FU] administered IV on Days 1-5 of each 3-week cycle) or CAPOX (1000
      mg/m^2 capecitabine administered orally twice daily [BID] on days 1-14 of each 3-week cycle
      and 130 mg/m^2 oxaliplatin administered IV on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle). A Japan cohort
      will receive SOX chemotherapy consisting of S-1 (tegafur, 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine
      [CDHP], and potassium oxonate [Oxo]) administered orally BID according to Body Surface Area
      (BSA) on Days 1-14 of each 3-week cycle and oxaliplatin (130 mg/m^2) administered IV on Day 1
      each 3-week cycle.

    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 assessed by BICR</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, progressive disease (PD) is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression. PFS will be determined for each treatment arm.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>

    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 assessed by BICR</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a Complete Response ([CR], disappearance of all evidence of disease) or Partial Response ([PR], regression of measurable disease and no new sites) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR. ORR will be determined for each treatment arm.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR) per RECIST 1.1 assessed by BICR</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>For participants who demonstrate CR or PR, DOR is defined as the time from first response (CR or PR) to subsequent disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. DOR will be determined for each treatment arm.</description>

    <measure>Adverse Events (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant that is temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment. The number of participants who experience an AE will be reported for each treatment arm.</description>
