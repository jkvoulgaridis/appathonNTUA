  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thirst is considered as one of the most distressing symptoms experienced by patients
      hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Whereas pain is a permanent concern for all
      caregivers, thirst is often ignored and its complications are poorly known. Mechanisms
      involved in thirst regulation are numerous and complex. To date, care of thirst is still non
      optimal. Critically ill patients are usually rehydrated intravenously or using a naso-gastric
      tube, thus shunting the mouth as a therapeutic target to relieve the patient's thirst.

      Water, cold and mint applied in mouth were studied separately and were shown to decrease
      thirst significantly on animal models and healthy humans.

      Therefore, the hypothesis of this study is that application of small mint ice cubes in mouth
      of very dehydrated ICU patients should allow decreasing quickly and significantly thirst for
      these patients, before the correction of their biological parameters, like natremia and
      osmolarity.

    <measure>Change of thirst intensity at 5 minutes from mint ice cubes application</measure>

    <description>The primary endpoint is a change of thirst intensity of at least 1.5 points on the thirst intensity scale at 5 minutes from mint ice cubes application. Thirst intensity scale is a numeric scale ranging from 0 to 10 points. 0 corresponds to no thirst (the best outcome). 10 corresponds to a thirst of the strongest possible intensity (the worst outcome).</description>

    <description>This secondary endpoint is a change of thirst-associated discomfort on the discomfort scale at 5 minutes from mint ice cubes application. The discomfort scale is a numeric scale ranging from on a 0 to 5 points. 0 corresponds to &quot;very comfortable&quot; (the best outcome). 5 corresponds to &quot;very uncomfortable&quot; (the worst outcome).</description>
