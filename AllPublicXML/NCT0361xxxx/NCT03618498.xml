      Purpose: To evaluate the logical surgical approaches in closing macular holes in eyes of
      proliferative diabetic retinopathy with retinal detachment

      High MH closure rate can be achieved. Other than high myopia, MH with RD may appear in
      several conditions, such as severe vitreomacular traction, proliferative diabetic retinopathy
      (PDR).clinical charts were reviewed of patients of proliferative diabetic retinopathy
      suffering from MH with RD who were treated with vitrectomy combined with inverted epiretinal
      ILM flap,inverted ILM flaps insertion techniques, or free ILM flaps.Standard 3-port 23 or 25
      gauged pars plana vitrectomy was performed. After core vitrectomy, anterior-posterior
      oriented tractions as well as all fibrovascular tissues were removed as thoroughly as
      possible.The patients were kept in a facedown position overnight and were allowed to take any
      positions except supine for approximately one week.Various surgical approaches utilizing in
      managing macular hole may effectively closing macular holes and reattach retina.

    <intervention_model_description>A 25-gauged blunt-tipped needle connected with Viscoat® (Alcon laboratories, Fort Worth, TX, USA) containing syringe was placed within the macular hole just below the level of the macular hole. A small amount of Viscoat® was injected into and around the hole. An ICG solution (25 mg ICG in 15 ml 5% glucose-water solution, final concentration = 1.7 mg/ml) was then carefully applied around the macular hole within the arcade.Excessive ICG was immediately removed by suction. ILM at the parafoveal area was peeled in a circular fashion. Care was taken not to peel the ILM flap across the hole edge. If possible, at least 1.5 to 2 disc area of partially detached ILM around the hole was left in place with central part remained attached to the edge of the hole.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The ILM flap anchoring on the hole edge was inverted and covered the hole.Otherwise, temporal side ILM flap was used. However, if the risk of ILM flipping back was judged to be high, ILM insertion instead of ILM hole coverage was adopted.If the size of the ILM flaps was judged inadequate, the double ILM insertion technique was used, done by adding a piece of previously obtained free ILM flap on top of the inverted ILM tissue until they were securely in place.</description>
