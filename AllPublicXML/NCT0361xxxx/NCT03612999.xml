  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To learn about individual glycemic response to physiological and psychological conditions
      across a diverse population, the investigators will collect sensor and lifestyle data
      directly from participants as they engage in daily activities. The investigators will collect
      real-time glucose data from a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) system; accelerometer,
      aggregated activity, and sleep data from a wrist-worn activity tracker; mood and experiential
      data; and food information. Non-sensor data will be collected using a paper log, or via a
      study app when available.
