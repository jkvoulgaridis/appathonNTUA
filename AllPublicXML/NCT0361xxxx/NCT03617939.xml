  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is not a treatment study. The overall objective is to develop an improved standard of
      care through studying blood, tissue, biological, etc. samples, that patients have allowed
      researchers to procure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN) hopes to establish a unique
      collection of blood, tissue, other biological samples and their associated data (survey data,
      medical records data, cancer registry data, and other related data) from thousands of
      patients with cancer or at risk of having cancer. Their hope is to, over time, facilitate new
      clinical trials, technology, informatics solutions, and personalized medicine to each cancer
      patient.
