  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK3326595 is a potent, selective, reversible inhibitor of the protein arginine
      methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5)/Methylosome protein 50 (MEP50) complex that is being tested as an
      oral treatment for human subjects with cancer. Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid
      leukaemia are bone marrow neoplasms for which novel, effective therapies are desperately
      needed. This is an open-label, multicentre, multi-part study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, and clinical activity of GSK3326595 in subjects with relapsed and refractory
      MDS, chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML), and hypoproliferative AML that has evolved from
      an antecedent MDS. The study will be conducted in two parts and at the end of Part 1, if
      pre-specified criteria are met, then the study will be expanded with three additional parts
      that will be opened in parallel (Part 2A, 2B and 2C). Part 1 is composed of a single-arm dose
      expansion cohort to determine the clinical benefit rate of GSK3326595. Part 2A is a
      randomized head-to-head Phase II evaluation of GSK3326595 compared to investigator's choice
      of best available care (BAC). Part 2B is composed of an abbreviated series of dose escalation
      cohorts followed by a single-arm dose expansion cohort to determine the overall response rate
      of the combination of GSK3326595 plus 5-azaciditine in newly-diagnosed MDS. Part 2C is a
      single-arm dose expansion study to evaluate the clinical activity of single-agent GSK3326595
      in subjects with AML whose disease contains mutations in spliceosome proteins.

        secondary to prior anti-neoplastic therapy, of any risk score, or AML, which has evolved
        from an antecedent MDS/MPN of any risk score, provided that the myeloblast percentage in
        the marrow is ≤ 30% or the peripheral white blood cell count is less than 20,000 cells/μL

        or high risk per CPSS or CPSS-mol criteria, or MDS/CMML secondary to prior anti-neoplastic
        therapy, of any risk score

        Part 2C:

        AML (irrespective of antecedent MDS and myeloblast percentage in the marrow, irrespective
        of hydroxyurea therapy)

          -  Prior therapy Part 1: Subjects must have disease that failed to respond to, or
             progressed despite, treatment at least one systemic therapy Part 2A: Subjects must
             have disease that failed to respond to, or progressed despite, treatment with at least
             one systemic therapy Part 2B: Subjects must have received no prior therapy for their
             disease, or have completed no more than one cycle of a hypomethylating agent Part 2C:
             Subjects must have disease that has failed to respond to, or progressed despite
             treatment with, at least one but no more than four prior lines of systemic therapy

             Auxiliary Factor 1 (U2AF1), or Zinc Finger CCCH-Type, RNA Binding Motif and
             Serine/Arginine Rich 2 (ZRSR2); in addition, at least 12 subjects must have documented
             wild type status of all of these genes/proteins. While enrolment will initially
             proceed without consideration of mutational status, enrolment may be limited to one
             group or the other as the study proceeds based on the enrolment rates in each group,
             in order to ensure this minimum number of mutated and wild type subjects.

        Part 2A: No specific mutational or molecular requirements Part 2B: No specific mutational
        or molecular requirements Part 2C: Subjects must have a documented loss-of-function
        mutation(s) at least one of the following genes/proteins: SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, or ZRSR2
