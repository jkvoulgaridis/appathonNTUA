  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To analyze the proportion of hereditary tumors in ovarian cancer patients in China, as well
      as the spectrum of variations; the ctDNA characteristics in patients with ovarian cancer; the
      correlation between the clonal status of mutations and therapy response; whether ctDNA
      detection can be used to predict the risk of ovarian cancer recurrence; and the
      characteristics of immune repertoire before and after treatment in patients with ovarian
      cancer.

      100 OC cases with available matched tumor DNA and plasma will be collected. All patients will
      be treated according to clinical guidelines, and receive circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) liquid
      biopsy at the time of diagnosis, at mid treatment, at the end of treatment and during
      follow-up. The study will be ended when the patients have progressive disease (PD) or reach
      the longest follow-up time (2 years).
