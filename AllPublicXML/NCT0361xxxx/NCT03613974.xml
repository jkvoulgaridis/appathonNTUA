  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      using a biased-coin design up-down sequential method, different concentration of lidocaine
      will be used for popliteal block After 45 successful block (positive response), the data will
      be used to calculate the minimum lidocaine concentration that can result in successful
      popliteal block in 90% of patients
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The response of a patient determined the lidocaine concentration given to the next patient (a
      biased-coin design up-down sequential method). If a patient had a negative response, the
      lidocaine concentration was increased by 0.1% w/v in the next patient. If a patient had a
      positive response, the next patient was randomized to receive the same lidocaine
      concentration (with probability of 0.89), or to receive a concentration 0.1% w/v less (with
      probability of 0.11).

    <description>the popliteal block will be performed (once) in all patients using 20 ml of lidoacine. The response of a patient determined the lidocaine concentration given to the next patient (a biased-coin design up-down sequential method). If a patient had a negative response (failed block), the lidocaine concentration was increased by 0.1% w/v in the next patient. If a patient had a positive response (successful block), the next patient was randomized to receive the same lidocaine concentration (with probability of 0.89), or to receive a concentration 0.1% w/v less (with probability of 0.11).</description>
