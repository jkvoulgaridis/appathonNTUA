    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of early manual therapy on function,
      pain, range of motion (ROM), hand and pinch grip strength and disability level in patients
      underwent volar plating after distal radius fracture (DRF). Patients were randomly divided
      into two groups: Routin Physiotherapy (RP) or Early Manual Therapy (EMT). While RP group
      received routine physiotherapy, EMT group received routine physiotherapy plus Mulligan's
      Mobilization With Movement technique. All treatments were done two sessions a week, through
      12 weeks. Function, pain, range of motion (ROM), hand and pinch grip strength and disability
      level of patients were assessed. Measurements were made at postoperative week 3, 6 and 12.
