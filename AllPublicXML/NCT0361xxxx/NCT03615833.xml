  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is greater than 15%. PAD is associated
      with an increased risk of cardiovascular death, coronary heart disease and stroke, with a
      mortality rate of 5% per year.

      Most clinical evidence supports the idea that having normal vitamin D reduces cardiovascular
      risk. The data suggests that normalizing vitamin D levels would have a significant impact on
      public health, reduce costs and help control the incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular
      disease.

      There is also a plausible physiological theory, supported by numerous observational studies,
      that vitamin D supplementation should be effective in improving cardiovascular outcomes, such
      as blood pressure, arterial stiffness, atherosclerosis, endothelial function, and clinical
      events.

      The investigators hypothesize that routine screening for vitamin D deficiency and
      supplementation in case of hypovitaminosis D is effective for improving the maximum walking
      distance after 12 weeks of treatment in stage 2 PAD patients .

      At admission eligible patients are proposed to participate. Written consent is signed after
      complete oral and written explanation of the protocol is signed. Vitamin D level will be
      assessed : Patients without vitamin D deficiency will be excluded.

      The influence of vitamin D supplementation on the evolution of walking distance in 12 weeks
      will be studied by comparing the spontaneous evolution of this walking distance, in not
      supplemented patients (period 1 ), and the evolution under treatment with vitamin D (period
      2, afer 3 months ).

      The spontaneous evolution of the walking distance will be evaluated by the difference in
      walking distance observed between the beginning and the end of the first Period (3 months) .
      The evolution of walking distance under vitamin D treatment will be evaluated by the
      difference in walking distance between between the beginning and the end of the second Period
      (3 months).

      The duration of participation for a subject is equal to 6 months (2 periods of 3 months )
