  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The choice of the size of the laryngeal mask (i-gel) is based on the weight. Even following
      the weight recommendations, it is quite common to choose a mask that is too big or too small,
      which leads to ventilation leaks (too small), or insertion failures (too big) and leads to a
      change of mask for bigger or smaller.

      The i-gel are laryngeal masks (2nd generation) which consist of gel and have been designed by
      molding on larynx corpses. The masks are not inflatable (so not adaptable).

      I-gel masks are used in adult and pediatric patients for weights ranging from 2 Kg to over 90
      Kg to provide ventilation during general anesthesia.

      Patients with a deep voice probably need a larger laryngeal mask than their weight alone
      suggests.

      The investigators propose to measure the lowest sound emitted by the patient because it would
      seem logical that the larger the larynx is, the more the voice is serious.

      This hypothesis will be verified a posteriori by the size of the laryngeal mask used and
      adapted by comparing it to the range of the voice.
