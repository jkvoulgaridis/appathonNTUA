      Preeclampsia (PE) is one of a common type of hypertensive disorder complicating pregnancy
      (HDCP). It is a class of clinical syndromes which shows relevant symptoms, hypertension and
      proteinuria after 20 weeks pregnant as main characteristic, and may accompany with fetal
      anomaly and systemic multi-system organs damage. Several complications, such as eclamptic
      seizures, coma, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), cardiac failure, pneumonedema, hepatic
      failure, kidney failure, placental abruption and disseminated intravascular coagulation
      (DIC), may be threat to the life of the mother as well as fetal. Thus, the disease is one of
      the core issues that cause the maternal and perinatal death. Morbidity of PE is approximately
      3% to 5%. Morbidity has significant differences between different populations. According to
      the data, from 1995 to 2004, HDCP morbidity in four hospitals in Guangzhou was 5.78%, and in
      the HDCP, mild preeclampsia and severe preeclampsia were accounted for 72.22% and 27.78%
      respectively. Meanwhile, HDCP morbidity decreased from 9.4% (1984 to 1989) to 5.57% (1989 to
      1998).

      In 1996, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) gave new
      classification of HDCP based on the characteristic of disease symptoms, divide into five
      groups; gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia, chronic hypertension complicated
      with preeclampsia and chronic hypertension. The pathogenesis of PE remains unclear so far.
      The frequent sight is that PE caused by multiple reactions by a number of factors affect.
      Physiologically, mainly altered of PE is increased blood viscosity and systemic vascular
      spasm which cause hypoxic-ischemic of multiple key organs, such as the placenta, kidney,
      liver and brain. The research theory includes abnormal trophoblast invasion, immune response
      abnormal or increase, genetic susceptibility, coagulation disorders or thrombophilia,
      abnormal angiogenesis, endothelial cell damage, abnormal levels of carbonic oxide, increase
      of oxygen radical, abnormal metabolism of calcium ion, heterotrophia and so on. However,
      there are numbers of epidemiologic study have analyzed high risk factor of PE which provides
      significant medical evidence of prevention, early diagnosis and early treatment for PE, there
      is only little study focus on susceptibility gene and pathogenic genetic variation. Nowadays,
      there are numerous clinical phenotype are considered to exist, different phenotype gives
      different inheritance and epigenetics. Thus, the investigator's group will examine the onset
      of type and characteristics of PE by a retrospective cohort study to discuss if
      susceptibility gene and pathogenic genetic variation were existing in PE patients, also to
      find the relativity between clinical phenotype and genotype. Moreover, this study is trying
      to reach the effect of PE on the patients' health as well as their children. Thus, can
      predict the health status of PE patients and their children, and so can prevent (avoid or
      delay) of the patients from late complications and disease in their children.

      1. All female staff that works, examination and delivery in the Third Affiliated Hospital
           of Guangzhou Medical University from Dec 1995 to Dec 2016 should be in the cohort.
           Collect all information; include clinical examination and medical examination, science
           the subject work in the hospital. Collect the perinatal data; include obstetric
           information, past medical history, family history and so on. Build the database and
           analyze the relative factor.

        2. From all subjects, choose subjects that have got PE before as the experimental group.
           Pair the same age, gestational weeks, children's gender and healthy subject as a control
           group in the ratio of 1:1. The control group should exclude subject that have ever got
           heart or lung diseases, diabetes, chronic nephrosis, immune disease and other hereditary
           disease. Store the blood samples (serum, blood and plasma) of both the experimental
           group and control group and their children. Compare the differences of functional
           parameter between two groups both before and after delivery, which include blood
           pressure, blood glucose and blood lipids. Moreover, compare the function of heart, liver
           and kidney and genetic material (DNA and RNA).

        3. Diagnostic standard of PE refer to People's Medical Publishing House &lt;Obstetrics and
           Gynecology&gt; 8th edition. Confirm the diagnostic standard of HDCP and relative disease
           include PE will make sure the veracity and uniformity of diagnosis.
