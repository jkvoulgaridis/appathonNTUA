    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects of avelumab and how well it works in combination
      with fluorouracil and mitomycin or cisplatin and radiation therapy in treating participants
      with muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as avelumab, may interfere
      with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      fluorouracil, mitomycin, and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy beams to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors.
      Giving avelumab with chemotherapy and radiotherapy may work better in treating participants
      with muscle-invasive bladder cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the complete response rate of concurrent chemotherapy radiation treatment
      combined with avelumab for patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity (adverse event profile) of concurrent chemotherapy
      radiation treatment combined with avelumab.

      II. To evaluate quality of life (QoL) at 1 year of concurrent chemotherapy radiation
      treatment combined with avelumab.

      III. To evaluate progression-free survival and relapse-free survival at 1 year with
      concurrent chemotherapy radiation treatment combined with avelumab.

      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore biomarkers that may predict response to avelumab in the muscle invasive
      population.

      II. To evaluate the association of tumor mutational burden with response to concurrent chemo-
      radiation and immunotherapy.

      III. To evaluate whether concurrent chemoradiation and immunotherapy after maximal
      transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) is associated with a decrease in circulating
      Bim+CD11a^high PD-1+CD8+ T-cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs).

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive avelumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes every 14 days for a total of
      10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 29 days
      after the first dose of avelumab, participants receive either fluorouracil IV on days 1-5 and
      16-20 during radiation therapy (RT) and mitomycin IV on day 1 of course 3, or cisplatin IV
      starting on day 1 of courses 3-5 for up to 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days, 6, 9, and 12
      months.

    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item patient-reported questionnaire. 28 of the 30 items are measured on a 1-4 scale (1=not at all; 4=very much) with the remaining two items (overall health and overall quality of life) scored on a 1-7 numeric analogue scale (1=very poor; 7=excellent). The recall period for the EORTC QLQ-C30 is one week.
Changes from baseline will be statistically tested using paired t-tests, and standardized response means (mean of the change from baseline scores at a given cycle, divided by the standard deviation of the change scores) will be interpreted (after applying Middel's (2002) adjustment) using Cohen's (1988) cut-offs: &lt;0.20 = trivial; 0.20-&lt;0.50 = small; 0.50-&lt;0.80 = moderate; and &gt;=/0.80 = large.
