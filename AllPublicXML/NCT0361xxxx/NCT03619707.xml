  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In IVF/ICSI cycles, the progesterone levels induced by ovarian stimulation are low, therefore
      the luteal phase is supported by progesterone. The use of progestogens in IVF is associated
      with an improvement in the live birth rate Standard protocol for luteal phase support has not
      yet been established. Currently vaginal progesterone is widely used, since the classic oral
      progesterone seems to result in a low bioavailability and a lower pregnancy rate. However,
      vaginal administration of progesterone is associated with vaginal irritation, discharge and
      bleeding. For all these reasons, there is a need for an effective, well tolerated, and safe
      treatment that can improve patient satisfaction and compliance.

      Many studies have observed similar pregnancy rate results with dydrogesterone and micronized
      vaginal progesterone. A new RCT including a total of 1143 patients by Tournaye, showed that
      dydrogesterone treatment had a similar safety profile to micronized vaginal progesterone
      (MVP) for luteal support as part of ART treatment. The crude pregnancy rates at 12 weeks were
      37.6% and 33.1% in the dydrogesterone and MVP treatment groups respectively.

      Regarding the administration route of progesterone, intramuscular and transvaginal routes are
      the two conventional progesterone administration techniques. However, very few studies have
      compared the advantages of oral dydrogestrone with vaginal progesterone for luteal support in
      ART cycles.

      The objective of the investigator's study is to demonstrate the superiority of oral
      dydrogesterone (Duphaston) 10 over MVP (Utrogestan) used for luteal supplementation in
      cryo-warmed embryo transfer cycles. Upon consent, 224 patients women will be randomly
      allocated into either one of the study groups using a simple randomization method by
      computer-generated random numbers. Group I will receive the oral dydrogesterone, while group
      II will receive the vaginal microprogesterone.
