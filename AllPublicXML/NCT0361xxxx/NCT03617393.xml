  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Focusing on patients with diabetes complicated with pulmonary infection, the purpose of this
      study is: 1) to identify the epidemiology, etiologic spectrum and status of diagnosis and
      treatment; 2) to develop a symptom score scale , clarify the risk factors and create a
      precise warning model; 3) to develop a rapid detection of pathogen of lower respiratory
      infection, to establish clinical pathways of early diagnosis and treatment of diabetes
      complicated with pulmonary infections (including bacterial, tuberculosis and fungal
      infections) and then make an application in clinic.

      Investigators perform a observational study on 6000 patients with diabetes, among which 200
      patients with pulmonary infection are included in a retrospective study and 100 patients go
      through metabolomics research. All patients receive clinical questionnaires, laboratory
      examinations and pulmonary function tests. Investigators study on pathogen distribution and
      infection ratio of patients above depending on follow-up survey. 1:1 nested case-control
      study is carried out involving 100 cases from pulmonary-infected group paired with 100
      control cases matched for gender, age and fasting blood-glucose. The final purpose is to
      create a precise warning model in order to develop a rapid detection of pathogen of lower
      respiratory infection in diabetes patients. Now investigators wish to register this study to
      do a further research, in order to improve the early diagnosis of diabetes complicated with
      pulmonary infection and to reduce the mortality.
