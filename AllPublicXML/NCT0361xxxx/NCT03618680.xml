  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study is to primarily investigate fatigue and sleep and to secondarily
      examine possible relationships between disease activity, pain and functional ability in
      Turkish children and adolescents with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with JIA become fatigued easily, experience joint inflammation, pain, limited
      mobility and report poor sleep quality and daytime sleepiness . It is reported in the
      literature that children with JIA suffer from poor sleep, parasomnias, daytime sleepiness,
      sleep fragmentation, cyclic alternating patterns increase, and sleep-disordered breathing
      compared to healthy children. Sleep was disturbed in almost half of the patients with both
      JIA and juvenile dermatomyositis, and that sleep disturbance and fatigue were both correlated
      with disease activity. Increased pain is associated with more sleep disturbance and more
      fatigue, and these appear to negatively influence quality of life.

      So, in this study, fatigue and sleep in Turkish patients with JIA will be investigated by
      using specific surveys and also secondarily it will be examined possible relationships
      between disease activity, pain and functional ability in children and adolescents with JIA.

    <measure>Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory-Multidimensional Fatigue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory-Multidimensional Fatigue Scale&quot; (PedsQL-F) is a valid and reliable tool, and can be used to measure symptom-specific fatigue among patients with JIA . Fatigue symptoms will be assessed by the PedsQL-F which is an 18-item questionnaire and is designed to measure child and parent's perception of fatigue in pediatric patients and comprises the general fatigue scale (6 items), sleep/rest fatigue scale (6 items) and cognitive fatigue scale (6 items). Higher scores indicate higher quality of life.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep quality will be evaluated with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). PSQI is a 23 item questionnaire that generates scales reflecting daytime dysfunction, sleep latency, disturbance, duration, quality and efficiency. As the score increases, sleep quality decreases and daytime dysfunction due to sleep quality disorder increases. PSQI is composed of three main scores: total PSQI score, PSQI sub-scores and sleep quality status score. Each component is scored from 0 to 3, leading to a global PSQI score between 0 and 21, with higher scores indicating lower quality of sleep.</description>

    <measure>Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Functional ability will be assessed using The Turkish version of the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ). CIn 8 activities (dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities), a number of questions were answered and scored on a scale of 0 - 3, where 0 = able to do with no difficulty, 1 = able to do with some difficulty, 2 = able to do with much difficulty, and 3 = unable to do. The mean of the 8 scores identified the CHAQ score (range, 0 - 3).</description>

        All patients attending the outpatient clinic of the Department of Pediatric Rheumatology,
        Medical Faculty of Cerrahpasa, Istanbul University, were recruited between February 2015
        and December 2015 to participate in this study. All participants signed informed consent
        forms. The participants were volunteers who were examined by the pediatric rheumatologist
        who participated in the present study.
