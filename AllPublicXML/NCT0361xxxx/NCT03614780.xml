  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research was designed with partners to determine differences in temperature exposures in
      urban and rural communities in Alabama. The investigators hypothesized that significant
      differences in temperature exposure exist between urban and rural settings. Time spent
      outdoors has been previously positively associated with greater physical activity. Built
      environment components in urban versus rural environments and ambient temperatures
      experienced during the summer may pose barriers to time spent outdoors. Persons with Type II
      Diabetes Mellitus may find it more difficult to overcome temperature barriers due to reduced
      thermoregulation capacity. This analysis will result in a more precise picture of temperature
      exposure as well as behavioral factors that may mediate exposure.

      The investigators gathered individual-level temperature exposure data by asking 180 female
      participants to wear a small thermometer on their shoe for 7 days. Ninety participants were
      recruited from Birmingham AL (urban) and 90 from rural West Central Alabama. The first two
      days participants were asked to go about their normal daily activities. During the next 5
      days of participation, participants were asked to add an additional 30 minutes of time spent
      outdoors. As a secondary outcome, steps were measured via pedometers worn by participants. A
      subgroup of participants with self-reported doctor diagnosed Type II Diabetes also recorded
      their fasting glucose each morning of participation.
