      This study will evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a single dose of
      the live attenuated Zika vaccine rZIKV/D4Δ30-713 in adults with no history of previous
      flavivirus infection.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive a single dose of either rZIKV/D4Δ30-713 or
      placebo at study entry (Day 0).

      Study visits will occur on Days 0, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 21, 28, 56, 90, 150, and 180.
      Visits may include a physical examination; blood, urine, saliva, vaginal secretions, and
      semen collection; and pregnancy testing.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult male or female between 18 and 50 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Good general health as determined by physical examination, laboratory screening, and
             review of medical history.

          -  Available for the duration of the study, which is approximately 26 weeks.

          -  Willingness to participate in the study as evidenced by signing the informed consent
             document.

          -  Females only: Female subjects of childbearing potential, with the exception noted
             below, should be willing to use effective contraception and have no plans to undergo
             IVF (in vitro fertilization) during participation in the trial. Reliable methods of
             contraception include hormonal birth control, condoms with spermicide, diaphragm with
             spermicide, surgical sterilization, and intrauterine device. All female subjects will
             be considered as having childbearing potential, except for those who have had a
             hysterectomy, tubal ligation, or tubal coil (at least 3 months prior to vaccination),
             or are considered to be post-menopausal, as documented by at least 1 year since last
             menstrual period with a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the menopausal
             range or at least 24 consecutive months of amenorrhea. Transgender men who have
             internal female organs will be considered of childbearing potential and should be
             willing to use effective contraception during the trial. Exception: Females who have
             sex with females (exclusively) and have no intention of conceiving a child during the
             study will not be required to use contraception.

          -  Males only: Males of reproductive potential should be willing to use barrier
             contraception for the duration of the study and agree to not donate sperm for the
             duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females only: Currently pregnant, as determined by positive β-human choriogonadotropin
             (HCG) test, or breast-feeding.

          -  Evidence of clinically significant neurologic, cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic,
             rheumatologic, autoimmune, or renal disease based on history, physical examination,
             and/or laboratory studies.

          -  Behavioral, cognitive, or psychiatric disease that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, affects the subject's ability to understand and cooperate with the
             requirements of the study protocol.

          -  Screening laboratory values of Grade 1 or above for absolute neutrophil count (ANC),
             alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and serum creatinine, as defined in this protocol.

          -  Any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would jeopardize the
             safety or rights of a subject participating in the trial, or would render the subject
             unable to comply with the protocol.

          -  Any significant alcohol or drug abuse in the past 12 months that has caused medical,
             occupational, or family problems, as indicated by subject history.

          -  History of a severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis.

          -  Severe asthma (emergency room visit or hospitalization within the last 6 months).

          -  HIV infection, as indicated by screening and confirmatory assays.

          -  Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, as indicated by screening and confirmatory assays.

          -  Any known immunodeficiency syndrome.

          -  Current use of anticoagulant medications (this does not include anti-platelet
             medication such as aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications).

          -  Use of immunosuppressive corticosteroids (excluding topical or nasal) or
             immunosuppressive drugs within 28 days prior to or following inoculation. An
             immunosuppressive dose of corticosteroids is defined as greater than or equal to 10 mg
             of a prednisone equivalent per day for greater than or equal to 14 days.

          -  Receipt of a live vaccine within 28 days or a killed vaccine within 14 days prior to
             inoculation, or anticipated receipt of any vaccine during the 28 days following
             inoculation.
