  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the safety and initial effectiveness of the TIVUS™
      System when used for pulmonary artery denervation in group II PH patients through change in
      clinical parameters including hemodynamics, exercise tolerance, and quality of life.

      This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, open-label clinical trail. The study
      will be conducted in up to 3 centers and will recruit up to 15 patients diagnosed with
      pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease that demonstrate combined pre and post
      capillary involvement with PVR&gt;3 wood units.
