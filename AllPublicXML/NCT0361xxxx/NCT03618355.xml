  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and immunologic
      impact of encapsulated rapamycin in patients with low risk prostate cancer under active
      surveillance. There will be four groups of patients, each receiving a different dose of
      rapamycin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib trial of encapsulated rapamycin to determine safety,
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and immunologic impact in patients with low risk prostate
      cancer under active surveillance. This new formulation, encapsulated rapamycin (sirolimus),
      provides a more predictable bioavailability of this drug than [the other formulation]. The
      encapsulated and targeted rapamycin (eRapa) can be delivered at a consistent and lower
      dosage, not only improving the toxicity profile but also capitalizing on the newly
      appreciated mechanism of partial and/or intermittent mTOR inhibition, making eRapa an ideal
      immuno-oncologic and chemopreventative agent. Low dose rapamycin has been shown to prevent
      cancer formation, progression, and/or recurrence in the majority of cancer histologies
      including the most prevalent: lung, breast, prostate, and colon cancers.

    <intervention_model_description>Oral administration with consecutive enrollment of overlapping dose-escalation cohorts, total treatment period 3 months. Patients will conclude treatment with previously scheduled standard of care prostate biopsy. With a single site screening patients into the cohorts at a rate of 3 patients every 6 weeks (4 weeks dosing and 2 weeks safety assessment), a new cohort will start approximately every 6 weeks. Therefore, if each cohort of 3 patients are pre-screened and there are no dose limiting toxicities (DLT), the 4th and final dose cohort will be enrolled at approximately 18 weeks. Each patient will be on study for 6 months; therefore, 10-11 months will be the shortest time for trial completion. Given unforeseen delays, we anticipate the trial to take approximately one year to complete.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The eRapa (encapsulated rapamycin) drug product consists of sub-micron rapamycin particles incorporated into poly(methyl methacrylate) polymer (Eudragit® L 100 / S 100).
This improved formulation and better bioavailability enables eRapa to consistently provide approximately 30% more drug than sirolimus (unpublished data). Improved and predictable delivery allows for consistent and sustained lower dosing, which will result in an improved toxicity profile since the latter is proven to be related to blood concentration levels. This is a phase Ib trial in low risk (Gleason score ≤7 (3+4)) prostate cancer patients under active surveillance to establish dosage safety and treatment levels.</description>
