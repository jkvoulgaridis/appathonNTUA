    <textblock>
      According to World Health Organization data, approximately 10% of all unintentional injury
      deaths are due to fire-related burns. In Malaysia, burn represent about 5.6% (745 cases) of
      all injuries among children. As childhood burn was not considered as a child health problem
      comparing to other childhood illnesses, parents and children tends to have less priority in
      overcome this issue. This highlights the need to transfer the knowledge especially to the
      children on the burn prevention. By implementing this module on preventing fire, burns and
      scalds injury among children, knowledge on main causes of burns and their immediate
      management can be improved at young age.
