      The aim of this study is to compare the effect of mesial and distal adjacent gingival
      biotypes of the tooth / teeth region of free gingival graft (FGG) on the shrinkage ratio of
      graft at 6 months postoperatively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The concept of gingival and periodontal phenotype was established as a result of clinical
      observation of changes in facial keratinized tissue width and thickness .It has been reported
      that gingival or periodontal diseases may develop more frequently in patients with thin
      gingival biotypes and that thick-flat biotype in implant restorations is important in
      achieving a successful aesthetic treatment outcome.

      Free gingival graft (FGG) is a mucogingival surgical procedure that is successfully used in
      the presence of inadequate keratinized gingival width and gingival recession. It is thought
      that factors that may adversely affect the continuity of graft nutrition may be effective in
      graft shrinkage. These reasons can be listed as follows; graft thickness, traumatic surgical
      procedure, graft dehydration, and suturing procedure.

      There was no study investigating the effect of periodontal biotypes on graft contraction in
      the region adjacent to the FGG operation.

    <description>Thin Biotype group has described as Group 1. The biotypes of the terminal teeth adjacent to the free gingival graft region were determined by the &quot;Probe transparency method&quot;.
The mesial terminal tooth (MTT) was defined as the first tooth adjacent to the mesial side of the tooth / teeth to which the FGG will be applied. The distal terminal tooth (DTT) was defined as the first tooth adjacent to the distal side of the tooth / teeth to which the FGG will be applied. If MTT and DTT had thin biotype, the patient was assigned to the thin biotype group.</description>

    <intervention_name>free gingival graft</intervention_name>
    <description>A horizontal incision was made along the mucogingival line with a scalpel number 15 to prepare a bed of periosteum and a thin immobilized connective tissue. The moving gingival tissues were removed coronally, and the bed was prepared so that the immobilized keratinized gingival tissue was preserved and the graft was placed apically. The template of the recipient region was placed in the donor region to be 2-3 mm more apically than the gingival margins of the teeth. The number of 15 scalpel was used to make incision at the template border and perpendicular to the keratinized tissue. The graft thickness was standardized in all patients between 1.5-2 mm. FGG was placed over the recipient bed and 5/0 non-resorbable monofilament sutures were used for fixing the four corners of the graft.</description>
