  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reliable prediction of the preoperative risk is of crucial importance for patients undergoing
      vascular operations. The assessment of the metabolic equivalent of task (MET) is an easy
      clinical evaluation of the functional capacity of an individual. A MET is defined as the
      resting metabolic rate, that is the amount of the consumed oxygen at rest. According to the
      MET concept a patient would be considered as &quot;fit for surgery&quot; when the stairs of two flights
      can be climbed and the housework can be fully managed by oneself.

      Hypothesis: Patients with a functional capacity over 4 MET (fit for surgery) have less
      perioperative complications with the focus on cardiac pathology than patients with less than
      4 MET during aortic operations.

      Patients and Method: Retrospective analysis of a single center unit of 296 patients
      undergoing open or endovascular aortic repair.
