  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease is a life-threatening genetic disorder that can be effectively treated
      following early diagnosis via newborn screening. However, sickle cell disease is most
      prevalent in low-resource regions of the world, where newborn screening is rare due to the
      cost and logistical burden of laboratory-based methods. In many such regions, &gt;80% of
      affected children die, undiagnosed, before the age of five years. A convenient and
      inexpensive point-of-care test for sickle cell disease is thus crucially needed. In this
      study we will conduct a blinded, multicenter, prospective diagnostic accuracy study of
      HemoTypeSC(TM), an inexpensive 15-minute point-of-care immunoassay for detecting sickle cell
      disease, hemoglobin C disease, and trait phenotypes in newborns, children, and adults.
