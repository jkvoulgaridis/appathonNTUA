  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver cancer is the fifth most common cancer and the second most frequent cause of
      cancer-related death globally. Hepatocellular carcinoma represents about 90% of primary liver
      cancers and constitutes a major global health problem. The pattern of HCC occurrence shows a
      significant geographical imbalance, with the highest incidence rates in East Asia (more than
      50% of the cases occurring in China).

      The aim of this study is to investigate the overall survival (OS) of patients diagnosed with
      unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma under real-world practice conditions in Asia Pacific
      region.
