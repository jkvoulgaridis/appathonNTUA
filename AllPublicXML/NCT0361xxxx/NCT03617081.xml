  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess how safe the study drug is and how well a participant
      tolerates it after a single oral (taken by mouth) dose. The study also aims to measure the
      concentration of the study drug and its breakdown products after a single dose. Participants
      will either get NNC0113-2023 (a new medicine) or placebo (a &quot;dummy medicine similar to the
      study medicine but without active ingredients) - which treatment any participant gets is
      decided by chance. Participants will get one dose (can be one or two tablets) of study
      medicine. The study will last for about 65 days. Participants will have 10 scheduled site
      visits with the study physician or study staff at the study centre. For one of the visits,
      participants will stay at the research unit for 5 days. At all visits, except the first
      information visit, participants will have blood drawn along with other clinical assessments.
      Participants cannot take part in this study if participants have any disorder that the doctor
      thinks is a health problem. Only healthy men are allowed to take part.
