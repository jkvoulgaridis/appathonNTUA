  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Nowadays an increase in the incidence of teeth affected by molar incisor
      hypomineralisation (MIH) has been observed. There are several treatment modalities that
      depend on the degree of severity of the defect, such as preventive procedures, restorative
      and even dental extractions. However, these changes may affect the retention and longevity of
      restorative materials. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the use of diode laser
      irradiation for the treatment of occlusal surfaces of moderate lesions in permanent first
      molars affected with MIH as a preventive method for dental caries and occlusal wear, besides
      verifying the discomfort of the treatment by patients. Methods: For this, a controlled and
      randomized study, with parallel groups, will be conducted comparing the treatment with diode
      laser and sealing with high viscosity glass ionomer cement in the teeth affected by the MIH.
      Participants will be assessed at baseline and after 1 week, 1, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. As
      the main outcome, the presence of dentin caries lesion and /or occlusal surface wear included
      in the study with dentin involvement will be evaluated. A visual examination for caries
      detection will be done using the ICDAS, using the index based on classification in the United
      States Public Health Service - Modified (USPH) for evaluation of sealed teeth and impression
      of impacted teeth for quantitative analysis of the lesions. Other outcomes such as patient
      satisfaction with treatment, patient discomfort, impact on quality of life and participant
      perception, as well as the duration and cost of treatment, as well as their cost-efficacy,
      will also be evaluated. Multilevel statistical analyzes will be performed to verify the
      efficacy of Diode laser treatment compared to sealing, in addition to possible factors
      associated with this efficacy.

    <intervention_model_description>Diode laser group Prophylaxis of the selected region for the study and application of diode laser (Sirolaser, Sirona Dental Systems GmbH, Bensheim, Germany) with wavelength of 970 nm +/- 10 nm, maximum power of 7 W CW, 1mW guide beam and 320Î¼m optical fiber. Irradiation will be performed on the entire occlusal surface in contact mode, with power of 0.7 W and frequency of 10 Hz for 30 seconds, having an energy density of 222.82 J / cm2.
Glass Ionomer Sealing Group Prophylaxis of the selected region for the study, followed by relative insulation with cotton rollers of the tooth in question, application of acid polyacrylic for 15 seconds throughout the surface, light drying with cotton ball, insertion of the high viscosity glass ionomer (Equia Forte in capsule - GC) through a specific applicator, after loss of the gloss of the digital pressure material with Vaseline for due drainage and surface protection of the material.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>All surfaces will be examined after previous cleaning with prophylactic paste and water and a Robson brush, with lighting and after air drying and 1, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after</time_frame>
    <description>The main outcome will be the presence of changes in clinical signs in relation to the progression of carious lesions and / or occlusal surface wear included in the study with dentin involvement through ICDAS, photographs, radiographic examination and the index based on the classification in the United States Public Health Service - Modified (USPH).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction in relation the treatment using VAS scale</measure>
    <time_frame>This evaluation will be applied after 1 week of treatment, 1, 12 and 24 months and will not be identified by name and will be done in the absence of the operators so as not to restrain the subject from expressing their actual opinion.</time_frame>
    <description>The responsibles will be asked to respond about the satisfaction regarding the care (treatment and follow-up) received by their children. He should classify his satisfaction using the VAS scale with indexes from 0 to 10, with 0 being the worst evaluation of treatment and 10 being the best.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported discomfort using Wong Backer face scale after the treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>This evaluation will be performed before starting the treatment with laser or with high viscosity glass ionomer and 2 minutes after the treatment is performed]</time_frame>
    <description>In order to assess the discomfort reported by the children in relation to the type of treatment received, the same timekeeping operator will apply the Wong-Baker Facial Scale to the patient, which is composed of six figures with equidistant faces that the first one is very smiling and the expressions are changing, until the last one is very sad. The face 1 mean &quot;no hurts&quot;, face 2 &quot;hurts little bit&quot;, face 3 &quot;hurts little more&quot;, face 4 &quot;hurts even more&quot;, face 5 &quot;hurts whole lot&quot;, face 6 &quot;hurts worst&quot;. The child chooses the face that judges more similar to his own after the treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>This evaluation will be performed before treatment, 1 week, 1, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>The patients will answer to a VAS scale with indexes from 0 to 10 (no pain - 0 and worst pain - 10) for each teeth.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of patient's perception of satisfaction regarding their oral health</measure>
    <time_frame>For this, an external examiner will apply the questionnaire prior to randomization and on 1, 12 and 24 month return visits.</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluation of the patient's perception of satisfaction regarding his / her oral health will be performed through the questionnaire of quality of life, Child Perceptions Questionnaire 8-10 (CPQ8-10), specially developed for children aged 8-10 years old.
The questionnaire consists of 10 questions. Each question is composed of 5 answers: a) Never, b) Once or twice, c) Sometimes, d) Often, e) Every day or almost every day. These issues include generic and specific aspects of oral diseases. For example: &quot;In the last month, how many times have you had toothache or mouth pain?&quot; or &quot;In the last month, how many times have you felt sad because of your teeth or your mouth?&quot;</description>

    <description>To calculate the direct costs of the procedures, the time spent in each consultation (initials and reevaluations) will be taken into account. For the calculation of direct costs, the prices of consumer and permanent materials (specifications and quantity) used in each procedure, electricity and the professional fee will be considered.</description>
