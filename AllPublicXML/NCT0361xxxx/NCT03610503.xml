  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients often report anxiety and pain related to electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction
      studies (NCS) which are tests used to look for diseases of the nerves and muscles.
      Unfortunately, for those with very high levels of test related stress, the experience may be
      very frightening and may impede completion of the study and negatively impact on making a
      timely and accurate diagnosis. Several studies have shown that music can improve anxiety and
      pain levels in various situations and procedures. Our study will allow participants to play
      music of their choice during EMG and NCS in order to determine if the pain and anxiety that
      they experience is reduced.

      This study will be a prospective randomized trial carried out at Mount Hope Centre for Long
      Term Care in London, Ontario. All patients referred for electromyography and a nerve
      conduction study will be considered for inclusion in the study. Those who meet the criteria
      and verbally consent to the study will sign a consent form and then be randomly assigned to
      either a music or no-music group using a computer-generated random number series. Prior to
      starting the test, all participants who enroll in the study will complete form Y-1 and Y-2 of
      the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) which measure state (S) anxiety and trait (T)
      anxiety respectively. They will also complete an 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain
      and anxiety prior to beginning the studies. During and following the test they will be asked
      to complete a VAS for pain and anxiety, and the Y-1 of the STAI to measure state anxiety.
      Aside from having to fill out the STAI and visual analogue scales, patients assigned to the
      no-music group will undergo the EMG and NCS as per usual. Those in the music group will be
      given a set of over-ear headphones (sterilized before use) and a tablet device. Participants
      will be allowed to navigate Spotify, a digital music service to select whatever music they
      desire. An app that limits volume will be used to ensure that volume cannot be raised above
      80 decibels by the patient. Communication with the patient will not be hindered as the EMG
      technician and physician will be speaking into a microphone that transmits the sound directly
      to the participant's headphones.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients 18 years of age or older referred for NCS and EMG at Mount Hope Centre for
             Long Term Care in London, Ontario will be eligible and offered entry into the study if
             the following criteria are met: the NCS/EMG are indicated, they have at least a 6th
             grade reading level in English such that they can complete the STAI, and the patient
             is willing and able to provide signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of hearing aids that would preclude or hinder the use of over-ear headphones.

          2. Profound hearing loss.
