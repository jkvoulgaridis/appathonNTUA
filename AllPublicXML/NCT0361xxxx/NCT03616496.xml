  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although being classified as a rare disease, cardiac amyloidosis constitutes an increasing
      cause of heart failure, which is often overlooked and thus poorly managed. Amyloidosis
      involves deposits of light chain immunoglobulins in the immunoglobulin light chain
      amyloidosis (AL) type, but it may also be of a hereditary type in mutated transthyretin
      amyloidosis (ATTRm) or of a senile type in wildtype transthyretin forms (ATTRwt).

      Myocardial biopsy remains a gold standard for definitive diagnosis but it is a traumatic
      technique which only provides information on a limited number of sampled sites.

      Useful but not fully specific signs of cardiac amyloidosis may also be provided by Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging or MRI (delayed retention imaging) and echocardiography (longitudinal
      strain pattern).

      Notwithstanding the above, relatively specific markers of amyloid plaques are now available
      in Positron Emission Tomography (PET). These markers are primarily fluorinated tracers which
      have been developed for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Two of these have already been
      the subject of feasibility studies in the setting of cardiac amyloidosis diagnosis, on a
      maximum of 10 amyloidosis patients but with very favorable results.

      The hypothesis is that one of these two tracers, Florbetaben labelled with
      Fluorine-18-Florbetaben (18F-Florbetaben) used in the study, has sufficiently strong and
      prolonged binding kinetics at the level of the amyloid plaques to allow: (i) achieving
      whole-body PET recordings and thus, (ii) identifying not only cardiac amyloidosis but also
      extracardiac binding sites, particularly those readily accessible to biopsy sampling. This
      hypothesis has been strengthened by a recent case report illustrating the ability of
      whole-body florbetaben-PET to image not only cardiac but also extra-cardiac sites of amyloid
      deposits (Clin Nucl Med. 2017;42(1):50-3).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In addition, distinctive imaging patterns pointing to amyloidosis may also be documented by
      other imaging techniques although insufficiently specific (e.g. decreased cardiac uptake of
      metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), evocative pattern of delayed retention at Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (MRI) or at strain echocardiography. Specific markers of amyloid plaques have been
      developed for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and were initially labeled with carbon-11
      and more recently, with fluor-18. Most of these markers have already been the subject of
      feasibility studies on limited numbers of amyloidosis patients (max 10) but with favorable
      results. In a previous pilot study, one of these tracers, the 18F-Florbetaben used in the
      present study-protocol, exhibited particularly slow kinetics, with differences in cardiac
      uptake between patients and controls still being documented as late as 80-min following
      injection. This uptake was also found to be somewhat lower in the 5 ATTR patients
      comparatively to the 5 AL patients (Low WP and al, J Nucl Med 2016).

      It may be hypothesized that 18F-Florbetaben has sufficiently slow and prolonged binding
      kinetics at the level of the amyloid plaques to allow: (i) achieving whole-body PET
      recordings with current recording times of 20 to 30 min and thus, (ii) identifying not only
      cardiac amyloidosis but also extracardiac binding sites, particularly those readily
      accessible to biopsy sampling. This hypothesis has just been strengthened by a recent case
      report, published by investigators involved in the present project and illustrating the
      ability of whole-body 18F-Florbetaben-PET to image not only cardiac but also various
      extracardiac sites of amyloid deposits (D'Estanque E. and al, Clin Nucl Med 2017).

      The proposed study would be the first in which the sample size would be sufficient to provide
      a credible assessment of the ability of PET, using an amyloid plaque tracer, to identify
      cardiac amyloidosis and with a possible separate analysis of ATTR and AL forms. Moreover, it
      would also constitute the first study involving an extensive use of whole-body PET imaging to
      assess the benefit of amyloidosis detection, not only at the cardiac level, but also at
      peripheral sites, especially those accessible for biopsy (tongue, rectum, salivary glands,
      carpal tunnel, liver, subcutaneous tissue, thyroid,...).

      Being able to confirm or invalidate the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis in a non-invasive
      manner and by guiding biopsy sampling to the most active extracardiac sites would be a major
      step forward for these patients whose diagnosis is most often established too late, i.e. at
      an advanced stage of heart failure.

      In the longer term,18F-Florbetaben whole-body PET could be helpful for the non-invasive
      monitoring of the evolution of cardiac as well as extracardiac sites of amyloid deposits
      under dedicated specific treatments (chemotherapies in AL forms and specific treatments
      currently under investigation for the AL forms). Such monitoring is still impossible today.
