  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is characterized by allergy-driven inflammation of the
      esophagus leading to a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms and increased healthcare
      utilization. While considered a rare disease, EoE is rapidly increasing in prevalence in the
      United States. Treatment options are limited and include dietary modifications with the
      elimination of suspected food triggers or pharmacological options including proton pump
      inhibitors (PPIs) and swallowed corticosteroids. Compliance to strict elimination diets is
      difficult thus many patients elect to use swallowed corticosteroids. Because nearly half of
      all EoE patients are treated with swallowed corticosteroids there is a growing concern
      regarding the long-term effects of this class of medication.4

      It is known that oral corticosteroids can compromise bone mineral density and growth
      velocity5-7. Furthermore, there have been multiple studies exploring the relationship between
      inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and endocrine effects in asthmatics. While the risk of ICS use
      is less compared to systemic corticosteroids, higher ICS doses do cause deleterious effects
      on growth and bone health8-11. Currently, there are no published studies examining the effect
      of swallowed corticosteroids on bone mineral density or growth velocity in patients with EoE.
      Given the route of administration, there may be more systemic absorption leading to a higher
      risk of long-term complications.

      The proposed work will address the following specific aims:

      Specific Aim 1: Assess effects of swallowed corticosteroids on bone mineral density (primary
      outcome) in children 5-12 years of age with EoE compared to age matched controls.

      Specific Aim 2: Evaluation of the effect of swallowed corticosteroids on growth velocity.

        We will recruit 30 children, ages 5-12 years, with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and 30
        age and sex-matched controls from the Arkansas Children's Hospital allergy clinic to
        participate in this prospective study. Controls will be age- and gender-matched in a 1:1
        ratio with EoE subjects but will not be required to have a diagnosis of EoE. Control
        subjects will not be treated with swallowed corticosteroids.

               1. Age 5-12 years

               2. Diagnosis of EoE based upon a peak eosinophil count of â‰¥ 15 eosinophils/high
