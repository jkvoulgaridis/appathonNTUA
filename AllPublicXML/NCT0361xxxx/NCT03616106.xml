      To complete the study aims, a mixed methods study that includes a single group
      pretest-posttest study design will be used to pilot test the infographic intervention.
      In-depth interviews will be completed with a selection of participants to explore participant
      perceptions of HIV-related communication using infographics. Data will be collected from
      participants through baseline (at enrollment) and follow up assessments (at 3-, 6-, and
      9-month follow up visits). Follow up interviews will be conducted with the providers involved
      in the intervention to ascertain their perspectives on the clinical utility of infographics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Caribbean has among the highest HIV prevalence in the world. Regionally, the majority of
      HIV/AIDS cases are located on the island of Hispaniola, comprised of the Dominican Republic
      (DR) and Haiti. Due to a large international response and widespread availability of
      antiretroviral therapy (ART), in recent years the incidence of HIV in the DR has declined and
      prevalence hovers around 1% in the general population. The effective and long-term management
      of this condition depends on infected individuals being able to acquire ART and apply the
      learned information and self-management skills that lead to optimal adherence.

      HIV-related disparities exist in developing countries, such as the DR, where minority groups
      and/or those with low socioeconomic status experience higher disease burdens and worse health
      outcomes than those with higher socioeconomic status. These disparities may be exacerbated
      when individuals are unable to understand the health information, as low health literacy has
      been associated with worse health outcomes, less use of healthcare services, poorer knowledge
      of illness, and worse self-management. The effective management of HIV requires patients to
      acquire, comprehend, and use large amounts of complex information, including how to manage
      variations in health status, medications and their side effects, nutrition and exercise
      needs, and healthy coping. Health care providers can help patients understand pertinent
      health information by offering it in targeted, culturally-, language-, and
      literacy-appropriate ways.

      One such strategy is to use infographics to assist communication through visual
      representations of information. Participatory design of infographics supports presentation of
      information in a culturally appropriate and visually appealing format which can improve
      information understanding, health behaviors, attention span, and ability to recall
      information. It is critical to develop and test methods to improve the way health information
      is delivered to patients in these clinical contexts so patients, including those with low
      health literacy, can acquire and comprehend the information needed to improve self-management
      behavior and treatment outcomes.

      Preliminary studies showed many persons living with HIV (PLWH) attending Cl√≠nica de Familia
      La Romana do not fully comprehend and use the health information they receive through current
      modalities. In response, culturally relevant, evidence-based infographics to improve
      information delivery during clinical visits were developed with a participatory design
      methodology (manuscript under review). The next phase of this study is to rigorously assess
      if using these infographics is a feasible, acceptable, and efficacious method to enhance
      HIV-related clinician-patient communication and lead to improved patient outcomes.
      Additionally, a thorough exploration into the cultural factors of patient-provider
      communication in the Dominican Republic that can influence infographic use for
      clinician-patient communication in a clinical setting is warranted.

    <description>14 questions pertaining to HIV-related knowledge were developed according to the information that will be included in the intervention. Participants will receive one point for each correct answer and then the scores for each question will be summed to obtain a final score. Therefore, the minimum score will be 0 and maximum score will be 14 where the scores closer to 14 indicate patients have more HIV-related knowledge.</description>

    <measure>Engagement with Clinician Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 9 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Engagement with Health Care Providers scale is a 13 item scale through which clients rate how they feel about their interactions with their providers. Answers are recorded on a 4-point scale (1=always true and 4=never true). Lower scores (with 13 being the lowest score) indicate more provider engagement.</description>

    <description>11 questions on patients' satisfaction with health care provider and the health care center adapted from previously validated instruments are included. Each question response has a different scale.

    <description>Self-efficacy to manage chronic disease scale (SEMCD) will be used. This is a 6-item measure where 1 is not at all confident and 10 is completely confident. Final scores are calculated as the mean of the 6 questions, where higher scores indicate higher self-efficacy.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 9 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence will be measured with the validated simplified medication adherence questionnaire (SMAQ)-6 scale, a 6-item questionnaire. A person is considered &quot;non-adherent&quot; if there is a &quot;yes&quot; answer for any of items 1,2,3, and 5. Additionally, if they answer that they have missed more than two doses in the past week (item 4) or if they have gone more than two days without taking their medication in the past 3 months (item 6)</description>

    <measure>Participant's self-reported Health-related Quality of Life Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 9 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life will be measured with the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System¬Æ (PROMIS)-29 measure, which measures 7 domains of physical functioning with 4 questions in each section pertaining to how that participant's health influences their life. In general, each question has five response options ranging in values from 1-5. To find the total raw score for this form with all the questions answered, the values from the responses of each question are summed. Raw scores are then translated into a T-score for each participant, which rescales the raw score into a standardized T-score with a mean of 50 and standard deviation (SD) of 10. Consequently, a person with a T-score of 40 would be one SD below the mean.</description>

    <measure>Health Status Average Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 9 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Health status will be assessed with the Health Status Assessment which includes two quality of life measures. The first, a general health item scored on a five-point scale where 1 is excellent and 5 is poor and the second, a health assessment scale from 0 - 100 where 0=death or worst possible health and 100=perfect or best possible health.</description>
