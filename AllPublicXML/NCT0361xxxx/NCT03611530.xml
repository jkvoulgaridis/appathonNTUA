  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, parallel arm, multicenter, double-blind trial.

      Patients with POAG will be randomized 1:1 ratio to receive:

        -  Prostaglandin analogue (PGA) monotherapy + CoQun® (Arm A)

        -  Prostaglandin analogue (PGA) monotherapy + Vehicle (Arm B)
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      CoQun® 10 ml is a medical device marked by the European Community as class IIb. This device
      has a system of dispensation that permits it to be preservative free (OSD - Ophthalmic
      Squeeze Dispenser). Investigators and patients will be masked to the study treatment. In
      order to mask the treatment, identical kit boxes, identical packaging (bottles and labels)
      will be used for vehicle and active product. The bottles will be dispensed sealed to the
      patient.

      One or two drops of the solution (CoQun® or Vehicle) will be instilled in the conjunctival
      sac of both eyes, twice daily from 8 to 10 AM and from 8 to 10 PM. Hypotensive therapy should
      be administered in the evening one hour after the CoQun® or Vehicle administration.

      At baseline, ocular hypotensive treatment, as per inclusion criteria has to be a PGA
      monotherapy. During the follow-up, in case the IOP exceeds 28 mmHg, any additional
      hypotensive therapy will be allowed to obtain IOP control.

      Dose modifications/reductions of CoQun® /Vehicle are not permitted.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with diagnosis of POAG (monolateral or bilateral) with an IOP ranging from 17
             to 21 mm Hg (at the last performed visit and confirmed at the baseline study visit) on
             treatment with a topical prostaglandin analogue (PGA) monotherapy.

          2. VF examination at randomization: VF Mean Defect (MD) at baseline within -4 decibel
             (dB) and -10dB and VF Pattern Standard Deviation (PSD) within 4 dB and 10dB (stage 2-3
             per the Enhanced Glaucoma Staging System 2 (GSS) determined by Humphrey Field Analyzer
             II-i, program 30-2 SITA standard.

          3. In order to determine patient's reliability to perform VF examination: before baseline
             VF, at least two reliable VF examinations during the last year had to be performed.
             Visual fields are considered reliable if false-positive responses are fewer than 15%
             and a clear blind spot could be seen in the VF printouts, threshold value &lt;10 dB.

          4. Age &gt;40 years

          5. Provision of informed consent prior to any study specific procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Secondary glaucoma (exofoliative glaucoma, pigmentary glaucoma, neovascular glaucoma).

          2. Abnormalities of the anterior segment of the eye that could affect IOP assessment.

          3. Cornea abnormalities with entities that could affect IOP evaluation.

          4. Other conditions different from glaucoma that could cause VF abnormalities
             (degenerative myopia, diabetic retinopathy, maculopathy, other optic nerve
             abnormalities that could mimic glaucoma damage).

          5. BCVA) &lt; 0.5 Snellen decimal fraction

          6. Any previous ocular surgery except for uncomplicated cataract extraction and YAG laser
             capsulotomy, laser glaucoma surgeries (argon laser trabeculoplasty and/or selective
             laser trabeculoplasty).
