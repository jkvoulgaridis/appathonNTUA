      To compare efficacy of topical latanoprost preceded by microneedling versus topical
      latanoprost alone in treatment of acrofacial vitiligo.

    <textblock>
      patients meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria presented to Dermatology Outpatient Clinic,
      Sohag University Hospital will be enrolled in the study after obtaining a written consent
      from them. Full history will be obtained and meticulous examination will be carried out.
      Patients will be randomly divided into 2 groups, one group will receive topical latanoprost
      with microneedling, and the other one will receive topical latabnoprost alone.

    <measure>Improvement in VASI score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>VASI score: The percentage of vitiligo involvement is calculated in terms of hand units. One hand unit is approximately equivalent to 1% of the total body surface area. The degree of pigmentation is estimated to the nearest of one of the following percentages:
100% - complete depigmentation, no pigment is present
90% - specks of pigment present
75% - depigmented area exceeds the pigmented area
50% - pigmented and depigmented areas are equal
25% - pigmented area exceeds depigmented area
10% - only specks of depigmentation present. The VASI for each body region is determined by the product of the area of vitiligo in hand units and the extent of depigmentation within each hand unit measured patch.
Total body VASI = S All body sites [Hand Units] x [Residual depigmentation]. (Feily et al., 2014).</description>

    <description>A superficial micro-needling technique will be done in millimeters according to depth of skin. The vitiliginous area and a thin surrounding rim (about 2 mm) will be subjected to micro-needling with dermapen. The depth of abrasion will be guided by the depth adjustor according to depth of skin on the affected area. This will be followed by the appearance of multiple, tiny, punctate, bleeding points</description>
