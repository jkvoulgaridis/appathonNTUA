  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An early mobilization (EM) program will be implemented in the Cardiovascular Intensive Care
      Unit at the Jewish General Hospital (JGH), an academic tertiary hospital in Montreal, Quebec.

      The investigators will perform a prospective, pre/post-EM intervention study in adults aged
      ≥60 years old admitted to the Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit (CICU) at the JGH. During a
      3-month period, the investigators will prospectively enrol patients to the pre-intervention
      cohort. The EM intervention will then be implemented. During a 12-month period, the
      investigators will prospectively enrol patients to the intervention cohort. 1 and 12 months
      following hospital discharge, patients in the pre-intervention and post-intervention cohorts
      will be contacted by phone by a member of the research team to assess for functional status
      and quality of life measures.

      The primary effectiveness outcome will be the mean improvement in level of function (LOF)
      during CICU admission and at 1 and 12 months. Covariates predicting improvement in LOF
      (&quot;responsiveness&quot;) and ones which do not (&quot;non-responsiveness&quot;) will be assessed. The
      recovery of physical function at 1 month and 6 months as measured by the SF-36 physical
      component summary score will be assessed. The SF-36 scores of the highest scoring tertile of
      LOF on hospital discharge will be compared with the lowest scoring tertile. Hospital
      readmission at 30 days and discharge home vs. healthcare facility will also be compared. For
      safety, the composite and individual components of the number of falls, injuries, and
      dislodgements over the total number of attempted mobility activities will be recorded. The
      results from the intervention cohort will be compared to the pre-intervention cohort for all
      results.

    <description>Recovery of physical function at 1 month and 12 months as measured by the Short Form (SF)-36 physical component summary score (measures 8 subscales: physical functioning, physical role, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional role and mental health). The score range is from 0 to 100 and scores are calibrated so that 50 is the average score. Higher scores mean less disability.</description>

    <description>The EM program consists of a progression of functional activities from level of function (LOF) 0 (lowest mobility) to 5 (highest mobility). Each LOF has 3 primary activities designed to promote the patient to the next level. The nurse will begin with mobility activities based on the LOF that matches the patient's current status. The nurse and clinical partner will attempt and/or complete each LOF activity once per shift.</description>
