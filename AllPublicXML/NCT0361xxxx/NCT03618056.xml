      This study will evaluate the breadth and potency of HIV-1 neutralizing antibody (nAb)
      responses and examine the safety and tolerability of an HIV gp120 protein vaccine (AIDSVAX®
      B/E) in HIV-uninfected adults diagnosed with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) who have
      stable disease.

      All participants will receive 600 mcg/mL of AIDSVAX® B/E at Months 0, 1, and 6.

      Study visits will occur at Months 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 3, 6, 6.25, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, and

          -  Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, Hb A1C greater than 7.0. (not excluded: history of
             isolated gestational diabetes.)

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension:

               -  If a person has a history of hypertension, or is found to have elevated blood
                  pressure or hypertension during screening, exclude for blood pressure that is not
                  well controlled. Well-controlled blood pressure is defined as consistently less
                  than or equal to 140 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic,
                  with only isolated, brief instances of higher readings, which must be less than
                  or equal to 150 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 100 mm Hg diastolic. For
                  these volunteers, blood pressure must be less than or equal to 140 mm Hg systolic
                  and less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic at enrollment.

               -  If a person has NOT been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension
                  during screening or previously, exclude for systolic blood pressure greater than
                  or equal to 150 mm Hg at enrollment or diastolic blood pressure greater than or
                  equal to 100 mm Hg at enrollment.

          -  Bleeding disorder diagnosed by a doctor (eg, factor deficiency, coagulopathy, or
             platelet disorder requiring special precautions)

          -  Malignancy (not excluded from participation: Volunteer who has had malignancy excised
             surgically and who, in the investigator's estimation, has a reasonable assurance of
             sustained cure, or who is unlikely to experience recurrence of malignancy during the
             period of the study)

          -  Seizure disorder: History of seizure(s) within past three years. Also exclude if
             volunteer has used medications in order to prevent or treat seizure(s) at any time
             within the past 3 years.

          -  Asplenia: any condition resulting in the absence of a functional spleen (not excluded:
             splenectomy for splenic trauma)

          -  History of hereditary angioedema, acquired angioedema, or idiopathic angioedema.
