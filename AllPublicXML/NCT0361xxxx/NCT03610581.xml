      The main purpose of this study is to assess safety and reactogenicity of the 3 vaccine
      regimens.

      This study is part of a vaccine program which aims to generate a therapeutic vaccine for
      women with HPV types 16 or 18 infection, with a focus on early disease interception. The
      study consists of 3 periods: Screening period of up to 42 days (6 weeks), followed by prime
      and boost immunizations and follow-up visits up to 12 months after the first vaccination.
      Evaluation of the safety/reactogenicity of the vaccine regimens will include physical
      assessment by study-site personnel, participant reports on signs and symptoms and laboratory
      assessments following vaccinations. Immunogenicity and Virology/Histology assessments will
      also be performed.

             determined by a qualitative PCR test within 8 weeks prior to screening or at the time
             of screening. Available history of high-risk (HR)-HPV positivity and HPV16 or HPV18
             positivity positivity will be recorded

          -  Must have a recent colposcopy result (with a maximum of 12 months old at screening);
             in case a colposcopy has not been performed before, it will be done as screening
             procedure

          -  Contraceptive (birth control) use by participants should be consistent with local
             regulations regarding the acceptable methods of contraception for those participating
             in clinical studies

          -  Agrees not to donate blood until 3 months after receiving the last dose of study
             vaccine

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  In case cytology results are available, participant has current or history of
             high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) or any
             high-grade vulvar, vaginal or anal intraepithelial neoplasia

          -  Current or history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)2+ or cervical cancer

          -  History of an underlying clinically significant acute or chronic medical condition,
             other than infection with HPV, or physical examination findings for which, in the
             opinion of the investigator, participation would not be in the best interest of the
             participant (for example, compromise the well-being) or that could prevent, limit, or
             confound the protocol-specified assessments

          -  Tests positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at screening

          -  Chronic active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection, verified at screening by
             hepatitis B surface antigen or anti-hepatitis C virus antibody, respectively

          -  Vaginal atrophy with or without topical hormonal therapies or systemic selective
             estrogen receptor modulators

             participated in the past in another preventive or therapeutic HPV vaccine study

          -  Clinically significant gynecological abnormalities that could, in the judgment of the
             investigator, interfere with study evaluation (for example [e.g.], prolapse, myoma,
             fibroid, hysterectomy)

          -  Symptomatic vaginal or genital infection (including genital herpes) as confirmed by
