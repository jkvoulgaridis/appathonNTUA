  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized cross-over trial to evaluate the cardiovascular responses after a power training
      session in elderly hypertensive participants. The current hypotesis is that power training
      session will reduce ambulatory blood pressure in elderly hypertensives when compared to an
      usual day without exercise (control session).

      Although resistance exercise (RE) is widely recommended as a non-pharmacological therapy to
      reduce blood pressure (BP), the efficacy of the RE to lower BP remains controversial.
      Additionally, the effects of a power training session (PT) on BP remain unclear particularly
      in elderly patients with hypertension. The objective of the present study is determine the
      effects of a power training session (PT) on ambulatory BP in elderly patients. All
      participants will perform two sessions in random order: PT and Control session. Before the
      experimental sessions the participants will perform maximal strength tests (1 Maximum
      Repetition test - 1RM) to determine the training loads in which the PT will be performed. The
      PT will be composed by 3 sets of 8-10 repetitions in 5 exercises (i.e., knee flexion, knee
      extension, leg press, bench press and upright row) at 50%1RM. The concentric phase during
      each repetition will be performed &quot;as fast as possible&quot;, while the eccentric phase of the
      movement last approximately 1 to 2 seconds duration.

      The control session will be performed in seated rest. Both experimental sessions last 40 min.
      Before and after experimental sessions reactive hyperemia (assessed by ultrassonography) and
      BP (assessed by an automatic device) will be assessed throughout one hour. After that, 24h
      ambulatory blood pressure monitoring will be evaluated.
