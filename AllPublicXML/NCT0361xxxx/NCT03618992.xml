    <textblock>
      This will be a multi-visit study that will take approximately 3 hours in total. Up to 200
      subjects from the BUMC Valley Fever and BUMC Dermatology clinics will be enrolled in this
      study and assigned to one of three cohorts according to timeline of oral anti-fungal therapy.
      Subjects in Cohort 1 will be randomized to apply topical cholesterol-containing moisturizers
      to the skin, hair and lips on either the right or left side of the body daily. Measurements
      of skin barrier function, appearance of skin and hair, and hair samples will be obtained at
      baseline and at 4 week follow-up visits. Cohorts 2 and 3 will be observational groups at
      differing points in oral antifungal treatment regimen. Subjects will be randomized to have
      measurements of skin barrier function and hair and skin characteristics obtained from either
      the right or left side of the body at baseline and at monthly follow-up visits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coccidioidomycosis, also known as Valley Fever, is a fungal condition most commonly seen in
      Arizona and can affect multiple organs, including the skin, lung, bone, joints, and central
      nervous system. Oral antifungal therapy such as fluconazole is the first-line medication to
      treat coccidioidomycosis. Through the investigator's clinical observations at the Valley
      Fever Center for Excellence, nearly all patients who have been placed on systemic azole
      treatment show some extent of cosmetic changes in their skin and hair, such as dry skin,
      chapped lips, hair loss, and change in hair characteristics. The goals of the study are to 1)
      understand the cosmetic changes in the skin and hair in patients initiating and discontinuing
      long-term oral antifungals, and 2) to examine whether cholesterol-based
      commercially-available moisturizers for the skin and for the hair can improve the cosmetic
      appearance better than a vehicle without these cholesterol ingredients.

    <description>Subjects will be provided with containers of topical cholesterol-containing moisturizers to be applied to the skin and hair, identical except for labels designating left and right. Topical formulations will be purchased by Skin Actives Scientific (www.skinactives.com), and will consist of one container of intervention and one of vehicle only (see ingredients below), to be applied to the left or right arm as indicated by pre-randomization assignment. Patients will be instructed to begin a 1-week washout period in which they will stop all topicals, and will then begin daily application of the topical intervention products to the indicated sites. Patients will return for follow-up visits at 2, 6, 10, and 14 weeks after starting intervention.</description>

    <description>Pre-study randomization will assign patients to have measurements obtained from either the left or right side of the body. Baseline skin barrier measurements of the skin and lips will be obtained, including transepidermal water loss (TEWL), hydration, pH and sebum (oil). Photos of the skin, lips, eyebrows, eyelashes and scalp will be taken. On each side, samples of scalp (pluck 1), eyebrow (trim 1), and eyelash (trim 1) hairs will be obtained only at baseline and the final visit. Patients will return for follow-up visits at 1, 2, and 3 months after discontinuation of oral antifungal therapy.</description>
