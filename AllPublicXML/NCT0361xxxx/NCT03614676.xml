      The purpose of this study is to assess pregnancy outcomes, and maternal, as well as neonatal
      events of interest in healthy pregnant women and their new-borns. The study will also
      determine incidence of lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI) caused by respiratory syncytial
      virus (RSV) in the new-borns during their first year of life.

    <intervention_model>Single Group Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>Single Group Assignment is selected because this is a low-interventional, epidemiological study. As such, the study does not have multiple groups/treatment arms that will be compared against one another statistically in the way two study arms would be compared against each other in a clinical trial. Instead, the study will longitudinally follow pregnant women through a 42-day post-delivery period and will also follow the infants born to these women. It should be noted that these are the two populations listed in the protocol, but these are not two groups that will compared against one another. Statistical analyses will be conducted within each group and some analyses will be done across the two groups. However, these two groups should not be considered equivalent to two study arms. This explains why a single group assignment is appropriate while two study groups (mothers and infants) will be examined.</intervention_model_description>
