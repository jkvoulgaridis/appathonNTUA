  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ZSP1603
      and the Secondary objective is to estimate the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters after orally
      administered once daily of ZSP1603.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, single center study aimed at
      investigating the safety, tolerability and the pharmacokinetics of ZSP1603 on fasted
      condition.Up to 4 cohorts of 32 eligible participants totally are planned to be enrolled.
      This is a two-arm clinical trial that ZSP1603 and matching placebo will be orally
      administered once daily. Two subjects in the first cohort will be assigned in a opened
      fashion to receive 7.5mg of ZSP1603 while another three cohorts of volunteers will be
      randomly assigned in a blinded fashion to receive either a single dose of ZSP1603 or matching
      placebo in an ascending dose fashion. To monitor AEs,record abnormalities (Holter, 12-lead
      ECG, Vital signs, Physical examination, Clinical Laboratory), and detect the pharmacokinetics
      of ZSP1603.
