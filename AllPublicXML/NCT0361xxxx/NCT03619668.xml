  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to obtain important information about the tumour and
      surrounding organs during preoperative chemo-radiotherapy for patients with adenocarcinoma of
      the rectum. The knowledge generated in this project has the potential to make future
      radiotherapy treatments (RT) of rectal cancer patients more precise, with less side effects.
      This could lead the way to make chemo-radiotherapy the main treatment modality and spare a
      large group of patients from the risk of severe complications after surgery. Specifically, we
      aim to obtain:

        -  A characterization of systematic and random changes in position and shape of tumours and
           surrounding organs during RT.

        -  A patient-specific pre-treatment characterization of random uncertainties in position
           and shape of the tumour during radiotherapy. This will be used to create and assess an
           individual, patient-specific treatment strategy, with the possibility to implement an
           adaptive RT strategy using the information obtained from the MRI-scans during treatment.

        -  Information about treatment response and local toxicity from morphological and
           functional data before, during and after CRT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the rectum are treated with
      concomitant chemo-radiotherapy (CRT), with the aim of reducing local recurrences. Depending
      on tumor location, this is a pre-operative procedure prior to total mesorectal excision or
      partial mesorectal excision. The surgery is associated with a high risk of postoperative
      morbidity, however, especially when combined with CRT. Consequently, recent years have seen
      an increasing focus on other therapeutic approaches, such as &quot;watch and wait&quot;, where the aim
      is to treat some patients with definitive CRT alone. The success of these new approaches
      directly relies on the effectiveness of the radiotherapy (RT) treatment and thereby on the
      level as well as the accuracy of the delivered dose to the tumor.

      Standard treatment today is based on a single set of CT- and MRI-scans, which are
      insufficient to estimate the organ motion during RT. Precise knowledge about the variation in
      position and shape of the tumor using multiple MRI scans before and during RT will have the
      potential to make future radiotherapy treatments more precise with less side effects.

      The investigators will conduct a prospective study of sequential MRI scans before and during
      CRT. Patients will be MRI scanned six times in addition to the standard MRI-scan appointments
      and follow-up. This will provide a total of 9 MRI-scans of each patient; 3 before RT, 3
      during RT and 3 during follow up. The information gained from these additional scans will
      provide a much better understanding of the tumor and organs during RT.

      This project's overall focus is to make future RT treatments of rectal cancer patients as
      precise and efficient as possible. This could contribute to and aid the paradigm shift of
      making chemo-radiotherapy the main treatment strategy for some rectal cancer patients. This
      has the potential to spare patients of the severe morbidities associated with surgery, as
      well as the need for stomas.

    <description>Use additional MRI scans before radiotherapy (for random changes) and during radiotherapy (for systematic changes). The gross tumor volume (GTV), clinical target volume (CTV) will be delineated separately on CT and all MRI-scans. Using a rigid bony anatomy-based method, the MRI-scans will be registered to the planning CT scan, to allow a comparison of the position and shape variations of the volumes. The information gained will be used to evaluate the relevance of current population based planning target volume (PTV) margins, and, if relevant, provide updated recommendations for treatment margins.</description>
