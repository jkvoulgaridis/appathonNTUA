      This study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) profile in
      healthy Chinese volunteers with single or multiple ascending oral doses of TG-2349
      (Furaprevir capsule). The study is separated into two parts, part A and part B.

      Part A：To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of single ascending oral dose
      (100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg, and 600 mg) of TG-2349 in healthy Chinese volunteers.

      Part B：To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of multiple ascending oral doses
      (200 mg, 400 mg, and 600 mg) of TG-2349 for five days in healthy Chinese volunteers.
