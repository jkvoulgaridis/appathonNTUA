  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Xerostomia is defined as the subjective complaint of dry mouth. Symptoms of dry mouth may
      range from mild oral discomfort to significant oral disease that can compromise patients'
      health, dietary intake and quality of life. Xerostomia is accompanied by numerous signs and
      symptoms mainly in the mucous membranes, lips, tongue, salivary glands and teeth.

      This study was designed to verify efficacy and safety of a novel dietary supplement
      (Aqualief),designed with the aim of stabilizing the saliva flux and pH at a neutral level and
      to improve the acid buffering capacity of saliva.

      Sixty patients with xerostomia (grade 1-2 according to RTOG/EORTC) from different etiologies
      were recruited at the Clinica Odontoiatrica dell'Università degli studi dell'Insubria
      (Varese, Italy). Exclusion criteria were subjects under treatment using drugs to treat
      hyposalivation (e.g. pilocarpine) and xerostomia grade ≥ 3. Patients with severe
      hyposalivation were excluded (saliva flow rate at baseline &lt;0.1 ml min-1) due to their
      inability to dissolve the tablet formulation.

      Written informed consent was received from all patients before study initiation. The study
      was conducted in accordance with the principles laid out by the Declaration of Helsinki 1964
      and its subsequent amendments and with the International Committee on Harmonization
      Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and in compliance with local ethical and legal
      requirements. The study was approved by the ethics committee at the participating site.

      The study was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial undertaken at
      the Clinica Odontoiatrica dell'Università degli Studi dell'Insubria (Varese, Italy). Eligible
      patients who had developed xerostomia RTOG/EORTC grade 1-2 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio,
      with one group receiving three Aqualief tablets (after meals: breakfast, lunch, dinner) daily
      for 6 days. The second group received a placebo tablet given with the same regimen. The
      primary objective of the study was to assess the safety and efficacy of Aqualief in
      stabilizing the saliva pH at a neutral level compared with placebo. The secondary objective
      was to determine whether Aqualief induced an increase of unstimulated or stimulated saliva
      and in ameliorating the symptoms related to oral dryness.
