  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following severe traumatic brain injury, patients may remain unconscious for many years. It
      is the first proteomic analysis comparing differentially expressed proteins between patients
      with chronic disorder of consciousness and controls so far. The investigators generated
      accurate lists of proteomes and identified differences at different disease time courses. The
      obtained results provide new insight into understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying
      the chronic disorder of consciousness.

      Background: Patients who awake from severely traumatic brain injury (sTBI) may remain
      unconscious for many years. Although behavioral assessment and functional imaging are
      currently used as diagnostic tools, the molecular basis underlying chronic condition has yet
      to be explored.

      Objective:To explore the molecular basis and identify novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and
      prognosis of patients with chronic disorder of consciousness.

      Method: Plasma samples were obtained from patients with chronic disorder of consciousness,
      and healthy volunteers. A coupled isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation
      (iTRAQ)-based proteomics approach was used to screen differentially expressed proteins (DEPs)
      between patients and controls. Potential molecular mechanisms were further discussed through
      bioinformatics analyses. Candidate proteins were validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
      assay (ELISA).

      Peripheral blood (5 mL) was collected in a Vacutainer® tube, containing anticoagulant, using
      standardized phlebotomy procedures. Plasma was prepared by centrifugation (2,000 g, 5 min,
      4°C) and stored at -80°C until further analysis.
