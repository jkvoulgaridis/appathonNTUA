  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled trial to slow cognitive decline in adults undergoing
      hemodialysis (HD). The investigators will test three interventions cognitive training (CT),
      exercise training (ET), and combined cognitive and exercise training (CT+ET) relative to
      standard of care (SC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a two by two factorial, randomized, controlled trial to slow cognitive decline
      in adults undergoing hemodialysis (HD). The investigators primary objective is to determine
      if receiving cognitive training (tablet-based brain games), exercise training (stationary
      foot pedal), or combined cognitive and exercise training preserves executive function
      relative to those with standard of care . The secondary objectives are to compare the rates
      of end stage renal disease (ESRD)-specific clinical outcomes and patient centered outcomes
      among those receiving CT, or ET, or CT+ET relative to those in SC. The investigators will
      formally test whether receiving CT or ET will preserve executive function and receiving
      combined CT+ET will preserve executive function better than CT or ET alone.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>3 month change in executive function</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in executive function between baseline and 3 months of interventions as measured by the Trail Making Test which is comprised of Part A and Part B. Executive function is assessed by the time (minutes) to complete Part B minus the time (minutes) to complete Part A. Needing more time to complete the test indicates worse executive function.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Global Cognitive Function as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in global cognitive function at 3-months and 6 months of interventions as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). This test was designed as a rapid screening instrument for mild cognitive dysfunction. It is a brief 30 question test that assesses different cognitive domains: attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation.Total possible score is 30 points and a score of 26 or above is considered normal.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Executive function as measured by the Stroop test</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in executive function at 3 months and 6 months of interventions as measured by the Stroop Test. The Stroop test is a screening test for cognitive function test and evaluates the inhibitory control of executive function. It is a measure of the ability of the brain to sort out distracting or unnecessary information from the meaningful tasks. It involves reading the name of a color printed in a different color ink. The time ratio of color-word interference and color only tasks will be calculated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Executive function as measured by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in executive function at 3 months and 6 months of interventions as measure by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test. This test evaluates the speed and working memory components of executive function. It involves a key consisting of the numbers 1-9, each paired with a unique, easy-to--draw symbol such as a &quot;V&quot;, &quot;+&quot; or &quot;&gt;&quot;. Below the key are a series of the numbers 1-9 in random order and repeated several times. The participant is allowed 90 seconds to fill in the corresponding symbol for each number. This task requires the individual to visually scan the answer key provided at the top of the test and then write the correct symbol by each number as quickly as possible. The correct number of symbols written within 90 seconds is measured.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Physical function as measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) test</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in lower extremity function at 3 months and 6 months of interventions using the SPPB test. The SPPB is an objective assessment tool for evaluating lower extremity functioning This test is a performance-based assessment comprised of 3 tasks: 1) repeated chair stands, 2) standing balance, and 3) a 4-meter usual paced walk in those with and without a walking aid (meters/second). Participants receive a score of 0 for a task if they were unable to complete the task; otherwise, they receive scores of 1-4 based on population-based norms. The scores of the three tasks are summed to create the SPPB score. The SPPB score ranges from 0 to 12, with lower scores indicating poorer function.</description>

    <measure>Number of Falls</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Number of injurious falls resulting in a medical encounter during the 6 months of interventions and for 6 months after the interventions</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Hospitalizations</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The number of hospitalizations parameterized as both the number of hospital admissions and number of days hospitalized during the 6 months of interventions and 6 months after the interventions</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mortality</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Mortality will be captured through Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) death notification or the National Death Index. Mortality will be ascertained within the 6 months of the intervention and 1 year after the intervention (1.5 years total).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient-centered Outcomes as measured by the Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL) Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in kidney disease-specific physical and mental quality of life at 3 months and 6 months of interventions. The KDQOL s a kidney disease-specific measure of how kidney disease is impacting a participant's quality of life. It is a 36-item survey with 3 subscales including physical and mental health-related quality of life, and kidney disease-specific HRQOL. Each subscale is scored 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better HRQOL.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient-centered Outcomes as measured by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-29</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the participants' physical, mental, and social health status at 3 months and 6 months of interventions. PROMIS-29 is a health-related quality of life survey which assesses each of the 7 PROMIS domains with 4 questions. Norm-based scores have been calculated for each domain on the PROMIS measures. High scores represent more of the domain being measured. Thus, on symptom-oriented domains of PROMIS-29 (anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain interference, and sleep disturbance), higher scores represent worse symptomatology. On the function-oriented domains (physical functioning and social role) higher scores represent better functioning.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
