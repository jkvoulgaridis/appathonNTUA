  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether it is safe to administer a peptide vaccine (6MHP) with adjuvants
      and the CDX-1127 monoclonal antibody, and whether the adjuvants and the CDX-1127 monoclonal
      antibody boost immune responses to the vaccine. In this study, the adjuvants are Montanide
      ISA-51 and polyICLC. The investigators will monitor these effects by performing tests in the
      laboratory on participants' blood and tissue from a vaccine site.
