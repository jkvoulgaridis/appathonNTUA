  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension (HTN) is the most important stroke and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor.
      Unfortunately, there is substantial under-treatment of HTN. Of the 86 million adults with
      prevalent HTN in the U.S., 40 million (46%) have inadequately controlled blood pressure (BP).
      This problem is worse among minority groups. In this study, the investigators demonstrate how
      mHealth (mobile health technology) can improve HTN control rates in stroke survivors and
      primary care patients without stroke, but who are at a high risk of stroke and CVD. Our
      intervention is called mGlide. Intervention participants will self- monitor their BP daily
      using a wireless BP monitor and a smart phone. The phone will transmit this BP to a database
      automatically. The investigators will use the framework of glide paths to manage the
      transmitted BP data. The glide path, based on the concept of landing an airplane, establishes
      an expected trajectory of BP readings for each patient with bounds set by guidelines and
      provider input. BP is monitored at home; the health care team is alerted when patient BP
      deviates from expected bounds. Alerts are generated once a week for the health care team with
      a list of patients with uncontrolled HTN. This facilitates early intervention while avoiding
      information overload. Partnering clinical centers include Federally Qualified Health Centers
      that serve low income and minority (Latino, African American, Hmong) communities. In this RCT
      study, the investigators will randomize 450 participants with uncontrolled HTN to the mGlide
      intervention (n=225) vs. state-of-clinical-care comparison (n=225).

      Aim 1 will examine how well HTN is controlled in the two groups at 6 months and 12 months
      after randomization. Aim 2 will examine mGlide usability for providers and provider
      experience and satisfaction with mGlide. It will also examine whether medications are managed
      differently for participants in the two groups. Aim 3 will examine whether patients are more
      satisfied with care in the mGlide group, whether they are more &quot;activated&quot; and have a greater
      sense of self-efficacy in managing their HTN. Aim 4 will be a cost-effectiveness analysis of
      providing mGlide care. The long-term goal is to prevent stroke and improve cardiovascular
      health in populations by increasing health system efficiency and effectiveness. The results
      from our mGlide RCT will provide evidence for the use of readily available mHealth technology
      for bridging the guideline-to-practice gap in HTN treatment in low resource health systems
      serving minority groups.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Stroke survivors (ischemic stroke or intra-parenchymal hemorrhage) or patients who
             have not had a stroke but carry a high risk of stroke or cardiovascular disease (CVD)
             events (&gt;7.5% over 10 years) as defined by the AHA/ACC guideline on risk
             stratification9

          -  Diagnosis of uncontrolled HTN at the time of study enrollment (need not have stroke)

          -  Uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) defined as SBP &gt;140 mm Hg at the last 2 clinic visits
             in the 6 months prior to the screening date. Alternatively, if a patient was
             discharged from the hospital in the 6 months prior to screening and does not have 2
             clinic visits after hospital discharge, at least one hospital SBP in the last 2 days
             of the hospital stay must be &gt;140 mm Hg. Screening of uncontrolled HTN will be based
             on Electronic Medical Record (EMR) BP data.
