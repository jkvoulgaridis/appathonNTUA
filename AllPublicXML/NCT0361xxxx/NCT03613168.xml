    <textblock>
      Trastuzumab is approved for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer and gastric cancer.
      The recent study showed that HER2 overexpression or amplification is noted about 5-15% of
      total biliary tract cancer patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of trastuzumab in the combination of current standard gemcitabine plus cisplatin.
