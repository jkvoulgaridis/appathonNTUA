    <description>Eligible patients who consent to participate undergo planned colonoscopy by endoscopists performing procedures that day per normal standard of care. The colonoscope is passed to the cecum and then withdrawn to the hepatic flexure with washing and aspirating of colonic contents as needed to optimize visualization of colonic mucosa. Then, the colonoscope is inserted to the cecum and withdrawn to the hepatic flexure again for second examination.</description>
