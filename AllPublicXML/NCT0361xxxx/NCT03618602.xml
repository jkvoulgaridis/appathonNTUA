  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human study to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      efficacy of Bisthianostat in refractory or recurrent multiple myeloma patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, single center, open-label, single arm, dose escalating phase I
      study. This study will be conducted in 3 parts.

      Phase A : Patients will receive single dose of bisthianostat to evaluate the single-dose
      pharmacokinetics and safety.

      Phase B: After single-dose phase, patients will receive multiple dose bisthianostat for 4
      weeks on day 1,4,11,14,18,21,25,28 to evaluate the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics and safety

      Phase C: Patients will continue on the study if they benefit from the drug and not experience
      any serious side effects.
