      Single blinded randomized controlled trial evaluating THERANOVA-500 dialyzer compared to
      REVACLEAR-400 dialyzer in chronic hemodialysis patients over a 6-week intervention period.
      Primary endpoint is post-hemodialysis recovery time. Secondary endpoints are six pre-dialysis
      biomarker levels (b2-microglobuline, procalcitonine, free light chains (gamma-lambda), IL-6,
      CRP) and three Quality of Life (QoL)(adapted KDQoL-SF questionnaire, EQ-5D, and rESAS).

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial involving 70 subjects divided in 4 groups: 25 single
      blinded subjects using THERANOVA-500 dialyzer; 25 single blinded subjects using REVACLEAR-400
      dialyzer; 10 non-blinded subjects using THERANOVA-500 and 10 non-blinded subjects using
      REVACLEAR-400 dialyzer for their chronic hemodialysis treatments over an active intervention
      period of 6 weeks. All subjects are to be dialyzed using REVACLEAR-400 for two weeks prior
      and for two weeks after the intervention period.

      Primary endpoint is mean post-hemodialysis recovery time (as reported by subjects once
      weekly) between groups (THERANOVA-500 vs REVACLEAR-400) (all subjects) during the 6-week
      intervention period.

      Secondary endpoints are:

        1. Post-hemodialysis recovery time change (mean of 2-week pre and 2-week post intervention
           period compared to mean during 6-week intervention period)(mean THERANOVA-500 vs mean
