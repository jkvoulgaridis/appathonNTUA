    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product.</description>

             including (but not limited to) cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiovascular disease,
             hematologic disease, coagulation disorders (including any abnormal bleeding or blood
             dyscrasias), significant pulmonary disease, including bronchospastic respiratory
             disease, hepatic or renal insufficiency, type 1 diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes
             mellitus (T2DM), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), pancreas or beta-cell transplantation,
             or diabetes secondary to pancreatitis or pancreatectomy, thyroid disease, neurologic
             or psychiatric disease, infection, or any other illness that the investigator
             considers should exclude the participant or that could interfere with the
             interpretation of the study result

          -  Participant has taken any prescription or nonprescription medication (including
             vitamins and herbal supplements), except for acetaminophen, from 14 days before the
             first dose of the study drug is scheduled until completion of the study

          -  Participant has received an experimental drug (including investigational vaccines) or
             used an experimental medical device within 3 months or within a period less than 5
             times the drug's half life, whichever is longer, prior to screening

          -  Participant test positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV [positive serology for
             HIV antigen/antibody]), tests positive for hepatitis B virus surface antigen, or has

          -  Participant has had major surgery (example, requiring general anesthesia) within 4
             months before screening, or will not have fully recovered from surgery, or has surgery
