    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the relative bioavailability of BI
      655130 administered as two subcutaneous injections in the left and right periumbilical region
      compared to a single subcutaneous periumbilical injection of BI 655130.

      The secondary objective is to investigate the relative bioavailability of a single
      subcutaneous injection of BI 655130 into the thigh compared to a single subcutaneous
      periumbilical injection of BI 655130.

             after trial completion:

               -  Use of adequate contraception, e.g. any of the following methods plus condom:

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including Blood pressure (BP), Pulse rate (PR)

          -  Participation in another trial where an investigational drug has been administered
             within 60 days prior to planned administration of trial medication, or current
             participation in another trial involving administration of investigational drug

          -  Smoker (more than 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes per day)

             males)

          -  Drug abuse or positive drug screening

          -  Blood donation of more than 100 mL within 30 days prior to administration of trial
             medication or intended donation during the trial

          -  Intention to perform excessive physical activities within one week prior to
             administration of trial medication up to 4 weeks after administration

          -  Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site

          -  A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (such as QTc intervals that are
             repeatedly greater than 450 ms in males or repeatedly greater than 470 ms in females)
             or any other relevant ECG finding at screening

          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (such as heart failure,
             hypokalemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)

          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,
             because considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements, or has a
