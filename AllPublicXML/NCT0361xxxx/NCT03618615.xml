      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE Qualitatively describe the distribution of cutaneous arteries in patients
      with long-term occlusive arterial disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE To compare the distribution of cutaneous arteries observed on the legs of
      arteritic patients with that observed on non-arteritic legs (from bodies given to science).

      Arterial patient coming to CHRU Nancy, in the Vascular and Endoluminal Surgery Department, to
      undergo leg amputation.

      Usually, after the amputation of the leg in the operating theatre, the surgical waste is
      destroyed.

      Instead of being destroyed, the leg will be used for research.

    <description>The leg will be transported in a container to the Anatomy Laboratory (Faculty of Medicine - University of Lorraine).
Within 72 hours of its arrival, the operating room will be dissected to qualitatively describe the distribution of cutaneous arteries in patients with long-term occlusive arterial disease.</description>
