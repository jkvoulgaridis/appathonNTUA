      The study is an open label, non-randomized study designed to evaluate the diagnostic
      performance of SPECT CT. The study will consist of 3 cohorts, and a subset of the patients in
      cohort C will participate in a test-retest study, where the baseline SPECT/CT will be
      repeated.

      SPECT CT will be performed in all cohorts.

      Cohort A will evaluate SPECT CT by comparison to a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan
      using NaF.

      Cohort B will evaluate SPECT CT by comparison to 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT.

      Cohort C will evaluate SPECT CT by comparison to Whole Body Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      (WB-MRI).

      Eligible subjects will be enrolled in a non-randomized manner per the treating physician
      discretion.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months post-treatment, 6 months post-treatment, at time of disease progression assessed up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>QBSI will be measured on SPECT scans at pre-defined intervals. A lower QBSI would mean likelier progression free survival.</description>

    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Reproducibility measured by difference in QBSI between test-retest in 12 patients, as defined by the protocol. A smaller difference in QBSI reflects greater reproducibility.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months post-treatment, 6 months post-treatment, at time of disease progression assessed up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>QBSI will be measured on QBSPECT images obtained at the same time as standard-of-care bone scans. A higher QBSI would predict earlier recurrence of metastasis.</description>

    <measure>Accuracy of NaF PET/CT as determined by difference in QBSI from SPECT versus QBSI from NaF PET/CT in 20 patients</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months post-treatment, 6 months post-treatment, at time of disease progression assessed up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Difference in QBSI from SPECT versus NaF PET/CT. A smaller difference in the measured QBSI would reflect a higher accuracy of Na18F PET/CT. These images will be acquired within 32 hours of the bone scintigraphy scans at the pre-defined time points, per protocol.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Accuracy of PSMA PET/CT as determined by difference in QBSI from SPECT versus QBSI from PSMA PET/CT in 20 patients</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months post-treatment, assessed up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Difference in QBSI from SPECT versus PSMA PET/CT. A smaller difference in the measured QBSI would reflect a higher accuracy of PSMA PET/CT. These images will be acquired within 32 hours of the bone scintigraphy scans at the pre-defined time points, per protocol.</description>
