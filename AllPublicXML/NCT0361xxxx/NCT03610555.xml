  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Choosing a transplant center that will accept a particular candidate can be difficult and
      challenging for patients with end-stage organ failure. As transplant centers have varying
      levels of expertise, interests, and outcomes of solid organ transplant, patient
      health-related characteristics influence the variation in candidates centers will accept.
      Most transplant candidates undergo waitlist work-ups as outpatients and many undergo
      transplant at centers not closest to their homes. Some are listed at more than one center.
      Several studies suggest that patients have a choice of centers. The PI, as Deputy Director of
      the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR), provides comparative information to
      the public about each solid organ transplant center in the United States. The risk adjusted
      outcomes, in the report cards, account for the transplant recipient's health-related
      characteristics, donor characteristics and transplant related factors. Unfortunately, in
      their current format, the report cards are not designed for transplant candidates, many of
      whom may have low health literacy and numeracy.

      The proposed work aims to develop and evaluate a patient-centered website and printouts of
      the SRTR report cards that will effectively communicate comparative information to transplant
      candidates about their alternatives when choosing transplant centers. We will develop a novel
      tool to allow candidates to tailor the report cards to their clinical profiles based on their
      health-related characteristics and to communicate information on alternative transplant
      centers that perform transplants in patients like them. Aim 1 will use focus groups to
      determine which transplant center characteristics to present to transplant candidates and how
      to present these characteristics clearly in a patient centered report card. Using this
      information, Aim 2 will develop a patient-centered website and printouts of the SRTR report
      card that effectively communicate comparative information about transplant centers to
      transplant candidates. Lastly, Aim 3 will conduct a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the
      effectiveness of the patient centered SRTR report card. We will determine transplant
      candidates' comprehension and the value of the comparative quality reports, and the effect on
      clinical decision making and status on the waiting list. After the RCT, a convenience sample
      of online visitors to the new website will be assessed for similar outcomes.

    <measure>Comprehension of the report card</measure>
    <time_frame>one hour</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is the comprehension of the report card. To assess comprehension, the correct response to the following question will be assessed, &quot;Which transplant center do you think is most likely to have the best posttransplant outcome?&quot; There will be one correct answer; respondents will choose one of the four transplant center report cards shown or respond &quot;Don't know.&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived value of information</measure>
    <time_frame>one hour</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived value of information will be determined via patient responses to the following question, &quot;How useful is the information in the report card in helping you choose a transplant center for you or your family?&quot; Response choices to the questions will be based on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = not at all useful to 5 = very useful; score 1 indicates the worst outcome and score 5 indicates better outcome).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measurement of satisfaction with decision making</measure>
    <time_frame>two hours</time_frame>
    <description>We will also measure satisfaction with decision-making and decisional conflict using the Ottawa Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS). The DCS consists of 16 questions with an overall score and subscales that address uncertainty, modifiable factors contributing to uncertainty such as feeling uninformed, clarity of values, inadequate social support, and perceived effective decision making. (1 = low decisional conflict, 5 = high decisional conflict). The overall score is calculated by summing up the subscales and the total score is considered for the measure of outcome. Overall score indicates the level of decisional conflict and lower overall score indicates better outcome.</description>
