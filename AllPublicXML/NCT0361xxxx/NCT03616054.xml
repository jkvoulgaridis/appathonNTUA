  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endotracheal intubation (ETI) is a potentially life-threatening procedure for critically ill
      patients and major severe complications such as severe hypoxia, cardiovascular collapse and
      cardiac arrest are common. Despite the high risk of the procedure, different interventions
      lack high-quality evidence and the investigators hypothesize that a heterogeneous practice
      among different centres and geographical areas may be found.

      The investigators designed a large international observational study aiming at prospectively
      collecting data on the current impact of ETI-related adverse events and current airway
      management practice in critically ill patients. Investigators will collect data on all
      consecutive in-hospital (intensive care unit, emergency department and wards) ETIs performed
      in adult critically patients.

    <textblock>
      This study aims at prospectively collecting data on the current morbidity and mortality of
      ETI-related adverse events and current airway management practice in adult critically ill
      patients. Investigators designed a large international study calling for participation all
      institutions caring critically ill patients worldwide.

      Inclusion criteria

      Investigators will include all adult (≥ 18 years old) critically ill patients undergoing
      intubation during the period of observation. Investigators will consider all in-hospital
      intubations. Critically ill will be defined those patients with a life-threatening condition
      requiring intubation for either cardiorespiratory failure or airway protection.

      Exclusion Criteria

        -  Intubation performed in the out-of-hospital setting

        -  Intubation during cardiac arrest

        -  Intubation performed for anaesthesia

      Primary Outcome

      Major ETI-related adverse events - composite outcome (severe hypoxemia, cardiac arrest and
      cardiovascular collapse - see further for definitions)

      Secondary Outcomes

      Minor ETI-related adverse events and ICU mortality (see further for definitions).

      Sample size

      Investigators' aim is to collect data from 1000 intubation- related major complications. From
      a previously published report (Jaber 2006) the expected incidence of at least one major
      complication is 28%. Therefore investigators plan to recruit data from 3600 endotracheal
      intubations. Intubation rate may vary from 0.5 to 2 ETIs/day according to different centres
      (e.g. total hospital beds, number of ICUs and ICU beds) and local policies. Each centre will
      be asked to collect data from 20 ETIs. A maximum time window of 8 weeks will be allowed for
      each centre (i.e. for centres with a slower recruitment rate, data collection will stop after
      8 weeks irrespective of total number of ETIs collected data). Investigators plan to recruit
      at least 180 centres worldwide.
