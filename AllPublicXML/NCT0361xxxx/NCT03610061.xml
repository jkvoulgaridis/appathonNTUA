    <textblock>
      The primary objective for this study is to determine the safety profile of radiotherapy and
      durvalumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor.

      Primary endpoint:

      Toxicity, drug pharmacokinetics (PK), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase two
      dose (RPTD) of simultaneous radiotherapy plus durvalumab in patients with relapsed or
      refractory DLBCL or FL.

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  ORR

        -  Progression-free survival

        -  Overall survival

      Exploratory endpoints include description of biological effects of combination radiotherapy
      plus durvalumab (Imaging results, immune function, PK and PD-see 'research methodologies')
      and in the PET-Sub-Study, biodistribution of 89Zr Durvalumab and 89Zr-IAB22M2C.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Follicular Lymphoma (FL) are the most common non
      Hodgkin lymphomas. Standard first line treatment achieves cure in approximately half of
      patients. However 30% die from relapsed lymphoma.

      Durvalumab (an antibody which blocks programmed cell death ligand 1) and other
      immunotherapies fight cancer by blocking barriers to immune system activity. Immune control
      of lymphoma provides the prospect of cure, even when chemotherapy has failed. Radiotherapy
      has striking effects on the immune system and can boost responses to these immunotherapies.
      The effect of concurrent radiotherapy and durvalumab in DLBCL and FL is unproven.

      This study will evaluate the safety and effect of simultaneous radiotherapy plus durvalumab
      (a PD-L1 inhibitor) in relapsed DLBCL and FL patients.

    <description>A minimum of 3 patients will initially be enrolled in each cohort, if none of the first 3 patients experiences a dose limiting toxicity (DLT), the doses in that cohort will be deemed safe and tolerable and escalation may continue. DLTs will be grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, grade 3 hemolysis, grade 4 immune related AEs.
If 1 of the first 3 evaluable patients in a cohort experiences a DLT, the cohort will be expanded to at least 6 patients. If there are no further DLTs in the first 6 DLT-evaluable patients, the doses in that cohort will be deemed safe and tolerable and escalation may continue.
If a DLT is observed in ≥ 33% of patients (e.g., 2 or more of up to 6 patients), the dose combination at which this occurs will be considered intolerable and the MTD will have been exceeded for radiotherapy If the MTD is exceeded in any cohort, the highest dose combination at which fewer than 33% experience a DLT will be declared the combination MTD.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or Female subjects aged 18 years weighing more than 30 kg

          2. Histologically proven CD20-positive relapsed or refractory diffuse large B cell
             non-Hodgkin lymphoma (DLBCL) either de novo or DLBCL transformed from any indolent
             B-non-Hodgkin lymphoma (including Richter's transformation) Or follicular lymphoma
             grade 1-3A, or Grade 3B, according to the current World Health Organization
             classification on tissue biopsy. Archived tissue is permitted however must have been
             obtained after the last known therapy. The Trial Management Group retains the option
             to limit the number of participants enrolled with a specific histology.

          3. At least 1 line of previous treatment for lymphoma which must include a CD20
             monoclonal antibody such as rituximab, with no curative option as determined by the
             investigator. Prior radiotherapy is permitted.

          4. Patients with DLBCL must not be eligible or willing to receive high-dose
             (myeloablative) chemotherapy (HDC) and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) OR has
             received prior ASCT.

          5. Eastern Collaborative Oncology Group performance status 0, or 1, unless attributable
             to lymphoma in which case patients of performance status 2 are also eligible.

          6. Patients must have measurable disease (at least one bi-dimensionally measurable site
             of disease that has not been previously irradiated OR has progressed after
             radiotherapy: nodal disease &gt;1.5 cm or an extranodal lesion &gt; 1.0 cm in longest
             perpendicular diameter). At least three disease sites must be FDG-avid on PET imaging

             not planned for radiotherapy, but not mandated. A fresh tumor biopsy collected during
             screening and /or archival tumor tissue collected after the last relapse/disease
             progression (material which has been collected before the last line of treatment is
             not accepted). In addition, a sufficient amount of the material is required for
             acceptance of the archival material. If neither condition occurs, a fresh tumor biopsy
             needs to be performed as stated above.

             according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula (or local institutional standard method).

         10. Adequate hepatic function defined by a total bilirubin level ≤ 2 × the upper limit of
             normal (ULN) range (excluding Gilbert's disease where a level of ≤ 3 ×ULN is
             acceptable) and AST and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels ≤ 2.5 × upper limit of
             institutional normal range unless attributed to lymphoma.

         11. No concurrent uncontrolled medical condition as determined by the investigator.

         12. Life expectancy &gt; 3 months.

         13. Negative blood pregnancy test at screening for women of childbearing potential.
             Effective contraception for both male and female subjects if the risk of conception
             exists.

        (Note: The effects of the trial drug on the developing human fetus are unknown; thus, women
        of childbearing potential and men must agree to use effective contraception, defined as 2
        barrier methods, or 1 barrier method with an intrauterine device, or use of oral female
        contraceptive. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her
        partner is participating in this trial, the treating physician should be informed
        immediately. Effective contraception at least 30 days prior and up to 3 months after
        treatment is required for all women of childbearing potential and male subjects will be
        advised not to father a child during the 3 months after treatment completion. Male subjects
        will be requested to seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment.) n) Signed
        written informed consent before any trial-related procedure is undertaken that is not part
        of the standard patient management.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        maximum of 5 days at the discretion of the local PI. Steroids must not be given within 5
        days of radiotherapy. Note that steroids are optimally avoided due to the potential for
        reduction in durvalumab activity
