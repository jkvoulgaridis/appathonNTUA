      Determine motion and morphology of the healthy ankle during simulated gait.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy volunteers will undergo weight-bearing, cone beam CT scans of their foot/ankle during
      3 phases of simulated gait. Motion and morphology of the foot and ankle will be quantified
      and analyzed.
