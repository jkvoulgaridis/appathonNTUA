  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot early phase I trial studies how well fluorothymidine F-18 positron emission
      tomography (PET) works in imaging patients with intermediate or high grade soft tissue
      sarcoma. Fluorothymidine F-18 PET may provide useful information about the tumor's response
      to treatment and may give the doctors early results that would better help to plan the
      post-surgical therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine fluorothymidine F-18 (¹⁸F-FLT) uptake parameters before and after
      radiotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate ¹⁸F-FLT uptake post-radiotherapy scan with pathologic response. II. To
      correlate levels the mitotic index in surgical specimens with the ¹⁸F-FLT uptake in
      post-radiation scans.

      III. To correlate ¹⁸F-FLT uptake both pre- and post-radiotherapy with magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) enhancement both within and around the tumor.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare ¹⁸F-FLT uptake and fludeoxyglucose F-18 (FDG) uptake when FDG-PET-computed
      tomography (CT) is available, pre-radiation, post-radiation, or both.

      II. To compare ¹⁸F-FLT uptake in post-radiation scans with local recurrences looking for
      spatial correlation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fluorothymidine F-18 intravenously (IV) over 1 minute and undergo PET scan
      over 60 minutes 21 or less days prior to standard of care radiation therapy and 14 or less
      days prior to the standard of care surgery.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 2 years.
