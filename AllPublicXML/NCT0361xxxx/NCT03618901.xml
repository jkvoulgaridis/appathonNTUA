  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect on Rock Steady Boxing (RSB) and PD SAFEx on Parkinson's
      disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both interventions produce benefits to the PD population. PD SAFEx has been proven to improve
      the motor symptoms of PD. However, research still needs to be conducted on the PD specific
      benefits associated with RSB. As such it an RCT is necessary to compare the effects of both
      interventions.
