  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effect of topical tetracycline and dexamethasone on periodontal and pulpal
      regeneration of avulsed permanent teeth after an observation period between 9-16 years.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two different medications were applied prior to replantation. A) Topical tetracycline, B)
      topical dexamethasone. Teeth were splinted using a non-rigid titanium trauma splint for 7-14
      days. Endodontic treatment was performed within 1-7 days, except for teeth with an open apex
      and a short extraoral dry time. All patients received systemic tetracycline for 10 days after
      accident and were subsequently re-examined.

      Follow-up examinations included periodontal examination, percussion, Periotest measurements,
      pulp sensitivity using CO2 snow, periapical radiograph and intraoral photographs.
      Additionally a OHIP-14 questionnaire was carried out to determine the oral health-related
      quality of life.
