    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a significant cause of morbidity and
      mortality worldwide. In contrast to other chronic diseases, COPD is increasing in prevalence
      and is projected to be the third-leading cause of death and disability worldwide by 2030. The
      costs to society for treating COPD are high, accounting for approximately 3.4% of the total
      health care budget of the European Union. Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are
      responsible for a large portion of the economic burden of COPD. More than 500,000
      hospitalisations and 100,000 deaths are attributed to AECOPD in the US each year. In addition
      to a substantial economic burden, AECOPD is also responsible for much of the morbidity and
      mortality from COPD.

      Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is an alarmin released from the epithelium following damage. IL-33 is
      an IL-1 family alarmin cytokine constitutively expressed at epithelial barrier surfaces where
      it is rapidly released from cells during tissue injury. IL-33 signals through a receptor
      complex of IL-1 receptor-like 1 (IL1RL1) (known as ST2) and IL-1 receptor accessory protein
      (IL1RAcP) to initiate MyD88-dependent inflammatory pathways. The role of the IL33/ST2 axis in
      COPD is uncertain. IL33 has been implicated in eosinophil recruitment to the airway and
      maturation in the bone marrow largely via its effects upon innate lymphoid cells. IL33
      increased following experimental cold in asthma and thus might play a role in the consequent
      inflammatory response and possible susceptibility to secondary bacterial infection in
      obstructive lung disease. Both eosinophilic inflammation and viral infection drive COPD
      exacerbations and therefore targeting the IL33/ST2 axis might reduce COPD exacerbations.

      The main aim of this trial is to evaluate whether anti-ST2 will impact on airway inflammation
      in COPD and therefore reduce the frequency of exacerbations. For the purposes of this trial,
      exacerbations are defined as flare-ups of symptoms involving the use of healthcare resulting
      in treatment with steroids and/or antibiotics and/or hospitalisation or death due to COPD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel group, randomised
      controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of anti-ST2 compared to placebo, in
      patients with moderate to very severe COPD (GOLD II-IV). Anti-ST2 will be administered via
      subcutaneous injection once every 4 weeks (Week 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, and
      44) during the 48-week treatment period. Participants will be followed up for 60 weeks (i.e.
      48 week treatment period and 12 week follow-up), with secondary outcome measures at baseline,
      4, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 weeks and at exacerbation events presenting prior to treatment
      initiation.

      After signing the informed consent at the initial visit, patients will enter a screening
      period which should last for up to 2 weeks unless extension of the screening period is
      necessary under certain circumstances. Patients who qualify to participate in the study will
      be randomised into a 48-week treatment period in which they will receive either 490 mg
      anti-ST2 or a matching placebo. Patients will be evaluated for an additional 12 weeks
      following completion of the randomised treatment period. Treatment groups will remain blinded
      until the 60-week follow-up period is completed, and trial database is locked.

      This trial is sponsored by the University of Leicester, coordinated by the National Institute
      for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) - Respiratory and Leicester
      Clinical Trials Unit (LCTU) and funded by Genentech, Inc.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of anti-ST2 versus placebo on
      frequency of moderate-to-severe exacerbations (health care utilisation resulting in treatment
      with systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics or hospitalisation, respectively) as add-on
      to standard of care.

      Secondary objectives: another key objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of
      subcutaneous (SC) doses of anti-ST2 compared to placebo in adult patients with moderate to
      very severe COPD.

      Additionally, to assess the effects of anti-ST2 versus placebo both during stable visits and
      at the exacerbation events on the following:

        1. Symptoms

        2. Health status

        3. Lung function

        4. Inflammatory cell differentials i. Sputum cell count ii. Blood cell count

        5. Airway morphometry

        6. Pharmacogenomics

      Exploratory objectives include:

        1. Systemic inflammation

        2. Upper airway inflammation

        3. Airway infection and ecology

        4. Breath volatile organic compound profiling

        5. Quantitative airway geometry and densitometry

        6. Pharmacogenomics

        7. Pharmacokinetics and ADA level

      Subgroup objectives: to evaluate the rate of protocol-defined COPD exacerbations through 48
      weeks treatment period, patient reported outcomes (PROs), and lung functions, by subgroup
      outcomes as detailed below:

        -  Pharmacogenomics response analysis in subgroups determined by SNPs for alleles
           associated with the IL33/ST2 axis.

        -  Baseline blood eosinophil count

        -  Baseline thoracic CT-derived % wall area

    <description>Patient reported outcome (PRO). To evaluate health status; designed to measure health impairment in patients with asthma and COPD. It is in two parts. Part I produces the Symptoms score, and Part 2 the Activity and Impact scores. A Total score is also produced. The Total score is calculated by summing the weights to all the positive responses in each component. The score for each component is calculated separately by dividing the summed weights by the maximum possible weight for that component and expressing the result as a percentage. Maximum possible weights for components: Symptoms (566.2), Activity (982.9), Impacts (1652.8). Total (3201.9, which would represent the worst possible state of the patient.</description>

    <description>Patient reported outcome (PRO). To evaluate health status: evaluation and rehabilitation education guidance on the respiratory and motor functions of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The CAT has a scoring range of 0-40, with Since COPD is a progressive disease, a fi xed target score for all patients cannot be set. In Practice, a target for improvement in individual patient CAT scores may be set, based on an holistic assessment of the patient. A change of 2 units suggests a meaningful difference. This test should be used in conjunction with the mMRC and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) to determine COPD health assessment of participants.</description>

    <description>Patient reported outcome (PRO). To evaluate respiratory breathlessness symptoms (Grade 0-4, with Grade 0 being breathlessness with strenuous exercise to Grade 4 being breathlessness for daily activities like dressing). The mMRC Dyspnea Scale score must be contextualized with an individual patient's history, physical, and available diagnostic test results. For patients with a higher mMRC grade (e.g. ≥2) and clinical circumstances consistent with respiratory disease, measuring spirometry (e.g., FEV₁ and FVC), determining the patient's Body-mass index, airflow Obstruction, Dyspnea, and Exercise (BODE) Index and/or GOLD stage, and pursuing further targeted diagnostic and/or therapeutic interventions is appropriate. A patient's mMRC Dyspnea Scale score, or another dyspnea measurement, such as the COPD Assessment Test (CAT), is combined with the patient's FEV₁ percent predicted and the frequency of COPD exacerbations to guide treatment interventions</description>

    <time_frame>Anytime between screening and week 12, unless patient has had the test within 12 months prior to screening visit.</time_frame>
    <description>To assess lung function, i.e. the functional residual capacity of the lungs. The participant sits inside an airtight box, inhales or exhales to a particular volume (usually FRC), and then a shutter drops across their breathing tube. The participant makes respiratory efforts against the closed shutter, causing their chest volume to expand and decompressing the air in their lungs. The increase in their chest volume slightly reduces the box volume (the non-person volume of the box) and thus slightly increases the pressure in the box. TLC, RV and RV/TLC% will be measured.</description>

    <description>MSTT1041A (RO7187807; formerly made by Amgen [AMG] and referred to as AMG 282) is a novel biopharmaceutical that blocks signaling of interleukin (IL)-33, an inflammatory cytokine of the IL-1 family and member of the newly discovered &quot;alarmin&quot; class of molecules. IL-33 is released from airway epithelial cells in response to allergens, irritants, and infection. IL-33 release can trigger acute exacerbations in both asthma and COPD. MSTT1041A has the ability to block inflammation,prevent exacerbations, and improve lung function and quality of life.
Anti-ST2 is presented as sterile, clear, and colourless to slightly yellow liquid. Each sterile vial is filled with a 1 mL deliverable volume of 70 mg/mL. It is formulated with 15 mM sodium acetate, 9.0% (w/v) sucrose, 0.01% (w/v) polysorbate 20, pH 5.2.</description>

             investigator will affect the study

          2. Patients whose treatment is considered palliative (life expectancy &lt;12 months)

          3. Known hypersensitivity to the active substance of the investigational product (IP) or
             any of the excipients

          4. Known history of anaphylaxis

          5. Patients with a COPD exacerbation and/or pneumonia within the 4 weeks prior to visit 1

          6. Have, in the opinion of investigator, uncontrolled co-morbid conditions, such as
             diabetes mellitus, hypertension and heart failure [e.g. New York Heart Association
             (NYHA) class III (e.g. less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, or
             dyspnoea), and class IV (e.g. Symptoms of heart failure at rest)] that will affect the
             study.

          7. Myocardial infarction, unstable angina or stroke within 12 month prior to screening

          8. Diagnosis of malignancy within 5 years of visit 1 (except for excised localised
             carcinoma of skin not including malignant melanoma)

          9. Clinically significant ECG changes, which in the opinion of investigator warrants
             further investigations

         10. Laboratory abnormalities, which in the opinion of investigator warrants further
             investigations

         11. Have, in the opinion of the investigator, evidence of alcohol, drug or solvent abuse.
