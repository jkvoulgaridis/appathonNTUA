  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate brain reorganization, functional motor
      development, level of daily living activity and quality of life of upper extremity mirror
      therapy in children with spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy. Several studies have reported
      increased use of the affected arm following rearrangement of cerebral re-organization with
      mirror therapy. The investigator's study is the first of its kind and was planned to evaluate
      the effectiveness of upper extremity mirror therapy in cerebral reorganization and functional
      motor skills in children with spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy. Hypothesis of this study is
      that mirror therapy improves brain re-organisation, functional motor skills and daily living
      activities in unilateral spastic CP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common neurodisability in children. It has been defined as a
      disorder of movement and posture due to a defect or lesion of the immature brain and as a
      group of non-progressive, but often changing motor impairment syndromes secondary to lesions
      or anomalies of the brain arising in the early stages of development.

      Characteristically, children with unilateral cerebral palsy (CP) have one well-functioning
      hand and one impaired hand.Common features of the hemiplegic hand are slowness, abnormal
      muscle tone, decreased strength, and coordination difficulties, which occur to a varying
      extent in children independently of age. Many children also have impaired sensibility and
      mirror movements. Perhaps most importantly, children with unilateral CP hav e varying degrees
      of limitation in their ability to handle objects in daily life. This limitation is most
      obvious insituations where two hands are needed. However, knowledge about bimanual ability in
      chil dren with unilateral CP and its development over time is scarce at present.

      To improve upper extremity function in children with unilateral CP, the mirror therapy is a
      promising approach. Mirror therapy for the first time, Ramachandran et al. has described for
      the treatment of phantom pain in amputee. Also in unilateral spastic CP mirror therapy have
      indicated that visual illusion of functional limb provided by mirror can support healing. By
      means of visual feedback, modified vision and perception is stimulated plasticity the
      premotor cortex and developed re-organization. In the current studies, mirror therapy in
      hemiplegic patients, have been shown that improve the function and reduce the sensitivity of
      the hemi neglect. Gygax et al. have investigated the effects of mirror therapy on upper
      extremity function 10 children with unilateral spastic CP between 6-14 years. Consequently,
      the spontaneous use affected hand, the maximum grip force increase of 15% and is demonstrated
      that improve the upper extremity motor function.

    <description>Brain reorganization was assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).Being a non-invasive method, FMRI is nowadays the most common method used to map the neural activity of the human brain. fMRI is also used to describe patterns of cortical activation in children and adults with brain lesions</description>

    <time_frame>change from baseline upper extremity skills at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of upper extremity skills assessment was be assessed by Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test (QUEST). The test evaluates that handcraft and the quality of the movement in children with CP.This is an objective standardized measure evaluating the quality of upper extremity function in 4 domains: dissociated movement, grasp, protective extension, and weight bearing. Scores for the QUEST are calculated as percentages with a maximum score of 100.</description>

    <description>The functional independence assessment was be assessed by Functional Independence Measure (WeeFIM). The Weefim was designed as a basic indicator of severity of disability and to determine the amount of assistance required by children to perform daily living activities on a consistent basisThe subsets are categorized as self-care (six items), sphincter control (two items),transfers (three items), locomotion (two items), communication (two items), and social cognition (three items). Each measurement item of the subsets is scored on a scale of 1- 7, where 1 indicates total assistance and 7 shows complete independence. The minimum total score is 18 (total dependence in all skills) and the maximum score is 126 (complete independence in all skills).</description>

    <description>Health related quality of life was evaluated by the Child Health Questionnaire Parent Form 50 Questions (CHQ-PF50). 50-item parent-completed CHQ (CHQ-PF50), which measures 11 domains of health. Physical domains include the following: physical functioning, role/social limitations as a result of physicalhealth, bodily pain/discomfort, and general health perception.
Psychosocial domains include the following: role/social limitations as a result of emotional-behavioral problems, self-esteem, mental health, general behavior, emotional impact on parent, and time impact on parents. A separate domain measures limitations in family activities. There is also a single-item measure of family cohesion. Scores for the domains and single item range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better HRQL</description>
