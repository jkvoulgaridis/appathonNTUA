  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dyslipidemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events. Statins have become the
      cornerstone for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic vascular diseases. However,
      after the comprehensive control of the traditional risk factors, including unhealthy
      lifestyle, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, hyperglycemia and obesity, there is still a
      high risk of residual cardiovascular disease in patients with dyslipidemia. Triglyceride
      elevation is the most common type of dyslipidemia and constitutes an important component of
      cardiovascular residual risk.

      The geraniol has a variety of pharmacological effects, such as anti-inflammatory,
      antioxidant, regulating cell apoptosis. Recent studies have confirmed that geraniol plays an
      important role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, and may have a synergistic role
      with statins. Gefarnate Tablets is a kind of anti-ulcer and gastritis treatment. It can
      increase the defense ability of gastric mucosa by improving the prostaglandin level and the
      concentration of amino hexose in the gastric mucosa. Geraniol is the main components of
      Gefarnate Tablets. In the previous study, the investigators found that geraniol induced
      autophagy through the SIRT1-AMPK-mTOR pathway and accelerated the degradation of
      triglycerides in liver cells, thus reducing the level of triglyceride in the serum of high
      fat diet mice. 6 patients with hyperlipidemia were received Gefarnate Tablets (100mg/ times,
      3 times per day). A month later, the levels of serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, and low
      density lipoprotein cholesterol were decreased significantly. However, the above results need
      to be confirmed by the larger clinical research.

      Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Gefarnate Tablets on blood
      lipid levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and coronary heart disease treated with
      statins, provide more options for the treatment of lipid lowering treatment, reduce the risk
      of cardiovascular remnant, and improve the long-term prognosis of the coronary heart disease
      patients with residual hypertriglyceridemia.
