    <textblock>
      This study tests the feasibility and acceptability of a physical activity intervention that
      combines use of a wearable activity monitor with a scrapbook. Half of the participants will
      receive this enhanced intervention, while the other half will receive a wearable activity
      monitor with a standard step log.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women breast cancer survivors could benefit from increased physical activity but are in need
      of greater motivation to be active. Interventions that use wearable activity monitors and
      mobile apps have shown promise in the short-term, but use drops off over time. Reports have
      suggested that users find the step data provided to be unclear and not very personally
      meaningful. The ultimate purpose of this line of research is to test whether enhanced
      motivational feedback, using scrapbooks, can increase motivation for activity. The scrapbooks
      will target integrated regulation, which is a type of motivation related to personal identity
      and values. Participants who receive this intervention will draw their step graph, add
      photographs and stickers an explanations to the graph, and answer reflection questions daily.
      Before testing the effects of this intervention on physical activity, the investigators must
      first ensure that the materials and procedures are feasible and acceptable. This small pilot
      study will allow the research team to iteratively test scrapbook materials and improve upon
      them for use in future studies. The investigators will compare an intervention using the
      enhanced materials to an intervention using only the wearable device, app, and a standard
      step log without scrapbook or reflection components. In addition to the primary outcome of
      feasibility (use of the scrapbook), the investigators will also explore the effects of the
      intervention on steps, motivational and values-related outcomes, and various aspects of
      feasibility and acceptability.
