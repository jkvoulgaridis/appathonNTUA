  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pelvic pain is a serious health condition with an estimated prevalence of 15% women
      worldwide.Treatment is a challenge given the different pain generators described. It is
      important to develop self-management interventions to reduce the frustration associated with
      its management.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pelvic pain is defined as non-cyclic pain lasting for 6 or more months, that
      localizes to the anatomic pelvis, anterior abdominal wall at or below the umbilicus, the
      lumbosacral back, or the buttocks and is of sufficient severity to cause functional
      disability or lead to medical care. It can occur continuously or intermittently, with
      intensity severe enough to limit activities of daily living. It is frequent in women. The
      primary aim of this study isto evaluate the efficacy of a self-management intervention, as
      compared with an educational booklet in improving health-related quality of life and coping
      strategies, occupational performance, activity level and psycho-emotional symptoms in women
      with chronic pelvic pain.

    <time_frame>Change from baseline health-related quality of life at 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life will be assessed using the EuroQol-5D. This scale consists of a descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale. The descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, oain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, extreme problems. Higher scores indicate more problems. In the visual analogue scale the patient rate the pain from 100 (best imaginable health state) to 0 (worst imaginable health state). Higher values represent a better health state.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in coping strategies</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline coping strategies at 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Coping strategies will be evaluated using the Coping Strategies Questionnaire (CSQ). It assesses eight different coping strategies for pain which describe two types of coping: adaptive coping (diverting Attention, coping self-statements, ignoring sensations, reinterpreting pain sensation, hoping and cognitive distracting) and maladaptive coping (catastrophizing, and faithing and praying). Participants score each item using a 7-point scale to indicate how often they use that strategy to manage their pain (0 never, 3 sometimes, and 6 always)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in performance of activities</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline self-perceived performance at 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Canadian Occupational Performance Measure will be used to evaluate changes in patient's self-perception over time including performance and satisfaction scored from 0 to 10. Higher values represented improvement on perceived performance and satisfaction</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in activity levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline self-reported activity levels at 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Activity levels will be evaluated with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. It assess the frequency and time spent on vigorous, moderate-intensity activities and walking time for each category. Higher values indicate higher activity levels.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in anxiety levels.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline anxious symptoms at 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety will be evaluated using the Beck Anxiety Inventory. It contains 21 questions, each answer being scored on a scale value of 0 (not at all) to 3 (severely). Higher total scores indicate more severe anxiety symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline depressive symptoms at 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Depression will be evaluated using the Beck Depression Inventory. It contains 21 questions, each answer being scored on a scale value of 0 (not at all) to 3 (severely). Higher total scores indicate severe depressive symptoms.</description>
