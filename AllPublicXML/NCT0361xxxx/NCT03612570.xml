  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, open label, muti-center study evaluates the use of Nano-Pulse Stimulation
      (NPS) in the treatment of Sebaceous Hyperplasia (SH) lesions less than 2.5mm in size.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed with each subject serving as his or her own control. A total of up to
      75 subjects with 2-5 qualifying SH lesions will be enrolled and treated with either a 1.5-mm
      x 1.5-mm or 2.5-mm x 2.5-mm tip. One lesion will be randomized as a untreated control and no
      NPS energy will be delivered. All treated lesions will receive at least one NPS treatment and
      evaluated at 30 days for lesion clearance. Initial lesions scored as Not Clear or Partially
      Clear may undergo a second NPS treatment. All subjects will have their lesions evaluated at
      60 days post-primary or secondary treatment.

    <description>NPS utilizes a timed series of low energy, high voltage nanosecond (billionth of a second) pulses which are applied directly to targeted tissue using small microneedles. NPS energy induces cell signaling and the activation of cellular pathways by creating transient nanopores in cellular membranes and organelles and initiate regulated cell death.</description>
