  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric submucosal tumors (SMTs) are rare findings during routine upper endoscopy; the
      incidence of these lesions may be as high as 0.4%.SMTs display a wide spectrum,ranging from
      benign to highly malignant, with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) being the most
      common type.SMTs is a gastrointestinal tumor,surgical operation is still the main method of
      gastric tumor treatment.The common surgical methods for resection of SMTs include laparotomy
      and laparoscopic surgery.In recent years, the Da Vinci robot assisted gastric resection has
      become a new way to treat gastric cancer. Compared with the traditional laparoscopy and
      laparotomy, the operation of the robot is more precise and flexible, with obvious advantages
      of minimally invasive and good application value and prospect.In recent years, some scholars
      have put forward the concept of the third space.The concept of the &quot;third space&quot; was
      initiatively proposed at the same time when new endoscopic surgery approach via natural
      orifice transluminal was put forward(NOTES). To be specific, with respect to the first
      space(lumen) and second space(peritoneal cavity),the third space refers to the intramural
      space.The aim of the study is to compare value (outcomes/costs) of surgery in patients with
      SMTs by 2 approaches:Laparoscopic and Endoscopic cooperative surgery(LECS),Robotic and
      Endoscopic cooperative surgery(RECS).First of all, the investigators will collect 80 cases of
      SMTs patients, randomly assigned for the LECS and RECS groups. Secondly, to analyzing the
      demographic data,basic treatment and follow-up data, including the operation time, blood
      loss, the number of cut edge positive, the distances of cut edge away from the tumor edge,
      average such confinement, the meal time, cost of treatment, tumor recurrence rate, the
      presence of residual stomach, upset stomach and frequency,complications and other indicators.
