  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is an emergent disease to treat as soon as
      possible. 2017 ESC guidelines for the management of STEMI recommend using radial approach
      (RA) rather than femoral approach (FA) to reduce mortality and bleeding complications if the
      operators are expert for RA. Recently, Ferdinand Kiemeneij reported that distal radial
      approach (DRA) could be a feasible and safe route for coronary angiography (CAG) and
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in 70 patients. The right-handed patient could feel
      more comfortable in left DRA than right RA. Left DRA also could provide a better comfortable
      position for the operator compared to left RA. Distal radial artery is located around the
      anatomical snuffbox, which doesn't contain nerve and vein beside artery. Therefore, the
      possibility of procedure-related complications such as nerve injury or arteriovenous fistula
      is very low. Also, the superficial location of DRA could make easier hemostasis. There were
      no vascular-related complications from the report of Kiemeneij. But, the rate of puncture
      failure was 11%, which was higher than RA-based study (5.34% in STEMI patients of RIVAL
      trial, 6% in RIFLESTEACS trial and 5.8% in MATRIX trial). Nevertheless, this study was a
      pilot study with a small number of patients. There is no clinical study to compare the
      feasibility and safety for CAG and PCI between DRA and RA in patients with STEMI. Therefore,
      this study aimed to evaluate whether DRA is feasible and safe compared to RA in STEMI
      setting.
