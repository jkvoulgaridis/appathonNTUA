  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this ancillary study is to examine cardiorespiratory fitness, cognitive
      factors related to appetite, and objectively-measured food intake in a subsample of children
      and adolescents with overweight to severe obesity enrolled in the TIGER Kids prospective
      cohort. The primary study also collects data on habitual physical and sedentary activity,
      body weight and body composition, and cardiometabolic health markers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will enroll 30 boys and girls (50% female) between the ages of 10-16 years
      and above the 85th BMI percentile (i.e., overweight to severe obesity) in this pilot
      ancillary study. The objective is to examine interactions between the following
      energy-balance related factors:

        1. Ad libitum post-exercise food intake

        2. Cognitive factors, including inhibitory control, food wanting, and motivation for food

        3. Exercise-related factors, including cardiorespiratory fitness, substrate utilization
           (carbohydrate versus fat), and perceived exertion

        4. Habitual physical and sedentary activity

        5. Body composition and cardiometabolic health

      The prospective, longitudinal nature of the study will allow the investigators to examine
      these variables cross-sectionally and quantify change over two years. Of particular interest
      is whether cognitive factors related to energy balance, including perceived exertion,
      inhibitory control, food wanting, and food motivation, vary across time or are relatively
      stable. Finally, the investigators will assess the ability of these factors to predict
      changes in body composition and cardiometabolic health over two years.

    <description>The Three Factor Eating Questionnaire - Revised 18-item version 2 (TFEQ-R18v2) consists of three appetite-related subscales: Cognitive Restraint, Emotional Eating, and Uncontrolled Eating. Subscales are scored on a range from 0-100, with higher scores representing higher levels of that construct.</description>

        This study will identify and recruit 30 participants from the TIGER Kids primary study
        sample of 340 participants. Ancillary participants will be between the ages of 10-16 years
        and above the 85th age- and sex-specific BMI percentile (i.e., overweight to severe
        obesity). We will have an even distribution of boys (n=15) and girls (n=15) and aim to have
        a representative distribution of race.
