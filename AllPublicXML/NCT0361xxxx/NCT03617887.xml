  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The problems of lack of lumbo-pelvic stability, as well as weakness or mobile restriction of
      the adductor muscles, may be the origin of lower limb injuries. Both intrinsic and extrinsic
      factors are key in the probability of suffering an imbalance. A protocol of abdominal
      isometric strength, accompanied by specific exercises of the gluteus medius, can be useful in
      order to prevent such dysfunctions.

      The objective is to compare the efficacy of abdominal isometric work against the specific
      work of gluteus medius in the improvement of lumbo-pelvic stability and strength and
      elasticity of the adductor muscles.

      Study design. Randomized, longitudinal, experimental, prospective, multicentre and
      single-blind clinical trial. It will take place at the facilities of the Soccer Club
      Fuenlabrada S. A. D. and the European University of Madrid.

      The subjects will be randomly divided into two groups: control group and experimental group.
      The intervention period will last eight weeks, performing 2 weekly sessions, of approximately
      20 minutes (depending on the group to which each subject belongs). The variables to be
      evaluated before and after the intervention will be the lumbo-pelvic stability and the
      strength and elasticity of the adductor muscles. For the statistical analysis, the SPSS
      program version 19.0 will be used.

      It is expected to find how gluteal work produces improvements in lumbo-pelvic stability, as
      well as an increase in strength and adduction elasticity.

      Each session will last 20 minutes, taking place during 2 days a week, in a period of 8 weeks.
      The intervention will be carried out at the beginning of the training session. This
      intervention consists of an abdominal work protocol, and a gluteal work protocol added to the
      previous protocol, performed by the control group and the experimental group, respectively.

The intervention consisted of sessions of approximately 20 minutes, taking place 2 days a week, for 8 weeks. The exercises were performed at the beginning of the training session, and consisted of a work of the abdominal region in the control group, and a specific work of gluteus medius, added to the previous one, in the experimental group.</description>
