  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a potentially fatal disease
      with a reported lethality of up to 40% that is under tight epidemiologic control by the World
      Health Organization (WHO) and currently without registered prevention or treatment option.

      In this phase I first-in-human clinical trial, healthy volunteers in two different dose
      cohorts will be vaccinated twice with the candidate vaccine MVA-MERS-S. A subgroup will
      additionally receive a late booster vaccination.

      The aim of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of the candidate vaccine and to
      characterize its immunogenicity.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vaccine contains a Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara (MVA) vector expressing the MERS-CoV
      spike glycoprotein (S). A total of 24 participants will receive the following vaccine regime:

      12 participants will receive 10^7 plaque-forming units (PFU) of MVA-MERS-S on days 0 and 28.

      12 participants will receive 10^8 PFU of MVA-MERS-S on days 0 and 28.

      Safety and immunogenicity data will be collected throughout the study, which concludes at day
      180.

      Update March 2019: A subgroup of participants from both dose cohorts will receive a late
      booster immunization of 10^8 PFU MVA-MERS-S 9 months (+/- 4 months) after prime immunization.
