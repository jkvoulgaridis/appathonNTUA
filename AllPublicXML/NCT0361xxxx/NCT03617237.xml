  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Registry database repository for determining clinical outcomes primarily of patients who have
      received or have been evaluated for radiation treatment in either the definitive or
      palliative setting for both malignant and benign etiologies.

      To compare the outcomes with National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) of the American College of
      Surgeon(ACS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigator will retrospectively collect and evaluate information from patients with cancer
      or benign etiologies to improve future clinical outcomes and help identify prospective
      outcomes study questions. This information will include patients' name, medical record
      number, medical history, diagnosis, treatment, laboratory test results, diagnostic test
      results, pathology reports, therapeutic and nontherapeutic results, surgical results,
      radiology results, radiation therapy details (dose, techniques, toxicity), concurrent use of
      chemotherapy/systemic therapy, quality of life outcomes,cachexia status, and primarily last
      follow-up data. All information will be collected after their standard of care visits.

    <description>The quality of life questionnaire will be used as a standardized instrument to measure the health outcome.Its provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status. The US version of the EQ-5D will be used, to enable mapping of general HR-QOL scores from EQ-5D scores into health state utility scores (ranging from 0 to 100) for the US population.Analyses will be performed for all subjects having received treatment for benign and cancer tumors. Information gained from this could lead to improved medical care for them. By performing comparative study for subgroups of patients with similar diseases but not treated with radiation therapy, potential benefits and risks of radiation therapy may be better delineated.</description>

    <description>All patients who are currently treated by any physician at the University of Texas Southwestern campus Aston Clinic, Seay Clinic, PHHS Clinic, Moncrief Radiation Oncology, St. Paul West Campus Radiation Oncology, East Radiation Oncology Clinic will be included in the registry. The data from the charts will be entered into a password protected excel spreadsheet. The charts will be identified by name, medical record number, date of birth, and social security number.
The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects.
The waiver will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects.
The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver.
Whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information after participation.</description>

        Risk will be minimized by protecting patient data through the use of deidentification of
        patient identifiers and password protected data collection. The information will be given
        only to faculty members and statisticians involved in the research project. The information
        will include the parameters attached in the spreadsheet supplied with the IRB submission.
        The data will be disclosed only for analytical purposes.Confidentiality will be maintained
        by adhering to HIPAA guidelines. Only the PI and other study team members will have access
        to that data.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Any patient who received or was potentially evaluated for radiotherapy since 2000 for
        benign or malignant etiologies in the definitive or palliative setting.

        Patients with comparatively similar diagnosis and disease status at UTSW, but electing not
        to undergo radiation therapy, treated with surgical or systemic therapy, or best supportive
        care, being followed by an oncology specialist at UT Southwestern Medical Center will also
        be eligible for evaluation. -
