  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective cohort survey study is to further explore the incidence of
      adverse events with dry needling by physical therapists - as well as any differences or
      similarities between patient-reported vs therapist-reported incidence of AEs.

      The study design will comprise of an observational study, where practicing clinicians will
      log data from dry needling sessions and patients will report via online surveys. Clinician
      logs will be collected weekly via an online REDCap survey . Patients will be instructed to
      complete an online REDCap survey in the event that an adverse event occurs. Data will be
      collected for a period of 4 mo.

      Descriptive statistics will be used to calculate frequencies of various AE's and rates of
      occurrence per 100 treatments. Adverse events will be classified on how frequently they
      occur, ranging from very common (&gt;1/10 treatments) to very rare (&lt;1/10,000 treatments).

      The investigators will then examine for differences between patient-reported and
      clinician-reported incidences and also explore for any correlations between adverse events
      and other various reported factors.
