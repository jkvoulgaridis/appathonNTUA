  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastro-intestinal (GI) cancer is becoming the top-ranked high mortality cancer in recent
      years. Every year, approximate 5,300,000 people in China are diagnosed with cancer, of which
      about 2,000,000 die each year, and esophagus cancer, gastric cancer and colorectal cancer
      account for ~50% of all GI cancer cases. GI cancer causes 500 thousand deaths a year. In
      China, nearly 85% of patients with cancer of the digestive tract are in middle to late stage
      at diagnosis. Regardless of the treatment, the five year survival rate is only 36%. GI
      cancers include cancer in the oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine
      (duodenum, jejunum, ileum) and large intestine (cecum, colon, rectum). The main malignant
      tumors of the GI tract are esophageal, gastric, colorectal, liver, and pancreatic cancer.

      Adoptive immunotherapy based on cytotoxic T lymphocytes reactive with specific antigens has
      proven to be effective in many studies. In vitro induction of cancer antigen-specific immune
      cells and genetic engineering of target specific immune cells have great potential for cancer
      eradication. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ex vivo manipulated EIE
      cells including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modified immune cells in treating cancer. The
      primary study objectives are to evaluate the safety of the investigational product,
      autologous EIE cells, to subjects by intravenous and intratumoral injections. The secondary
      study objectives are (1) to evaluate the success rate of generating autologous EIE cells ex
      vivo, and (2) to determine the anti-cancer efficacy of the EIE cells.

    <description>Objective response (complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)) are assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria. CR is disappearance of all lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Partial response is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>
