  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) accounts for 2% of National Health Service (NHS) expenditure, and 5% of
      emergency hospitalisations. Patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) are
      older, have more comorbidities, have similarly poor or worse outcomes compared to patients
      with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and currently lack an evidence base for treatment.
      The investigators hypothesise that outcomes of patients with HFpEF can be improved through
      optimised management and self-management of comorbidities, fluid status and lifestyle
      delivered in primary care in collaboration with specialists. The primary aim is to develop a
      programme of optimised management by improving understanding of needs and experiences of
      patients with HFpEF, clinical decision-making and management in primary care, and integrating
      research findings with patient and clinical expertise. The main objective for this work
      package is to identify patients with HFpEF in primary care and assess comorbidities and other
      factors, management, morbidity and mortality at one year. The methodology employed will be a
      longitudinal cohort study of 270 patients with HFpEF in primary care followed for 12 months.

      This work package of the study will use phenotyping and one-year follow-up of a community
      recruited cohort of patients with HFpEF or probable HFpEF to understand the characteristics
      and needs of this patient group. It involves a longitudinal cohort study conducted to
      identify patients with HFpEF in primary care and assess comorbidities, lifestyle factors,
      frailty, self-management, symptoms, quality of life, cognitive function, types of care
      received, management of risk factors and comorbidities, and one year morbidity and mortality.
      This will inform particular areas for assessment and management/self-management in the
      optimised programme. The investigators will also apply to NHS Digital who are the data
      controllers of Hospital Episode Statistics to check if participants have had any hospitals
      visits throughout the duration of the study.

    <description>A cohort of participants with suspected stable HFpEF will be recruited from the primary care setting. HFpEF diagnosis will be confirmed as per the 2016 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for diagnosing HFpEF. All participants will undergo a series of assessments including but not limited to pulse wave velocity, 6 minute walk test, blood tests including natriuretic peptides (NT-Pro-BNP), ECG, physical assessments and a series of questionnaires. Those with confirmed HFpEF will be followed up at 6 and 12 months.</description>
