  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic sleep deprivation among adolescents is a prevalent health problem across the world
      and is associated with a series of short and long term consequences. However, effective
      interventions targeting on this vulnerable adolescent population is very limited. Majority of
      the previous sleep education programme are conducted in a school context which personal
      factors and individualized problems were not addressed. In addition, failure to address
      &quot;knowledge-action gap&quot; may also explain why individual fail to enact health behaviors even
      holding positive motivation. In regard to this, investigators proposed an active and
      person-oriented protocol with the aid of advanced technology in order to improve adolescent
      sleep health.

      This study will conduct a randomized control trial to evaluate the effectiveness of
      group-based sleep intervention using motivational interviewing plus text reminders in
      changing adolescent sleep deprivation problem with both subjective and objective
      measurements. The intervention will consists of 4 weekly group therapy targeting on
      adolescent with school day sleep duration less than 7 hours.

    <measure>Change of Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week, 3 month and 6 month after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>KIDSCREEN-27 health questionnaire for children and young people for the measurement of quality of life by rating 27 items related to general health on a 5 point Likert scale.
There are five subscales on: physical well-being (possibly scored from 5 to 25), psychological well-being (possibly scored 7 to 35), autonomy &amp; parents (possibly scored 7 to 35), peers &amp; social support (possibly scored 4 to 20), and school environment (possibly scored 4 to 20). A grand total score can be calculated by summing up the five sub scores. In all cases, a higher score represents higher perceived well-being.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week, 3 month and 6 month after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Adolescent Sleep Hygiene Scale (ASHS): It is a 28-item instrument used to assess how adolescent apply sleep hygiene practice. total score range from 28 to 168 with higher score indicates better sleep practice. The instrument assessed adolescent sleep practice in nine domains: physiological(5 items, score 5-30), cognitive(6 items, score: 6 to 36), emotional(3 items; score: 3-18), sleep environment(4 items; score: 4-24), daytime sleep(1 items; score 1-6), substance(2 items; score: 2 to 12), bedtime routine(1 items; score:1-6), sleep stability(4 items; score: 4 to 16) and bedroom sharing(2 items; score 2-12).</description>

    <description>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a self-assessed scale for detecting states of depression and anxiety. The depression subscale range in scores from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating severer states of depression. Similarly, the anxiety subscale range in scores from 0-21 with higher scores indicating severer states of anxiety. No additional computation will be made with the two subscores.</description>
