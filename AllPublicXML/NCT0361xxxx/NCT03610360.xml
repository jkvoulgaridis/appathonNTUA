    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the overall survival (OS) rate (determined from the time of
      randomization in the study) of subjects who receive dendritic cell immunotherapy with
      MesoPher plus best supportive care (BSC) compared to BSC alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized Phase II/III study in adult subjects with mesothelioma to
      evaluate the efficacy and anti-tumor activity of dendritic cell immunotherapy with MesoPher
      plus best supportive care compared to best supportive care alone. The safety, tolerability,
      quality of life and immunogenicity of MesoPher will also be evaluated.

      The study includes a screening phase, a 7 month open-label treatment phase during which
      subjects visit the study center for administration of study drug and follow-up evaluations.
      An end-of-study (EoS) visit will be performed after completion of the study, after which data
      on survival, subsequent therapies and response to these therapies will be collected.

      A target of 230 subjects satisfying all study criteria, will be randomized to receive either
      dendritic cell therapy plus best supportive care (Arm A) or best supportive care alone (Arm
      B).

      Subjects in Arm A will undergo leukapheresis to obtain monocytes from which dendritic cells
      will be generated. These dendritic cells will be loaded in vitro with an allogeneic tumor
      cell lysate (PheraLys). Treatment with autologous dendritic cells loaded with PheraLys is
      called MesoPher. The treatment with Mesopher will start within 9 to 13 weeks after the last
      dose of chemotherapy. Subjects will receive 3 bi-weekly injections with MesoPher in addition
      to BSC. In case of stable disease or partial/complete response, an additional 2 injections
      will be given at weeks 18 and 30. Subjects will be administered with a maximum of 5 doses of
      MesoPher.

      Subjects in Arm B will be treated with best supportive care according to the discretion of
      the local investigator.
