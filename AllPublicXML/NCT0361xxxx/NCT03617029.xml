  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, the development of low-dose pulmonary computed tomography screening has led
      to the discovery of many small pulmonary nodules in the early stages.

      Surgical resection is still the main treatment for those suspected malignant lesions. In the
      face of such small pulmonary nodules, accurate preoperative localization has become the key
      to successful resection, and the deep-seated nodules are the most challenging parts. Because
      the deep-seated nodules cannot be localized by surface dye injection, however, it is
      necessary to place a fiducial marker (such as a microcoil) or contrast medium injection in
      combination with intraoperative fluoroscopy to ensure adequate resection of the deep-seated
      nodules. . This study will be carried out at the Hsinchu Branch of National Taiwan University
      Hospital. It is expected that 60 patients with pulmonary nodules with a depth larger than 2
      cm will be randomly assigned into two groups. One group will receive microcoil placement, and
      the other group will receive contrast medium injection. The primary goal of the study was to
      compare the localization duration of the two groups of patients, the total dose of radiation
      exposure during localization and the incidence of location-related complications, and the
      secondary goals were the results of the surgical procedure, including the surgical duration.
