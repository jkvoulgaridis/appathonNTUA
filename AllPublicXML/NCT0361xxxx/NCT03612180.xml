  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study will evaluate the plasma pharmacokinetics of metoprolol in a cohort of 8
      adult volunteers who are receiving regular hemodialysis treatment (HD) 3 days a week for 4
      hours each day and have been taking a total daily dose of 25-200 mg of metoprolol succinate
      for &gt;30 days as part of their usual care. Blood sampling will occur over 10 hours, with
      frequent sampling during HD and in the 4 hours after termination of HD treatment. The 8
      subjects will all receive their prescribed dose (25-200 mg total daily dose) 2 hours prior to
      HD treatment. The pre-HD sample will also be sent for pharmacogenomics genotyping. Safety and
      pharmacodynamic assessments (blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) assessments) will be
      performed throughout the study. Axiom Precision Medicine Research Array (Affymetrix, Santa
      Clara, CA) will be used to evaluate genotype of CYP2D6. CYP2D6 phenotype will be evaluated
      using the ratio of parent drug to metabolite. Non-compartmental analyses will be performed to
      compare maximum concentrations (Cmax), time to maximum concentration and area under the curve
      from time 0 to the last measurable sample (AUClast) between the two phases. Compartmental
      analyses will be performed to construct a model to explain time-dependent changes in
      metoprolol clearance. Monte Carlo simulations will be performed to compare metoprolol
      pharmacokinetic profiles on and off HD.
