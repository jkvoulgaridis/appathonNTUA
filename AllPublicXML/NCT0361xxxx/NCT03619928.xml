    <textblock>
      Introduction: Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is a common myogenic condition considered
      to be a muscle tension injury frequently observed in recreational or experienced athletes,
      induced in the majority of cases by eccentric and inactive exercises, the most common of
      which are: tension, pain and impairment muscular and have a course of typical duration of 24
      hours and peak between 48 and 72 hours. Among the treatments proposed with the aim of
      reducing the symptoms of DOMS is massage therapy. However, dry needling is a relatively new
      technique that has been used in myotendinous lesions and its effects on late muscle pain have
      not yet been studied. Objective: To compare the impact of dry needling and massage therapy on
      exercise tolerance, and analgesia of sedentary individuals with late muscle pain induced by
      eccentric exercise. The present study is characterized as a randomized and blinded
      comparative study in which male sedentary individuals will be invited in which the late
      muscle pain will be induced through eccentric contractions and will receive different
      treatments: dry needling or massage therapy. The upper limb functionality, pain perception,
      superficial hyperemia and brachial biceps thickness will be compared through the exams:
      visual analogue pain scale (VAS), digital algometry, thermography, ultrasonography and
      isometric test.

    <description>Procedure in which a thin needle is used to penetrate the skin, subcutaneous tissues and muscle with the intention of mechanically stimulating the tissue without the use of an anesthetic. The physiological mechanism supporting the effects of dry needling remains to be clarified. It has been suggested that the needle works according to the pain gate control theory, indicating that one type of sensory input could be inhibited in the Central nervous system by another input</description>

    <description>Among the therapeutic approaches for DOMS is massage therapy. Several authors have examined the effects of DOMS massage and indirect markers of muscle damage, such as impaired muscle function, edema and muscle changes in blood proteins.</description>

    <description>20 minutes through a sterile, disposable Dong Bang® needle size of 0.25X30 mm. At the moment of insertion of the needle, the therapist will perform a muscular shortening around the application site, in a pincer movement performed by the index and thumb fingers, in order to isolate the muscle fibers of the biceps brachii. Five needles will be applied to the short head brachii biceps in five points: origin, insertion, center of the muscular womb (60% of the distance from the medial acromion to the cubital fossa in the elbow line) and two points equidistant from the center 2 cm.</description>

    <description>A 20-minute massage will be applied to the non-dominant upper limb exercised by a therapist for the massage condition. The massage will consist of: 1) surface slip; 2) deep slip; 3) kneading; 4) friction with the thumbs; 5) friction with four fingers; 6) percussions with open and alternating hands; 7) percussions with open and simultaneous hands; 8) tapping; and 9) surface slip.</description>
