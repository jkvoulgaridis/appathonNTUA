      This project aims to investigate the relationship between radiation-induced the relationship
      between elevated peripheral blood TGFβ and complications of radiotherapy,and to analysis of
      changes in peripheral blood TGFβ levels after abdominal radiotherapy and its relationship
      with radiotherapy complications.Simultaneously,Patients who underwent abdominal radiotherapy
      were given captopril (sustained release) to block TGFβ,Whether it can reduce peripheral blood
      TGFβ levels and reduce radiotherapy complications,to explore the protective effect of
      blocking TGFβ secretion on normal tissues after radiotherapy.
