  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale behind this RCT is to assess within 24 hours after surgery the quality of
      recovery of prostatectomy patients treated with 3 different analgesia concepts
      (intraoperative spinal analgesia, transversus abdominis plane block, intravenous lidocaine
      administration) using the quality of recovery (QoR) 15 questionnaire.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostatectomy (open or robotic assisted) is a major urological surgery, which is associated
      with relevant acute postoperative pain. Perioperative analgesic techniques aiming at
      optimizing postoperative analgesia have to be investigated. Optimal postoperative pain
      management is one of the key factors leading to enhanced recovery after surgery. Optimal
      analgesia should aim for optimized patient comfort, fast functional recovery with the fewest
      side effects thus encouraging the DREAMS concept (DRinking, EAting, Mobilizing and Sleeping).

      The perioperative additional use of a spinal single shot analgesia, or a transversus
      abdominis plane block to general anaesthesia are validated options to enhance pain therapy
      compared to systemic analgesia alone. However, if the impact on pain scores has been
      described previously, the impact on the quality of recovery (QoR) is still unclear. Using the
      assessment of QoR allows for a much more objective and broader assessment of the quality of
      the postoperative treatment. Indeed, patient's perioperative experience cannot be only
      focused on pain scores but should involve items like physical independence, patient support,
      comfort, emotion. All these items are included in already validated QoR questionnaires like
      the QoR 15 or QoR 40.

      The rationale behind this randomized, parallel group, single centre, interventional, active
      controlled trial is to assess with the QoR 15questionnaire within 24 hours after surgery the
      quality of recovery of prostatectomy patients treated with 3 different analgesia concepts.

    <description>Changes in Quality of Recovery using the validated 15 items quality of recovery (QoR-15) score : QoR is a patient reported outcome short questionnaire that measure the quality of recovery after surgery and anaesthesia. It incorporates 5 dimensions of health (patient support, comfort, emotions, physical independence, pain). This is a shortened validated version of the QoR 40 including 15 items. QoR-15, with a score range from 0 to 150, is easy to perform. Recently a meta-analysis showed that QoR 15 fulfils requirements for outcome measurement instruments.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive a spinal analgesia (group SSS) with a single shot of bupivacaine 0.5% combined with fentanyl intrathecally during induction of anaesthesia. The technique used is referred to daily practice.
All patients included in the study will receive the same postoperative multimodal analgesia starting at the end of surgery with the following regimen: 30 mg ketorolac 3* per day for 48 hours intravenously and 1 gr 4* per day metamizol intravenously or per oral, depending of the return of bowel function as baseline analgesia during length of hospitalization.
Additional rescue analgesia will be provided and consisted in boluses of 25 mcg fentanyl intravenously (first 24 hours) and thereafter 5-10 mg oxycodone tablets (per oral administration).
