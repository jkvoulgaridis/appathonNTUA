  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial that tests the effectiveness of a novel
      intervention called the Push-Pull-Hold program on improving self-care in patients with heart
      failure. This intervention was developed based on our previous quantitative and qualitative
      findings and existing psychological concepts. Results would inform current understanding of
      the intention-behavior link in self-care and inform future policy and intervention
      development to improve patient and caregiver outcomes.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Self-Care of Heart Failure Index (SCHFI) maintenance subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>weeks 1, 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>SCHFI maintenance subscale is a 10-item, self-administered instrument that measures self-care maintenance behaviours such as medication adherence. Each item of the instrument is rated on a 4-point Likert scale and each subscale score is rescaled to range from 0 to 100 where a score of more than or equal to 70 represents adequate self-care.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the Consideration of Future Consequences Scale (CFCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>weeks 1, 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>CFCS is a 14-items self-administered instrument that measures the degree to which one considers about and is influenced by the potential consequences of their present behaviours. Each item is measured using a 7-point Likert scale where 1 represents extremely uncharacteristic and 7 represents extremely characteristic of the participant. The average scores of the items will be calculated, where a higher score indicates a higher consideration of future consequences.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in intention to change behaviours</measure>
    <time_frame>weeks 1, 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Intention will be measured using a self-developed 3-item, self-administered instrument. Responses will be measured on a 7-point Likert scale where a higher score indicates a higher intention to change behaviours.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the Self-Report Habit Index (SRHI)</measure>
    <time_frame>weeks 1, 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>SRHI is a 12-items, self-administered instrument that measures automaticity; behaviour frequency; and self-identity on a 7-point Likert scale. Scores will be averaged and a higher score indicates higher habit strength.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>weeks 1, 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>MAAS is a 15-items, self-administered instrument measured on a 6-point Likert scale. A mean score will be computed and a higher score indicates higher level of mindfulness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>weeks 1, 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>MLHFQ is a 21-items, self-administered instrument measured on a 6-point Likert scale and includes components of physical, emotional, social and mental dimensions of quality of life. Scores will be summed up and ahigher score indicates poorer quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in readmission</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Measures the changes in readmission incidences.</description>
