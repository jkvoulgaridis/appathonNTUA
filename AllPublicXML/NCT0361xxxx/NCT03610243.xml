      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a patient-centered self-administered acupressure
      intervention on fatigue, sleep quality, pain, fatigue-sleep disturbance-pain symptom cluster
      severity, psychological distress, and health-related quality of life among Chinese advanced
      cancer patients.

      HYPOTHESIS TO BE TESTED: Upon intervention completion, the intervention group will exhibit
      lower levels of fatigue, pain, fatigue-sleep disturbance-pain symptom cluster severity, and
      psychological distress and higher levels of sleep quality and health-related quality of life
      than the wait-list control group.

      DESIGN and SUBJECTS: A randomized wait-list controlled trial with intervention and wait-list
      control groups. A total of 30 Chinese advanced cancer patients who screen positive for
      moderate/severe fatigue with symptoms of insomnia and/or pain will be recruited.

      STUDY INSTRUMENTS: Chinese versions of the Brief Fatigue Inventory, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
      Index, Brief Pain Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Functional Assessment of
      Cancer Therapy - General, and a demographic questionnaire.

      INTERVENTION: A 4-week patient-centered self-administered acupressure intervention comprising
      17.5 hours of individual training and self-practice.

      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary: fatigue. Secondary: sleep quality, pain, fatigue-sleep
      disturbance-pain symptom cluster severity, psychological distress, health-related quality of
      life, actigraphy.

      DATA ANALYSIS: Linear mixed-effects models to assess between-group differences in outcome
      measures post-intervention and changes between data collection points, as well as whether the
      between-group differences vary across time.

      EXPECTED RESULTS: The proposed patient-centered self-administered acupressure intervention is
      useful for alleviating the fatigue and related symptoms experienced by Chinese advanced
      cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence and impacts of fatigue and related symptoms in cancer patients have been
      clearly demonstrated in the literature, which also emphasizes the need for evidence-based
      interventions targeting symptom management in such advanced patients. The main challenge is
      identifying an intervention that is not only effective in managing cancer-related symptoms
      but is also feasible, acceptable, and safe for this patient group. The proposed study aims to
      test the effects of a patient-centered self-administered acupressure intervention on fatigue
      management for Chinese advanced cancer patients using the robust study design of a
      randomized, wait-list controlled trial.

    <description>The questionnaire will be used for assessing levels of fatigue. The first three items (fatigue severity subscale) ask patients to describe their current fatigue, usual fatigue, and worst fatigue in the past 24 hours, with 0 = &quot;no fatigue&quot; and 10 = &quot;fatigue as bad as you can imagine.&quot; The next 6 items (interference subscale) ask the extent to which fatigue interferes with various aspects of life, with 0 = &quot;does not interfere&quot; and 10 = &quot;completely interferes.&quot; The mean scores of the 9 items can be categorized as mild (1-3), moderate (4-6), and severe (7-10).</description>

    <description>This 19-item questionnaire will be used to assess participants' sleep disturbance levels. The items form seven component scores: sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. The scores for each component range from 0 to 3 and are summed to produce a global score ranging from 0 to 21, with higher scores denoting poorer sleep quality.</description>

    <description>The pain severity subscale (4 items) will be used to assess participants' pain intensity. The 4-item subscale assesses pain at its &quot;worst,&quot; &quot;least,&quot; &quot;average,&quot; and &quot;now&quot; using an 11-point response format ranging from 0 (&quot;no pain&quot;) to 10 (&quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;). Average scores will be calculated and range from 0 to 10. The higher scores refer to higher pain intensity.</description>

    <description>This 14-item questionnaire will be used to measure the severity of participants' psychological distress. Responses are measured on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (&quot;not present&quot;) to 3 (&quot;considerable&quot;). The total score is the sum of the subscale scores (range: 0-42), with a higher score indicating more severe distress.</description>

    <description>The questionnaire consists of 27 items and will be used to assess health-related quality of life. Respondents have to rate each item with a score between 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) and 4 (&quot;very much&quot;). The subscale scores are added to obtain a total score (range=0-108), with a higher score representing a higher level of HRQOL.</description>

    <description>the average scores of the BFI and BPI severity subscales and the item on overall sleep quality in the PSQI (to be transformed to a 0-10 scale) will be used. The symptom cluster severity score will be calculated by averaging the fatigue, sleep disturbance, and pain summary scores. The average severity score range from 0 to 10, with higher scores representing higher severity.</description>

    <description>The proposed self-administered acupressure intervention is patient-centered comprising four pre-selected acupoints that should be applied pressure on by all patients and a list of additional acupoints from which patients can choose two for self-administration according to the personalized recommendations of trainers. In this way, each patient will receive an individualized protocol (four pre-selected and two self-selected acupoints).
The intervention consists of: individual participant training (Two 2-hour one-on-one training sessions in week 1), self-practice (15 minutes of self-administered acupressure twice a day), and follow-up visits (a 1-hour follow-up visit at weeks 2, 3, and 4).</description>

    <description>Two 2-hour one-on-one training sessions in patient-centered self-administered acupressure will be provided by trainers in the first week (4 hours) in the patient's home or at the university, depending on his/her preference. From the second to fourth weeks of the intervention, participants will engage in 15 minutes of self-administered acupressure twice a day (for a total of 10.5 hours over the 3 weeks). They will log the frequency of self-practice in a diary and be encouraged to undertake self-practice beyond the 4-week intervention. At weeks 2, 3, and 4, a 1-hour follow-up visit will be conducted by the same team of trainers to reinforce learning and self-practice (for a total of 3 hours over the 3 weeks).</description>
