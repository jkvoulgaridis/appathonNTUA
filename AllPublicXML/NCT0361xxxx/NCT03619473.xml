    <textblock>
      The main aim of this intervention study is to test the hypothesis if helmet initiative
      program will significantly increase helmet usage in primary school students. The secondary
      aim of this intervention is to evaluate the behavioral change in standard child safety helmet
      usage among the parent/adult riders. The study was conducted in 23 primary school in Selangor
      from 1st January 2016 to 31st December 2018 in three different phases.

      In Malaysia, the road traffic plans estimated that the number of death on road traffics might
      increase almost 23% from 2014-2020 (Royal Police of Malaysia, 2017). The main road crash
      involved the motorcyclist and the main cause of death was due to the severe head injuries.
      Previous study in Malaysia had reported only 20% of proper helmet usage among the adult
      riders (Malaysian Institute of Road Safety Research, 2015). This highlights the need to
      transfer the knowledge to the parent/adult riders on the importance, proper usage and
      availability of the standard child safety helmet and hence increase the prevalence of
      standard helmet usage for the pillion riders especially for the children.

    <description>There will be increase in the prevalence of standard motorcycle child safety helmet usage among primary school students after the educational session under helmet initiative program as well as after the distribution of standard motorcycle child safety helmets.
The educational session under helmet initiative program will provide important information about the risks of riding without standard helmet include the severity of injury to children. This will be an effective effort for continuous usage of standard helmet among child pillion riders
Distribution of standard motorcycle child safety helmets will be able to increase the ownership of standard child helmet especially among those who; hence will increase the prevalence of standard motorcycle child safety helmet usage</description>

    <measure>There will be increase in mean score of parents' knowledge measured using questionnaire in standard motorcycle child safety helmet usage in post intervention compared to pre-intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The usage of standard child motorcycle helmet among child pillion riders will be more successful when they receive consistent messages from their parents.
The educational session under helmet initiative program will provide important information on the law, proper usage, risk of non-usage and the consequences to the parents which further will develope a positive attitude toward helmet wearing for children.
parents' practice in helmet usage will significantly motivates the children to wear a helmet</description>
