  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the U.S., 5.7 million people have heart failure (HF), 915,000 new cases are diagnosed each
      year, and both incidence and prevalence are increasing due to the aging of the population and
      to better survival from ischemic heart disease. A hallmark of HF, is poor functional status
      that, characteristically, deteriorates as the condition progresses, negatively affecting
      patients' quality of life. Poor functional status is associated with increased risk of
      hospitalization for exacerbations of HF and with increased mortality. Optimization of drug
      therapy and appropriate use of resynchronization therapy can improve functional status, as
      can patient engagement in exercise. Although exercise is recommended as a component of HF
      management, adherence is consistently low. This is particularly troubling because exercise
      has great potential as a low-risk, low-cost intervention to improve functional status and
      quality of life while decreasing HF symptoms and hospitalizations in patients with HF. Low
      adherence is due in part to inadequate strength and inability to tolerate or sustain even low
      levels of activity. In this study, we propose to use neuromuscular electrical stimulation
      (NMES) to assist patient initiation of quadriceps strengthening in order to progressively
      increase low exercise tolerance. NMES has been shown to improve muscle strength, exercise
      capacity and quality of life, in samples less than 20 of male patients with HF. Larger sample
      studies are needed to demonstrate efficacy of this practice to jump start patients' abilities
      to benefit from formalized exercise program. The purpose of this double blinded, randomized,
      controlled, longitudinal study is to determine if NMES will increase muscle mass and
      strength, decrease sedentary time, and improve HF symptoms and exercise capacity, thus
      improving quality of life in patients with HF. It is hypothesized that with this increase in
      muscle mass, patients will improve overall exercise tolerance and capacity. In addition,
      after the intervention patients will be better able to tolerate an exercise program thus
      improving adherence to exercise recommendations. After 6 weeks of intervention, patients will
      be encouraged to participate in a formalized exercise program.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a double blinded, randomized controlled longitudinal study design to determine if NMES will increase muscle mass and strength, decrease sitting and lying time, and improve HF symptoms and exercise capacity thus improving likelihood of engagement with a structured exercise program. Patients will be randomized to either intervention that includes NMES or to a sham(TENS)/wait list control group. In order to ensure that the two groups are comparable between treatment and sham interventions, the participants will be randomized according to gender. Randomization via minimization will be used in order to avoid an unbalanced number of women in the two comparison groups due to chance. A file of the computer-generated random assignments will be kept by the research assistant so the PI/data collector remains blinded in a protected Box Health account.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The PI will collect baseline data before the participant is randomized. The intervention/sham will be set-up by the RA and will be collected after the PI leaves the department so those collecting data will not know which group the participant has been/will be participating in. The RA who is trained in both NMES and Sham intervention will then look at the randomization schedule, and set up and train the participants on equipment use. Once trained, participants will be contacted via phone weekly by the RA who initially trained them (in order to maintain blinding). The RA applying the intervention will not have any part in the data collection of the rest of the measurements (other than adherence, tolerance and problems with equipment).</masking_description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-8 weeks after baseline and 5-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Strength Assessment will be done using a portable fixed dynamometer load cell (BTE Technologies, Hanover, MD) (specific aim 1). The load cell will be calibrated prior to testing daily using manufactures guidelines. The patient will be seated with knees flexed to 90Â° following the protocol described by Toonstra.36 The participant will be seated with inelastic strap just above the ankle to resist knee extension. Participants will be given 5 minutes to familiarize themselves with the device and testing procedures. Practice trials will be performed prior to testing. Participants will be asked to produce 3 maximal contractions for 5 seconds each with a 60 second rest between trials. The average of the 3 contractions will be used to represent strength of the knee extensors. Then isometric tests will be completed.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-8 weeks after baseline and 5-6 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Fatigue Scale assess a range of self-reported symptoms, from mild feelings of tiredness to an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained sense of exhaustion. Fatigue is measured by frequency, duration, and intensity as well as the impact of fatigue on physical, mental, and social activities.51 The fatigue short form-8 is universal rather than disease-specific and assess fatigue over the past seven days. Each question usually has five response options ranging in value from one to five. With 1= not at all, to 5=very much).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-8 weeks after baseline and 5-6 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Self-Efficacy for Exercise Scale is used to evaluate how strongly patients feel they can exercise in the face of common barriers. There are 9 items with 10 choices ranging from 0 meaning no confidence to 10 meaning very confident they could/would exercise despite the barrier. Reliability was demonstrated with a alpha coefficient of 0.93 and validity, by factor loadings of all 9 items greater than 0.50 and path coefficients greater than 0.70.56,57 This scale has been validated in a group healthy minority older adults and in a group of older adults ~85+ living in a retirement community (Caucasian, female and unmarried).56,57</description>

    <measure>Change in Outcome Expectations for Exercise Scale-2, from baseline to post, baseline to 6 months, and post to 6 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-8 weeks after baseline and 5-6 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome Expectations for Exercise Scale-2 is used to measure positive and negative expectations for engaging in exercise. There are 13 items with 5 choices on a scale range from 1 strongly agree, 2 agree, 3 neither agree or disagree, 4 disagree, 5 strongly disagree. There are 2 subscales, one for the positive (9 items) or benefits expected by engaging in exercise and the other on possible negative (4 items) outcomes from exercise. The each sub scale is then summed and divided by the number of items giving you an average score for positive and negative expectations score.58</description>
