      To describe the safety, possible complications and technical success of different technical
      methods and different embolic materials in the endovascular management of visceral artery

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal visceral artery aneurysms (VAAs) are defined as aneurysms which involve branches of
      the celiac, superior mesenteric, inferior mesenteric or renal arteries. Owing to the
      improvements in imaging technology and the use of cross-sectional imaging modalities
      (ultrasound, computed tomography [CT], and magnetic resonance imaging), there is increase in
      the frequency of VAAs diagnosis. Although classically treated by open surgery, modern
      treatment strategies generally place interventional radiology techniques at the top of the
      treatment algorithm. Therefore, vascular interventional radiologists must become familiar
      with the indications for the treatment of VAA, become experienced in the different
      techniques, and know when to recommend treatment of VAA by interventional radiology
      techniques or to advocate open surgical repair.

      VAAs are subdivided into true and false aneurysms. A true aneurysm involves all three layers
      of the arterial wall. Classically, a true aneurysm is defined as a localized dilatation of
      the artery by more than 1.5 times the expected arterial diameter. True aneurysms occur as a
      result of underlying arterial pathology such as atherosclerosis, fibromuscular dysplasia, and
      arteritis. The prevalence of true VAAs is 0.1-2%, and most true VAAs are asymptomatic. A
      minority may cause abdominal pain, which may be a harbinger of imminent rupture. VAAs are
      almost never large enough to be palpable by examination. False aneurysms, or pseudoaneurysms,
      are effectively contained ruptures of the artery that are lined by adventitia or by the
      perivascular tissues. False aneurysms may occur as a result of inflammation, infection, or
      trauma.

In instances of aneurysmal disease of second-order or third-order branches, technical success is further defined as exclusion of the aneurysm with preservation of flow within the intended parent artery.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aneurysm due to inflammation or pancreatitis [e.g., splenic, gastroduodenal (GDA),
             superiomesenteric artery (SMA), hepatic, or even renal aneurysms].

          -  Aneurysm due to trauma.

          -  Aneurysms occurring after surgery

          -  Aneurysm due to penetrating peptic ulcers.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  In most cases with multiple, diffuse, small aneurysms related to portal hypertension
             should be left untreated and followed by repeat computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI) examinations. Once the portal hypertension and underlying
             cirrhotic disease is treated (e.g., via liver transplantation), the aneurysm may
             spontaneously decrease and completely disappear over time.

          -  Patient refusal.
