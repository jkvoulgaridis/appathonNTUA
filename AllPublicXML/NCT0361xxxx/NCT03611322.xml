    <textblock>
      This study compares semaglutide in two different injection tools called &quot;PDS290&quot; and
      &quot;DV3372&quot;. The study aims to show similar levels of semaglutide in the blood when using either
      of the two injection tools. The researchers also want to look at how well the injection tools
      work. Participants will either receive semaglutide using the PDS290 or the DV3372 injection
      tool. This is decided by chance, like flipping a coin. This is called randomisation.
      Semaglutide is an approved medicine (thus available on the market) for people with type 2
      diabetes. Semaglutide will be injected subcutaneously (injection under the skin).
      Participants will get a total of 5 injections with semaglutide. The study will last for a
      maximum of 86 days. Participants will have 17 scheduled site visits with the study physician
      or study staff at the study centre. For one of the visits participants will stay at the
      research unit for 4 days and 3 nights. Participants cannot take part in this study if
      participants have any disorder that the doctor thinks is a health problem. Only healthy men
      and women are allowed to take part. Women cannot take part if pregnant, breast-feeding or
      plan to become pregnant during the study period.
