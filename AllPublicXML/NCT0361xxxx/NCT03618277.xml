  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Melasma (also called chloasma and pregnancy mask) is characterized by pigmented lesions
      darker than their usual complexion on the faces of affected subjects.

      The physiopathology of melasma is still poorly understood. To date, the factors that favor
      the onset of melasma appear to be: genetic predisposing factors, changes in sex hormone
      levels, and sun exposure.

      Vascularization as well as elastosis also appear to be increased in skin with melasma.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the different levels of expression of biomarkers between
      pigmented melasma lesions and surrounding healthy skin when melasma is highly pigmented but
      also when it is dormant (ie treated melasma, without UV solicitation in the heart of winter).
      The goal is to identify and better understand the involvement of different genes and proteins
      and thus offer more specific ways of care, and therefore effective, for the subjects.
