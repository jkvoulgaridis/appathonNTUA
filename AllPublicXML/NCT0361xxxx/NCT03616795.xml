    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to measure how much of the study drug gets into the
      bloodstream and how long it takes the body to get rid of it. This study will involve a single
      dose of 14C radiolabelled LY3154207. This means that a radioactive substance C14 will be
      incorporated into the study drug, to investigate the study drug and its breakdown products,
      to find out how much of these pass from blood into urine, feces and expired air. The study
      will last about 4 weeks. Screening is required within 28 days prior to the start of the study
      and follow up is required approximately 7 days after discharge.
