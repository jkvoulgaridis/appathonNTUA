  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore whether financial incentives, reminders, information about HIV/AIDS
      and its treatment and anti-stigma counseling help improve anti-retroviral therapy (ART)
      adherence among HIV infected individuals in a resource-limited environment. The interventions
      will be randomized in the study population in a cross-cutting design, with a control group, a
      financial incentive treatment group, a reminders treatment group, a treatment group that
      receives both the financial incentive and reminder interventions. In addition, there will be
      an information treatment group, a stigma-relieving treatment group and a group that receives
      both information and stigma-relieving interventions. The primary outcomes of interest for
      this study will be the adherence to ART, measured by attendance rates at clinic appointments
      and refill collection rates.

    <measure>Medication possession ratio (MPR) at least 95%, 6 month window</measure>
    <time_frame>0-6 month interval from date of study enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Fraction of participants for whom MPR is greater than or equal to 95%. MPR is proportion of days that a respondent is in possession of at least one ART dose. MPR is computed from pharmacy dispensing records. Measurement window truncated to last visit date for patients who transfer clinics, opt out of future study participation, or die.</description>

    <time_frame>0-3 month interval from date of study enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Fraction of participants for whom MPR is greater than or equal to 95%. MPR is proportion of days that a respondent is in possession of at least one ART dose. MPR is computed from pharmacy dispensing records. Measurement window truncated to last visit date for patients who transfer clinics, opt out of future study participation, or die.</description>

    <measure>Medication possession ratio (MPR) at least 80%, 6 month window</measure>
    <time_frame>0-6 month interval from date of study enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Fraction of participants for whom MPR is greater than or equal to 80%. MPR is proportion of days that a respondent is in possession of at least one ART dose.

    <description>Fraction of participants for whom MPR is greater than or equal to 80%. MPR is proportion of days that a respondent is in possession of at least one ART dose.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Appointment attendance rate (AAR)</measure>
    <time_frame>0-6 month interval from date of study enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Average AAR among participants. AAR is proportion of scheduled visits completed during the observation period. &quot;Completed visit&quot; considered done if patient visits clinic on scheduled appointment date, or up to 7 days prior to that date. AAR is computed from clinic records. Measurement window truncated to last visit date for patients who transfer clinics, opt out of future study participation, or die.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lost to follow-up (LTFU)</measure>
    <time_frame>0-6 month interval from date of study enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Fraction of participants lost to follow up (LTFU). LTFU indicates patient missed last appointment and 90 or more days have elapsed since patient's last scheduled appointment date, with no clinic record of contact since that date. Patients who transfer clinics or opt out of future study participation are excluded from LTFU denominator, but those who die are retained in LTFU denominator.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Test Referral, 1-month window</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month interval from date of study enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>This is a binary variable, which takes value 1 if the participant has a successful referral to test for HIV within 1 month of recruitment and 0 otherwise. A participant is considered having a successful referral if someone approaches our study team in the clinic, present us with the proof of an HIV testing together with the barcode-card we distributed to the participant upon recruitment.</description>
