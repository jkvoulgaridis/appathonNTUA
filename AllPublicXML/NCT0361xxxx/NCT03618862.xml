  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a nuclear receptor that controls the transcription of many
      genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism. A recent study opens the hypothesis that
      Farnesoid X receptor also participates in deoxyribonucleic acid repair mechanisms and
      possibly in the fight against cell invasion by foreign genomes. This hypothesis implied that
      modulation of Farnesoid X receptor by ligands could modify Human Immunodeficiency Virus
      replication. The results of in vitro studies with Human Immunodeficiency Virus-infected cell
      lines indicate that indeed the modulation of Farnesoid X receptor activity by its ligands
      induces stimulation of virus production rapidly followed by cell death; the overall effect is
      therefore antiviral. Farnesoid X receptor ligands have also shown an effect on the
      reactivation of proviruses in cellular models of viral latency studies. This last data raises
      the hope of being able to intervene on the reservoir of Human Immunodeficiency Virus.

      It is therefore crucial to confirm on quiescent CD4 + T lymphocytes of patients whose viral
      load is controlled by antiretroviral treatment combining several antiretrovirals the results
      obtained with the in vitro models.

      Providing proof of concept that Farnesoid X receptor agonists can reactivate latent
      proviruses will open new therapeutic perspectives for attacking the Human Immunodeficiency
      Virus reservoir with a view to achieving a functional cure for Acquired Immune Deficiency
      Syndrome. The objective of the study is to confirm ex vivo the data obtained in vitro with
      cellular models and laboratory viral strains. It is therefore necessary to show that
      Farnesoid X receptor agonists can reactivate latent viruses or proviruses present in
      quiescent CD4 + T circulating lymphocytes prepared from venous blood of HIV-positive patients
      under cART. Human Immunodeficiency Virus-positive patients will be any patients, irrespective
      of the viral genotype, who initiated antiretroviral therapy, regardless of the combination of
      antiretrovirals, away from primary infection, when they already had a complete western blot,
      indicating an evolution of the infection without treatment and constitution of an already
      evolved reservoir. Patients will have had an undetectable viral load since initiation of
      treatment with a follow-up of at least one year and will have at least 500 CD4 + T
      lymphocytes / mm3.

    <description>The primary endpoint of the study is the presence or absence of reactivation of latent proviruses present in quiescent CD4 + T cells purified from peripheral venous blood following treatment of these cells with Farnesoid X receptor agonists.
This is a composite endpoint because the reactivation will be determined qualitatively, virus production or not after treatment, and quantitatively, level of production of infectious and / or defective viruses.</description>
