      This study evaluates the effect of a standardized mindfulness based intervention compared to
      control on self-reported levels of stress in residency trainees.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent research studies have indicated that the practice of mindfulness is strongly
      correlated with enhanced well-being and improved resilience in a variety of populations.
      Mindfulness-based interventions have been shown to reduce stress and symptoms of burnout in
      physicians. However, the two studies that included residents were observational trials
      evaluating the effect of an abbreviated, informal mindfulness course.

      The aim of the investigator's study is to assess whether a standardized course in mindfulness
      meditation (Mindful Awareness Practices, MAPs) reduces self--reported signs and symptoms of
      stress, burnout, depression, anxiety, loneliness and poor sleep quality in residents in
      pediatrics training. This study is a randomized controlled trial using 2 parallel groups. The
      pediatrics residents randomized to the intervention will participate in a standardized
      mindful awareness practices intervention consisting of one live 45- minute session and 5
      web--based self--study sessions. The live session will be administered by a trained
      mindfulness educator at the UCLA Westwood, Olive View Medical Center and Cedars--Sinai
      Medical Center campuses. The waitlist group will have the opportunity to participate in the
      same course once the study has been completed. Participants will respond to questionnaires to
      assess for levels of stress and other mental health measures before and after the
      intervention to see if the intervention group had a reduction in symptoms compared to the
      waitlist group.

    <measure>Change in level of stress per Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 2 months (immediately post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>PSS = validated 14-item self-report questionnaire of stress experienced over past month. Scores range from 0-56. Higher scores represent a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in symptoms of burnout per Abbreviated Maslach Burnout Inventory-9</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 2 months (immediately post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Physician-specific self-report questionnaire of symptoms of burnout. The inventory is divided into three subscales: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and personal accomplishment. Each subscale scores from 0-18. The subscales are reported separately rather than added together for a total score. Higher scores represent a worse outcome, except on the personal accomplishment subscale, where higher scores represent better outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and at 2 months (immediately post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Validated self-report questionnaire of symptoms of depression. Scores range from 0-63. Higher scores represent a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in symptoms of anxiety per Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 2 months (immediately post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Validated self-report questionnaire of symptoms of anxiety. Scores range from 0-63. Higher scores represent a worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in level of loneliness per UCLA Loneliness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 2 months (immediately post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Validated self-report questionnaire of frequency of feeling lonely. Scores range from 20-80. Higher scores represent a worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in level of sleep quality per Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 2 months (immediately post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Validated self-report questionnaire evaluated sleep quality. Scores range from 0-21. Higher scores represent a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in level of mindfulness per Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 2 months (immediately post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>MAAS = validated 15-item self-report questionnaire of tendency to be attentive to and aware of experiences in daily life. Scores range from 15-90. Higher scores represent a better outcome.</description>
