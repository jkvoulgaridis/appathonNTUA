  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uric acid is the final breakdown product of purine degradation in humans. The association
      between high serum uric acid levels and arterial stiffness as well as endothelial dysfunction
      has been demonstrated in humans and uric acid has been suggested to be an important modulator
      of the inflammatory process. But debates still existed for hyperuricemia and hypouricemia as
      an independent role,especially after controlling other traditional atherosclerotic risk.The
      aim of this study was, firstly, to verify the association between hyperuricemia and
      cardiovascular diseases,secondly,to assess whether hypouricemia was an independent risk
      factor impact for cardiovascular disea.

      The study is a longitudinal cohort study. The first cross-sectional survey was conducted in
      2011. The eligible participants were followed up from November 2011 to June 2017 (mean
      follow-up months 68.71±11.35). During the followed-up time, 67 patients had missing data and
      56 had no compliance. Thus, the study sample actually comprised 3,640 valid participants
      (1859 men, 1781 women) whose age older than or equal to 35 years (mean age 60.2±10.4 years)
      were followed up. A total of hospitalized patients were consecutively enrolled from the
      endocrinology or cardiology department of Beijing and Shanghai. All subjects are under
      treatment because of cardiovascular diseases or endocrine diseases.

    <description>Cardiovascular events definitions: Hospitalized myocardial infarction was classified as definite or probable based on chest pain symptoms, cardiac enzyme levels, and electrocardiographic findings, or angioplasty28. Coronary heart disease was determined to be present if there was (1) electrocardiographic (ECG) evidence of a prior myocardial infarction, (2) prior coronary artery bypass surgery or angioplasty, (3) Coronary angiography show coronary heart disease, (4) have symptoms of angina and ECG revealed myocardial ischemia performance or laboratory tests showed cardiac enzymes increased and exclude other types of disease, (5) a self-reported history of a physician-diagnosed heart attack 29. CHD death was classified &quot;definite&quot; based on chest pain symptoms, hospital records, and medical history.</description>

        There were 3,682 participants from multi-central departments with multiple classical
        Framingham risk factors atherosclerosis, 166 of whom had missing follow-up data. Thus,the
        study sample actually comprised 3,516 valid participants whose age older than or equal to
        35 years.All participants were followed up from January 2011 to November 2017. A total of
        hospitalized patients were consecutively enrolled from the endocrinology or cardiology
        department and under treatment because of cardiovascular diseases or endocrine diseases.
