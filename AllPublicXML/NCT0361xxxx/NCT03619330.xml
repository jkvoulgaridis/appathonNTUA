      The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of liraglutide and testosterone
      replacement therapy on features of hypogonadism and weight loss in obese men with persistent
      features of hypogonadism after unsuccessful lifestyle measures.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The main outcome was improvements of symptoms related to hypogonadism</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients were screened and asked for symptoms at the beginning and every 4 weeks for 16 weeks of the study.</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The main outcome was change testosterone level.</measure>
    <time_frame>Patient's blood was drawn at the base point and every four weeks during 16 weeks of clinical trial.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's blood was drawn between 8 and 9 a.m. Concentrations of testosterone was measured in nmol/L.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>the main outcome was change in gonadotropin levels.</measure>
    <time_frame>Patient's blood was drawn at the base point and every four weeks during 16 weeks of clinical trial.</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary outcome was change in body weight.</measure>
    <time_frame>Patient's body weight in kilograms were measured at the base point and every four weeks during the 16 weeks of clinical trial.</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary outcome was change in waist circumference.</measure>
    <time_frame>Patient's waist circumference was measured at the basepoint and every four weeks during 16 weeks of clinical trial.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's waist circumference was measured in centimeters.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>The other outcomes was changes changes in fasting concentrations of glucose.</measure>
    <time_frame>Patient's fasting blood was drawn at the basepoint and and the end of the 16 weeks of clinical trial.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's blood was drawn between 8 and 9 a.m. Concentrations of fasting glucose was measured in mmol/L.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Other outcome was change in fasting concentration of insulin.</measure>
    <time_frame>Patient's fasting blood was drawn at the basepoint and and the end of the 16 weeks of clinical trial.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's blood was drawn between 8 and 9 a.m. Fasting concentrations of insulin was measured in mU/L.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Other outcome was change in HOMA IR index for insulin resistance.</measure>
    <time_frame>Patient's fasting blood was drawn at the basepoint and and the end of the 16 weeks of clinical trial.</time_frame>
    <description>HOMA IR index was calculated as fasting plasma glucose times fasting plasma insulin devided by 22.5</description>
