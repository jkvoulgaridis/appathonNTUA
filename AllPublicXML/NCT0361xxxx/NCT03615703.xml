  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this non-interventional study is to optimize the point subtraction aggression
      paradigms (PSAP) task in typically developing children (TDC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PSAP is a behavioral aggression test used to evaluate behavioral response related to
      impulsive aggression. The task will be combined with functional MRI to establish a reliable
      BOLD signal during testing in developing healthy subjects (8-12 years old) and, to determine
      the feasibility to perform the task.

      Additionally, the levels of neurotransmitters Glutamate and GABA will be measured using
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Brain Imaging in typically developing healthy children during the PSAP aggression Task</measure>
    <time_frame>The study consist of one visit (total time-2 hrs.).</time_frame>
    <description>The study has only one visit (approximately 2 hours). During the task each participant competes against a fictitious opponent (a computer in reality) to earn points. The participant will play a computer game in which they can steal points (simulating an aggressive behavior) or have points stolen by the opponent.
10 healthy subjects will be recruited for the study. To make the participant feel comfortable in the MRI, eligible subjects will spend time first to habituate to the scanner and then practice the task. The complete MRI will last one and half hour (at most).
Functional imaging data (neural activation) will be collected during the behavioral aggression task, while playing the game. In addition, imaging data will be collected at resting state to understand the connectivity between regions of interest before and after the aggression task.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>GABA and Glutamate Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>The study consist of one visit (total time-2 hrs.).</time_frame>
    <description>During the MRI scan, imaging data will be obtained while participants are able to listen to music. GABA and Glutamate signals measured using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) from two brain regions (anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala) will be used to quantify the two neurotransmitters.</description>
