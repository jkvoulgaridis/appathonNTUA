      In general, brain metastases found after development of neurologic symptoms have poor
      prognosis. Therefore, the investigators aim to investigate whether regular brain MRI
      (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) can detect early brain metastases and influence survival through
      early brain management in HER2-positive and triple negative breast cancer.

      It is well known that HER2-receptor positive and triple negative metastatic breast cancer
      (MBC) have poor prognosis than hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer. However,
      as new therapies such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab are introduced, overall survival was
      extended in patients with metastatic breast cancer compared with the previous 10 years. As a
      result, the number of breast cancer patients with brain metastases has increased, the demand
      for treatments of brain metastases is increasing.

      The incidence of brain metastases in MBC has been reported to be 7.6% and 10.8% in luminal A
      / B, respectively. However, HER2-positive and triple negative breast cancer with the
      incidence of more than 30% of brain metastases were at high risk group of brain metastases.

      In general, brain metastases found after development of neurologic symptoms have poor
      prognosis. Therefore, the investigators aim to investigate whether regular brain MRI
      (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) can detect early brain metastases and influence survival through
      early brain management in HER2-positive and triple negative breast cancer.
