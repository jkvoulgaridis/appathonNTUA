    <description>After inclusion in the study, eligible patients having hepatic metastases and/or péritonéales of a colorectal cancer considered as resecables will have biological and tissue samples.
The samples will be carried out at the time of the surgical gesture envisaged under general anaesthesia and will concern:
Tumoral material: primitive tumour (if available), hepatic metastases and/or peritoneal
Peritoneal liquid
none tumoral peritoneum
Portal blood
Peripheral blood
Cellulo-lymphatic material The necessary time to carry out the whole of these samples is estimated at 10-15 minutes maximum.
In the event of complex situations being able to complicate the surgical gesture initially envisaged or to increase by them morbidity, one or more these samples will not be carried out. This decision will be made at the discretion of the investigator.</description>
