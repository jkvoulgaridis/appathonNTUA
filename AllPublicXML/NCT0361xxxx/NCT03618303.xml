  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart attacks remain a common cause of death throughout the world. The most common initiating
      event is the formation of a blood clot within the coronary arteries occluding blood supply to
      the heart. However, we know that thrombus often occurs within the coronary arteries without
      causing any symptoms, and may be found in patients with stable angina. We wish to investigate
      whether blood clots within the coronary arteries can be detected in patients who have had a
      heart attack and in patients with stable angina using combined positron emission tomography
      and magnetic resonance (PET-MR) imaging. If possible, this may provide a safe and noninvasive
      means of identifying patients at higher risk of heart attacks.

      The study will be conducted in Edinburgh Heart Centre and a total of 40 participants will be
      recruited from the cardiology wards, outpatient clinics and day case unit. Participants will
      be asked to undergo a single PET-MRI scan in addition to invasive angiography as part of
      standard care (non-research procedure). During the invasive angiogram procedure, an
      additional imaging test may be performed called Optical Coherence Tomography to provide
      images from within the heart blood vessels.
