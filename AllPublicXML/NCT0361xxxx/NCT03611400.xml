  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this double blind, crossover study participants will take a placebo for 3 weeks each. Gut
      permeability will be assessed weekly using food-grade sugar molecules. On the second week,
      participants will take aspirin, which will make their intestine permeable to the sugars.
      Participants will be asked to provide urine and stool samples to assess gut permeability and
      microbial communities. No change in permeability to the small sugar probes is anticipated
      with the probiotic.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gastroduodenal Permeability</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 2 of each intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is the difference between the changes in gastroduodenal permeability induced by aspirin challenge with the probiotic versus the placebo. Gastroduodenal permeability will be assessed while on the placebo and probiotic interventions by measuring urinary sucrose in the 0 to 5-hour urine collection of the sugar probe permeability test. Change will be calculated as the urinary sucrose concentration after aspirin challenge (week 2 of each intervention) minus the concentration from the prior week (i.e., 1 wk on intervention with no aspirin challenge).</description>

The GSRS consists of 15 questions related to 5 syndromes, constipation, diarrhea, reflux, abdominal pain, and indigestion. Symptoms are scored 1=no discomfort to 7=very severe discomfort.
