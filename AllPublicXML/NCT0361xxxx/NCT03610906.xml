  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New data suggests that the current treatment for pediatric adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma
      (CPA) may not be as effective as it could be.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current treatment regimens for pediatric CPA are limited to surgery and radiation therapy.
      This pilot study seeks to identify biologically rational therapeutics for the medical
      treatment of adamantinomatous CPA by confirming the overexpression of specific molecules.

        The population to be enrolled in this study will be children ages 0 through 21 years of age
        with a high preoperative suspicion of craniopharyngioma. The study population will be
        selected from the clinics at the 10 POETIC member institutions, and selected additional
        institutions by the treating clinicians.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients between 0-21 years of age.

          2. Patients with the diagnosis or clinical suspicion of craniopharyngioma in whom planned
             clinical management will include tissue sampling.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients in whom final pathology does not demonstrate adamantinomatous
             craniopharyngioma

          2. Patients in whom tissue specimen is not obtained/available

          3. Patients over 21 years of age.

          4. Patients who choose not to participate
