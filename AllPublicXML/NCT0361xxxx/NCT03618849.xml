  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this preliminary study, we will examine the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), in the setting of dosage escalation, as a
      candidate intervention for children with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI). We will also explore
      the use of electroencephalography (EEG) as a response and predictive biomarker in pediatric
      ABI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have demonstrated that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is
      safe and effective in adults with chronic Acquired Brain Injury. Limited data have
      established the safety of tDCS in children with neuropsychiatric and neuromotor disorders.
      However, these tDCS safety paradigms may not be relevant to children with ABI due to their
      abnormal brain structure and function, decreased ability to communicate, variable
      symptomology, and time-consuming care needs that exist in this population.

      In this open-label, single-group, dosage escalation study, investigators aim to assess the
      safety, tolerability, and feasibility of incrementally higher tDCS currents in 10 pediatric
      patients with ABI on an inpatient rehabilitation unit. The study will include up to three
      sessions of tDCS (sham, 1mA, and then 2 mA) either over the left dorsolateral prefrontal
      cortex or over the primary motor cortex based on the goal to evaluate change in either
      cognitive or motor function. We will also explore whether tDCS improves consciousness in
      pediatric DOC. Additionally, we will explore whether EEG (resting-state coherence and
      event-related potentials) improve following tDCS and predict current behavioral function and
      recovery form ABI. Mozart classical music, as a concurrent intervention, will be played
      during sham, 1 mA, and 2 mA tDCS applications.

    <description>Post initial screening and baseline data collection, all study participants (a single cohort of patients) will receive a single dose of sham tDCS for 20 minutes over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or the primary motor cortex in conjunction with Mozart piano sonata. For sham tDCS, the current will be ramped up and immediately ramped down for 30 seconds. The sham tDCS session will be preceded and followed by behavioral assessments and EEG recording.</description>

    <description>Post sham-tDCS, we will determine the eligibility of the participant to receive 1 mA of real tDCS based on the occurrence of adverse events and seizures occurring within 5 days of the sham session. After a minimum of 5 days post-sham stimulation (and typically around 7 days later), the participant will receive a single dose of 1-mA current over left DLPFC or M1 in conjunction with Mozart piano sonata. The participant will receive 1-mA current for 20 minutes; the current will be ramped up for 30 seconds, will held constant at the determined intensity for 20 minutes, and then ramped down for 10 seconds. The 1-mA tDCS session will be preceded and followed by behavioral assessments and EEG recording.</description>

    <description>Post 1-mA tDCS, we will again determine the eligibility of the participant to receive 2 mA current. After a minimum of 5 days post-1 mA stimulation (typically 7 days), the participant will receive a single dose of 2-mA current over left DLPFC or M1 in conjunction with Mozart piano sonata. The participant will receive 2-mA current for 20 minutes; the current will be ramped up for 30 seconds, will held constant at the determined intensity for 20 minutes, and then ramped down for 10 seconds. The 2-mA tDCS session will be preceded and followed by behavioral assessments and EEG recording.</description>
