      An evaluation of the safety and performance of the Conformal Left Atrial Appendage Seal for
      Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Conformal Left Atrial Appendage Seal (CLAAS) Device is a permanent implant designed to
      occlude the left atrial appendage (LAA) to eliminate blood flow into and clot passage from
      the LAA.

          4. The patient is recommended for oral anticoagulation therapy (OAC), but has an
             appropriate rationale to seek a non-pharmacologic alternative to chronic oral
             anticoagulation

          5. The patient deemed appropriate for LAA closure by the Site P.I. and a
             non-interventional physician using an evidenced-based decision-making tool on oral
             anticoagulants consistent with standard of care.

          6. The patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol-specified medication
             regimen and follow-up evaluations

          7. The patient (or legally authorized representative, (where allowed)) has been informed
             of the nature of the study, agrees to its provisions, and has provided written
             informed consent approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB) or
             Ethics Committee (EC)

        General Exclusion Criteria

          1. Pregnant or nursing patients and those who plan pregnancy in the period up to 1 year
             following the index procedure. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a
             negative pregnancy test (per site standard test) within 7 days prior to index
             procedure.

          2. Anatomic conditions that would prevent performance of an LAA occlusion procedure
             (e.g., prior atrial septal defect [ASD] or patient foramen ovale [PFO] surgical repair
             or implanted closure device, or obliterated or ligated left atrial appendage)

          3. Atrial fibrillation that is defined by a single occurrence or that is transient or
             reversible (e.g., secondary thyroid disorders, acute alcohol intoxication, trauma,
             recent major surgical procedures)

          4. Patients with a medical condition (other than atrial fibrillation) that mandates
             chronic oral anticoagulation (e.g., history of unprovoked deep vein thrombosis or
             pulmonary embolism, or mechanical heart valve)

          5. History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy, or patients in whom antiplatelet and/or
             anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated

          6. Active infection with bacteremia

          7. Documented symptomatic carotid artery disease (&gt;50% diameter stenosis with prior
             ipsilateral stroke or TIA) or known asymptomatic carotid artery disease (diameter
             stenosis of &gt;70%)

          8. Recent (within 30 days pre-procedure) or planned (within 60 days post-procedure)
             cardiac or non-cardiac interventional or surgical procedure

          9. Recent (within 90 days pre-procedure) stroke or transient ischemic attack.

         10. Recent (within 60 days pre-procedure) myocardial infarction

         11. Vascular access precluding delivery of implant with catheter-based system

         12. Severe heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III or IV)

         13. Prior cardiac transplant, history of mitral valve replacement or transcatheter mitral
             valve intervention, or any mechanical valve implant

         14. Renal insufficiency, defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;30
             mL/min/1.73 m2 (by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation), or dialysis at
             the time of screening

         15. Platelet count &lt;75,000 cells/mm3 or &gt;700,000 cells/mm3, or white blood cell count
             &lt;3,000 cells/mm3

         16. Patient has a known allergy, hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin,
             or device materials (e.g., nickel, titanium, gold) or that would preclude any P2Y12
             inhibitor therapy, or the patient has contrast sensitivity that cannot be adequately
             pre-medicated

         17. Current participation in another investigational drug or device study

         18. Patient is a prisoner

         19. Patient is unable to undergo general anesthesia

         20. Known other medical illness or known history of substance abuse that may cause
             non-compliance with the protocol or protocol-specified medication regimen, confound
             the data interpretation, or is associated with a life expectancy of less than 2 years

         21. Patient has a condition which precludes adequate transesophageal echocardiographic
             (TEE) assessment

        Echocardiographic Exclusion Criteria

          1. Left atrial appendage anatomy cannot accommodate the CLAAS device per manufacturer IFU

          2. Intracardiac thrombus or dense spontaneous echo contrast, as visualized by TEE within
             2 days prior to implant

          4. Circumferential pericardial effusion &gt;10 mm or symptomatic pericardial effusion, signs
             or symptoms of acute or chronic pericarditis, or evidence of tamponade physiology

          5. Atrial septal defect that warrants closure

          6. High risk patent foramen ovale (PFO), defined as an atrial septal aneurysm (exclusion
             &gt;15 mm or length &gt; 15 mm) or large shunt (early [within 3 beats] or substantial
             passage of bubbles)

          7. Moderate or severe mitral valve stenosis (mitral valve area &lt;1.5 cm2)
