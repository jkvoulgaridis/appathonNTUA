      Approximately 350 adult subjects will be recruited from approximately 80 study centers in the
      United States, Canada, and Europe who were enrolled in the ASPEN-1 Study Protocol 1720302 and
      de novo subjects (not previously enrolled in ASPEN-1 Study Protocol 1720302) will be treated
      with up to 4 different doses of daxibotulinumtoxinA for injection.

    <description>The CGIC is an investigator-reported assessment of the global clinical change in CD since study treatment administration. The CGIC uses a 7-point Likert scale ranging from +3 (very much improved) to -3 (very much worse), and will be assessed by the investigator at the Week 4 and Week 6 visits.</description>

    <measure>The average of the change from Baseline in the TWSTRS Total Score at Weeks 4 and 6 for Treatment Cycles 1, 2, 3, and 4 [Time Frame: Weeks 4 and 6 of treatment cycles 1, 2, 3, and 4 (12 - 52 weeks duration each)]</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 4 and 6 of treatment cycles 1, 2, 3, and 4 (12 - 52 weeks duration each)</time_frame>
    <description>The difference in TWSTRS-Total score between the Baseline and average of Weeks 4 and 6 for each treatment cycle will be determined for each subject. The TWSTRS is an assessment scale used to measure the impact of CD on subjects. TWSTRS-total score has a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 85, where higher scores represent worse outcomes. It is made up of the summation of 3 subscales: the Torticollis Severity Scale (minimum score of 0, maximum score of 35), the Disability Scale (minimum score of 0, maximum score of 30), and the Pain Scale (minimum score of 0, maximum score of 20).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Meets diagnostic criteria for isolated CD (idiopathic; dystonic symptoms localized to
             the head, neck, shoulder areas) with at least moderate severity at Baseline (Day 1),
             defined as a TWSTRS-total score of at least 20, with at least 15 on the
             TWSTRS-Severity subscale, at least 3 on the TWSTRS-Disability subscale, and at least 1
             on the TWSTRS-Pain subscale (minimum TWSTRS subscale criteria applicable only to
             subjects not previously enrolled in Study Protocol 1720302)

          -  Subjects who were previously enrolled in Study Protocol 1720302, and completed the
             study, including:

               -  Those with no reduction or have an increase from baseline in the average
                  TWSTRS-total score at Weeks 4 and 6 (i.e., no improvement or worsened disease
                  status), and the investigator agreed that there was a need for retreatment based
                  on the subject's symptoms and neurologic exam findings

               -  Those who benefited from study treatment and completed follow-up study visits up
                  to the time point of when their TWSTRS - total score reached/exceeded their
                  target TWSTRS score

               -  Those who benefited from study treatment but subsequently experienced significant
                  recurrence of CD symptoms (e.g. pain) during the study before their TWSTRS-total
                  score reached their target TWSTRS score and requested retreatment, which the
                  investigator determined was warranted based on the subject's symptoms and
                  neurologic exam findings

               -  Those who completed study visits up to Week 36 and their TWSTRS-total score never
                  reached their target TWSTRS score and they never requested another treatment. The
                  investigator determined that these subjects can be followed in the OLS until
                  their TWSTRS-total score is the same or higher than their target TWSTRS score or
                  until they request retreatment, which the investigator determined is clinically
                  indicated

          -  De novo subjects (not previously enrolled in Study Protocol 1720302):

               -  Naïve to BoNT treatment

               -  BoNT treatment-experienced; if previously treated with BoNTA, the subject must
                  have demonstrated a clinically meaningful response to the last BoNTA treatment
                  based on the clinical judgment of the investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cervical dystonia attributable to an underlying etiology, (e.g., traumatic torticollis
             or tardive torticollis)

          -  Predominant retrocollis or anterocollis CD

          -  Significant dystonia in other body areas, or is currently being treated with botulinum
             toxin (BoNT) for dystonia in areas other than those associated with isolated CD

          -  Severe dysphagia (Grade 3 or 4 on the Dysphagia Severity Scale) at Screening or
             Baseline (prior to study treatment)

          -  Any neuromuscular neurological conditions that may place the subject at increased risk
             of morbidity with exposure to BoNT, including peripheral motor neuropathic diseases
             (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and motor neuropathy, and neuromuscular
             junctional disorders such as Lambert-Eaton syndrome and myasthenia gravis)

          -  Previous treatment with any BoNT product for any condition within the 14 weeks prior
             to Screening (applicable only to de novo subjects)

          -  Botulinum neurotoxin treatment-experienced subjects who had suboptimal or no treatment
             response to the most recent BoNTA injection for CD, as determined by the investigator;
             or history of primary or secondary non-response to BoNTA injections, known to have
             neutralizing antibodies to BoNTA; or have a history of botulinum toxin type B
             (rimabotulinumtoxinA [Myobloc/Neurobloc]) injection for CD due to non-response or
             suboptimal response to BoNTA (applicable only to de novo subjects)
