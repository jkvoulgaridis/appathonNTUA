      This phase 2 trial studies the effect of intravenous (IV) vitamin C repletion after
      myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin C is a nutritional supplement that can help fight inflammation. Most patients who
      have a stem cell transplant have lower than normal levels of vitamin C in their blood.
      Patients will receive intravenous Vitamin C the day after transplant for two weeks, followed
      by oral vitamin C until six months after transplant. The effect of the Vitamin C on
      non-relapse mortality (NRM), time to engraftment, rate of acute graft-versus-host disease and
      to characterize the safety and tolerability of the vitamin C regimen.

Then participants will take vitamin C orally (by mouth in pill form) twice a day each day until 6 months after transplant. The treatment is IV vitamin C 50 mg/kg/day. After completion of the IV vitamin C doses, oral vitamin C 500 mg twice each day.</description>
