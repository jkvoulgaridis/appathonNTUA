  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate how exercise and surgical weight loss
      affect how likely an individual is to develop peripheral neuropathy and other neurologic
      complications.

      The length of this study, including screening is approximately 24 months. Patients at
      Bariatric Surgery Clinics will be recruited for this study. Both patients that decide to
      undergo bariatric surgery, and those that do not undergo surgery will be enrolled. Patients
      will be randomized to either a high intensity interval training (HIIT) or standard exercise
      regimen after eligibility is confirmed and the baseline visit is complete. All patients will
      complete follow-up appointments at 3 month, 12 months and 24 months. Patients that are
      randomized to the HIIT program will compete 2 supervised and 1 unsupervised training sessions
      a week for 24 months.
