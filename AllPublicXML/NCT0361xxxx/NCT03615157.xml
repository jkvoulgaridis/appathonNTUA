  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is a multisystemic disease leading to exercise intolerance and fatigue.
      Supervised physical training improves functional capacity, quality of life and reduces
      hospital admissions in HF patients. In this way, home physical training may be a good
      alternative to patients who, for any reason, cannot perform supervised training. Objective:
      To asses the effects of a home-based training program on functional capacity, sedentary
      lifestyle and quality of life of patients with chronic HF compared to supervised training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After agreement with the written informed consent, subjects with heart failure (left
      ventricle ejection fraction bellow or equal 40%) will be included in this study. They will be
      randomized in two groups: Home-based and Supervised exercise groups. The two groups will be
      submitted to a twelve-week combined exercise program of aerobic and peripheral muscle
      training. All volunteers will be assessed at baseline and after twelve weeks of intervention.
      Peripheric and respiratory muscle strength as well the 6MW analyses were assessed also at 4
      and 8 weeks after baseline.
