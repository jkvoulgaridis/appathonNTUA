      A phase I/IIa, multinational, multicentric (IDIBAPS, IRSICAIXA, AARHUS, VUB, APHP),
      randomised, balanced by centre (to include participants from the 4 arms), open-label,
      controlled clinical trial. Each participant will be followed up a different time according to
      study arm: a minimum of 38 weeks in arm I, 31 weeks in arm II, 54 weeks in arm III and 26
      weeks in the arm 4. The study duration will be 104 weeks from inclusion of the first
      participant.

      Participants will be randomised to one of the following 4 arms:

        -  Arm 1 (study): 14 participants will receive 3 vaccines of HIVARNA01.3 prime, 2
           MVA-vectored vaccine boosts, 1 dose of 10-1074 antibodies and 3 doses of romidepsin

        -  Arm 2 (study): 14 participants will receive 5 vaccines of HIVARNA01.3, 1 dose of 10-1074
           antibodies and 3 doses of romidepsin

        -  Arm 3 (study): 14 participants will receive 5 vaccines of personalized RNA vaccine
           (HIVACAR01), 1 dose of 10-1074 antibodies and 3 doses of romidepsin

        -  Arm 4 (control): 14 participants 1 dose of 10-1074 antibodies and 3 doses of romidepsin
