  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to see if Adapalene-Clindamycin Combination Gel is effective and safe in the
      treatment of acne vulgaris, compared to adapalene gel alone and clindamycin gel alone.
      Adapalene and clindamycin have been reported to have a better effect in acne treatment when
      used together. This new formulation is also easier to use as it combines two products into a
      single gel and only needs to be used once a day.
