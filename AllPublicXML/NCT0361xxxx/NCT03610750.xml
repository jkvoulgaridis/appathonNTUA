  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Global mental health (MH) and substance use disorders prevention, treatment and research gaps
      require that efficacious treatments be scaled-up, leveraging existing platforms. In tandem,
      participation of Ministries ready to apply evidence-inform policies must sustain them over
      time. PRIDE SSA may generate templates for other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) by
      conducting a state of the art scale up study in Mozambique and by establishing a
      collaborative research network of nascent research &quot;Seed Teams.&quot; Such &quot;Seed Teams,&quot; trained
      by the capacity building component, may work across the region to build capacity and conduct
      implementation research to sustainably scale-up MH services. Scale Up Research (Mozambique)
      in MH and substance use disorders will evaluate strategies and costs of scaling up an
      innovative, integrated, sustainable, stepped-care community approach. The scale up study will
      leverage: (1) Mozambique's task-shifting strategy of training psychiatric technicians (PsyTs)
      to provide MH care, (2) the WHO-funded epilepsy community care program successfully
      implemented in 5 Provinces, now primed for scale-up by the Health Ministry. The
      cost-effective approach redefines work roles without requiring new human resources.
      Importantly, it comports with the Health Ministry's plan to implement prevention and
      treatment for all MH conditions, rather than single disorders. The model employs
      evidence-based practices (EBPs; e.g. Psychopharmacology; Interpersonal Therapy), already in
      use by PsyTs to: a) establish a sustainable program delivered and supervised by non-MH
      professionals, overseen by MH specialists; b) provide community screening, care and/or
      referrals for all MH disorders; and c) use implementation tools to monitor sustainability.
      This collaborative network will scale-up a cost-effective, sustainable program and inform
      policy.

      Working in three geographically separate Mozambican provinces and in rural (N=24), peri-urban
      (i.e., rural urban transition zone; N=6), and urban (N=6) clinics, the scale-up study first
      will conduct a two-year (12 months implementation, 12 months sustainability),
      cluster-randomized, three-arm hybrid effectiveness-implementation type 1 trial, guided by
      Proctor's implementation framework. The delivery pathway showing the highest overall
      effectiveness after this two-year trial in 36 clinics will then be implemented in clinics
      from the other two arms for two additional &quot;cross-over&quot; years. Throughout the trial and the
      &quot;cross-over&quot; years, qualitative and other process data will complement structured assessments
      to examine implementation, sustainability, and scale-up.

      Scale-up PRIDES Mozambique has the following Specific Aims:

      Aim 1. To determine the most effective delivery pathway in terms of 1) implementation
      outcomes (reach, retention, pathway fidelity, cost-effectiveness); 2) service-level outcomes
      (efficiency); and 3) patient-level outcomes (function/disability, comprehensive MH screener,
      patient satisfaction). As an Exploratory Sub-Aim: To assess the impact of: pre-implementation
      stage factors (acceptability, adoption); mediators (work self-efficacy, MH literacy); and
      moderators (clinic characteristics: rural, peri-urban, urban, epilepsy program
      implementation) on implementation, services, and patient outcomes.

      Aim 2. To evaluate implementation, sustainability, and scale-up requirements of the most
      effective pathway (determined in Aim 1) in order to inform regional policies. A rigorous
      process evaluation mixed-methods approach will identify barriers and facilitators to
      implementing, sustaining, and scaling-up the most effective pathway in all clinics during the
      &quot;cross-over&quot; two years using purposive sampling for mixed-methods evaluation in a subset of
      18 clinics (6 per Province).

      Aim 3. To develop an implementation tool-kit for low-cost, feasible, and sustainable
      system-wide implementation of the most effective WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme
      (mhGAP) delivery pathway in Sub-Saharan Africa (sSA) with collaboration of Members of the
      PRIDES sSA Five-Country Council, External Advisory Board and the WHO.
