  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Complications associated with excess weight (hypertension, coronary artery disease and
      diabetes) have become major causes of morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation
      (LT). To ensure excellent long-term outcomes with LT it is critically important to understand
      the best strategies to minimize obesity and its associated complications in our patients.
      Weight loss can be achieved through dieting and exercise, but most patients are unable to
      maintain the weight loss. In the general population, bariatric surgery is much more effective
      than medical treatment for permanent weight loss and prevention or reduction of
      obesity-associated complications.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of performing sleeve
      gastrectomy (SG) procedure in the early post-LT period in obese patients.

      The patient population for this study will be anyone listed for liver transplantation at
      Toronto General Hospital (University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada) and meeting the
      current standard criteria for bariatric surgery (BMI&gt;40, or BMI&gt;35 with at least 1
      obesity-related complication).This study will randomly assign eligible participants to one of
      two groups (1:1). Patients in group 1 will receive standard lifestyle/diet counselling while
      patients in group 2 will undergo SG-specific counselling prior to transplant and the SG
      procedure within 2 weeks of LT (if safe to do so).

      All participants will be followed for 12 months.
