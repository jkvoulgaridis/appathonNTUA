  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with high standards of oral hygiene frequently search for buccal gingival recession
      (GR) treatment due to cervical wear, root sensitivity and compromising aesthetics. The
      cervical lesion (NCCL) is commonly produced by improper toothbrushing techniques, sharing the
      same etiology of GR. Many different surgical approaches have been described. The association
      of a graft to the coronally advanced flap had demonstrated the best long-term outcome for
      root coverage. But, substitutes for the autogenous graft must be studied. Therefore, the aim
      of this clinical trial was to investigate the effectiveness of the acellular dermal matrix
      graft (ADMG) in root coverage associated with a previous restored cervical lesion or not.

      Material and methods: Seventeen individuals with bilateral GR were included in the study. At
      one side, the GR must present a previously restored cervical lesion, as the test group (TG).
      The contralateral arch, must present GR with an intact root surface (CG). All patients were
      treated with the extended flap technique associated with the ADMG. All clinical parameters
      were assessed at baseline and 6-months postoperative.
