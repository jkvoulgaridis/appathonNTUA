  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present study is to evaluate the growth, safety, and tolerance in
      healthy, term infants consuming a new to market infant formula (Formula A) and a commercially
      available infant formula (Formula B) with daily weight gain as the primary outcome. As
      secondary outcomes, the study will evaluate other growth parameters, tolerance, and safety.

      This is a controlled randomized parallel assignment, masked (Participant, Care Provider,
      Investigator, Outcomes Assessor) study. Healthy infants will be assigned an Investigational
      (Formula A) experimental new milk based infant formula, or an active comparator Control
      (Formula B) Enfamil (trademark brand name) marketed milk based infant formula. The period for
      the study is 365 days (52 weeks) using repeated-measures mixed model (RMMM). Anthropometry,
      formula intake, tolerance, and stool characteristics will be assessed. Medically confirmed
      adverse events will be recorded throughout the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Infants will be eligible to participate if they meet all of the following conditions. At
        birth the infant must be:

        Only infants whose parent(s) or legal guardian(s) have decided to feed infant formula as
        the sole source of nutrition, will be approached for potential study enrollment

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Infants will be ineligible if they have any of the following conditions that are judged by
        a physician to interfere with the infant's normal growth, development, and/or tolerance to
        an infant formula:

          1. Infants showing evidence of anatomic and physiologic defects of the respiratory tract,
             or other congenital defects (as determined by the clinician)

          2. Evidence of chronic hepatic, gastrointestinal, renal, cardiac, pulmonary, or
             neurological diseases

          3. Having a maternal history with known adverse effects on the fetus and/or the newborn
             infant, such as diabetes (gestational diabetes is acceptable if infant's birth weight
             is &lt; 4300 g), active tuberculosis, perinatal infection,

          4. Having a family history of cow's milk protein intolerance/allergy

          5. Are an infant from a multiple birth (twin, triplet, etc.)
