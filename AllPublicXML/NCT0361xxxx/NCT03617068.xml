    <textblock>
      Empirically, mosturizer is used to prevent and treat many occupational dermatoses that has
      skin barrier impairment. Evidence based medicine about the effectivity of mosturizer in
      occupational dermatoses is limited. Coconut oil is one of traditional substance that is used
      as a skin care. There is study shows that coconut oil is effective for atopic dermatitis
      treatment in children. Other studies are needed to assess the effectivity coconut oil
      mosturizer cream to overcome occupational hand dermatitis.

      The aim of this study is to measure the effectivenes of coconut oil cream for batik workers
      who suffer from occupational hand dermatitis. The gloves that used as a protective equipment
      are made from rubber which have its own limitations. Therefore other interventions are needed
      to improve barrier skin.
