    <textblock>
      In implant dentistry, platform switching is a method used to preserve alveolar bone levels
      around dental implants. The concept refers to using an implant with slopped shoulder neck of
      narrower diameter on implants of wider diameter, rather than placing abutments of similar
      diameter, referred to as platform matching.The aim of the study is to compare the effect of
      bone-level implants versus the conventional implant on oral soft tissues.

      Implant prosthesis allows normal muscle function, and the implant stimulates the bone and
      maintains its dimensions in a manner similar to healthy natural teeth. Crestal bone loss can
      result in increased bacterial accumulation resulting in secondary peri-implant inflammation
      and bone loss which can further result in loss of alveolar support, which in turn can lead to
      occlusal overload resulting in implant failure. In implant dentistry, platform switching is a
      method used to preserve alveolar bone levels around dental implants. The concept refers to
      using an implant with slopped shoulder neck of narrower diameter on implants of wider
      diameter, rather than placing abutments of similar diameter, referred to as platform
      matching. The authors developed the concept of slopped shoulder implant which results in an
      inward bone creeping at the coronal part of the implant to be in continuity with the alveolar
      bone crest.

      The rational to use this type of implant allows an increase at residual crestal bone volume
      around the implant neck and has 3 merits:

        1. Reduced mechanical stress at the implant neck area;

        2. Repositioning of gingival papillae on the beveled neck implant (that is the physiologic
           condition);

        3. proper vascular supply to the implant investing structure and bone tissue also because
           of reduced inter-implant space.

      The aim of the study is to compare the effect of bone-level implants versus the conventional
      implant on oral soft tissues

    <description>soft tissue esthetics scale : Seven variables will be evaluated vs. a natural reference tooth: mesial papilla, distal papilla, soft-tissue level, soft-tissue contour, alveolar process deficiency, soft-tissue color and texture. Using a 0-1-2 scoring system, 0 being the lowest, 2 being the highest value, the maximum achievable PES is 14.</description>

    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>bone loss around implant neck will be measured using (CBCT) cone beam computed tomography. On CBCT scans, the amount of bone resorption in the buccal, lingual/palatal, mesial and distal surfaces will be determined by measuring the distance from the platform of the implant to the alveolar crest (normal group: 0-1.5mm, mild bone loss: 1.6-3mm, moderate bone loss: 3.1-4.5mm and severe bone loss: &gt;4.5mm)</description>
