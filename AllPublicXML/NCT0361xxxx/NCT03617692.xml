  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the feasibility of a human observational study of
      orally administered cannabis use among cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tightly controlled experimental laboratory studies (e.g., clinical trials with randomization)
      using Cannabis products available in state-regulated markets are simply, at this point, not
      possible owing largely to federal law and the University requirements related to the
      Controlled Substances Act and Drug Free Schools and Communities Act. Because a traditional
      clinical trial design is not possible given the current federal status of Cannabis products,
      this investigator will use a patient-oriented, prospective observational design.
      Specifically, individuals who have already decided to try Cannabis for their cancer
      treatment-related symptoms will initiate use of an orally administered product they have
      selected. A research assistant will provide information on the range of edible cannabis
      products and basic information about their various cannabinoid profiles, approximate prices,
      and nearby locations where participants may choose to purchase their product. The
      participants will then purchase the product and decide how often and how much to use. This
      approach is consistent with federal law and supported by our preliminary and ongoing
      studies(1R01AT009541-01, 1R01DA044131-01, CDPHE2902, R01DA039707). Patients will take the
      product as they see fit, without any frequency or dosing instructions from study staff, for
      two weeks, at which time they will be scheduled for their session in our mobile pharmacology
      and phlebotomy lab (Ta1-Tc1) so that we may examine the acute effects of the product. The
      Mobile Lab session will take place at a location of their choosing up to 90 minutes
      drive-time away from the CUChange Lab. The final follow-up will be one month later via an
      online survey sent directly to the participant via email.
