    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the Inveniaâ„¢ Automated Breast Ultrasound
      (ABUS) device, as an adjunct to Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT), improves breast cancer
      detection in women with dense breasts. The study aims to collect information about cancer
      detection, treatment, and outcomes based on individual and combined technologies in patients
      who receive ABUS exams in addition to DBT. The results of this study are intended to be used
      to extend understanding of ABUS as an adjunct in DBT screening in patients with dense
      breasts.

  <detailed_description>

      Following consenting procedures, subjects will undergo standard of care DBT of both breasts
      or of one breast if they have had prior uni-lateral mastectomy. Subjects will also undergo
      ABUS of both breasts or of one breast if they have had prior uni-lateral mastectomy. These
      imaging exams will be done per the sites routine practice, and can be done in any order.

      Images will be read and assessed by one (1) Mammography Quality Standards Act
      (MQSA)-qualified reader. The evaluating radiologist will use the image reconstruction views
      appropriate for the evaluation, per his or her medical judgment, and handle diagnostic
      evaluations in accordance with the standard of care at the investigational site. The DBT
      images will be read and assessed first and independent of ABUS images. DBT plus ABUS will
      then be read per routine practice and assessed. Images will not be read until both imaging
      exams have been completed.

      If screening shows a suspicious finding, subjects will receive standard of care follow-up and
      appropriate workup, which may include biopsy (as needed), to determine cancer status.
      Subjects will be followed at approximately one year (11- to 16-months) unless negative
      histopathology with image concordance or positive cancer status is histologically determined
      prior to one-year follow-up. Follow up procedures will be conducted as per the sites standard
      of care.
