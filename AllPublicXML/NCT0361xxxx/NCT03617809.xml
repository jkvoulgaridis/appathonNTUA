  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothermia is a frequent perioperative complication. Its appearance can have deleterious
      effects such as perioperative bleeding or surgical site infection. Once the temperature has
      decreased, its treatment is difficult.

      Preoperative warming prevents hypothermia, lowering the temperature gradient between core and
      peripheral compartments and reducing thermal redistribution. The most recent clinical
      practice guidelines advocate for active prewarming before induction of general anaesthesia
      since it is very effective in preventing perioperative hypothermia. However, the ideal
      warming time prior to the induction of anesthesia has long been investigated. This study aims
      to evaluate if different time periods of preoperative forced-air warming reduces the
      incidence of hypothermia at the end of surgery in patients submitted to laparoscopic
      urological surgery under general anesthesia. This is an observational prospective study
      comparing routine practice of pre-warming in consecutive surgical patients scheduled to
      laparoscopic prostatectomy or nephrectomy between August and December 2018. In this study 64
      - 96 patients will be included and prewarming will be applied following routine clinical
      practice. The prewarming time will depend on the time the patient has to wait before entering
      in the operating theatre. Measurement of temperature will be performed using an esophagic
      thermometer. Patients will be followed throughout their hospital admission. Data will be
      recorded using a validated instrument and will be analysed using the statistics program R
      Core Team.

      Maintaining patient's temperature above 36 grades Celsius throughout the perioperative period
      is challenging. Thus, it is essential to monitor temperature in order to be able to take
      measures to avoid the appearance of hypothermia. Once the temperature has decreased, its
      treatment is difficult since the application of heat to the body surface takes a long time to
      reach the core thermal compartment. Intraoperative warming alone cannot avoid postoperative
      hypothermia. The application of forced-air warming system during the preoperative period has
      been shown to be the most effective measure to prevent hypothermia and maintain
      intraoperative normothermia. However, long time periods of prewarming would not be efficient.
      Thus, the ideal warming time prior to the induction of anesthesia has long been investigated.

      Due to the searching of optimal prewarming time, the conductance of this study is justified.
