    <textblock>
      Patients will be enrolled in two stages:

        -  Dose-escalation stage: Approximately 12-24 patients will be enrolled.

        -  Dose-expansion stage: 6-12 patients will be enrolled. Dose-escalation slots will be
           filled first, then dose-expansion slots.

      Detailed Description:

        -  Dose-escalation stage : designed as classical 3+3 to determine MTD(Maximum tolerable
           dose), RP2D(Recommended Phase 2 Dose) and DLT(Dose-limiting toxicity)s to evaluate
           approximately four dose levels of GX-I7

             -  pre-determined dose(Level I)~ pre-determined dose(Level IV)

        -  Dose-expansion stage : designed to enroll additional 6-12 patients to acquire additional
           safety and pharmacodynamic data to more fully inform the dose selection for
           RP2D(Recommended Phase 2 Dose)
