  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both acute ingestion (1-3 h) and chronic supplementation (3-30 days) with dietary nitrate has
      been shown to increase nitric oxide activity and, in some studies, to improve exercise
      economy, exercise tolerance, and endurance exercise performance. In addition, more recent
      evidence suggests that dietary nitrate has the potential to enhance team-sport-specific
      high-intensity intermittent exercise performance. Indeed, chronic dietary nitrate
      supplementation (2-6 days) has been reported to increase the distance covered before
      exhaustion during the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery level 1 test, a well-established and
      ecologically valid test widely used to mimic the high-intensity running bouts of soccer
      match-play. However, while these findings suggest that nitrate may be an effective ergogenic
      aid for team-sport players when consumed daily, it is currently unclear if the improvement in
      team-sport specific intermittent exercise performance can be achieved following a single
      bolus of dietary nitrate. Given the increasing interest and use of dietary nitrate as an
      ergogenic aid by team-sport players, establishing the shortest period of supplementation
      required to elicit an ergogenic effect is important in order to guide athletes on optimal
      supplementation strategies.

      Given that a single bolus of dietary nitrate has previously been shown to improve exercise
      tolerance and endurance exercise performance, and an improved Yo-Yo IR1 performance has been
      observed after chronic nitrate supplementation, the investigator hypothesizes that acute (2
      h) and short-term (4 days) nitrate supplementation will significantly elevate nitric oxide
      activity (measured as an increase in plasma nitrite concentration and skeletal muscle nitrate
      concentration) and improve performance during the Yo-Yo IR1 test (measured as an increased in
      distance covered (m) during the test at the point of volitional exhaustion) to a similar
      extent, when compared to a placebo.
