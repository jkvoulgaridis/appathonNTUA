    <textblock>
      Histological transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a rare complication which may
      occur in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. In this multicenter study, we retrospectively
      analyzed the clinico-biological features, therapy, outcomes and prognostic factors in 77
      Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia patients with biopsy-proven transformation to diffuse large
      B-cell lymphoma.

      Histological transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a rare complication which may
      occur in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. In this multicenter study, we retrospectively
      analyzed the clinico-biological features, therapy, outcomes and prognostic factors in 77
      Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM) patients with biopsy-proven transformation to diffuse
      large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

      We retrospectively searched the databases of French and Belgian centers for patients older
      than 18 years diagnosed with WM and a concurrent or sequential diagnosis of DLBCL between
      1995 and 2016. Nineteen centers belonging to the French Innovative Leukemia Organization
      (FILO) group participated in this study. Patients with a diagnosis of indolent lymphoma other
      than WM were excluded. The diagnosis of WM was based on criteria established in the Second
      International Workshop on WM. Clinical, biological data and prognostic scores were recorded.
      Quantitative variables were expressed as median and range and qualitative variables as number
      and percentages. Multivariate analyses using cox proportional hazard model were conducted to
      investigate the factors independently related to progression-free survival and overall
      survival.
