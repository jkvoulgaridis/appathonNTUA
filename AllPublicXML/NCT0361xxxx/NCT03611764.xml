  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will address whether teaching the Body Scan exercise to cancer patients with
      hematological malignancies and their caregivers during an inpatient hospitalization improves
      reported physical and psychological symptoms after a two-week period. Giving patients and
      caregivers the opportunity to learn mindfulness and the tools to practice on their own is
      expected to lead to a decrease in stress and anxiety, and help empower patients and
      caregivers to better cope with stress in the future.

    <description>The mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) of the Body Scan is expected to take 20 minutes
Participants will then be guided through the Body Scan. Beginning with awareness of sensations of the left toe, patients will be asked to observe these sensations without judgment, simply noticing and allowing them. Awareness of sensations will continue up through the left leg, then from the right toe up the right leg, then abdomen and chest, then fingertips to arms, then neck, and finally the head. After completing the Body Scan, participants will be given several minutes of quiet to reflect upon how they feel. After opening their eyes, participants will be given the opportunity to discuss and ask questions.
Caregivers will be encouraged to practice with the patient or on their own, in an additional space on the floor called the Zen Den</description>

    <description>-All efforts will be made to normalize their experience: for example, the desire to open their eyes, thinking about other things, wanting to move around - these are all normal and participants will be encouraged to become interested in and curious about, and to allow these natural tendencies</description>

    <description>39 Likert-scale items, including physical and psychological symptoms (30 questions), daily function (8 questions), and overall valuation of life (one question)
For the 30 questions pertaining to symptoms, the four-item Likert scale ranges from 'not at all=1' to 'very much=4'; the higher the total score, the greater the score, the higher the level of distress. The single question pertaining to overall valuation of life asks participants to circle one of the seven items, ranked from &quot;extremely poor&quot; to &quot;excellent&quot;</description>
