      The aim of this study is to determine if and how the &quot;Probiotic Product&quot; affects functional
      brain responses in healthy subjects during an emotional- and arithmetic stress task,
      respectively and in terms of microbe-brain-gut interactions.

      In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study, n=22 healthy subjects will receive
      the following interventions in a crossover fashion, separated by a 4-week wash-out period: 1)
      Probiotic Formula, 2) placebo. After baseline assessments, study participants will start with
      a 4-week intervention with the study product or the placebo, followed by a 4-week wash-out
      period and a subsequent 4-week intervention period (placebo or study product, respectively).
      fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) scanning during two validated stress tasks will
      be performed after each of the intervention periods (week 4 and week 12). At the same time
      points and in addition on the days before the 1st and 2nd intervention (baseline 1 and 2),
      saliva, blood and faecal samples will be collected. Questionnaire data will be collected and
      psychological tests and instruments will be performed. For one week at baseline and during
      the intervention periods (last week), subjects will wear actigraphs to record their physical
      activity and help assess sleep quality. At baseline, subjects will undergo a carbon dioxide
      (CO2) challenge test as well as a food diary to record dietary habits.
