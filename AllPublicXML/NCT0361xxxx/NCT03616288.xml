  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beriberi is a potentially fatal disease caused by vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency that still
      occurs in Southeast Asia despite near eradication elsewhere. Mothers with a diet low in
      thiamine produce thiamine-poor milk, putting their infants at a high risk of developing
      thiamine deficiency and beriberi. There is also a growing body of evidence suggesting
      thiamine deficiency not severe enough to cause clinical symptoms may negatively effect
      cognitive development and functioning of the infant. Since human milk should be the sole
      source of nutrition for babies during the first six months, maternal thiamine intake must be
      improved to combat this disease.

      The investigators' recent study of thiamine-fortified fish sauce in Cambodia showed that
      fortification could increase maternal and infant thiamine status'. However, centrally
      produced fish sauce may not reach the poorest communities who make their own fish sauce, and
      fish sauce is not consumed in all regions where we find thiamine deficiency. Salt, by
      contrast, is a common condiment in most regions of the world and has proven to be a
      successful global fortification vehicle for iodine.

      Suboptimal maternal thiamine intake puts exclusively breastfed infants at risk of low
      thiamine status, impaired cognitive development, and infantile beriberi, which can be fatal.
      Thiamine fortification of salt is a potentially low-cost and sustainable means of combating
      suboptimal thiamine status; however knowledge gaps must be filled before thiamine
      fortification can proceed. In this study, mothers will consume thiamine supplements in order
      to model the thiamine dose required to optimize human milk thiamine concentrations for the
      prevention of beriberi. Other thiamine biomarkers will be assessed, and usual salt intake
      will be measured. Finally, the investigators will assess the effects of early-life thiamine
      exposure on infant neuro-cognitive development.

Score notes for Visual Paired Comparison task
Scale ranges: An overall novelty score is calculated that averages across all face and pattern trials, and is a percentage reflecting the percent of time infants' looked at the novel item during the test phase, calculated as the duration looking to the novel item divided by the sum of the duration of looking to the novel item plus the duration looking to the familiar item.
Sub-scales: Two sub-scales are calculated: the novelty score averaged across face trials, and the novelty score averaged across pattern trials. The total scale composite averages the novelty score across the two sub-scales.
For all scales, he range is 0-100%, and higher novelty scores indicate better outcomes.</description>
