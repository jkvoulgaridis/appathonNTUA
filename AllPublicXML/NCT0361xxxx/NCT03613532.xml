  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial involves individuals who have been diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia
      (AML), Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML), or
      MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm-unclassifiable (MDS/MPN-unclassifiable) and are planning to
      have an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (&quot;bone marrow transplant&quot;). The goal of
      this research study is to (1) test the safety of adding the study drug, Venetoclax, to a
      standard of care conditioning regimen for bone marrow transplantation as a possible means of
      eliminating residual (left-over) disease prior to transplant and (2) to test the safety of
      combination Venetoclax and azacitidine as &quot;maintenance therapy&quot; after transplant to possibly
      prevent disease recurrence.

        -  The name of the study drug involved in this study is Venetoclax.

        -  It is expected that about 38 people will take part in this research study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an
           investigational drug and tries to define the appropriate dose and schedule of the
           investigational drug to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug
           is being studied.

        -  There are two parts to this research study:

             -  Part 1 is to determine a safe dose of the study drug, Venetoclax, when given in
                combination with a standard chemotherapy and Part 2 is to determine the safety of
                post-transplant maintenance therapy with the combination of azacytidine and
                venetoclax. Participants enrolled in Part 1 of this study, will receive Venetoclax
                in combination with conditioning chemotherapy (prior to transplantation).

             -  Participants enrolled in Part 2 of the study, will also receive Venetoclax in
                combination with conditioning chemotherapy (prior to transplantation) and will have
                the opportunity to receive maintenance chemotherapy (after transplantation) for
                potentially a year.

        -  Both Part 1 and Part 2 of this research study will have a Dose-Escalation phase. The
           Dose-Escalation phase is the part of the study where treatment dose and schedule are
           being tested.

             -  In Part 1, the Dose-Escalation phase is when venetoclax will be given at different
                doses until the safest maximum dose has been identified. Part 1 also includes a
                second phase of the study which is called the Dose-Expansion phase, during which
                more participants will be treated at this dose level to obtain additional
                information on safety.

             -  In Part 2, the Dose-Escalation phase is where the combination of venetoclax and
                azacitidine will be given after transplantation at different schedules.

             -  For both the Dose-Escalation or Dose-Expansion phase of this study, there will be a
                screening period, a pre-transplant period, a transplant period, and a
                post-transplant follow up period.

        -  In this research study, participants will receive venetoclax plus chemotherapy.
           Participants in Part 1 and Part 2 of this study will receive chemotherapy immediately
           prior to transplantation, which is called the &quot;conditioning regimen.&quot; The conditioning
           regimen chemotherapy will suppress the immune system and may help to destroy cancer
           cells. During this process normal bone marrow cells are destroyed as well, thus making
           way for donor stem cells.

             -  Fludarabine and busulfan (FluBu2) are both chemotherapies and a common conditioning
                regimen.

             -  In this study, Venetoclax is added to the conditioning regimen (FluBu2) prior to
                transplantation to eliminate leftover blood cancer cells prior to transplant.

             -  Participants in Part 2 of the study will also have the opportunity to receive
                venetoclax plus azacitidine after transplantation. The combination of these two
                drugs is called &quot;maintenance therapy,&quot; which is treatment given after transplant to
                potentially reduce the chance of disease relapse. Relapse is a cause of transplant
                failure and can occur when there are leftover blood cancer cells.

        -  The FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved Venetoclax in combination with
           cytarabine, azacitidine or decitabine for the treatment of newly diagnosed acute myeloid
           leukemia, but not for use in with conditioning chemotherapy prior to transplantation or
           after transplant with maintenance chemotherapy. Venetoclax is an oral drug that
           selectively inhibits Bcl-2, which is critical for keeping cancer cells alive.

             with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere
             with the interpretation of study results and/or would make the patient inappropriate
             for enrollment into this study.

          -  Patients with known active hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection should be excluded
             because of potential effects on immune function and/or drug interactions. However, if
             a patient has HBV history with an undetectable HBV load by polymerase chain reaction
             (PCR), no liver-related complications, and is on definitive HBV therapy that is not
             contraindicated on this study, then he/she would be eligible for study.

          -  Patients with known active hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. However, if a patient
             with a history of HCV infection has received definitive therapy (and is now HCV viral
             load negative), or if a patient has a reactive HCV antibody test but has an
             undetectable viral load by PCR, then he/she would be eligible.

          -  Patients with known active HIV infection out of concern for the drug-drug interaction
             with venetoclax and HAART therapy.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women or those intending to become pregnant during the study
             or within 3 months after the final dose of study treatment are excluded from this
             study. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             resulted during screening and repeated within 7 days prior to study drug (local labs
             are allowed).

          -  Vaccination with live, attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study
             treatment or anticipation of need for such a vaccine during the study.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled infection at time of first dose of treatment on study.
             Patients receiving anti-microbial agents including antibiotics, antiviral and
             antifungal therapies are allowed if hemodynamically stable.

          -  Part 2 only: Patients recommended to receive FLT3 inhibitor therapy or any other
             antileukemic therapy for AML as maintenance post allo-HCT.

        Part 2 Eligibility Criteria:

          -  No DLT event (including delay in neutrophil engraftment) due to the addition of
             venetoclax to conditioning chemotherapy prior to start of maintenance therapy.

          -  No morphologic evidence of relapse (defined as 5% or more morphologic blasts) prior to
             start of maintenance therapy confirmed by bone marrow biopsy after day +28.

          -  ANC ≥ 1.0 K/uL without growth factor support and platelet level ≥ 50 K/uL without
             platelet transfusion within 7 days of starting maintenance therapy. Exception:
             Patients without morphologic evidence of disease relapse but with evidence of
             persistent molecular or cytogenetic residual disease at the time of assessment can
             start maintenance therapy as long as ANC ≥ 0.75 K/uL without growth factor support and
             platelet level ≥ 25 K/uL.

          -  Absence of overall grade II-IV acute GVHD per investigator. Upon acute GVHD
             resolution, patients are eligible. Patients that are on prednisone 0.5 mg/kg daily
             dose or lower are allowed to initiate maintenance.

          -  Total bilirubin less than or equal to 2 x institutional ULN (unless has known
             Gilbert's disease).

          -  AST and ALT less than or equal to 3 x ULN.

          -  Cr Cl ≥ 30 mL/min or higher (Cockgroft Gault formula).

          -  No concurrent illnesses that would prevent taking oral therapy and interfere with
             safety assessment.
