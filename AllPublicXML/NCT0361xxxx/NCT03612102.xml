  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This goal of this study is to evaluate an intensive group behavioral treatment (IGBT) program
      for children with selective mutism, a low base-rate childhood anxiety disorder. 29 children
      between the ages of 5 and 9 will be randomly assigned to participate in a 5-day IGBT over the
      summer or to a waitlist control condition, with the opportunity to participate in IGBT 4
      weeks later. All children that participate in treatment will be followed up 8 weeks into the
      following school year.

    <intervention_model_description>Families of children with selective mutism will be randomly assigned to receive either immediate intensive group behavioral treatment (IGBT) or to a waitlist with psychoeducational materials, and then IGBT.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impressions Scales - Improvement (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-I is the most widely used clinician-rated measure of treatment-related changes in functioning (Guy &amp; Bonato, 1970) and will be completed by masked independent evaluators in the present study. The CGI-I rates clinical improvement on a 7-point scale, ranging from 1 (&quot;very much improved&quot;) to 7 (&quot;very much worse&quot;).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Children (ADIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The ADIS is is a semi-structured diagnostic interview that assesses child psychopathology in accordance with DSM criteria. From the ADIS, clinical severity ratings are generated by independent evaluators (IEs) to determine severity of selective mutism and social anxiety disorder. IE's also determine presence of diagnosis, which was also a main outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Selective Mutism Questionnaire (SMQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The SMQ is a parent-report measure of selective mutism/verbal behaviors in various settings. Two subscales were used for the purpose of this study, the &quot;Social&quot; subscale (&quot;social&quot; scores are a sum of 5 items with scores ranging from 0-15) and the &quot;Home&quot; subscale (&quot;home&quot; scores are a sum of 6 items with scores ranging from 0-18). Lower scores indicate less verbal behavior, and higher scores indicate more verbal behavior.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS; Shaffer et al., 1983) is a widely used measure of overall child disturbance, providing a clinician-rated index of functioning. Scores range from 0-100, with lower scores indicating greater functional impairments.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The CBCL is a parent-report general measure assessing multiple problems of childhood. Subscales are standardized by age and gender. The &quot;Anxiety Problems&quot; Subscale t-score will be used as an outcome measure for the purpose of this study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>School Speech Questionnaire (SSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The SSQ is a brief measure given to teachers to assess verbal behavior in the school setting. The SSQ generates a total score, which is a sum of 7 items. Scores range from 0-21, with lower scores indicating less verbal behavior, and higher scores indicating more verbal behavior.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impairment Rating Scale (IRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The IRS is a brief teacher-report scale of how much a child's &quot;problems&quot; are interfering with their social and academic functioning in the school setting. The IRS consists of 7 items, with 6 of the items being rated on a scale from 0-6, with higher scores being more indicative of a worst problem. The 6 items are summed to form a total score which ranges from 0 to 36, with higher scores indicating worse problems.</description>

    <description>The waitlist consists of a 4-week waitlist period where parents will be provided with psychoeducational materials about their child's condition (i.e., selective mutism). After the 4-week waitlist period, families will be provided with the opportunity to participate in IGBT.</description>
