  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the use of new technologies in &quot;biofeedback gaming&quot; and their
      potential for use as a treatment for stress and anxiety. Biofeedback training is typically
      accomplished through devices that measure heartrate variability (HRV), galvanic skin response
      (GSR), or electroencephalogram (EEG). Typically, the use of this equipment requires a
      practitioner with specialized training in reading and interpreting HRV, GSR, and/or EEG.
      However, recent advances in technology have made biofeedback devices more readily available
      to the general public, and some commercial devices are now being sold. This study
      investigates the utility of these commercial devices with a mild clinical population. In this
      study, participants use two tools for biofeedback training, one is called &quot;The Pip,&quot;
      described in Group C, below, and another is a computer game called Nevermind, described in
      Groups A and B, below. These are compared against a control group (group D), which is
      standard relaxation training without biofeedback.

    <description>1) Group A is a biofeedback plus gaming group. Participants in this group play a horror videogame called Nevermind, while also wearing a chest strap heart rate monitor. The object of the videogame is to assist a patient by entering his/her mind and helping him/her work through some trauma memories. The way the game works is that the more anxious players are, the faster their heart beats, and the faster the heart beats, the harder and scarier the game gets. Thus, in order for one to do well in the game, he or she has to learn how to control the heartbeat and stress through relaxation. A therapist will help people in this group to learn relaxation techniques to help calm their body and finish the game.</description>

    <description>2) Group B is a gaming only group. Like Group A, participants in this group play a Nevermind, but this time they do not wear a heart rate monitor. A therapist will still be present to help people in this group to learn relaxation techniques to help calm themselves during game play, but in this case the game does not change based on heart rate.</description>

    <description>3) Group C is a biofeedback only group. In Group C, participants use a device called The Pip that measures Galvanic Skin Response. The Pip interacts with a few basic apps used in this study to teach relaxation. In one app, players control flying dragons. The more relaxed players are (as measured by GSR), the higher and faster their dragon flies. In another app, players control the changing of seasons. The more relaxed players are, the faster they can make seasons change from winter to spring. In another app, players can watch a simple graph of their stress over a period of time. Participants can learn to decrease stress by learning to make the line on the graph go down. In Group C, a therapist will also be present with participants to help them learn techniques to reduce stress.</description>

    <description>Participants receive relaxation training from a trained therapist with biofeedack through The Pip device. The Pip connects with 4 apps, The Loom, Relax &amp; Race, PipStressTracker, and Clarity. All 4 will be used in this study. Participants receive 2 30-minute sessions per week, for 4 weeks, for a total of 8 sessions.</description>

    <description>Intervention is identical to the &quot;Biofeedback plus gaming (Nevermind)&quot; intervention, but in this case participants play Nevermind without any biofeedback. Thus, they receive 2 30-minute sessions of relaxation training per week, for 4 weeks, totaling 8 sessions. During relaxation training, they will play the Nevermind game, but without attaching to any biofeedback devices.</description>
