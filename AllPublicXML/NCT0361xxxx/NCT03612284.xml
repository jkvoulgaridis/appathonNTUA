  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical ocular compatibility (feasibility of
      safety and efficacy) of a patented solution (US Patent 2,259,437, Stone) which contains
      multiple essential ions and has a pH and tonicity which more closely mimics human tears as
      compared to the subjects' current habitual scleral lens insertion solution.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sterile solution is provided by prescription for each patient by a local compounding
      pharmacy in unit dose containers. The initial exposure - filling the posterior bowl of the
      scleral contact lens by the Investigator and applying the lens to the eye - will be monitored
      in the office for one hour, prior to any dispensing of the solution to the patient for their
      use at home or work.

      This is a one week, unmasked comparison of the new solution to the subject's habitual
      solution used for scleral lens insertion. The (historical) control is the saline habitually
      used by the subjects.

      The sample size is determined to be manageable to insure close supervision of the subjects in
      these initial trials and to inform us for future safety and efficacy trials.

      The primary safety outcome measure will be slit lamp examination of the ocular anterior
      segment and the secondary outcome measure will be photo-documentation by ocular coherence
      tomography of the clouding of the tears between the cornea and scleral contact lens. The
      primary efficacy outcome will be ocular comfort as assessed by questionnaire.

    <description>Scleral lens insertion solution study. This is not an interventional study, but a study to test a new contact lens solution. Primary FDA Classification: 21 CFR 886.5928 Soft (Hydrophilic) Contact Lens Care Products Product Code: LPN
Secondary FDA Classification: 21 CFR 886.5918 - Rigid gas permeable contact lens care products Product Code: MRC
The FDA has previously made risk determinations (class II, non-significant risk) for devices classified under 21 CFR 886.5928 and 21 CFR 886.5918. As a non-significant risk device, the GatorFil Contact Lens Saline Solution is exempt from the IDE regulation (21 CFR 812).</description>

    <description>This contact lens solution is being tested for safety and comfort and is not an &quot;intervention.&quot; Subjects will have their scleral contact lenses filled with the test saline in the examination room and applied to their eyes. They will be monitored for symptoms and will be examined. Six to 8 hours later or whenever their lens clouding typically occurs they will return for further assessment and dispensing of solution if acceptable. subjects will use the solution for 5-9 days and return for a follow-up appointment. At each visit, subjects will complete an OSDI questionnaire and a Current Symptoms questionnaire.</description>
