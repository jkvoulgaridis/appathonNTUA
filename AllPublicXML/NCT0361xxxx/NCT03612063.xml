  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to compare four different heart rate monitors (Apple Watch
      Nike III,Fitbit Iconic, Garmin Vivosmart HR, Tom Tom Spark 3) to an Electrocardiograph (ECG)
      machine to determine the accuracy of the devices. Over the last two decades, there has been a
      proliferation of commercially available heart rate monitors. Elite athletes often use heart
      rate measurements to monitor training and fitness levels. In response, fitness companies have
      offered a variety of heart rate monitors to the general public. Previously, chest strap
      monitors that measured electrical activity were mainly used to track heart rates. More
      recently, wrist-worn monitors that use an optical sensor (light) to measure heart rate have
      gained in popularity. While the accuracy of chest strap monitors has been studied, there is
      currently no data concerning the accuracy of wrist-worn heart rate monitors. Assessment of
      the monitors' accuracy is important for subjects who rely upon the heart rate measurements to
      guide their athletic activity.

      In 2018, worldwide sales of wearable fitness monitors are anticipated to exceed 110 million.
      Millions of consumers purchase fitness trackers that include heart rate monitors in order to
      help them to maintain their health and wellness. As popularity of these fitness devices
      grows, assessment and awareness of the accuracy of heart rate measurements becomes
      increasingly important.

      In previous trials, the investigators assessed the accuracy of 4 wrist-worn HR monitors
      (Apple Watch, Fitbit Blaze, Garmin Forerunner 235, TomTom Spark Cardio) in healthy adult
      volunteers during various types of exercise. The investigators discovered that the accuracy
      varied with exercise type. With the treadmill, all devices were acceptable (rc =.88-.93)
      except the Fitbit Blaze (rc=.76). While biking, the Garmin and Apple Watch were acceptable
      (rc &gt;.8). On the elliptical trainer without arm levers, only the Apple Watch provided
      accurate readings (rc=.94). None of the devices gave accurate readings for the elliptical
      trainer with arm levers (rc &lt;.8). That study is now published.

      Reviewers of the investigator's previous work raised an important question: how do commercial
      optical heart rate monitors perform when measuring heart rate in athletes performing at a
      high level of exertion? This study addresses that question.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of four heart rate monitors in
      accomplished athletes (i.e. runners) performing at various levels of exertion, including a
      high level of exertion.

    <intervention_model_description>The five heart rate monitors that will be assessed in this study include the Apple Watch Nike III, Fitbit Iconic, Garmin Vivosmart HR, TomTom Spark 3, and Polar H7 heart rate sensor. During testing, participants will wear two different wrist-worn heart rate monitors, the Polar H7 heart rate sensor, and will be connected to an ECG machine. Participants will be assigned, by chance to one of six groups:
Fitbit Iconic HR and Garmin Vivosmart HR
Fitbit Iconic HR and TomTom Spark 3
Fitbit Iconic HR and Apple Watch III
Apple Watch III and Garmin Vivosmart HR
Apple Watch III and TomTom Spark 3

    <description>HR monitor values on each of the two wrist watches will be recorded along with the HR found on the Polar chest strap and ECG. In each running condition, heart rate will be assessed at 2 minutes of activity in order to ensure that a steady state heart rate has been achieved.</description>
