      Hestia3 will evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ticagrelor versus placebo in
      children with SCD during treatment for at least 12 months and up to approximately 24 months.

        -  The target population are children aged ≥2 to &lt;18 years of age and body weight of ≥12 kg
           diagnosed with HbSS or HbS/β0 confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography or
           hemoglobin electrophoresis. At least 50 evaluable patients should be recruited in each
           of the age groups, ≥2 years to &lt;12 years and ≥12 years to &lt;18 years.

        -  To be eligible for the study, patients must have experienced at least 2 VOCs (defined as
           painful crisis and/or ACS) events in the past 12 months prior to Visit 1, indicating
           that the severity of the patient's disease justifies preventive chronic long-term
           treatment. The intent is to enroll only children aged 2 years or above, since VOCs
           become more frequent with age.

        -  Study participants should receive standard of care for SCD, adjusted to the individual
           patient at the discretion of the investigator, including routine health care screening
           examinations and immunizations according to local guidelines and health care
           programmers. Study drug will be given on the background of standard treatments for SCD.
           Study participants are not withheld from any other treatments that may be used in SCD
           (eg., hydroxyurea) during the trial, which is important considering the use of a placebo
           control group. However, restrictions apply to some medications and interventions that
           may be necessary for the patient's health and well-being during the study.

        -  Patients are to be followed up to 24 months or until a common study end date is reached
           defined as 12 months after the last patient is randomised. The expected average
           follow-up is 18 months. Considering inclusion of patients with at least 2 VOC events in
           the past year, this treatment duration is considered long enough to evaluate effects on
           VOC events as well as to capture safety and tolerability data supporting a potential
           future long term use of ticagrelor.

        -  Due to ticagrelor mechanism of action and the potential to reduce symptoms caused by
           ischemia during a vaso-occlusion, a composite endpoint with painful crises and/or ACS
           has been selected for the primary endpoint. Painful crisis is the most common reason for
           emergency department visits for patients with SCD with a significant impact on young
           patients' lives, affecting them physically and emotionally. Secondary endpoints are
           included to broaden the understanding of effects in patients with SCD and to also assess
           potential benefits on symptomatic disease burden and health-related quality of life
           (HRQL).

        -  Patients will be treated with 15, 30 and 45 mg bd or matching placebo, depending on body
           weight.

    <description>Vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) defined as the composite of a painful crisis and/or an Acute Chest Syndrome (ACS) . Each component is defined as:
A painful crisis is an onset or worsening of pain that lasts at least 2 hours, for which there is no explanation other than vaso-occlusion and which requires therapy with oral or parenteral opioids, parenteral NSAIDs, or other analgesics prescribed by a health care provider in a medical setting (such as a hospital, clinic or emergency room visit) or at home.
An ACS is an acute illness characterized by fever and/or respiratory symptoms, accompanied by a new pulmonary infiltrate on a chest X-ray.</description>

    <measure>Health-related quality of life (HRQL) score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The HRQL will be assessed using the PedsQL SCD (Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory) Model and Multidimensional Fatigue Scale. The SCD consists of 43 items and measures problems with the patients' pain (severity, impact, management/control), worry, emotions, treatment and communication. There are 4 age group questionnaires: 1st: age 13-18 (teen report), 2nd age 8-12 (child report), 3rd age 5-7 (young child report), 4th age 2-4 (parent report for toddlers). 5-point Likert scale from 0 (Never) to 4 (Almost always). Items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale as follows: 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0. Higher scores indicate lower problems. The SCD module measures 9 sub-scales and a total score. Items are reverse-scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale (0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0), so that higher scores indicate better HRQOL. Scale Scores are computed as the sum of the items divided by the number of items answered (this accounts for missing data).</description>

    <description>Fatigue total score. By dimension using the PedsQL (Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory) Multidimensional Fatigue Scale (age appropriate versions: 2-4 years; 5-7 years; 8-12 years; 13-18 years). There are 4 age group questionnaires: 1st: age 13-18 (teen report-ACUTE version), 2nd age 8-12 (child report ACUTE version), 3rd age 5-7 (young child report), 4th age 2-4 (parent report for toddlers). 5-point Likert scale from 0 (Never) to 4 (Almost always) 3-point scale: 0 (Not at all), 2 (Sometimes) and 4 (A lot) for the Child Report for Young Children (ages 5-7). Scores are transformed on a scale from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate lower problems. The Multidimensional Fatigue Scale consists of 18 items measuring problems with general, sleep/rest and cognitive fatigue. The Multidimensional Fatigue scale measure 3 sub-scales and a total score. The scales are scored similarly to the SCD Module scales, with higher scores indicating better HRQOL (lower fatigue).</description>

The total FLACC score will then range between 0 and 10, with 0 representing no pain. For patient from 5 to 18 years of age, the Faces Pain Scale - Revised (FPS-R) will be administered. The scale consists of 6 faces and scoring ranges between 0 and 10 (with an increase in numeric value by 2 (i.e., 0, 2,4, 6, 8, 10), where 0 is no pain and 10 is very much pain.)</description>

For patients 2-4 years of age an observer's assessment of the patient's behavior (not a scale), including willingness to swallow, will be performed directly after the patient has received the IP]. An observer will have an option to choose from: swallowed without problem, some resistance but did swallow, spit out some / all of medication, vomited up medication.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provision of signed and dated informed consent prior to any study specific procedures
             not part of standard medical care (local regulations and international guidelines are
             to be followed in determining the assent/consent requirements for children).

          2. Male or female paediatric patients aged ≥2 to &lt;18 years and body weight of ≥12 kg (at
             Visit 1), diagnosed with HbSS or HbS/β0 as confirmed by high-performance liquid
             chromatography or haemoglobin electrophoresis.

             Note: Diagnosis of SCD (if not confirmed prior to screening and records available on
             the medical file) should be confirmed for HbSS or HbS/β0 by high-performance liquid
             chromatography or haemoglobin electrophoresis, performed at the site's local lab, in
             order to confirm the type of mutation.

          3. Have experienced at least 2 VOCs (painful crisis and/or ACS) as judged by the
             Investigator in the past 12 months prior to Visit 1. These VOCs need to be documented
             in the patient's medical records or in other documents that can be reconciled.

          4. If ≤16 years old, must have had transcranial Doppler (TCD) within the past year prior
             to Visit 1. If this is not the case, a TCD examination must be done before proceeding
             in the study.

          5. If ≥10 years old, must have had an ophthalmological examination within the past year
             prior to Visit 1. If this is not the case, the patient must be examined by an
             ophthalmologist before proceeding in the study. If local guidelines dictate
             ophthalmological examination at younger ages, those local guidelines should be
             followed.

          6. If treated with hydroxyurea, the weight-adjusted dose must be stable for 3 months
             before screening.

          7. Suitable venous access for the study-related blood sampling

          8. Prior to dosing on day of randomisation (Visit 2), a negative urine (dipstick)
             pregnancy test performed at Screening (Visit 1) and at Visit 2 must be available for
             female patients of childbearing potential.

          9. Females of childbearing potential (after menarche) must not become pregnant during
             study. Sexually active females must use a highly effective method of contraception
             which results in a low failure rate (ie, less than 1% per year). If use of effective
             contraception cannot be secured in sexually active females, the patient cannot be
             included in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or cerebrovascular accident (ischaemic or
             haemorrhagic), severe head trauma, intracranial haemorrhage, intracranial neoplasm,
             arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm, or proliferative retinopathy.

          2. Findings on TCD: Current or previous values for time averaged mean of the maximum
             velocity (TAMMV) that are Conditional or Abnormal. Patients with Conditional TAMMV
             values or higher (≥153 cm/sec using TCD imaging technique [TCDi] which is
             corresponding to ≥170 cm/sec by the non-imaging technique). Both the middle cerebral
             artery and the internal carotid artery should be considered.

             Any other criteria that would locally be considered as TCD indications for chronic
             transfusion would also exclude the patient.

          3. Active pathological bleeding or increased risk of bleeding complications according to
             Investigator

          4. Haemoglobin &lt;6 g/dL from test performed at Screening (Visit 1)

          5. Platelets &lt;100 x 10^9/L from test performed at Screening (Visit 1) Undergoing
             treatment with chronic red blood cell transfusion therapy.

          6. Undergoing treatment with chronic red blood cell transfusion therapy.

          7. Chronic use of NSAIDs defined as continuous intake &gt;3 days per week that cannot be
             discontinued

          8. Receiving chronic treatment with anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs that cannot be
             discontinued

             aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;2 × upper limits of normal (ULN), total bilirubin &gt;2 × ULN
             (unless judged by the Investigator to be caused by haemolysis), albumin &lt;35 g/L (3.5
             g/dL) and International normalised ratio (INR) &gt;1.4, or symptoms of liver disease (eg,
             ascites) from test performed at Screening (Visit 1).

         10. Renal failure requiring dialysis

         11. Patient considered to be at risk of bradycardic events (eg, known sick sinus syndrome
             or second or third degree atrioventricular block) unless already treated with a
             permanent pacemaker.

         12. Concomitant oral or intravenous therapy with strong or moderate cytochrome P450 3A
             (CYP3A) inhibitors, CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic indices, or strong CYP3A
             inducers, which cannot be stopped at least 5 half-lives before randomisation.

         13. Active untreated malaria. Patients with suspected malaria at Screening (Visit 1) will
             be tested.

         14. Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to ticagrelor

         15. Patients who are currently pregnant or breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant
             during the study or have given birth less than 3 months prior to Screening (Visit 1)

             unsuitable for the patient to participate in this study

         17. Concern for the inability of the patient or caregiver (defined as legally authorized
             representative) to comply with study procedures and/or follow-up

         18. Previous randomisation in the present study.

         19. Participation in another clinical study with an IP or device during the last 30 days
             preceding screening.

         20. Involvement of member of patient's family, or patient self, in the planning and/or
             conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca staff and/or staff at the study
