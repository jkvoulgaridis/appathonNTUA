  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The emergency setting, frequently associated with pain and the feeling of loss of control,
      can cause anxiety in patients.

      Reaction anxiety may be an appropriate response to an emergency; Nevertheless, attention must
      be paid to the evaluation and management of the latter especially as anxiety and pain are
      closely linked.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a definite interest in the management of patients' pre-hospital anxiety. The
      literature reports a strong association between anxiety, post-traumatic stress and chronic
      pain. A study conducted at SAMU 31 also found that anxiety on arrival at the emergency
      department was a negative factor in the treatment of pain. Anxiety can reduce the pain
      threshold and promote hyperalgesia.

      The management of patient anxiety in pre-hospital offers interesting results in terms of
      analgesia and satisfaction of users of care and should not be neglected.

      MEOPA has recently been available in SMUR vehicles (emergency and resuscitation mobile
      service) at SAMU 31 (urgent medical assistance service); its availability can lead teams to
      change their practices. More and more emphasis is placed on the importance of positive
      communication and comfort for which MEOPA, with its conscious sedating effect, could be a
      facilitating factor.

      The aim of our study is to evaluate the level of anxiety of patients treated by SMUR teams in
      Toulouse and receiving MEOPA following the usual indications for pain-induced pain or pain
      alleviation.

      This is a pilot study, which focuses on the assessment of anxiety in patients treated in
      pre-hospital care by SMUR Toulouse and receiving MEOPA as part of their care. No data exists
      in the literature on this subject.

      This descriptive study based on qualitative data collected by the FAS1 scale will provide us
      with the first data on this population. It does not change the usual management of the
      patient since only patients who must receive MEOPA following the usual indications for pain
      relief or pain-induced care will be included in the study

    <description>The state of anxiety of the patient assessed by FAS (face anxiety scale) self-assessment when supported by a SMUR team with MEOPA administration.
The FAS, called the Anxiety Faces Scale, is a validated anxiety assessment scale that was originally developed in the context of Critical Care, Critical Care (ICU) management.
The Faces Anxiety Scale is a valid single-item, self-report measure of state anxiety in intensive care patients that is easy to administer and imposes minimal respondent burden. It has the potential to be a useful instrument for the assessment of state anxiety by clinicians and for research into the reduction of anxiety in this vulnerable population.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The pain felt by the patient, evaluated by the numerical scale (EN), in connection with his anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>EN is a self-rated scale of pain: the patient rates his or her pain on a numeric scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (maximum pain). The evaluation of the pain at the SAMU is carried out in routine at each support by the EN. For the purposes of this study, the investigators will find the value of the EN in the same temporality as the assessment of anxiety.</description>
