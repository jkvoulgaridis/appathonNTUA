    <textblock>
      This study mainly focused on the effect of early antiviral treatment on the duration of cough
      in influenza patients.investigators conducted an early investigation of patients with
      positive influenza virus and asked whether patients used antiviral drugs in the early stages.
      According to the use of drugs, patients were divided into oral oseltamivir group, oral lotus
      phlegm group and other groups, and investigators will collected Inspection information and
      medication status,during the treatment period of patients.

    <textblock>
      Cough is a common symptom of respiratory diseases and helps to clear respiratory secretions
      and harmful factors, but frequent severe coughing has a serious impact on the patient's work,
      life and social activities. Upper respiratory tract viral infection is a common cause of
      coughing. Many patients have a long duration of cough after suffering from flu. Cough can
      last for several weeks, and most often have irritating dry cough or a small amount of white
      mucus sputum. This type of cough is also often referred to as &quot;subacute cough&quot; or
      &quot;post-infection cough.&quot; The mechanisms that cause this cough have not been fully elucidated,
      and the effect of conventional treatment is not good, and chest imaging has no obvious
      abnormalities. The use of large amounts of antibiotics is ineffective or ineffective.
      Antihistamine H1 receptor antagonists and central antitussives are often only effective or
      ineffective in the short term. The effects of various bronchodilators and even hormone drugs
      are not clear. Due to the poor efficacy of multiple treatments, patients are repeatedly
      subjected to various tests, which not only increases the pain but also aggravates the
      economic burden.

      Therefore, it is necessary to further clarify the causes and treatment measures of
      post-influenza cough patients.

    <description>Investigators will follow up every other week for follow-up calls or outpatients to ask about cough and medication, until the patient stops coughing, cough lasts from 1 day to 12 weeks, and cough time is greater than 12 weeks. Investigators should seriously exclude cough caused by other factors. No other factors are still included in the study, and the maximum time is no more than 6 months. If there are other factors causing cough, it will not be included in the study.</description>
