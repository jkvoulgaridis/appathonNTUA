  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine if non-opioid pain control is a safe way to manage
      pain after adenotonsillectomy surgery in children. The investigators will be randomly
      assigning children aged 3-17 to one of two groups: one group will receive non-opioid pain
      medication only, and the other group will receive opioid and non-opioid medications for pain
      control. The investigators will analyze the data and determine if there is a difference in
      pain control between the two drug regimens, and if there are any other associated
      complications between the two groups.

      This study is important because if we can demonstrate that there is little difference in
      outcomes and pain control between the two groups, a strong argument can be made for reducing
      or eliminating opioid prescription after adenotonsillectomy. This may protect future children
      from the risks of taking opioid medications and help to reduce the scope of the opioid
      epidemic.

      Purpose: To determine if non-opioid pain control is a safe and effective option in the
      treatment of post-operative pain following adenotonsillectomy in various pediatric age
      groups.

      Methods: The subject population will be patients between the ages of 3 and 17 who will
      undergo adenotonsillectomy. The study will consist of two unblinded arms - patients receiving
      standard pain control regimen which include opioids and non-opioids, and patients receiving
      non-opioid pain medications only. In the diary they will receive, patients or caregivers will
      record quantity and dosage of pain medication taken each day, a survey, and pain ratings
      measured by the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale. Within 4-8 weeks post-operatively the
      patients will return for a follow up appointment along with their diary. Demographic
      information such as age, race, gender, household income will be extracted from the diary and
      the electronic medical record. Information such as surgical technique, concurrent operations,
      post-operative pain prescription (types, weight based dosage, and total days prescribed) will
      be extracted from the electronic medical record and recorded as well. Outcomes measured will
      include pain scale rating and rates of complications between the two groups.

      Significance: If it can be demonstrated that non-opioid pain control after adenotonsillectomy
      does not lead to increased pain or worse outcomes in certain pediatric age groups, a strong
      argument can be made for the cessation of opioid prescription for these ages following
      adenotonsillectomy. Given the widespread opioid epidemic, this would be a significant step in
      curbing the massive opioid problem, as well as reducing the adverse effects of opioid usage
      in pediatric populations.
