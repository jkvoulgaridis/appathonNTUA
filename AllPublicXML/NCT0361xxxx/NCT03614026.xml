  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two aims of this study (a) to examine the effect of Teachers and Parents as
      Partners on student, parent, and teacher outcomes in middle school and (b) identify barriers
      and facilitators to implementing Teachers and Parents as Partners in middle school for
      students with behavior concerns.

      In the business-as-usual control condition, participants will have access to any services
      that a school would routinely provide (e.g., develop and implement a behavior support plan)
      as well as services families can access in the community (e.g., mental health support).

      Teachers and Parents as Partners will occur in a series of stages comprised of approximately
      four structured meetings over approximately 8 weeks. A Teachers and Parents as Partners
      consultant will meet together with a student's parent(s), teachers, other school personnel
      (as appropriate), and the student (as appropriate). The Teachers and Parents as Partners team
      will collaboratively address behavior problem solving objectives. Specific TAPP objectives
      include: identifying strengths and specific behaviors of concern, specifying alternative
      prosocial behaviors, creating measurable behavior goals, co-constructing behavior
      intervention/support plans to address the target concerns, creating sustainable conditions to
      support plan implementation at home and school, and evaluating the plan to assess progress
      toward goals.
