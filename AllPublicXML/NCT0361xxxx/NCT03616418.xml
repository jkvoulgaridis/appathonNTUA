  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common clinical manifestation of the systemic
      atherosclerotic process, and the ankle brachial index (ABI) is an ideal tool to diagnose PAD.
      The association between high serum uric acid levels (SUA) and arterial stiffness as well as
      endothelial dysfunction has been demonstrated in humans and uric acid has been suggested to
      be an important modulator of the inflammatory process. It has also been confirmed by clinical
      studies. Currently, there have been few long term follow up studies focused on the whether
      serum uric acid levels combined with ankle brachial index can improve prediction all cause
      mortality and cardiovascular mortality,especially in China population.Therefore, the aim of
      this study was to elucidate whether ABIcombined with SUA can improve prediction all cause
      mortality and cardiovascular mortality in the elderly China population independently of the
      traditional Framingham Risk Score.

      This study is a prospective community-based cohort study, which is aimed to investigate the
      prognostic factors, including conventional cardiovascular risk factors and measure
      ABI,SUA,asymptomatic target organ damage, for mortality and cardiovascular diseases. All
      population were separated into ABI ≤0.4，0.4 ＜ABI ≤0.9，and 0.9 ＜ABI≤1.4 three groups according
      to the ABI. ABI ≤0.9 was selected as cut point for the definition of PAD. Factors related to
      CVD and all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiac events (MACE) during follow-up was
      observed by multivariate Cox regression analysis and log rank test. Potential confounding
      variables with P ＜0.10 were adjusted for multivariate analysis.

    <description>Cardiovascular events definitions: Hospitalized myocardial infarction was classified as definite or probable based on chest pain symptoms, cardiac enzyme levels, and electrocardiographic findings, or angioplasty28. Coronary heart disease was determined to be present if there was (1) electrocardiographic (ECG) evidence of a prior myocardial infarction, (2) prior coronary artery bypass surgery or angioplasty, (3) Coronary angiography show coronary heart disease, (4) have symptoms of angina and ECG revealed myocardial ischemia performance or laboratory tests showed cardiac enzymes increased and exclude other types of disease, (5) a self-reported history of a physician-diagnosed heart attack 29. CHD death was classified &quot;definite&quot; based on chest pain symptoms, hospital records, and medical history.</description>
