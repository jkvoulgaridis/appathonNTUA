  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After trauma or stress factor like death exposition, serious injuries or sexual violence,
      some patients may develop stress reaction characterized by the presence of various symptoms
      among different categories (reviviscence, negative humor, dissociates symptoms, occasion,
      hypervigilance). In the month following trauma, the investigators speak of acute stress
      reaction (ASR) when symptoms are present during at least three days. If symptoms are present
      one month after trauma, then it is a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

      Among patients visiting emergency after latest trauma, quite a few is in acute stress
      reaction. However, this reaction is often incorrectly identified by healthcare team, due to
      lack of oriented medical examination, patients visiting about other complaints (pain,
      insomnia) and not expressing clearly the trauma context. Yet, it is know that acute stress
      reaction occurrence and existence of dissociate symptoms after trauma confrontation is
      considerably predictive of the eventual post-traumatic stress disorder occurrence.

      The identification of risk population of post-traumatic stress disorder is not the subject of
      any particular structured procedure in emergency services while early care of these patients
      may allow limiting post-traumatic stress disorder occurrence and associate consequences.
      Previous works on the subject having exclusively targeted some trauma subgroups or some
      predictive factors subtypes, investigators propose here biopsychosocial global approach that
      can weight the impact of each parameters.

      In this study, investigators aim at determining predictive biopsychosocial factors of the
      post-traumatic stress disorder occurrence at 3 months in patients visiting emergency after
      latest trauma (less than one month old) and identified as &quot;high-risk&quot; to develop
      post-traumatic stress disorder (moderate or high).

    <description>Presence or absence PTSD will be evaluated by the PCL-5 scale (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -5)).
The PCL-5 scale will be completed with patients during a phone interview with a psychologist or a psychiatrist.
The PCL-5 is a 20-item questionnaire that assesses the 20 DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD.
Patients will be asked to rate how bothered they have been by each item in the past 3-month on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0-4 (0 = not at all; 1 = a little bit; 2 = moderately; 3 = quite a bit; 4 = extremely).
A provisional PTSD diagnosis can be made by treating each item rated as 2 = &quot;Moderately&quot; or higher as a symptom endorsed, then following the DSM-5 diagnostic rule which requires at least: 1 B item (questions 1-5), 1 C item (questions 6-7), 2 D items (questions 8-14), 2 E items (questions 15-20).
Items are summed to provide a total score. The range is 0-80. A total score of 33 or higher signifies the likely presence of PTSD.</description>

    <time_frame>1 day (at admission to the emergency service)</time_frame>
    <description>The high risk of developing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder will be determined by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R).
The IES-R is a 22-item self-report questionnaire that assesses subjective distress caused by traumatic events. The IES-R contains sub-scales for avoidance, intrusions and hyperarousal.
Patients will be asked to indicate how much they were distressed or bothered during the past seven days by each item.
Items are rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0-4 (0 = not at all; 1 = a little bit; 2 = moderately; 3 = quite a bit; 4 = extremely). The IES-R yields a total score ranging from 0 to 88.
A total IES-R score of over 34 signifies patient is at high risk to develop PTSD.</description>

An IES-R score between 12 and 34 included signifies patient is at moderate risk to develop PTSD.</description>

    <description>Describe the patient dissociative disorders using the Questionnaire of Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiments score.
The Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire (PDEQ) determines the presence and the intensity of the peritraumatic response experienced by the individual at the time of the traumatic event, and in the minutes and hours that followed.
The PDEQ in a 10-item test. Each item is scored from 1 (not at all true) to 5 (extremely true). The total score is the sum of all items. A score above 15 is indicative of significant dissociation.</description>

    <description>Describe Post Traumatic Stress Disorder impact on social life using the Social Support Questionnaire (SSQ6).
The Social Support Questionnaire 6 (SSQ6) is a 6-item questionnaire designed to measure two dimensions of social support: availability and satisfaction.
Each item is a question that solicits a two-part answer: Part 1 asks participants to list up nine people maximum available to provide support in each of 6 areas, and Part 2 asks participants to indicate how satisfied they are, in general, with these people.
Availability is scored by counting the total number of people for each item (max = 54), and satisfaction is scored by counting the total satisfaction scores for the 6 items (max = 36).</description>

    <description>Impact of the excessive drinking and alcohol using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) at 3 months.
The AUDIT is a 10-item screening tool that assesses alcohol consumption, drinking behaviors, and alcohol-related problems. Each item has a score ranging from 0 to 4.
Total scores of 7 or more in men, 6 or more in women are recommended as indicators of hazardous and harmful alcohol use.</description>

    <description>Impact of the nicotine dependence at 3 months using the Fagerström test. The Fagerström Test is a standard instrument for assessing the intensity of physical addiction to nicotine.
In scoring the Fagerstrom Test, yes/no items are scored from 0 to 1 and multiple-choice items are scored from 0 to 3. The items are summed to yield a total score of 0-10.
A patient who scores between 0 and 2 is classified as no nicotine dependence; a score of 3 or 4 would be considered to have low dependence on nicotine, moderate dependence for a score of 5 or 6, high dependence for a score of 7 or 8, and very high dependence for a score of 8 or over.</description>

    <description>The severity of depressive symptoms at 3 months will be determined by the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR16).
The QIDS-SR 16 is a self-report questionnaire that assesses the severity of depressive symptoms. The 16 items (questions) on the QIDS-SR16 cover the nine diagnostic symptom criteria used in DSM.
Each item is rated 0-3. The QIDS-SR16 is scored by summing responses for each of the 16 items to obtain a total score ranging from 0 to 27.
A total score from 0 to 5 signifies absence of depression; 6 to 10 mild depression; 11 to 15 moderate depressions, 16 to 20 severe depression and from 21 to 27 very severe depression.</description>
