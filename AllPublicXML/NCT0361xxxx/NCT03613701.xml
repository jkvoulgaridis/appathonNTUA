  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Moyamoya disease is a chronic cerebrovascular diseaseï¼ŒThe typical pathological manifestations
      are the stenosis or occlusion of the distal internal carotid artery and/or middle cerebral
      artery, and the proximal anterior cerebral artery. Meanwhile, the abnormal vascular net,
      which is the smokey vessel, occurs at the bottom of the brain. Currently the pathogenesis of
      this disease is unknown. Limited studies have reported the expression of endothelial
      progenitor cells (EPCs) in moyamoya disease, but the results were inconsistent. Some
      investigators believe that the number of EPCs in peripheral blood of patients with moyamoya
      disease is increased, while others believe that the number of EPCs in peripheral blood of
      moyamoya patients is reduced. Therefore, the investigators need to find a more accurate
      detection method to confirm the growth of EPC in patients with moyamoya disease. At the same
      time, whether there is endothelial injury in patients with smoke disease, and the expression
      of endothelial cells (CEC) in patients with smoke disease, there is no research on this
      aspect at home and abroad.

      Objective: Detect the expression of endothelial progenitor cells and endothelial cells from
      peripheral blood of patients with moyamoya disease, and to assess the relationship between
      clinical characteristics.

      Design: A single center study, and planned to enroll 120 patients. The present study was to
      detect the quantities of EPC from peripheral blood in Moyamoya disease by flow cytometry, and
      to identify the relationship of endothelial progeIlitor cells and effect of the
      revascularization on Moyamoya disease. The present study also use cerebral ischemia animal
      model foe intervention experiment, to explore whether EPC can promote vascular remodeling
      effect of ischemic cerebrovascular disease, and to provide new thought for the treatment of
      chronic cerebrovascular disorder.
