  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Black women are at a higher risk of developing insomnia and insomnia has profound physical
      and psychological health consequences. There is a proven, non-pharmacological, treatment for
      insomnia for the general population but there is little evidence of the effectiveness of this
      treatment among Black women. The goal of this study is to conduct a comparative effectiveness
      trial of three insomnia therapies over a 6 month follow-up period. This study aims to provide
      the much needed evidence to help Black women make informed decisions regarding treatment for
      their insomnia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible Black Women's Health Study (BWHS) participants who report symptoms of insomnia
      compatible with clinical insomnia on the 2015 BWHS questionnaire will be randomly selected to
      receive information that will inform them of the opportunity to participate in a free program
      designed to address their sleep problems. These subjects will then be directed to an Insomnia
      Study Website which will provide information about the study and directions on how to
      complete an online screening questionnaire for those interested in participating. Reminders
      will be sent to these selected women to encourage participation.

      Once interested women submit the screening questionnaire, an internal assessment will be
      carried out to see if potential participants are eligible. Those determined to be ineligible
      will be sent a thank you letter and informed that they were not selected for this trial.
      Those who meet the qualifications for the study will be directed to the informed consent form
      with a note indicating that a member of the study team will call them within several days at
      a time they indicated would be convenient for them. The study team member will then call each
      eligible subject and review with her, over the phone, each section of the consent form. A
      verbal acknowledgement of consent, or non-consent, will be recorded in the study database.

      Once women have been verbally consented, they will be instructed on the use of the web
      programs and, completion of online sleep logs. Privacy concerns will be addressed.
      Pre-intervention post-intervention, and 6-month assessment questionnaires will each take an
      estimated 30 - 45 minutes, and sleep logs will take about 2 minutes daily to complete. After
      the pre-intervention questionnaires and sleep logs are completed, participants will be
      randomized to 1 of 3 groups: usual care (sleep hygiene information), Sleep Healthy Using the
      Internet (SHUTi- a publicly available cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)
      program), or SHUTi modified for Black women. Participants randomized to usual care (also
      called sleep hygiene or sleep information) will use a website that discusses ways to improve
      behaviors and environments that can affect sleep. This material is also included in the other
      2 treatments but is presented in a different way. Participants using this website may log in
      as often as they like and there are no time requirements. Participants randomized to SHUTi or
      modified SHUTi will use a web program that has six modules called Cores. Participants will
      log in to the six modules of their assigned treatment program over a 6 to 8-week period.
      Cores are completed one at a time in order. Each Core is expected to take 45 to 60 minutes to
      complete. Each Core contains information and exercises designed to help change behaviors and
      thoughts that can contribute to sleep problems.

      Nine weeks after completing the initial pre-intervention questionnaire, all participants will
      be asked to complete another questionnaire about their sleep and health. Following completion
      of the questionnaire, participants will be asked to complete 10 sleep diaries. Six months
      later, participants will be asked again to complete a questionnaire, followed by completion
      of 10 sleep diaries.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in sleep difficulties assessed by the Insomnia Severity Index</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A change in sleep difficulties will be assessed by using the ISI scale (Insomnia Severity Index). The ISI is a 7-item self-report questionnaire assessing the nature, severity, and impact of insomnia in the past month. The specific items evaluate the severity of difficulties with sleep onset, sleep maintenance, and early morning awakening; sleep dissatisfaction; interference of sleep problems with daytime functioning; noticeability of sleep difficulties by others; and distress caused by sleep difficulties. A 5-point Likert scale (0 = none; 4 = very severe) is used to rate each item, with total scores ranging from 0 to 28. A higher total score indicates more severe sleep difficulties.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality and pattern of sleep assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A change in the quality and pattern of sleep will be assessed by the PSQI (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index). The PSQI is a self-rated questionnaire which assesses sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-month time interval. It differentiates &quot;poor&quot; from &quot;good&quot; sleep quality by measuring seven areas (components): subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction over the last month. The sum of scores for these seven components yields one global score. Scoring of the answers is based on a 0 to 3 scale, whereby 3 reflects the negative extreme on the Likert Scale. A total score of &quot;5&quot; or greater is indicative of poor sleep quality.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in behavior pattern prior to sleep assessed by the Sleep Behavior Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SBRS (Sleep Behavior Rating Scale) will be used to measure the change in behavior patterns prior to sleep. The Sleep Behavior Self-Rating Scale is a 5 point rating scale (1-Never, 2-Rarely, 3-Sometimes, 4-Often, 5-Very Often) that assesses 20 sleep-incompatible behaviors associated with a person's bed or bedroom.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in beliefs and attitudes about sleep assessed by the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep-16 scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The DBAS-16 will be used to assess the change in participants' people's beliefs and attitudes about sleep. Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep scale-16 (DBAS-16) is a tool for assessing sleep-related dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes. The DBAS-16 is a self-rating inventory consisting of 16 items (e.g., I am worried that I may lose control over my abilities to sleep) with 10-point scales, ranging from 0 (strongly disagree) to 10 (strongly agree). The total score is calculated from the average score of all the items on the scale and could range from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating higher levels of dysfunctional beliefs about sleep.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mood and quality of life assessed by the Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessing changes in mood and quality of life using HADS, the Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale, which is a 14 item instrument that has 7 questions that assess level of anxiety and 7 questions that assess the level of depression. Each question has 4 possible responses scored from 0 to 3 (0, 1, 2, 3,). The HADS creates two scores, one for Depression (D) and the other for Anxiety (A) and the range for each is 0 to 21. The scores are interpreted as 0-7 = Normal, 8-10 = Borderline abnormal (borderline case), and 11-21 = Abnormal (case).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in health assessed by the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-GHS scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessing changes in mood and quality of life using PROMIS-GHS, the Global Health Scale assessing quality of life. The PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) consists of 10 items that measure patient-reported outcomes (PROs), such as pain, fatigue, physical functioning, emotional distress, and social role participation that have a major impact on quality-of-life across a variety of chronic diseases.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in sleep intervention acceptability, utilization and preference assessed by the Treatment Acceptability and Preference survey</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessing acceptability, utilization and preference using TAP, the Treatment Acceptability and Preferences survey. The Treatment Acceptability and Preferences (TAP) survey asks participants to rate their treatment of insomnia in four categories: appropriateness, suitability, effectiveness and convenience on a scale of 0 to 4: (0= not at all, 4=very much).</description>
