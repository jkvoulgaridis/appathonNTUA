  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the experiences of individuals with acromegaly who are
      receiving injections as part of their treatment regimen. Another objective of the study is to
      compare the patients' perception with their doctors' perceptions. The answers are important
      to help researchers and physicians understand what it is really like to take currently
      available treatments so that they can make efforts to improve patients' healthcare
      experiences, reduce treatment burden and, ultimately, improve patient's quality of life.

        Patients diagnosed with acromegaly will be sent invitations to participate. Their
        physicians will be identified at the time of participant enrollment and will be contacted
        by the study team for a telephone interview.
