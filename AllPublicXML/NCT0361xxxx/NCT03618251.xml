  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a common disease. It is increasingly managed in non-specialized centers.

      The volume of the lesion, evaluated on the diffusion weighted imaging, is a prognostic factor
      of clinical progression and is useful for the treatment decision.

      There is therefore a real interest in having a reliable software able to detect the stroke
      and evaluate the volume of the cerebral infarction. The aim is to provide rapid information
      to the interventional neuroradiologist and optimize the care of the patient.

      The Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score currently used to predict response
      to treatment divides the territory of the middle cerebral artery. It has a few limitations,
      it is unreproducible and concerns only the territory of the middle cerebral artery.

      Manual volumetry is a long and also not very reproducible technique. The aim of our study is
      to evaluate the reproducibility and diagnostic performances of the automated segmentation
      software based on the diffusion weighted imaging sequence, and to compare it to manual and
      semi-automatic measurements.

    <description>Our objective is to compare several volumetric techniques (manual, semi-manual, automatic) based on the B 2000 of diffusion weighted imaging and the coefficient of apparent diffusion.
We will also evaluate the correlation between the volumes obtained by the different techniques and the final volume of FLAIR infarction and diffusion in a subgroup of patients for whom a follow-up MRI is feasible.</description>
