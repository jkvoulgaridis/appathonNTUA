        Symptomatic patients from primary health care with elevated surgical risk and candidate for
        TAVI with severe calcified and stenotic aortic valves.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Symptomatic degeneration of severe calcified aortic heart valve

          2. Acceptable candidate for elective treatment with the ALLEGRA TAVI System TF (according
             to the most recent version of the ALLEGRA Instructions For Use)

          3. High risk for surgery as assessed by the heart team

          4. Has signed the Patient Informed Consent Form &gt;= 18 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unicuspid or bicuspid aortic valve

          2. Non-calcified aortic stenosis

          3. Combined aortic valve disease with predominant aortic regurgitation &gt; 3

          4. Distance between aortic valve basal plane and the orifice of the lowest coronary
             artery &lt; 8 mm

          5. Pre-existing prosthetic heart valve in aortic position

          6. Echocardiographic evidence of intracardiac thrombus or vegetation

          7. Significant aortic disease such as severe obstructive calcification or marked
             tortuosity or kinking which will preclude a safe advancement of the ALLEGRA TAVI
             System TF

          8. Iliofemoral vessel conditions such as severe obstructive calcification, severe
             tortuosity or kinking that would preclude safe placement of an 18 Fr introducer sheath
             or make endovascular access to the aortic valve impossible

          9. Severe ventricular dysfunction with LVEF &lt;20%

         10. Evidence of active endocarditis or other acute infections

         11. Renal failure requiring continuous renal replacement therapy

         12. Known hypersensitivity to contrast media, which cannot be adequately pre-medicated or
             contraindication to anticoagulant or anti-platelet medication or to nitinol alloy or
             to bovine tissue

         13. Life expectancy ≤ 12 months due to other medical illness

         14. Currently participating in another investigational drug or device study
