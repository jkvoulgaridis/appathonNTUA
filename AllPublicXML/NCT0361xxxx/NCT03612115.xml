  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate the effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation on
      peripheral muscles and other physical and psychosocial variables in patients with pulmonary
      arterial hypertension. This study was designed as an assessor-blind randomized controlled
      trial. Thirty-one patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension will be recruited. The
      participants will randomly divided two parallel groups as treatment and control. For the
      treatment group, neuromuscular electrical stimulation will be applied to the bilateral
      deltoid and quadriceps femoris muscles with 50 Hz for 3 days/week, 8 weeks. Control group
      will not be received any additional treatment, just given healthy life recommendations such
      as walking. The participants will be assessed before and after the treatment by a blind
      assessor to the group allocation. The outcome measure will be assessments of the upper and
      lower limb muscle strength, respiratory muscle strength, muscle cross-sectional area and
      thickness, pulse wave velocity, exercise capacity, walking speed, functional mobility and
      balance performances, balance confidence, fatigue perceptions, physical activity level,
      activities of daily living and quality of life.

    <description>The Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale is a 16-item instrument designed to measure a patient's perceived level of confidence in performing common activities of daily living without losing balance and falling. The patient ranks his confidence to complete each item from 0% (no confidence) to 100% (complete confidence). Total score is calculated as sum score ranged from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate higher balance confidence level.</description>

    <description>The Fatigue Impact Scale is widely used to measure fatigue. It is a 40-item multidimensional scale measuring the physical, cognitive and social. Patients are asked to rate how much of a problem fatigue has caused them during the past month, including the day of testing, on a 5-point Likert-type scale, with response options ranging from 0 &quot;no problem&quot; to 4 &quot;extreme problem&quot;. Higher scores indicate the greater level of fatigue (total score ranged from 0 to 160).</description>

    <measure>International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form has 7 items listing activities and requests estimates of durations and frequencies for each activity engaged in over the past week. Durations are multiplied by known metabolic equivalents per activity and the results for all items are summed for the overall physical activity score. Scores for walking and for moderate and vigorous activities are sums of corresponding item scores. Higher scores indicate higher physical activity level.</description>

    <measure>Milliken Activities of Daily Living Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Milliken Activities of Daily Living Scale consists of 47 items including preparing meals, and eating (8 items), self-care (9 items), dressing oneself (8 items), manual manipulation of objects (9 items), house cleaning, and washing clothes (7 items), and other activities (6 items). For scoring the level of ability to perform each item, a 5-point scale, and for the level of necessity to perform these items, a 3-point scale is used. Total score can range from 0 to 705 points. Higher scores indicate less limitation in activities of daily living.</description>

    <description>Health-related quality of life will be assessed using Nottingham Health Profile scale which is a general quality of life questionnaire that measures perceived health problems and their impact on normal daily activities. It has 38 items divided into six domains: energy level, pain, emotional reactions, sleep, social isolation and physical abilities. Items use yes/no answer format and each item is weighted. Total scores for each domain range from 0 to 100. Higher scores represent less quality of life in relevant domain.</description>
