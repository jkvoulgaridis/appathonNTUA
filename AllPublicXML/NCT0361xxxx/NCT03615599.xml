    <textblock>
      The Adventist Health Study-2 is a long-term study, exploring the links between lifestyle,
      diet, and disease outcomes among Seventh-day Adventists. More than 96,000 church members from
      the U.S. and Canada are participating in the current study, AHS-2, conducted by researchers
      at the Loma Linda University School of Public Health.

      The Adventist Health Study-2 (AHS-2) is a large national cohort of 96,000 Seventh-day
      Adventists in the U.S. and Canada. The study is searching for associations between diet and
      risk of common and medium frequency cancers (breast, prostate, colorectal, lung, uterus,
      pancreas, melanoma of skin). This cohort is unusual in that about half are vegetarian, many
      eat soy at Asian levels, and many have very low or absent dairy intake while others eat
      normal amounts of dairy. Thus observations on these people, many of whom have contrasting
      dietary habits, may provide insights about diet and cancer, so supporting dietary changes
      that could be readily adopted by many.

      Buffy coat samples from a sample of the cohort (~2500) are stored from which DNA material may
      be extracted when a study requires such data. Other stored bio-specimens from a sample of the
      cohort include adipose tissue, urine, blood, sputum, stool.

        The sample includes Seventh-day Adventist church members living in the USA and Canada who
        are 30 years and older, and who are sufficiently fluent in English to complete the lengthy
        lifestyle questionnaire. The study population is about 65% female. Approximately 25% of the
        cohort are Black/African Americans . Other ethnic minorities (e.g. Asian, Hispanic) are at
        much lower percentages (3-4 %).
