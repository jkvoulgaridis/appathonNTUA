      This phase II trial studies how well autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes MDA-TIL works
      in treating patients with ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, or pancreatic ductal
      adenocarcinoma that has come back (recurrent) or does not respond to treatment (refractory).
      Autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes MDA-TIL, made by collecting and growing specialized
      white blood cells (called T-cells) from a patient's tumor, may help to stimulate the immune
      system in different ways to stop tumor cells from growing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate efficacy using objective response rate (ORR) using the Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1 in subjects with ovarian cancer, pancreatic
      ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and colorectal cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the disease control rate (DCR) within and across cohorts. II. Determine the
      duration of response (DOR). III. Determine progression-free survival (PFS) and overall
      survival (OS). IV. Further characterize the safety profile of adoptive cell therapy (ACT)
      with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) across multiple tumor types.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish duration of TIL persistence. II. Compare the molecular and immunological
      features of tumors before and after TIL therapy.

      III. Prospectively evaluate the existing immunotherapy response criteria (immune-related
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [irRECIST]) as the best response assessment tool
      for TIL therapy among a diverse group of solid tumors.

      IV. Investigate TIL attributes (CD8 %, CD27 and CD28 expression) and correlation with
      response to therapy.

      V. Assess tumor marker (CA19-9; CA-125) response in patients who produce this tumor marker.

      VI. Assess Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL).

      OUTLINE:

      LYMPHODEPLETION REGIMEN: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on
      days -7 and -6, and fludarabine IV over 15-30 minutes on days -5 to -1 in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      T-CELL INFUSION: Patients receive autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes MDA-TIL IV over
      45 minutes on day 0. Patients then receive IL-2 IV over 30 minutes on days 1-4 for up to 6
      doses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at week 18, at 6, 9, 12, 18,
      and 24 months, and then every 3 months for up to 3 years.

             checkpoint inhibitor therapy, vitiligo, psoriasis, type 1 diabetes or resolved
             childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule. Subjects that require
             intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections would not be excluded.
             Subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or Sjogren's syndrome will
             not be excluded

          -  History of clinically significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
             asthma, or other chronic lung disease

          -  History of a second malignancy (diagnosed in the last 5 years). Exceptions include
             basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ
             cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy

          -  History of known active central nervous system metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks
             prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned
             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to initiation of lymphodepletion

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the initiation of lymphodepletion

          -  Patients who have a contraindication to or history of hypersensitivity reaction to any
             components or excipients of the TIL therapy or the other study drugs: NMA-LD
             (cyclophosphamide, mesna, and fludarabine); IL-2; any component of the TIL infusion
             product formulation including human serum albumin (HSA), IL-2, and dextran-40

          -  Any other condition that in the investigator's judgement would significantly increase
             the risks of participation

          -  Patient has any complication or delayed healing from excisional procedure that in the
             investigator's opinion would increase the risks of lymphodepletion, adoptive TIL
             therapy and adjuvant IL-2

          -  Patients has a decline in performance status to ECOG &gt; 1 (at the visit prior to
             admission for lymphodepletion)
