  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this research is to clarify the relationship between reported maternal
      stress, biological measures of maternal stress, breast milk biomarkers and milk quantity. Our
      primary hypothesis is that measures of maternal stress are associated with cortisol,
      cytokines, and other stress markers in the blood, which impacts breast milk quantity and
      composition and which may impact infant health.

    <description>Mother's stress will be measured using the The Parent Stress Scale: Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. This scale ranges from 1-130 with higher numbers indicating more stress.
Serum will be collected from mothers at enrollment and 4 weeks postpartum. Maternal venipuncture will be used to collect an 0.5mL aliquot of whole blood at the time of mother's first morning pump session in the neonatal intensive care unit. IgA will be quantitated using the Millipore Magpix 100 System. Multivariate regression analysis will be used to test for correlations.</description>
