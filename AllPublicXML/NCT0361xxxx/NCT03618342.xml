    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex, heterogeneous disorder, which produces in
      5-20% reproductive age women. In this study, a nontargeted metabolomics approach based on
      ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass
      spectrometry will be used to investigate serum metabolic characteristics of PCOS. PCOS women
      and healthy control will be divided into two distinct groups based on multivariate
      statistical analysis. The findings of this study will offer a new insight to understand the
      pathogenesis mechanism, and the discriminating metabolites may provide a prospect for PCOS
      diagnosis.

        PCOS is a complex disease and its pathogenesis is not clear, but it is believed to be the
        result from genetic, environmental, and lifestyle interaction. It is relatively clear that
        PCOS is closely related with hormone abnormality. More and more evidence displayed that
        insulin signaling pathways are closely related to PCOS. PCOS may also be associated with
        chronic inflammation and increased level of oxidative stress.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  PCOS diagnostic criteria: According to the diagnostic criteria revised by the European
             Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology and the American Society for Reproductive
             Medicine at the Rotterdam in 2003,4 PCOS patients can be diagnosed if two of the three
             criteria are present after excluding congenial adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing's
             syndrome, androgen secreting tumors, or other related disorders. The three criteria
             are (1) oligo- and/or anovulation; (2) clinical and/or biochemical signs of
             hyperandrogenism (clinical manifestations of hyperandrogenism include presence of
             acne, hirsutism, and androgenic alopecia); (3) polycystic ovaries by ultrasound
             examination: presence of 12 or more follicles in each ovary measuring 2-9 mm on
             diameter and/or ovarian volume&gt;10 ml.

          -  Age between 14 and 40 years

          -  2 years after menarche
