    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about reflux associated laryngeal symptoms, and more efficient
      ways to diagnose and treat this condition.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reflux associated laryngeal symptoms, coined &quot;laryngopharyngeal reflux&quot;, occurs when
      gastro-esophago-pharyngeal reflux contributes to chronic laryngeal symptoms such as throat
      clearing, sore throat and dysphonia. Over the past 25 years, Reflux associated laryngeal
      symptoms has been increasingly, and often incorrectly, diagnosed and has emerged as a point
      of controversy and confusion.

    <description>UES augmentation via the UES assist device is effective in true Reflux associated laryngeal symptoms. In our first pilot trial with the UES assist device, patients had significant symptom reduction following 2 weeks of UES assist device use. Based on our preliminary work, we theorize that the UES assist device is effective in Reflux associated laryngeal symptoms.</description>
