  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized to an evidence-based healthy lifestyle program alone or a
      healthy lifestyle program with mindfulness meditation added. The purpose of the study will be
      to determine if mindfulness improves BMI outcomes more than the program alone due to the
      stress-reduction benefits of mindfulness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will randomize 44 adolescents (aged 11-17 yo) with BMI &gt;95th percentile to
      traditional Bright Bodies Healthy Lifestyle Program or Lifestyle Program plus mindfulness
      meditation (6 sessions within the 12-week program) (22 per group). The traditional program
      includes exercise two evenings per week and nutrition/behavior modification one evening per
      week for 12 weeks. Mindfulness session topics include breathing meditation, body scan
      meditation, mindful eating techniques, and identification of hunger verses satiation. The
      primary outcome measure with be (1) BMI, while secondary outcomes include changes in (2)
      percent body fat, (3) perceived stress scale (questionnaire), (4) physical stress (saliva
      cortisol levels), and (5) overall caloric intake (pre and post food records). After the 3
      month intervention, participants will engage in post measures and be asked to return 6 months
      later (9 months) for longer-term follow-up measures.

    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale is the most widely used psychological instrument for measuring the perception of stress. It is a 10-item likert questionnaire published by Mind Garden that asks about feelings and thoughts during the last month. PSS scores are obtained by reversing responses (i.e., 0=4) for positively stated items and leaving score as is for negatively stated items. An average score for this age group is 14.2, with higher scores indicating more stress. Our hypothesis is a greater change (lower scores at post) in the mindfulness group + traditional than traditional group alone.</description>
