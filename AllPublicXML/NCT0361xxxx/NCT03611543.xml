      The goal of this study is to evaluate patient comfort during compression with a standard flat
      mammographic paddle and an investigational curved paddle. This is a study that will be
      performed with x-ray imaging and will be used to determine if an overall reduction in pain
      can be appreciated in patients without loss in image quality as compared to the current
      standard mammogram. Another benefit of the curved paddle may be an increase of perceivable
      and measurable tissue capture.

      The study will be conducted in the United States at up to 5 centers. The study will enroll up
      to 600 subjects. The number of subjects was chosen to allow evaluation of screening and
      diagnostic patients with a variety of breast densities (fatty, scattered densities,
      heterogeneously dense or extremely dense) and women with a range of breasts sizes that fit on
      the current detector. The evaluation of pain reduction will be the primary endpoint, while
      examining the potential of increased tissue capture without a compromise in image quality
      will be assessed as secondary endpoints. The enrollment will be consecutive for subjects who
      sign informed consent to participate. Women participating in the study will present for a
      screening or diagnostic imaging exam.

    <description>100 Patients. Each patient who agrees to participate and is consented and is undergoing a routine screening mammogram will receive her normal 4 view 2D plus 3D combination imaging (Left Cranial Caudal (LCC), Left Mediolateral-Oblique (LMO), Right Cranial Caudal (RCC), Right Mediolateral-Oblique (RMLO)) mammogram, with the current standard paddle. In addition she will also receive a CC and a MLO in one of her breasts as determined by a randomization scheme with the new investigational curved paddle. The amount of compression applied to both mammograms will be that to achieve tautness.</description>

    <description>400 Patients. Patients who agree to participate, are consented and are undergoing a diagnostic exam will have her prescribed diagnostic 2D plus 3D combination imaging as well as a CC or MLO with both the standard paddle and the new investigational curved paddle compressed to tautness on the breast of interest. The order of the paddles will be randomized and the view (CC or MLO) will be based in the visibility of the area of interest for which the diagnostic imaging was ordered. (It is possible that one of the views is superior to assess the area of interest).</description>
