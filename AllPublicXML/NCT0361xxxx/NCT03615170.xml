    <textblock>
      Application of circulating tumor DNA detection in diagnosis and treatment of locally advanced
      rectal cancer. First, to explore the feasibility of ctDNA as a detection index for rectal
      cancer. Second, evaluate the accuracy of ctDNA detection in rectal cancer. Third, to explore
      whether ctDNA can be used in the evaluation of preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy, so
      as to provide guidance for subsequent treatment. Fourth, to explore the guidance value for
      the decision of postoperative adjuvant therapy and the frequency of reexamination. Fifth,
      search for possible recurrence related mutations.
