  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive intervention for people with subjective cognitive complaints can be categorized
      into cognitive training, cognitive rehabilitation, psychoeducation, lifestyle intervention,
      etc. Literature have suggested multicomponent cognitive interventions can have better
      outcomes. However, studies to support this proposition are still limited. Few studies have
      also examined the influences of cognitive intervention on functional performance. This study
      was to examine the effectiveness of a multicomponent cognitive intervention for
      community-dwelling elderly with subjective cognitive complaints.

    <intervention_model_description>A quasi-experimental design with nonequivalent control was adopted in a senior center. Experimental variable was a 12 consecutive 90-minute weekly cognitive groups that included cognitive training and rehabilitation, with activity-based cognitive exercises and discussions with a focus on applications of cognitive strategies in daily lives. Participants were allocated into intervention group (cognitive intervention group) and control group (nutrition education group). The group assignment depended on what group they signed up for participate.</intervention_model_description>
