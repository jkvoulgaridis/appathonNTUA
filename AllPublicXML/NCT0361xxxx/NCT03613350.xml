    <textblock>
      Prevalence rates of urodynamic stress incontinence (USI), bladder oversensitivity (BO)
      /detrusor overactivity (DO) or both and their related clinical and urodynamic findings in
      women with ≥ pelvic organ prolapse quantification stage II cystocele are important for
      clinical consultation. Thus, the aim of this study was to elucidate the above findings and
      between-group associations.

    <textblock>
      Between November 2011 and January 2017, medical records of all women with ≥stage II cystocele
      who underwent 20-minute pad testing and urodynamic studies in a medical center were reviewed.
      ANOVA test and post-hoc testing with bonferroni's correction were used for statistical
      analysis. USI included evident USI and occult USI, which were classified according to pad
      weight before and after prolapse reduction. BO was defined as &lt;300 mL of the volume at strong
      desire to void during filling cystometry. Those women without USI, BO or DO were allocated
      into the no demonstrated USI+BO/DO group.

USI included evident USI and occult USI, which were classified according to pad weight before and after prolapse reduction.BO was defined as &lt;300 mL of the volume at strong desire to void during filling cystometry. Detrusor overactivity was defined as evidence of spontaneous detrusor contractions occurring during bladder filling or an uninhibited detrusor contraction occurring at a cystometric capacity that usually results in voiding.</description>
