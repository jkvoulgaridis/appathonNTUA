  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence showed that both TENS and passive body heating are potential treatment strategies
      for improving cognitive functions in people with dementia. It is hypothesized that hat device
      (Warmth +TENS) over the 4 acupuncture points would induce a greater improvement in cognitive
      functions and behavioural symptoms when compared with other hat devices (Warmth +
      placebo-TENS; TENS only; Warmth alone) and Control (hat device with no warmth and no TENS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acupuncture, a primary therapeutic method in traditional Chinese medicine, has been used for
      patients with dementia to improve memory, orientation, calculation, and self-managing ability
      in patients having dementia and prevent decline of cognitive functions. Results of animal
      studies have demonstrated that electroacupuncture on the head region is effective in managing
      the symptoms associated with dementia, including vascular dementia.

      A review of 8 studies on effects of TENS on non-pain related cognitive and behavioural
      functioning in patients with Alzheimer's disease and non-demented patients concluded that
      TENS could improve memory, affective behaviour and rest-activity rhythm in patients having
      Alzheimer's disease.

      Passive body heating is another novel physical intervention strategy which potentially can
      relieve the symptoms of dementia. A previous study demonstrated that the attention function
      of 15 elderly, measured by the reaction time in the Rapid Visual Processing Test, improved
      after passive body heating via a thermal suit. Moreover, 30 minutes of hot-water immersion
      improved the sleep quality in 13 people with vascular dementia.

    <time_frame>baseline (0 week)</time_frame>
    <description>C-DAD will be used to assess the participant's ability to perform a spectrum of functional activities, such as going on an outing and housekeeping. During the assessment, a caregiver is asked to indicate if the participant was able to perform 47 daily activities within the previous weeks with the responses of 'yes', ''no' or 'not applicable'. The result will then be converted into a scale ranging from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicates a higher level of functioning.</description>
