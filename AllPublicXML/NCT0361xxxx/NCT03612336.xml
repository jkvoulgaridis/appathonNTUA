  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a leading cause of death in cigarette smokers; quitting
      smoking is associated with reduced CVD. Cigarette smoking increases CVD through complex
      mechanisms, mostly on an increase in atherosclerosis and the effect appears unrelated to
      nicotine. Recently, electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS; also called vaporizer or
      electronic cigarette) have become popular with smokers who want to stop smoking. There is
      currently no evidence that ENDS use affects CVD outcomes. The nicotine contained in the
      e-liquids from ENDS has cardiovascular effects and the evidence about health effects mostly
      comes from studies on nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). These studies did not show an
      increased risk of CVD from NRTs. The ECLAT trial showed no difference in body weight, resting
      heart rate, or blood pressure between those who used ENDS or not. Two studies evaluated the
      short-term effects of ENDS on the cardiovascular system. One study suggested impairment in
      diastolic ventricular function with cigarettes and not with ENDS. Both ENDS and cigarettes
      increased diastolic blood pressure, potentially mediated through nicotine exposure, but an
      increased systolic blood pressure was found only in cigarette smokers. Other studies have
      suggested no changes in blood pressure in daily users of electronic cigarettes up to 1 year
      with some even a reduction in blood pressure among patients with hypertension. Interventions
      helping smokers quit have shown that quitting is associated with increased HDL-cholesterol,
      weight gain, higher blood glucose, and higher diabetes risk. No large randomized trials have
      tested the effect of ENDS on blood cholesterol and other markers of cardiovascular risk.

      This study will therefore test the efficacy of ENDS for cigarette smoking cessation, the
      safety of ENDS on adverse events and the effect of ENDS on health-related outcomes and
      exposure to inhaled chemicals.

      For this trial, smokers motivated to quit smoking cigarettes will be included. Participants
      in the intervention group will receive an ENDS and nicotine-containing e-liquids, which they
      will be allowed to use ad libitum. Additionally, they will receive smoking cessation
      counseling. Participants in the control group will receive smoking cessation counseling only.
      All participants will be followed over a 24-month period. Measurements of risk factors for
      cardiovascular diseases will be done at baseline and at 6, 12 and 24 months' follow-up.
