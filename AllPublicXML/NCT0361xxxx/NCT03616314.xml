  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) survivors often develop an acquired weakness due to a
      Critical Illness Polyneuropathy (CIP). Early mobilization in ICU, by reducing the bed rest
      and decreasing the oxidative stress, was shown to represent a valid preventive option.

      Purpose: To evaluate whether ICU sessions of stepping verticalization associated with
      Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) of the lower limbs are able to reduce the occurrence
      of CIP in Acquired Brain Injured (ABI) patients.

      Methods: all the ABI patients admitted in our Neurorehabilitation Unit from our ICU were
      retrospectively evaluated. Patients affected by previous peripheral neuropathy, diabetes,
      cancer, alcoholism, viral hepatitis, AIDS and autoimmune diseases were excluded. They were
      divided into 3 groups according to the rehabilitation strategy received in ICU: group 1
      received conventional physiotherapy + stepping verticalization sessions with Erigo® (Hocoma,
      Switzerland); group 2 received conventional physiotherapy + stepping verticalization sessions
      with FES using ErigoPro®; group 3 received only conventional physiotherapy. As for internal
      protocol, all patients started rehabilitation in the first week from the ABI and performed 60
      minutes/day of rehabilitation, 5 days/week. Primary outcome was the evidence of CIP at
      Neurorehabilitation admission (=ICU discharge), according to neurophysiological criteria.
      Secondary outcomes were the strength impairment at Neurorehabilitation discharge, measured by
      the total Motricity Index score and the Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC) score,
      assessing quality of gait.
