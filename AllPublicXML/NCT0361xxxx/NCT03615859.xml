  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is designed to compare healthy volunteers with three groups of patients with
      adrenal insufficiency and a final group of patients receiving high dose steroids for
      anti-inflammatory purposes. The study will collect data on all 5 groups with the intention of
      identifying any novel markers or immunological indicators which may be used clinically to
      gauge the adequacy of steroid replacement treatment in patients with adrenal insufficiency.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glucocorticoid replacement in adrenal insufficiency poses a significant challenge. If given
      too much, patients risk long term complications including diabetes, osteoporosis and
      cardiovascular disease. If, however they are given too little, patients can feel tired,
      unwell and may collapse as there is insufficient steroid hormone to cope with stress.

      Currently there is no single objective marker or outcome that can be measured to ascertain
      whether a patient is receiving optimum glucocorticoid replacement therapy. This study will
      investigate a selection of markers to examine whether they can be used to as indicators to
      gauge the adequacy of therapy. Finding an appropriate marker could unlock better care and
      outcomes for our patients with adrenal insufficiency .

             growth hormone in secondary adrenal insufficiency) are accepted providing that their
             replacement doses have not altered for at least 3 months

          -  Participants who are able and willing to give written informed consent to participate
             in the study.
