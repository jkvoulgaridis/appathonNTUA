  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Growing evidences indicates that the Kangaroo Mother Method is associated with health
      benefits for the child and her mother. Improvements have been found in physiological
      parameters of the preterm infants assisted by the method. Some of them are the reduction of
      the heart rate and respiratory, as well as the increase of the body temperature and of the
      arterial saturation of oxygen. More recently, it has been observed that children submitted to
      the method present an improvement in muscle tone, by the increase in the electromyographic
      activity of the biceps brachii and hamstrings. These physiological changes can result in
      benefits for the child, with a positive influence on their development.

      It is well established that the preterm newborn has an important circulatory vulnerability,
      since the transition from fetal life to extrauterine life is a complex process in which the
      major changes are concentrated in the cardiovascular system and occur during the first Hours
      after birth accompanied by important consequences in physiological parameters, such as
      systemic vascular resistance, heart rate and blood flow in the organs. Therefore, global
      hemodynamic parameters have been studied in premature infants, especially after some
      intervention. It is worth noting, however, that these global parameters such as blood
      pressure, heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation do not reflect the existence of adequate
      tissue oxygenation, since they are macrocirculatory and non-microcirculatory parameters. In
      order to obtain reliable signals on tissue oxygenation, it is essential to study the
      microcirculation.

      To further explore the effects that Kangaroo Position promotes on the physiological aspects
      of the newborn, especially on hemodynamic parameters, we consider it important to study
      aspects that may, in fact, represent an adequate tissue oxygenation. Therefore, the objective
      of this study is to evaluate the effect of Kangaroo Position in the electromyographic
      activity and on hemodynamic parameters, by means of microcirculation/macrocirculation
      measurements.
