  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single-center, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, multiple
      ascending dose study in healthy volunteers. Thirty-two male and female volunteer subjects,
      between the ages of 18 and 64 years of age, will be enrolled. Subjects will be enrolled in
      four dose-escalating cohorts of eight subjects and randomized to USB005 or placebo in a ratio
      of 3:1. Cohorts will be enrolled sequentially starting at the lowest concentration. The four
      cohorts will be identified as: Cohort 1(0.03% USB005 or placebo), Cohort 2 (0.1% USB005 or
      placebo), Cohort 3 (0.3% USB005 or placebo), and Cohort 4 (0.45% USB005 or placebo).
      Volunteers in the four cohorts will self-administer a single drop of USB005 or placebo into
      the study eye, three times a day for 28 days. The study eye in which the drug is applied to
      will be determined based on screening assessments. Subjects will be followed for 8 days after
      the last USB005 or placebo administration.

      The safety and tolerability of USB005 will be demonstrated by local toxicity, adverse events,
      laboratory assessments, vital signs, and a comprehensive eye exam. Plasma samples will be
      taken at various time points throughout the study to characterize the pharmacokinetics of
      USB005. Dropouts will be replaced after consultation with the Sponsor.

         18. History or presence, as judged by the Investigator, of drug or alcohol abuse (ie,
             alcohol consumption &gt;2 drinks/day over the last 3 months prior to screening); drug
             abuse is any use of illegal drugs or prescription-drug over usage or addiction. A
             positive drug screen or alcohol screen will disqualify a volunteer from study
             participation;

         19. Donated &gt;400 mL and/or received any blood or blood products within the previous 3
             months prior to screening;

             fully with the study staff, may have difficulty following some study requirements, or
             is otherwise not qualified for the study;

         22. Any volunteer who is directly involved in the conduct of the protocol.
