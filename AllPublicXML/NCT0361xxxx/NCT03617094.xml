  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of carrying out early vertebroplasty
      procedure, compared to the standard conservative treatment (corset), in order to prevent
      residual deformations that could occur in complications of vertebral fractures that are
      medically treated using a corset.

      This is a monocentric, randomized, parallel group, prospective and open-label study.

      In this study, 58 patients with a vertebral fracture no more than 10 days old (with a max of
      15 days old) will be enrolled. Treatment will be randomly allocated in 2 groups: Early
      percutaneous vertebroplasty (EPV group) or standard conservative treatment (corset, CT
      group). Patients will be followed up during 3 months after treatment. They will receive
      standard care for a vertebral fracture at the Grenoble-Alpes University Hospital.

      Evaluated criteria: Vertebral kyphosis evolution, Pain, Efficacy and Quality of
      vertebroplasty procedure, Tolerance and observance of the standard treatment, Safety,
      Physical performance, Quality of life, Autonomy.
