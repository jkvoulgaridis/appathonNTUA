  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this project is to compare the microbiome profiles of healthy
      pregnant women, both before and after the introduction of a probiotic supplement into the
      maternal diet. Specifically, the investigators are performing a pilot randomized
      double-blinded placebo-controlled trial, comparing the microbiome profiles of 40 healthy
      pregnant women randomized to receive an oral probiotic containing a mixture of Lactobacillus
      and Bifidobacterium species (20 mothers) versus an oral placebo (20 mothers) during the
      first/second trimester of pregnancy. For each mother, the investigators will collect
      biospecimens from the vagina, rectum, and urine, both before intervention, and 4-6 weeks
      after intervention. These biospecimens will be analyzed to obtain their microbiome profiles
      using next-generation sequencing. The primary outcome of interest is the vaginal microbiome,
      with secondary outcomes including the microbiomes of the rectum and urine. Additionally, the
      investigators will collect clinical data from the mother's and infant's medical records to
      correlate our findings with pregnancy and postnatal outcomes.
