      Our study aims at assessment of response, survival and toxicity of frontline treatment with
      chemotherapy and Bevacizumab in patients having advanced epithelial ovarian cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy and is the fifth most common cause
      of cancer death in women .The majority of women with ovarian cancer are diagnosed with
      advanced-stage disease; only 15% of all cases are diagnosed with local disease. Risk factors
      for ovarian cancer include family history, nulliparity, lack of breast feeding, and
      infertility .

      The GOG-0218 trial demonstrated that the use of bevacizumab in the front-line and maintenance
      setting improved progression free survival by 3.8 months when compared with conventional
      every-3-weeks carboplatin and paclitaxel.

      The ICON-7 trial also aimed to compare the progression free survival and Overall survival in
      women who receive bevacizumab with carboplatin/paclitaxel and women receiving
      carboplatin/paclitaxel alone The final results of ICON7 were announced in 2013. Overall, the
      results showed no difference in overall survival between those in the group receiving
      bevacizumab han those in the group receiving no bevacizumab. However, for high-risk patients,
      who were most likely to have early disease progression, the results were positive and showed
      an improvement in overall survival of 4.8 months in the group who received bevacizumab.

      Not only has the best route been intensely debated but the optimal timing of therapy has been
      and is currently being studied. Chemotherapy is usually given either only after primary
      debulking surgery or as both neoadjuvant chemotherapy before and after interval debulking
      surgery. recent trials have tried to determine which treatment timing is associated with
      better outcomes .

      The aim of the study will be assessment of response, survival and toxicity of frontline
      treatment with chemotherapy and Bevacizumab in patients having advanced epithelial ovarian
      cancer.

    <description>The chemotherapy regimen will be Paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 of body surface area) administered intravenously over 3 h, followed by carboplatin (area under the curve 5) over 1 h, with standard antiemetic and hypersensitivity medications.
In patients who develop dose-limiting peripheral neuropathy or hypersensitivity, paclitaxel will be replaced with docetaxel (75 mg/m2), which is administered intravenously over 1 h.
Bevacizumab (15 mg/kg bodyweight) administered intravenously initially over 90 min (if tolerated, this time can be reduced to 60 min, and could be further reduced to a minimum of 30 min)</description>
