  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized phase III trial in women with invasive carcinoma of the breast with
      negative axillary nodes treated by Breast Conserving Surgery (BCS). Eligible, patients will
      be randomly allocated to receive radiotherapy of 3 Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy
      (3DCRT) Whole Breast Irradiation (WBI) 50 Gray (Gy) in 25 daily fractions over 5 weeks or
      Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI) 38.5 Gy in 10 daily fractions of 3.85Gy over
      two weeks or 38.5 Gy in 10 twice daily fractions of 3.85Gy over one week. Patients will be
      followed at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post randomization. Cosmetic outcome will be measured
      using photographs and evaluated by a panel of trained radiation oncologists. Radiation
      toxicity will be assessed using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for
      Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE).

    <textblock>
      Women with invasive carcinoma of the breast less than 3 cm with negative axillary nodes ,
      following BCS, who meet the inclusion criteria will be approached for potential study
      enrollment.

      Eligible, consenting patients will be randomly allocated to receive radiotherapy of 3DCRT WBI
      50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks or APBI 38.5 Gy in 10 once daily fractions of 3.85Gy over
      two weeks or 38.5 Gy in 10 twice daily fractions of 3.85 Gy over one week. Patients will be
      followed at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post randomization. Cosmetic outcome will be measured
      using photographs and evaluated by a panel of trained radiation oncologists using the EORTC
      Breast Cosmetic Rating System. Radiation toxicity will be assessed using the NCI CTCAE
      version 4.0. The primary outcome is to compare the acute, late toxicities and adverse
      cosmetic outcomes at 6, 12 and 18 months among the three groups.
