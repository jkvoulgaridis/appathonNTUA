  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research by the investigators' team and others demonstrates that posttraumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD), depression, alcohol use disorders (AUD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and
      chronic pain frequently co-occur among post-9/11 war Veterans and are associated with
      functional impairment and suicide risk; however, no treatment currently exists that has been
      specifically designed to promote functional recovery among Veterans experiencing any
      combination of these most common mental and physical wounds of war. The investigative team
      has: (A) identified multiple modifiable psychosocial factors (emotion regulation,
      psychological flexibility, self-compassion) that prospectively predict impairment and
      suicidal ideation in Veterans; (B) characterized long-term trajectories of resilience and
      functional disability in Veterans; (C) determined that high utilization of VA mental health
      services appears to have little, if any, impact on the functional recovery of Veterans on the
      moderate and severely impaired trajectories; (D) identified psychological flexibility (i.e.,
      the ability to remain present in the moment despite emotional distress and to persist in
      changing behavior in the pursuit of one's values and goals) as a unique, prospective
      predictor of membership in the severely impaired functional trajectory and of suicidal
      ideation, even after accounting for the effects of co-morbidity; and (E) demonstrated that
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)-a trans-diagnostic, mindfulness-based behavior
      therapy that seeks to improve functioning by targeting psychological flexibility -can lead to
      recovery, including sustained improvements in functional disability, quality of life (QoL),
      suicidal ideation, PTSD, and AUD symptoms among severely impaired Veterans with co-occurring
      PTSD-AUD.

      This study is Phase 3 of Project SERVE (Study Evaluating Returning Veterans' Experiences).
      Through two prior RR&amp;D MERIT awards, SERVE has followed a cohort of post-9/11 Veterans since
      2010 and has identified numerous risk and protective factors. SERVE's overall objective is to
      understand and improve the long-term functional outcomes of post-9/11 Veterans. Consistent
      with the investigators' conceptual model, the central hypothesis is that psychological
      flexibility and other trans-diagnostic treatment targets mediate the effects of the most
      common mental and physical wounds of war on long-term functioning and self-directed violence
      (i.e., suicide risk). Thus, integrated interventions specifically designed to improve
      functioning associated with these conditions are most likely to promote long-term recovery
      among the most impaired Veterans. The investigators will test the central hypothesis and
      accomplish the overall objective by pursuing the following specific aims:

      Aim 1: Identify treatment targets that prospectively predict functional disability and
      self-directed violence (SDV) in post-9/11 Veterans with PTSD, depression, chronic pain, TBI,
      and/or AUD.

      To achieve this aim, the investigators will follow 500 Veterans for 2 years in order to
      prospectively evaluate the impact of several novel, treatment-relevant factors on functional
      disability and SDV over time.

      H1: Novel factors (mindfulness, perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, and moral
      injury) along with established treatment targets (psychological flexibility, self-compassion,
      and emotion regulation) will prospectively predict functional disability and SDV after
      accounting for covariates.

      Aim 2: Develop, refine, and evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a transdiagnostic,
      personalized ACT-based behavioral therapy (ACT-FX) specifically designed to improve
      functioning in Veterans.

      The investigators will use the Successive Cohort Design method to refine ACT-FX. The
      investigators will then evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of ACT-FX in 60 Veterans
      randomly assigned to ACT-FX or treatment as usual (TAU) and who will remain in the
      longitudinal assessment study (Aim 1) for long-term follow-ups.

      H2: ACT-FX will be feasible and acceptable to Veterans with complex mental and physical
      wounds of war.

      Aim 3: (Exploratory) Evaluate if participation in ACT-FX leads to the emergence of a new
      trajectory class among Veterans in Project SERVE that is characterized by long-term
      functional recovery.

      H3: ACT-FX treatment will predict membership in a new trajectory class characterized by
      functional recovery compared to Veterans receiving TAU who will continue to exhibit flat or
      worsening trajectories.

      Impact: The proposed research will help identify novel modifiable factors for functional
      recovery and provide proof-of-concept, within the context of the longitudinal study, that
      ACT-FX promotes recovery. This innovative project has potential to advance VA healthcare by
      promoting long-term functional recovery in Veterans.

    <intervention_model_description>Procedures for Successive Cohort Design (SCD) study: Stage 1: Adaptation. Two cohorts (n = 5) of functionally impaired Veterans will be treated during the adaptation and refinement stages. Clinician and Veteran qualitative feedback will guide modifications to the treatment. Veteran qualitative interviews will be conducted post-treatment and then coded and analyzed. Qualitative findings will be used to guide modifications. Stage 2: Treatment refinement. Using the revised manual, the investigators will treat a second cohort and follow the same methods described in Stage 1 to guide additional modifications. Stage 3: Pilot RCT. The investigators will conduct a pilot RCT of the modified ACT-FX protocol compared to mental health treatment as usual (TAU) with 30 treatment completers per group. The goals are to evaluate feasibility and acceptability.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy to promote functional recovery in war veterans (ACT-FX) will be an individually-tailored intervention to reduce functional impairment associated with any combination of the most common mental and physical wounds of war. ACT is an evidence-based, mindfulness-based behavioral treatment. The ACT model posits that low levels of psychological flexibility leads to functional impairment across a range of mental and physical health problems; thus, ACT is aimed at increasing psychological flexibility. ACT-FX will be a 12-session, individual, outpatient treatment, with sessions occurring approximately weekly. Each session includes: 1) mindfulness training; 2) review of between-session mindfulness practice and behavioral assignments; 3) new content and experiential exercises; and 4) development of values-consistent behavioral assignments to improve functioning. Daily mindfulness practice will be assigned.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Veterans will be recruited for the SCD treatment study (total n = 100 across 3 stages) from
        the ongoing longitudinal assessment study. The inclusion criteria for the longitudinal
        assessment study are as follows:

          -  Potential participants include male and female

          -  English-speaking OEF/OIF/OND Veterans

          -  Enrolled at CTVHCS or willing to be enrolled for the purpose of participation in this
             study.

        To be eligible, participants must be

          -  able to comprehend and sign the informed consent form

          -  able to complete the structured interviews and self-report assessments

          -  willing to be contacted for follow-up assessments

        For newly enrolled participants:

          -  given that the investigators have already recruited a large sample of veterans who are
             reporting relatively little functional impairment, the investigators will require
             newly enrolled participants to self-report global functional impairment on the WHODAS
             2.0 12-item self-report version equivalent to a mean item score of 1.0.

               -  Although the investigators anticipate being able to meet the recruitment goals,
                  should recruitment prove more challenging than expected, the investigators will
                  remove this inclusion criterion

          -  deemed stable on psychotropic medications (defined as 3 months on a selective
             serotonin reuptake inhibitor or monoamine oxidase inhibitor; &gt;1 month on an anxiolytic
             or beta-blocker; &gt;1 month medication discontinuation or &quot;wash out&quot; for all
             medications) at the time of the BL assessment

          -  deemed stable in psychotherapy (3 months stabilization for psychotherapy and 1-month
             psychotherapy wash-out) at the time of the BL assessment

               -  These latter two criteria are instated to ensure that symptoms assessed during
                  the baseline assessment are due to any underlying psychiatric condition and not
                  due to the effects of starting or stopping medications and/or psychotherapy.

          -  Changes in treatment will be permissible during the current study, as this reflects
             real-world practice

          -  All changes in medications will be monitored over time, and appropriately covaried, as
             treatment can have important effects on functioning over time

          -  Individuals will be eligible to participate with current and lifetime psychiatric
             diagnoses, with the exception of:

               -  schizophrenia

               -  schizophreniform disorder

               -  schizoaffective disorder

               -  delusional disorder

               -  unspecified schizophrenia spectrum/other psychotic disorder, and bipolar disorder

        Additional inclusion criteria specific to the SCD treatment study are:

          -  Veterans will have a global disability (mean item) score on the WHODAS 2.0 of 1.0,
             which is 1 SD above the mean of the large non-psychiatric sample of Veterans from
             SERVE and VA Boston during both of their last 2 assessments

          -  Those enrolling in the pilot RCT must be willing to be randomized

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion criteria for the longitudinal assessment study are as follows:

          -  plan to relocate out of the CTVHCS system within four months of protocol initiation

          -  meet criteria for a diagnosis of:

               -  schizophrenia

               -  schizophreniform disorder

               -  schizoaffective disorder

               -  delusional disorder

               -  a manic/hypomanic episode

          -  report current suicidal or homicidal risk warranting crisis intervention

          -  report symptoms consistent with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) that interfere
             with their ability to complete the consent process or assessment

               -  i.e., due to ethical concerns about obtaining informed consent and difficulties
                  with completing the structured assessment

          -  report current non-military related hallucinations or delusions that cause significant
             distress and/or impairment

        Additional exclusion criteria for the SCD treatment study are:

          -  recent (1 month) or anticipated change in psycho-pharmacological treatment. Veterans
             may stay on current medications but will be asked to refrain from changes to the
             extent possible based on safety

          -  for those randomized to ACT-FX, current participation in another form of individual or
             group psychotherapy

          -  logistical circumstances that would interfere with study completion

          -  Presence of a non-alcohol substance use disorder (SUD) deemed to be the primary focus
             of treatment

               -  Those with a principal AUD will be eligible.

          -  Additional diagnoses of non-alcohol SUD are allowed, unless they are deemed the
             principal focus of treatment.

          -  Potentially eligible Veterans who score above the clinical cutoff on the DAST will be
             asked additional questions during the eligibility screening to determine whether they
             meet criteria for a principal non-alcohol SUD (see phone screen)

          -  AUD/SUD of sufficient severity that residential, rather than outpatient, treatment is
             indicated based on potential safety concerns associated with withdrawal.

               -  This determination will be made by the PI, with consultation from the Veteran's
                  existing treatment providers, as appropriate.

               -  The investigators will begin the treatment adaptation (Stage 1) and refinement
                  (Stage 2) by recruiting transfer participants who have already been assessed over
                  time immediately following their baseline assessment.

               -  The pilot RCT will include both transfer and newly enrolled Veterans.
