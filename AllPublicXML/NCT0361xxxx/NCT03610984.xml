    <measure>Effects of structured education on β-cell endocrine function progression of T1D patients.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and every three months afterwards.</time_frame>
    <description>The natural progression of patients' β-cell endocrine functions was assessed by fasting C-peptide (FCP) and postprandial C-peptide (PCP) at each visit. FCP and PCP levels were measured at initial recruitment and every three months after that. The decay rate of β-cell endocrine function of patients in the two groups were compared.
Serum C-peptide levels were measured by a chemiluminescence method using a commercial available kit (Adiva Centaur System, Siemens, Germany).</description>
