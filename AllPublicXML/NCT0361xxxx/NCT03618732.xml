  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at investigating whether bilateral movement-based training with computer
      games could augment motor function of paretic upper limb and improve quality of life in
      sub-acute stroke patients.

    <measure>Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity Scores (FMA-UE scores) baseline to 4 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) is a stroke-specific, performance-based impairment index. It is designed to assess motor functioning, balance, sensation and joint functioning in patients with post-stroke hemiplegia. It is applied clinically and in research to determine disease severity, describe motor recovery, and to plan and assess treatment. The FMA-UE scores measure motor impairment of upper extremity. The motor domain includes items assessing movement, coordination, and reflex action of the shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist and hand.</description>

    <measure>Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) baseline to 4 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) is an evaluative measure to assess specific changes in limb function among individuals who sustained cortical damage resulting in hemiplegia. It assesses a client's ability to handle objects differing in size, weight and shape and therefore can be considered to be an arm-specific measure of activity limitation.</description>
