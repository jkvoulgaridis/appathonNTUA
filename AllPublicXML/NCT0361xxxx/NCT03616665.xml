  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The major objective of this randomized controlled study is to compare a new conceptualized
      personalized concept of Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy
      (CBASPersonalized) with a six-week waiting-list control (WLC) group and a version of
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBIntegrative) in the treatment of patients with persistent
      depressive disorder (PDD), childhood maltreatment, and treatment-resistance. Both active
      groups will be offered as treatment-phase programs (six-week inpatient-treatment and optional
      six-week blended-online-aftercare) in combination with standardized pharmacotherapy in a
      routine clinical inpatient setting. This study addresses the primary research question: Is
      the intensive six-week inpatient CBASPersonalized treatment more effective than a six-week
      WLC in a clinical sample of PDD patients? In addition, CBASPersonalized will be compared with
      CBIntegrative investigating differential indication by moderator, mediator, and process
      analyses.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Persistent depressive disorder (PDD) is a prevalent disabling disorder. Given its
      high degree of treatment-resistance (TR), comorbidity, and suicidality, this patient group
      constitutes a massive health problem. The Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of
      Psychotherapy (CBASP) was specifically developed for the outpatient treatment of PDD showing
      superiority to active control groups in some studies, yet not to the 'gold-standard'
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). In addition, non-remission and relapse rates of CBASP are
      relatively high, which might be caused by the fact that within the original CBASP-concept the
      frequent comorbid disorders are not sufficiently addressed. Thus, an optimized personalized
      CBASP-concept (CBASPersonalized) was established including the interpersonal CBASP-strategies
      while adding evidence-based intrapersonal strategies being tailored to the specific comorbid
      problems. In this study, the investigators will compare CBASPersonalized with I) a six-week
      waiting-list control (WLC) and II) CBT integrating strategies from the Acceptance and
      Commitment Therapy (CBIntegrative). Both active groups will be offered as treatment-phase
      programs (six-week inpatient-treatment and optional six-week blended-online-aftercare) in
      combination with standardized pharmacotherapy in a routine clinical inpatient setting.

      Methods: In the proposed prospective, mono-site, evaluator-blinded, randomized-controlled
      study, 192 PDD patients with childhood maltreatment and TR will be included. The study
      addresses the primary research question: Is the six-week inpatient CBASPersonalized-treatment
      more effective than a six-week WLC in PDD? It is hypothesized that six weeks after
      randomization, CBASPersonalized will significantly outperform WLC concerning reduction in
      depressive symptomatology (according to the 24-item version of the Hamilton Rating Scale of
      Depression, HRSD). In addition, the investigators will compare CBASPersonalized with
      CBIntegrative investigating differential indication by moderator, mediator, and process
      analyses. Primary and secondary outcome will be analyzed using analysis of covariance
      (ANCOVA) controlling for pre-treatment scores. Moderator, mediator, and process analyses will
      be performed using multiple regression and linear mixed models. A follow-up survey 6 months
      after end of treatment will provide important results on long-term treatment outcome.

      Discussion: The results of this study may have the potential to alleviate the burden of this
      serious and cost-intensive disease while improving public health. In addition, moderator and
      mediator analyses may guide personalized treatment and enable therapists to address
      psychotherapeutic needs of PDD patients more specifically.

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Due to the nature of interventions, masking or blinding of patients/therapists is impossible, but all assessments and data analysis will be blinded to treatment allocation. Measures to insure blinding will include locating the raters separately from the study wards, instructing patients not to mention information that could reveal their allocation, and providing back-up raters in case of unintentional unblinding. All blinded observers will be trained in all instruments. The trial statistician will be blinded to the allocated treatments during the analysis of the primary outcome. Strict concealment of randomization will be guaranteed to exclude selection bias. Since randomization of therapists is impossible, demographic and professional characteristics of therapists will be assessed.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 13, and 37 weeks after study start</time_frame>
    <description>It will be examined whether the effectiveness of CBASPersonalized and CBIntegrative (compared to WLC) can be explained by a decrease of dysfunctional attitudes and an increase in value-driven activities in CBIntegrative. The DAS is a self-report questionnaire to assess dysfunctional attitudes. It contains 40 items that assess depressogenic attitudes (need for approval, perfectionism, avoidance of risk/ need for success, need to impress others, need for approval, need to control feelings). There are 7 response categories (7= totally agree, 1= totally disagree). A total value of 280 can be achieved with higher values representing higher prevalence of dysfunctional attitudes.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 13, and 37 weeks after study start</time_frame>
    <description>It will be investigated whether the effectiveness of CBASPersonalized and CBIntegrative (compared to WLC) can be explained by a decrease of dysfunctional attitudes and an increase in value-driven activities in CBIntegrative. The BADS is designed to measure changes in avoidance and activation over the course of Behavioral Activation for depression. Areas of interest are 1) sleeping and staying in bed, 2) activity, 3) avoidance, 4) rumination, 5) social problems, 6) work and school problems, 7) coping skills, 8) mood dependent behavior, 9) awareness and identification problems. Responses are given on a 7-point scale (from 0= not at all to 6 = completely)</description>

    <description>Within the psychotherapy CBASPersonalized, the original specific six interpersonal CBASP strategies are augmented with intrapersonal evidence-based strategies. According to the frequently diagnosed comorbid disorders of PDD the following modules have been added: a) treatment of anxiety disorders and treatment of traumatic experiences, b) regulating intensive emotions, c) coping with resistant problems like pain, and d) relapse prevention. In addition, therapists adjust their strategies and therapeutic relationship according to the impairment in personality functioning and maladaptive personality traits of the patient.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients assigned to this group receive the established and evidence-based psychotherapy cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) whereas strategies of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) are integrated. Basic CBT techniques will be applied in this group (e.g. psychoeducation, behavior analyses, behavioral activation, cognitive strategies, exposure sessions). Further, therapists are allowed to apply social competence training and euthymic techniques, self-management, relaxation techniques, and biofeedback. In addition, techniques from ACT will be integrated. Therapists are explicitly instructed not to use the original six interpersonal CBASP techniques or methods from schema therapy.</description>
