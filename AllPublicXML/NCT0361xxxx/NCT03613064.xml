  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a feasibility study of an enhanced transitional care
      intervention, that will: 1) automate identification and risk-stratification of patients with
      CHF and IHD with social vulnerabilities; 2) incorporate a new standardized social
      vulnerabilities screening tool into clinical care; 3) enable electronic referrals to
      community resources; and 4) add novel community-based interventions to the existing
      medically-oriented transitional care intervention that is the standard of care at the study
      hospital (Parkland Hospital in Dallas, Texas) and other hospitals nationwide.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to develop, pilot and evaluate the feasibility of an existing
      medically oriented transitional care intervention enhanced to also address social
      vulnerabilities, to prevent readmissions in congestive heart failure (CHF) &amp; ischemic heart
      disease (IHD). The intervention design will be based on the Andersen Behavior Model of Health
      Services Use, highlighting pathways for clinical linkages to community resources to
      facilitate individual behavior change. To summarize, although existing interventions have
      largely focused on individual- and health system-level factors such as optimizing medication
      regimens, discharge education, and post-discharge follow-up, much of the risk for readmission
      in patients with CHF and IHD is also driven by social vulnerabilities that are currently not
      addressed in medical settings. Community-based organizations are a valuable but untapped
      resource to ameliorate key social vulnerabilities (i.e., food/housing insecurity, behavioral
      health needs) that are major barriers to effective medication and visit adherence,
      self-management and lifestyle modification in patients with heart disease. Thus, the
      investigators propose an enhanced transitional care intervention that uses the Dallas
      Information Exchange Portal, a health information technology platform, to link patients to
      local community organizations at discharge. Addressing social vulnerabilities to enable
      better adherence, self-management, and lifestyle behaviors can in turn prevent readmissions
      and improve downstream health outcomes. The investigators will conduct a feasibility study of
      an enhanced transitional care intervention, that will: 1) automate identification and
      risk-stratification of patients with CHF and IHD with social vulnerabilities; 2) incorporate
      a new standardized social vulnerabilities screening tool into clinical care; 3) enable
      electronic referrals to community resources; and 4) add novel community-based interventions
      to the existing medically-oriented transitional care intervention that is the standard of
      care at Parkland and other hospitals nationwide. The investigators will assess feasibility
      and acceptability of our intervention using measures derived from the RE-AIM (Reach,
      Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) implementation science framework.
