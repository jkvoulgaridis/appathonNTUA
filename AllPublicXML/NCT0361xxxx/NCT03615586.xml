      Background and aim: The use of chaperone in routine anorectal examination of women attending
      to Coloproctology clinics has not been studied to this date. The aim of this study is to
      compare the patients' perception and preference regarding the presence of a chaperone during
      their first anorectal examination. Patients and methods: adult women will be randomly
      selected to be examined with or without the presence of a female chaperone. After that, they
      will answer a questionnaire form about how they feel during the examination and whether or
      not they would prefer having or not a chaperone present in that clinical situation. The
      patients will prospectively enrolled in one of the two groups of this randomized trial during
      a period of two years.

    <textblock>
      The use of chaperone in routine anorectal examination of women attending to Coloproctology
      clinics has not been studied to this date. However, there are some guidance saying says that
      doctors should offer the patient the option of a chaperone wherever possible before
      conducting an intimate examination. The aim of this study is to compare the female patients'
      perception and preference regarding the presence of a chaperone during their first anorectal
      examination conduct by a male physician. Adult women will be investigated during their first
      visit to a Coloproctology Clinic at University Hospital. Only senior professionals will be
      examining the patients. This will be a prospectively randomized trial. Patients will be
      selected to be examined with or without the presence of a female chaperone. After that, they
      will answer a questionnaire form about how they feel during the examination and whether or
      not they would prefer having or not a chaperone present during the anorectal examination. The
      enrollment period will be two years from July 2018. Sample size estimated for the study is
      188 patients (94 in each study group).
