  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreaticoduodenectomy is inevitably an operation requiring extensive skin and muscle
      incision, resulting in postoperative pain resulting in limitation of the patient's early
      exercise and function. ETOIMS(Electrical Twitch Obstructive Intramuscular Stimulation) is
      used to relieve muscle pain and relax muscles. ETOIMS is a method to relieve pain by
      stimulating muscle in myofascial pain syndrome. ETOIMS as an effective new treatment for pain
      after pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy.

    <description>The primary outcome of this study was the postoperative pain score (VAS score) in patients undergoing ETOIMS during surgery. The type of surgery in the experimental group and the control group is the same and the same analgesic agent (IV PCA, Wound PCA) is used. The pain score is measured at 7 o'clock every morning from the day following surgery to discharge (about Postoperative day 10) to confirm the reduced pattern.</description>
