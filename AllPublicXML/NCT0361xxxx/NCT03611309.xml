  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study goal is to compare surgeon-palliative care team co-management, versus surgeon alone
      management, of patients and family members preparing for major upper gastrointestinal cancer
      surgery. The study also aims to explore, using qualitative methods, the impact of
      surgeon-palliative care team co-management versus surgeon alone management on the
      perioperative care experience for patients, family members, surgeons, and palliative care
      clinicians.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The components of surgeon palliative care team co management practices will include Time,
      Education, Assessments, and Multi disciplinary (TEAM) element.

        1. Time; At least 60 minutes/month (per patient and caregiver preference) devoted to
           palliative care treatments for the patient and family

        2. Education - Patients and family members, per their desires and wishes, are counseled and
           educated about their disease, including self-management of symptoms, prognosis, and
           treatment options

        3. Assessment - Formal assessment of symptoms including pain, dyspnea,
           constipation/diarrhea, anxiety/depression, fatigue, and nausea. Edmonton symptom score33
           will be used as a formal assessment.

        4. Multi-Disciplinary - Management must be multi disciplinary with access to a
           multi-disciplinary palliative care team composed of nurse, physician, social worker,
           pharmacist, and/or chaplain team members.

    <measure>Patient quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Patient quality of life will be measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Palliative care subscale (FACIT-PAL). FACIT-PAL is a compilation of general questions divided into four primary QOL domains: Physical Well-Being, Social/Family Well-Being, Emotional Well-Being, and Functional Well-Being. FACIT-PAL has 46 item self report measure. The range is from 0-184 for the FACIT-PAL. The outcome will be reported as the median value per group, with full range.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient mood symptoms assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Patient symptoms will be measured by Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-29) version 2.0. The PROMIS-29 is health-related quality of life survey which assesses each of the 7 PROMIS domains (pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep, physical function and sexual function) with 4 questions. The questions are ranked on a 5-point Likert Scale and 11 point rating scale for pain intensity. The outcome will be reported as the median value per group, with full range.</description>

    <description>Patient will be assessed for twelve symptoms (pain, tiredness, nausea, depression, anxiety, drowsiness, appetite, well-being, shortness of breath, constipation, financial distress, and spiritual pain) using a modified Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS). Each symptom is rated from 0 to 10 on a numerical scale, 0 meaning that the symptom is absent and 10 that it is of the worst possible severity. The outcome will be reported as the median value per group, with full range.</description>

    <description>In the Surgeon-palliative care team co-management arm, all patients receive the surgical care of surgeon alone management, which includes surgeon and the surgical team. In addition to this surgeon alone care, palliative care will also be provided by a specialist team. For patients in this arm, patients and/or family members will be seen by the palliative care team: (1) in an outpatient setting prior to surgery, (2) in the hospital within 72 hours of their initial surgery and as needed afterwards, and (3) via phone on in-clinic (per patient preference) on an at least monthly basis and/or as needed for 12 weeks following surgery.</description>
