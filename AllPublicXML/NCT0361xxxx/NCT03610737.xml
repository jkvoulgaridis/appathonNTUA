  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled clinical study examining functional
      improvement in lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) patients with neurogenic claudication who are
      treated with the MILD procedure plus conventional medical management (CMM) compared to those
      treated with CMM alone, as the control. Subjects in the control group will be allowed to
      crossover and receive MILD after completion of 12-month follow-up.

    <description>Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) measures permanent functional disability using questions regarding activities of daily living (ADL), specifically disturbance in ADL related to chronic back pain. Higher score indicate a 'more limited' life.
The ten topics of the ODI are rated from zero (no pain/limitation) to five (high pain/very limited physically). Calculated values range from zero (0% disability) to 100 (100% disability).</description>

    <time_frame>6 month</time_frame>
    <description>Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) measures pain intensity on scale of 0 to 10. Zero (0) represents 'no pain' and '10' represents the &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in ZCQ</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month</time_frame>
    <description>Zurich Claudication Questionaire (ZCQ) quantifies severity of symptoms, physical function characteristics, and patient's satisfaction after treatment. Symptom severity scale (1-5), Physical function scale (1-4), Patient's satisfaction (1-4). The lower the score the better.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients experiencing neurogenic claudication symptoms for at least 3 months duration.

          -  LSS with neurogenic claudication

          -  Radiologic evidence of LSS with unilateral or bilateral ligamentum flavum ≥ 2.5mm
             confirmed by pre-op MRI or CT performed within 12 months of baseline visit.

          -  Patients with comorbid conditions commonly associated with spinal stenosis, such as
             osteophytes, facet hypertrophy, minor spondylolisthesis (Grade I without instability),
             foraminal stenosis, and/or disk protrusion may be included unless the treating
             physician has determined that the condition is too advanced.

          -  Stable opioid intake with no change during 30 days prior to enrollment.

          -  Available to complete all follow-up visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  ODI Score &lt; 31 (0-100 ODI Scale).

          -  NPRS Score &lt; 5 (0-10 NPRS Scale).

          -  Lumbar epidural injections during eight weeks prior to study enrollment.

          -  Baseline analgesic medication greater than 90 milligram morphine equivalent (MME).

          -  Prior surgery at the same treatment level.

          -  Previously received interspinous spacer at the same treatment level.

          -  Previously received intradiscal procedure at the same treatment level.

          -  Previously received vertebral augmentation procedure at the same treatment level.

          -  Previously received the MILD procedure at the same treatment level.

          -  Received radiofrequency ablation at the same or the adjacent levels within 6 months
             prior to study enrollment.

          -  History of spinal fractures with current related pain symptoms.

          -  Grade II or higher spondylolisthesis.

          -  Motor deficit or disabling back and/or leg pain from causes other than LSS neurogenic
             claudication (e.g. acute compression fracture, metabolic neuropathy, or vascular
             claudication symptoms, etc.).

          -  Unable to walk ≥ 10 feet unaided before being limited by pain. In this context,
             'unaided' means without the use of a cane, walker, railing, wall, another person or
