  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 is a phase Ib standard &quot;3 + 3&quot; design will be employed to determine the MTD of APG-115
      by assessing the DLT of APG-115 in combination with pembrolizumab.

      Part 2 is a Simon two-stage phase II study design. At RP2D of APG-115 in combination with
      pembrolizumab, approximately 43 patients will be treated with the combination until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, or another discontinuation criterion is met.

      Part 1 is the open label, dose-escalation phase Ib portion of the study to establish an
      MTD/RP2D of APG-115 in combination with pembrolizumab. Dose levels/schedule of APG115 will be
      tested: 50mg, 100mg, 150mg, and 200mg, QOD with 2 weeks on 1 week off as a cycle of 21 days
      (3 weeks), pembrolizumab will administrated with label dose.

      Part 2 is the phase II portion of the study to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of
      the RP2D of APG-115 in combination with label dose of pembrolizumab in patient with
      unresectable or metastatic melanoma who is refractory or relapse of PD1 therapy. In this
      part, Simon's two-stage design (Simon R (1989). Controlled Clinical Trials 10: 1-10.) will be
      used. The null hypothesis that the true response rate is 10% or lower will be tested against
      a one-sided alternative. In the first stage, 18 patients will be accrued. If there are 2 or
      fewer responses in these patients, the study will be stopped. Otherwise, 25 additional
      patients will be accrued for a total of 43. The null hypothesis will be rejected if 8 or more
      responses are observed in 43 patients. This design yields a type I error rate of 0.10 and
      power of 80% when the true response rate is 25% or higher.

    <description>dose escalation of APG-115 in combination with label dose of pembrolizumab, Four dose levels of APG-115 will be tested: 50, 100, 150, and 200mg. APG-115 will be administrated orally every other day (QOD) for consecutive 2 weeks (ie. dosed at Day 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13), with one week dosing off as 3-weeks a cycle. Pembrolizumab is administrated following FDA approved label dose, i.e.: 200mg intravenous infusion at Day 1 of every 3 weeks as a cycle.</description>
