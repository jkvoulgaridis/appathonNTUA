      This is a single center, randomized, open-label, two-arm, parallel design, phase I study that
      using TG-2349 or DAG181 alone, or TG-2349 plus DAG181 to evaluate the drug-drug reactions,
      the pharmacokinetics, and tolerability profile in healthy Chinese volunteers. The results
      will be the reference for protocol designs of subsequent clinical trials.
