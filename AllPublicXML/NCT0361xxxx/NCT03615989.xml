  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will analyze whether dairy in combination with creatine supplementation will
      positively impact loading exercise-induced bone cell activity in healthy young females more
      than dairy and exercise or exercise alone.

      Introduction: Two million individuals at a cost of around 2.3 billion dollars a year in
      Canada suffer from osteoporosis. Research that emphasizes the treatment of this disease is
      important, but so is research that focuses on prevention; reducing bone loss and/or
      increasing bone mass when young. Countermeasures to improve bone health, such as nutrition
      and exercise, should be explored and implemented, particularly during young adulthood when
      peak bone mass is achieved so that the burden of osteoporosis later in life can be mitigated.
      The proposed research combines both nutrition and exercise along with the assessment of bone
      turnover markers in healthy young females, and aims to determine whether dairy in combination
      with creatine supplementation positively impacts acute bone turnover following a bout of
      resistance and plyometric exercise.

      Design: Randomized triple crossover trial.

      Participants: 10 healthy university aged females.

      Methods: Participants will be asked to complete 3 different acute exercise and nutritional
      supplement trials. Each trial will be assigned in random order. The three trials are: 1)
      exercise+carbohydrate (CHO), 2) exercise+milk (Milk), and 3) exercise+milk+creatine (Cre).
      The whole study will take a maximum of 12 weeks to complete as each supplement trial will be
      separated by 2-4 weeks. Each treatment is outlined below.

      Anticipated Results: The investigators anticipate that creatine in conjunction with dairy and
      exercise will have a greater positive impact on acute bone cell activity in healthy young
      females more than dairy+exercise and more than exercise alone.

    <description>Participants will have a fasted, baseline blood sample (10ml) taken upon arrival to the lab. They will then complete a supervised resistance and plyometric exercise bout. Immediately following exercise, 51g of carbohydrate (maltodextrin) + water will be consumed. Two more blood samples will follow the exercise bout at 5 minutes post (10ml) and 1 hour post (10ml). An additional 51g of carbohydrate will be consumed with water 1 hour post exercise. Two more fasting blood samples (10ml) will be taken 24 and 48 hours later.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete a 6-day creatine loading phase (5 grams x 4 times/day) before they come in for the exercise bout. Participants will have a fasted, baseline blood sample (10ml) taken upon arrival to the lab. Before the exercise bout, 5 grams of creatine will be taken. They will then complete a supervised resistance and plyometric exercise bout. Immediately following exercise, 555 ml of skim milk + 5g of creatine will be consumed. Two more blood samples will follow the exercise bout at 5 minutes post (10ml) and 1 hour post (10ml). An additional 555ml of skim milk will be consumed 1 hour post exercise without creatine. 5g of creatine will then be consumed with the participant's last meal of the day. Two more fasting blood samples (10ml) will be taken 24 and 48 hours later. On the day after exercise, participants will consume a 5g maintenance dose of creatine with their last meal of the day (between the 24 and 48h blood sample).</description>
