      To develop awareness, enhance knowledge, attitude and make behavioral changes by using health
      education and mHealth technology among hypertensive patients in a rural community of
      Bangladesh, A Randomized Controlled Trial will be conducted in a rural community around
      Kumudini Women's Medical College and Hospital, Mirzapur, Bangladesh, intervention period will
      be consecutive 5 months and 210 in each group (total 420). Face to face interviews will be
      conducted to develop awareness among hypertensive individuals as part of the provision of
      improved health care services. The face to face interview will take place at Kumudini
      Hospital or in the community. Face to face interviews will help to understand the
      individuals' perceptions, attitudes, and practices associated with compliance to treatment
      and behavior change. Additionally, the study will identify major barriers related to
      hypertension associated with healthcare-seeking behaviors. Subjects will be diagnosed cases
      of hypertension. The selection criteria would be: individuals aged 35 years and more, have at
      least 1-5 years of schooling, who are open and can exchange their views freely as well as who
      can be asked in-depth and probing questions. Moreover, specimens will be collected to examine
      for serum total cholesterol, random blood sugar, urinary salinity, and urinary protein.
      Physical measurements like height in meter, weight in kg, MUAC in millimeter, hip and waist
      ratio will be performed from the day of enrollment till the end of follow up. If the
      participant agrees to participate, they will be asked questions about their lifestyle,
      present health status, and socio-demographic characteristics. The interview will around 30
      minutes of their time, measurement of nutritional status (height, weight, MUAC, hip
      circumference, and waist circumference), and specimen collection for laboratory tests (blood
      and urine) will take another 30 minutes. Initially, the follow-up visits will be twice a
      month then once a month up to 4 consecutive months. Interviews will be conducted in the
      Kumudini Women's Medical College and Hospital. The data will be securely stored in a locked
      room. Data will be processed and analyzed by using the statistical software packages SPSS for
      Windows version 21.0 and Epi Info version 6.0. Statistical significance will be defined as
      p&lt;0.05.

      Introduction:

      Hypertension is one of the foremost non-communicable diseases (NCDs)c in the world, which
      significantly contributes to the burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), stroke, kidney
      failure, disability, and premature death. It is also recognized as a global public health
      problem and ranked third as a cause of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). According to
      the World Health Organization (WHO), about 17 million deaths occur worldwide due to CVDs, of
      which hypertension alone accounts for 9.4 million deaths and 80% of the CVD-related deaths
      occurred in the developing countries. The global prevalence of hypertension is projected to
      increase from 26% in 2000 to 29% by 2025, which will be approximately 29% of the world's
      population. Its prevalence is increasing in the low and middle-income countries (LMIC),
      especially Southeast Asia where individuals are having an increasing burden of hypertension
      including CVDs. According to WHO, hypertension has become a significant health concern in the
      Asian region, affecting more than 35% of the adult population. Bangladesh, a developing
      country in South Asia, has been experiencing an epidemiologic transition from communicable
      diseases to NCDs. In recent years, rapid urbanization, prolonged life expectancy, unhealthy
      diet, and lifestyle changes have led to an increase in the rate of CVD including hypertension
      in Bangladesh. In recent years, in Bangladesh, approximately 20% of adults and 40-65% of
      elderly people suffer from HTN. Most of the common reasons are sedentary lifestyle, changing
      food habit, smoking, and adulteration of food products, fruits, and vegetables. However,
      keeping in mind the changes in lifestyle and food habits among the young adults in
      Bangladesh, the possibilities of hypertension in young adults can't be ruled out among this
      age group. In this study, we aim to develop awareness, enrich knowledge and make behavioral
      modifications by health education and mHealth technology among hypertensive patients in a
      rural community of Bangladesh.

      Objectives:

      General objective:

        1. To develop awareness and enhance knowledge, which will be measured by actual behavioral
           changes by using health education and mHealth technology among hypertensive patients in
           a rural community of Bangladesh.

           Specific objectives:

        2. To evaluate the level of blood pressure changes

        3. To measure health status by Euro-5D-5L QOL questionnaire (Mobility, self-care, usual
           activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression)

        4. To decrease dietary salt intake (Measured by food and urinary salinity test)

        5. To measure blood glucose level (Random Blood Sugar), urinary protein and glucose test to
           measure complications.

        6. To evaluate the feasibility of this intervention strategies and mHealth technology.

      Hypothesis:

      Here we hypothesize that hypertensive patients because of health education and mHealth
      technology applications (cell phone monitoring of BP and periodic behavioral change education
      - drug adherence) and follow-up will have decreased blood pressure (BP) relative to controls
      under medication but without any mHealth technology applications. Compared to controls,
      intervention patients at follow-up will report quality of life, behavioral change, dietary
      habit as well as their greater satisfaction with care.

      Sample size calculation In this study we have considered two groups, intervention group (PI;
      health education with text messaging) and control group (PC; health education without text
      messaging). In each group a proportion of the participants will respond to the intervention;
      PI and PC. When the intention of the study is to show that the intervention group is superior
      than the usual formulation of null hypothesis (PI&gt;PC).

      In this study the investigators want to compare between two interventions (health education
      with or without text messaging). Investigators regard the compliance as PI&gt;PC. We assume
      that, if the proportion of patients with compliance is at most 10% to 12% better in the
      health education with text messaging group.

      Sample size was calculated with 2-tailed 5% significance level, power 80% with a confidence
      level of 95% (1‐α) and to detect varying differences in the effectiveness of the two
      intervention groups. Assuming adherence rates differing between 10-12% with 90% in the study
      group and 78%, 79% and 80% respectively in the control group and with a presumption that 6%
      of the participants would be lost during follow-up. The sample size was calculated to range
      between 153-210 in each group. Thus, considering the largest size of the calculated sample
      sizes, the study finally had a sample size of 210 in each group.

      Randomization:

      A randomization schedule is being prepared following a permuted block randomization technique
      using a block size of four based on a computer-generated series of numbers. An experienced
      researcher (third party), who is not involved with the study generated the random allocation
      by sequence and distributed that in serially numbered sealed opaque envelopes which are being
      kept in locked file cabinets in a site away from trial's location. Thus, all CHWs and the
      principal investigator (PI) are kept blinded about the random allocation. A total of eight
      CHWs are being involved in participants' enrollment under the guidance of the PI. Sequential
      ID numbers of the potential participants are arranged by the PI immediately before enrolling
      in the field on a daily basis. Enrollment takes place during morning hours for consecutive 6
      days (except Friday) in a week. CHWs open the envelope in front of the participants at their
      household when they agree to be enrolled in the study by giving written informed consent.

      Enrollment of participants:

      The study will be implemented at Kumudini Women's Medical College and Hospital immediately
      after getting IRB approval from Bangladesh Medical and Research Council (BMRC). Hypertensive
      patients living in rural Mirzapur will be mostly identified from Mirzapur Kumudini Hospital.
      Additionally, study participants will be selected from the community by the door to door
      visits. The diagnosis of hypertension will be based on the prescription and Kumudini hospital
      database records.

      Study Activities and Data Collection Procedure:

      Qualitative study

      The present qualitative assessment will follow an exploratory study design. The study will
      particularly aim to comprehend the knowledge level in relation to hypertension in a rural
      community of Bangladesh. To achieve the study objectives, this study will adopt focus group
      discussion (FGD), in-depth-interviews (IDI), and key informant interviews (KII). These tools
      are omnipresent in qualitative study and provide subjective perceptions from community and
      individual perspectives.

      Target population The inclusion criteria of these specific predefined participants for KII
      and IDI will be as follows: (i) male and female individuals aged ≥35 years, (ii) diagnosed
      recently or before as a hypertensive or non-hypertensive individual through review of
      hospital logs, and prescriptions (iii) physically and intellectually able to travel, attend
      and talk in interviews and actively participate in discussions, and (iv) who can be asked
      probing questions, can share their knowledge, perception, attitude towards hypertension and
      mHealth technology freely.

      Qualitative study sample size:

      Following number of participants will be interviewed:

      Data collection tools Number of participants Key informant interview 6-8 (3-4 M &amp; 3-4 F)
      In-depth interview 6-8 (3-4 M &amp; 3-4 F) FGD with hypertensive male and female participants
      60-80 (30/40 M &amp; 30/40 F)

      Data collection

      The data will be collected through individual interviews (key informant interviews) and group
      interviews (focus group discussions).

        1. Focus group discussion (FGD)

           FGD will be conducted in individuals with and without hypertension including both male
           and females at the community level to understand their perceptions, symptoms, knowledge,
           motivations, beliefs and attitude towards hypertension and mHealth technology and their
           practices related to healthcare at household and community level.

        2. In-depth interview (IDI)

           The in-depth interviews will be conducted with 3-/4 people with hypertension and 3-/4
           people without hypertension both male and female who are individuals of either sex from
           local community to understand their perceptions, knowledge about symptoms of
           hypertension, motivations, beliefs and attitude towards hypertension and mHealth
           technology and their health care seeking practices and compliances towards drugs and
           instructions.

        3. Key informant interview (KII)

      In relation to the study objectives, the study will conduct key informant interviews to
      develop an insight of individuals regarding the symptoms, causes and consequences of
      hypertension, the importance of lifestyle modification and regular check-ups in controlling
      hypertension or barriers and challenges that keep them away from regular checkups and
      medication adherence. Moreover, the systems that affect mobile health related health care
      services at the local level, potential barriers and challenges, and issues that may need
      further attention will be identified.

      Data Management and Analysis

      Data from field will follow a step-by-step data management procedure:

        1. Data labelling (naming the recorded and transcribed files)

        2. Transcription (both in Bangla and English)

        3. Data cleaning (recover missing data)

        4. Data compilation with field notes (check the accuracy and brevity)

        5. Data storage (both soft and hard copy in a safe and secure place with restricted access)

      Data Analysis After having a good sense of field data, the research team will initiate a
      thematic/content analysis based on available data. Both inductive (bottom-up: emerging from
      field data) and deductive (top-down: theory driven) approach of coding and themes
      (/sub-themes) selection will be taken into consideration. However, it is important to note
      that data analysis in a qualitative study is consistent process rather than step-by-step.

      Data coding At first, transcripts will be reviewed carefully and re-read for producing a code
      book. Reading and coding will initiate while data are being collected.

      Data presentation The data display and reduction process will be conducted once all data have
      been collected. Even during data display and reduction, the investigators will loop back
      through earlier steps to refine codes, re-read texts and revise some aspects of analysis.
      After reading, re-coding and coding the text, the main themes will be formalized.

      Enrollment of participants for RCT:

      Immediately before the implementation of the research, a structured questionnaire will be
      developed based on past experience in rural Bangladesh and elsewhere, which will be discussed
      thoroughly with field staff members and extensive field-testing will be done for necessary
      modifications of the questionnaire. Using a standardized pre-tested questionnaire, the
      socio-economic status and demography ( age, sex, religion, financial dependency, educational
      qualification, occupation, monthly family income and expense, type of house, type of family,
      marital status, living arrangements and so on) health status, health care seeking behavior,
      food consumption practices, life styles such as tobacco consumption, level of physical
      activity and other relevant information will be obtained. Moreover, blood and urine specimens
      will be collected and laboratory tests like serum total cholesterol, random blood sugar,
      urinary salinity, and urinary protein, glucose will be performed. Measurements of nutritional
      indices such as height, weight, MUAC, hip circumference, and waist circumference will be
      carried out from the enrollment day till end of follow up. Follow up and physical examination
      will take place at Kumudini Hospital or in the nearest Health and Family Welfare Center. In
      this study, we will use a portable health clinic device which is recommended by Grameen
      health program and by using this device we can save our time, as this device has all the test
      and measurement facilities which we will do in our study. Six follow up visits will be
      undertaken during the study period. Initially follow up visits will be twice a month then
      once a month up to 4 consecutive months.

      Moreover, staff members will be trained on use of all hardware. Usability evaluation of the
      staff members will be performed to document (a) user performance and understand common errors
      that are made by them while using the devices, (b) understand user perceptions and their
      suggestions in better usage of the devices. Similar usability evaluation of the 10-15
      hypertensive individuals will be conducted. The evaluation will be conducted in a quiet
      environment with no distractions. Five qualitative questions will be asked to understand the
      practical benefits and drawbacks of the devices. SMS messages will be developed in native
      language by the members of the research team representing different professional background;
      these messages will be sent to 10-15 people (randomly) for their comprehension and
      acceptability as part of field-testing. The wired intervention individuals will receive short
      messaging service (SMS) and they will have liberty to participate additionally in two-way
      communication system (between wired individuals and research team members). After receiving
      feedback, messages will be finalized. The SMS will provide simple health education and BP
      measurement reminders to encourage adherence to medical advice. Research team members will
      send a text message to a wired person having registered cell phone number throughout the
      study period. SMS (First month: 3 SMS per week, and then third month to five months: 1 SMS
      per week).

      All the enrolled patients will receive health education booklets created by the researchers
      based on Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet as well as a self-management
      notebook we will provide to participants in which the they will record blood pressure, body
      weight and lifestyle improvement goals. The education booklets will be selected for that it
      will suitable for the individual participant. Any abnormalities in the monitored values or
      data or exacerbation of participant symptoms will be reported immediately to the primary care
      physician.

      SMS content:

      Diet Reduce sodium (salt) intake WHO recommended sodium intake is 5g/day Eat more fruits,
      vegetables and more fiber

      Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan:

      It is high in fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy, and fiber. Patients who strictly follow
      the DASH eating plan can also have fairly significant reductions in weight, particularly when
      combined with a low-sodium diet. Lifestyle, Stop smoking, Stop taking alcohol, Caffeine,
      Exercise: Regular exercise (walking, running) for 20 to 30 minutes most days of the week can
      lower your blood pressure, Reduce weight, Reduce stress, Monitor your blood pressure at home,
      Control blood pressure during pregnancy, Medication: Take medication regularly

      Economic evaluation

      Researchers have recommended with emphasis on economic evaluation of health promotion
      interventions such as health education and mobile health technology (SMS).

      For this evaluation, the estimated cost of the program as well as costs for activities will
      be measured using ingredients approach, which includes listing of all types of inputs by
      identification of activities, quantities used, and prices for each input. Activity-based
      costing (ABC) techniques will be attempted to assign costs to each of the activities in the
      production process and/or resources. For this purpose, all costs will be classified according
      to major activities and/or resources. All activities and their associated inputs will be
      identified, and their respective costs will be obtained. Costs will be derived from two
      phases of the intervention named start-up cost and implementation cost which are directly
      related to the study. Total costs will be considered as the summation of capital and
      recurrent cost items for each phase. A comprehensive list of cost-related items will be made,
      and finally, cost per session per beneficiary will be estimated by dividing the total
      provider cost per session with the number of beneficiaries who received the SMS. The
      estimation of the cost will be covered the additional costs only that will include all field
      and administrative activities. Costs incurred other than intervention activities of the
      project such as salary, transportation, and data collection will be excluded from the
      estimation. Moreover, a household out of pocket expense/cost will be measured to assess any
      costs incurred for receiving the treatment or related to treatment. All necessary data will
      be extracted from the project's documents, and project staff members will be interviewed
      whenever necessary.

      Objectives of the study are;

        1. To capture the care seeking pattern due to chronic disease and other illness also.

        2. To estimate the treatment cost from household perspectives due to chronic disease and
           other illness also.

        3. To estimate the program cost from supply side perspective.

        4. To conduct a Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) of the program.

      Program costs/provider perspective

      Start-up cost

      Implementation cost

      Household costs/household perspective

      Cost-Effectiveness analysis

      Cost-effectiveness ratio of the intervention package will finally be calculated using the
      cost of the whole program. Net cost of intervention and its effectiveness will be measured by
      comparing cost and effectiveness in intervention and control groups. Cost-outcome ratio as
      well as incremental cost-outcome ratio will be calculated i.e. if the study switches from one
      alternative (A) to another alternative (B), the changes in costs and outcomes will be
      compared (like, C1 - C0 / E1 - E0). Changes in various effects between intervention and
      comparison group will be considered as the changes in outcome/success of the intervention.
      The program with the low cost-effectiveness ratio will be considered as cost-effective
      intervention as it would offer most value for money.

      Data management and analysis:

      Data will be entered twice and stored in a relational database. Pre-coded questionnaire will
      be used to minimize data coding errors. All data forms and questionnaires will be checked for
      errors and necessary corrections will be made before data entry. A data entry program with
      built-in range and consistency checks will be used. Frequency distributions will be run to
      identify outliers. In all analyses, potential confounding variables and effect modifiers will
      be considered. Data will be entered, processed and analyzed using the statistical software
      packages SPSS for Windows version 21.0 and Epi Info version 7.0.

      Statistical analyses will include descriptive as well as analytical methods. Basic
      presentations of data will include number and percentages of individuals with hypertension by
      age, sex and in relation to different known risk factors of interest. The descriptive
      statistics will be expressed as percentages, means, medians, standard deviations with ranges
      or with 95% confidence intervals where appropriate. Chi-square (χ2) tests will be computed to
      assess the association between outcome and independent variables. Odds ratios will be
      calculated for hypertension after adjusting for major confounding variables (e.g. age, sex,
      food habits, socioeconomic status, nutritional status, family history of hypertension etc.).
      Effects of interaction terms will also be examined fitting logistic regression models. When
      the main outcome measures are continuous variables, the statistical significance of group
      mean comparisons will be determined by Student's t-test. The primary analysis will be
      intention to treat which will provide relative unbiased comparisons among the intervention
      and control groups. In case of non-normal distribution of measurements, equivalent
      non-parametric tests will be used. Statistical significance will be defined as p&lt;0.05.
      Secondary outcomes will be compared with the χ2 test for categorical outcome. Fisher's exact
      test when needed will be performed to estimate p values. For all models, the results will be
      expressed as an estimate of effect size, with 95% CIs and p values.

      Outcome Variables:

      Primary outcomes:

      1. Behavioral changes by health education (evaluated by the researcher who developed
      questionnaire).

      Operational Definition: Increased awareness, knowledge, and attitude changes will be measured
      by actual behavior change of participants. Once participants will aware the importance of
      lifestyle change, obtain knowledge about the way of change, and intend to change, the
      participants will change their lifestyles. Thus, we can measure these changes by actual
      behavior.

      Secondary outcomes:

        1. To decrease level of blood pressure

        2. To measure health status by Euro-5D-5L QOL questionnaire (Mobility, self-care, usual
           activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression)

        3. To decrease dietary salt intake (Measured by food and urinary salinity test)

        4. To measure blood glucose level (Random Blood Sugar), Urinary Protein and glucose test
           (In order to measure the complications)

        5. Check the feasibility of mobile phone in hypertensive individuals by field testing
           questionnaires which will be developed by the researchers.

      Ethical Implications:

      The study will only be initiated after it has been approved by the Institutional Review Board
      (IRB) of Bangladesh Medical and Research Council (BMRC) as well as collaborating institutes
      in Bangladesh. Before enrolment, signed informed consent will be obtained from the
      participants. The consent form will be written in Bangla in a language and format that will
      be easily understood by the study participants of even little education. The consent form
      will be read out to the study participants. Signed consent or the left thumb impression will
      be obtained from the participants for participation in the study. A copy of the signed
      consent form will be given to the participant for their future questions and concerns. There
      will be some personal questions (age, income, contact address) for household respondents in
      the questionnaires. We will also collect blood and urine samples. So, there are some
      precautions will be taken to address the risk. Firstly, field researchers will be careful to
      emphasize the voluntary nature of engagement with the study and should ensure that
      participants will confirm written consent during the interview. Secondly, the personal
      questions will be asked in a calm and sensitive manner. Thirdly, during sample collection as
      much as possible we will take higher protection. Finally, total anonymity across all stages
      of the study will be maintained and access to raw data will be restricted to researchers only
      and stored securely.
