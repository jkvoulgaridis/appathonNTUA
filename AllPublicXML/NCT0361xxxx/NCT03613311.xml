  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prevalence rates of urodynamic urinary incontinence (USI) subtypes and their related clinical
      and urodynamic findings in women with ≥ pelvic organ prolapse quantification stage II
      cystocele are important for clinical consultation, especially for occult USI. Misdiagnosis of
      occult USI before cystocele repair might lead to occurrence of de novo stress urinary
      incontinence after cystocele repair. Thus, the aim of this study was to elucidate the above
      findings and between-group associations.

      Between November 2011 and January 2017, medical records of all women with ≥stage II cystocele
      who underwent urodynamic studies in a medical center were reviewed. ANOVA test and post-hoc
      testing with bonferroni's correction were used for statistical analysis. USI is noted during
      filling cystometry and is defined as the involuntary leakage of urine during increased
      abdominal pressure, in the absence of a detrusor contraction. The recruited patients with
      cystocele were classified into three groups (i.e.,evident USI, occult USI and no demonstrated
      USI) according to pad weight results before and after prolapse reduction.
