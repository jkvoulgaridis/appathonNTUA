    <textblock>
      the aim of this randomized controlled clinical study is to evaluate the efficacy of a new
      piezoelectric technique for wisdom teeth extraction without using manual tools versus the
      conventional one.Patients referred to the hospital of Bolzano for wisdom tooth extraction
      will be randomly divided in two groups. In the test group all the procedure will be performed
      using piezoelectric instruments, while in the control one conventional manual instruments
      will be used. Main outcome measures are patient pain and complications, secondary outcome
      measures are duration of the surgical treatment and soft tissue healing

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Wisdom teeth extraction can be difficult and patient can suffer post operative swelling and
      pain. A new piezoelectric technique for wisdom teeth extraction was developed and it showed
      promising results in terms of surgical effectiveness and patients post operative
      complications. The aim of the study is to compare the new technique with special designed
      piezoelectric tools with the traditional one in a randomized controlled way. The same
      procedures are to be followed for teeth extraction except for the use of a piezoelectric
      lever in one group and a manual lever in the other one. The study is a mono-center,
      pragmatic, randomised clinical trial (RCT) of parallel group design. The trial would have one
      week follow up. All patients referred to the Dental Department of S.Maurizio Hospital
      (Bolzano, Italy) for the extraction of wisdom teeth are considered eligible for the study.

    <intervention_model_description>All patients will take amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and Ibuprofen 600mg . Mepivacain with 1:100.000 adrenalin will be used for anesthesia. Local infiltration of Desamethasone 4mg and intraoral disinfection of the surgical area with povidone iodine will be done.
A full thickness flap will be raised after a sulcular incision from the mesial buccal aspect of the second molar to the distal aspect of the third one where a releasing incision begins describing an open V shape.
In the Piezoelectric group Piezoelectric tools will be used. In the conventional group manual tools and burs with a straight handpiece will be used. The flap will be sutured using a 3/0 suture. Levobupivacaine hydrochloride 5mg will be injected at the end of the procedure in the site of the operation</intervention_model_description>
