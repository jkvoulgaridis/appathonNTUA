  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to assess the use of a novel scaffold (an FDA-approved
      collagen-hydroxyapatite material called Syn-Oss) for regeneration of pulp tissues versus the
      use of a traditional scaffold (blood clot).

    <textblock>
      Regeneration of pulp tissues in teeth with immature roots is a new concept based on
      historical limited success using calcium hydroxide dressings placed into debrided pulp
      spaces. Obtaining stem cells from the apical papilla (SCAP cells), which are present at the
      base of all teeth, but are most accessible in teeth with immature apices, greatly enhances
      clinical success. Current therapies lack ideal messenger chemicals and scaffolds to optimize
      results.

    <description>Placement of a collagen scaffold (Colla-Plug) over a blood clot, placement of a tricalcium silicate barrier (mineral trioxide aggregate), placement of a composite occlusal restoration (standard dental material). The Colla-Plug material is placed adjacent to the blood clot that has formed inside the root canal space. It act as a matrix for the subsequent placement of the mineral trioxide aggregate material. It has been used as the standard of care in regenerative endodontics since 2004.</description>

    <description>Traditionally, endodontic therapy consisted of removing the infected dental pulp from the canal spaces and replacing it with an artificial substitute called gutta percha. Regenerative endodontic research efforts were originally concentrated upon treatment of the immature necrotic tooth whereby stem cells from the bone near the root end were stimulated to grow onto a blood clot scaffold created within the debrided and disinfected canal space. The hope is that the stem cells would differentiate into cells which could potentially replace the lost pulpal tissues, restoring what was lost due to infection.</description>
