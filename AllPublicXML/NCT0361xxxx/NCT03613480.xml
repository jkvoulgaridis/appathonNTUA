    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a highly prevalent disorder which is directly
      linked to lifestyle patterns and is associated with poor quality of life, increased fatigue
      and psychological distress. The aim of the current study is to evaluate quality of life,
      fatigue and psychological functioning in NAFLD patients and assess the impact of systematic
      counseling on patients' psychosocial functioning.

      Introduction: The term non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a spectrum of
      disorders ranging from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis, in the absence of other known
      causes of liver steatosis. NAFLD is a highly prevalent disorder which is directly linked to
      patients' lifestyle and is accompanied by severe co-morbidities. Although there is a wealth
      of studies on NAFLD's pathogenesis, natural course and treatment, few investigations have
      focused on patients' quality of life (QoL) and even fewer have evaluated the impact of
      therapeutic interventions on patients' quality of life and psychosocial functioning. In this
      context, there is a significant literature gap, given that modern research and clinical
      practice should aim at meeting patients' subjective physical and psychosocial needs and
      improving their overall quality of living.

      Aim-Methods: In this context, the aim of the present study is to assess the effect of
      systematic counseling on NAFLD patients' quality of life, psychological distress, fatigue and
      lifestyle habits.

      The current study will be conducted at the Gastroenterology Department of the University
      Hospital of Patras with the collaboration of the Department of Psychiatry. NAFLD patients
      will be invited to enrol to the study after being thoroughly informed about its aim and
      methods. Eligible patients will be assessed at baseline and then will be randomized to
      receive either systematic counseling based on the principles of Motivational Interviewing or
      care as usual. All participants will be re-evaluated at 6 months after study initiation. In
      addition, all patients will be submitted to laboratory tests including complete blood count,
      serum albumin, hemoglobin, gamma-globulin, ALT, AST, γGT, ALP, bilirubin, PT, INR, urea,
      creatinine, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides both at baseline and at study
      completion

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Survey 36 Short Form (SF36)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SF36 is a self-report, generic quality of life instrument, which includes eight multi-item scales (36 items) that evaluate the extent to which an individual's health limits his or her physical, emotional, and social well-being. The SF-36 covers eight domains of HRQOL, namely physical functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. Scores on each subscale range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life. Sub-scales scores are calculated according to an algorithm described in the SF36 manual.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a psychometric tool measuring psychological distress. It is comprised of 14 items, 7 items for anxiety and 7 items for depression. Each item is scored from 0 to 3 and subscale scores are calculated by summing the 7 item scores. Each subscale ranges from 0-21 and higher scores indicate greater severity of depressive and anxious symptoms</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a disease-specific instrument measuring quality of life. It encompasses 29 items contained within six domains including abdominal symptoms, fatigue, systemic symptoms, activity, emotional function and worry. A Likert scale response format is used for all items ranging from 1 (most impairment) to 7 (least impairment). Scoring of the questionnaire is performed by dividing each domain score by the number of items per domain.Overall CLDQ score is obtained by adding scores for each item and dividing by the total number of items.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue Severity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This 9-item scale measures the severity of fatigue and its effect on a person's activity and lifestyle in patients with various disorders. Each item is scored on a 7 point scale with 1=strongly disagree and 7=strongly agree. Total score is calculated by adding each item score. Scores range from 9 to 63 and higher scores indicate greater fatigue severity</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alanine aminotransferase levels (ALT)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a blood test measuring the serum concentration of alanine aminotransferase which is elevated in liver damage. ALT reference rates range between 20 to 60 IU/L</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Aspartate aminotransferase levels (AST)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a blood test measuring the serum concentration of aspartate aminotransferase which is elevated in liver damage. AST reference rates range between 5 to 40 IU/L</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body Mass Index (BMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Body Mass Index is a measure of obesity. It is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is universally expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres.Normal BMI ranges from 18.5-24.9</description>
