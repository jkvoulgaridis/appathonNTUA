  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study with the primary objective to validate the use of advanced minimally
      invasive hemodynamic monitoring with the PreSep™ Central Venous Oximetry Catheter, the
      Vigileo™ monitor, and FloTrac™ sensor for perioperative fluid management in Hepatobiliary and
      Pancreas Surgery. All of these devices and monitors are FDA approved devices and routinely
      used in the perioperative setting for these cases.

    <textblock>
      Surgical procedures involving the liver and pancreas are complex and involve paying close
      attention to hemodynamics to keep the patient stable through the duration of the case. Volume
      overload in liver and pancreas surgery leads to more intraoperative blood loss and rapid
      volume shifts make the patient unstable and more difficult to manage. Traditional methods of
      invasive monitoring to determine cardiac output and stroke volume include the placement of a
      pulmonary artery catheter and an arterial line. With the addition of the FloTrac™ Sensor to
      the arterial line and the Vigileo™ monitor; a pulmonary artery catheter would be no longer
      required. The minimally invasive cardiac output monitor connected to the central venous
      catheter will generate detailed information of cardiac function and fluid status and thereby
      help monitor and manage the hemodynamics of the patient intraoperatively. The information
      obtained from the Vigileo™ will be compared to the regular data normally available in
      patients undergoing hepatobiliary surgery to determine the advantages of using the system to
      aid in fluid management of the patient.

        The procedures will be divided by organ systems, liver and pancreas, and by method of
        surgery, laparoscopic versus open. Five patients will be chosen for each group for a total
        of 20 patients enrolled. The following procedures will be included in the study: liver
        resection (&gt;2 segments), distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy, and
        pancreaticoduodenectomy, including robotic procedures.
