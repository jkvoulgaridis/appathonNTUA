  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label, non-randomized study that will enroll pediatric and young
      adult research participants with relapsed or refractory non-CNS solid tumors to evaluate the
      safety, feasibility, and efficacy of administering T cell products derived from the research
      participant's blood that have been genetically modified to express a EGFR-specific receptor
      (chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR) that will target and kill solid tumors that express EGFR
      and the selection-suicide marker EGFRt. EGFRt is a protein incorporated into the cell with
      our EGFR receptor which is used to identify the modified T cells and can be used as a tag
      that allows for elimination of the modified T cells if needed. On Arm A of the study,
      research participants will receive EGFR-specific CAR T cells only. On Arm B of the study,
      research participants will receive CAR T cells directed at EGFR and CD19, a marker on the
      surface of B lymphocytes, following the hypothesis that CD19+ B cells serving in their normal
      role as antigen presenting cells to T cells will promote the expansion and persistence of the
      CAR T cells. The CD19 receptor harbors a different selection-suicide marker, HERtG. The
      primary objectives of the study will be to determine the feasibility of manufacturing the
      cell products, the safety of the T cell product infusion, to determine the maximum tolerated
      dose of the CAR T cells products, to describe the full toxicity profile of each product, and
      determine the persistence of the modified cell in the subject's body on each arm. Subjects
      will receive a single dose of T cells comprised of two different subtypes of T cells (CD4 and
      CD8 T cells) felt to benefit one another once administered to the research participants for
      improved potential therapeutic effect. The secondary objectives of this protocol are to study
      the number of modified cells in the patients and the duration they continue to be at
      detectable levels. The investigators will also quantitate anti-tumor efficacy on each arm.
      Subjects who experience significant and potentially life-threatening toxicities (other than
      clinically manageable toxicities related to T cells working, called cytokine release
      syndrome) will receive infusions of cetuximab (an antibody commercially available that
      targets EGFRt) or trastuzumab (an antibody commercially available that targets HER2tG) to
      assess the ability of the EGFRt on the T cells to be an effective suicide mechanism for the
      elimination of the transferred T cell products.
