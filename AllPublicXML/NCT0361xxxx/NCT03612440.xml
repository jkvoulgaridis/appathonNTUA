    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of dexmedetomidine on oxygenation
      index, respiratory index and inflammatory factors, and to explore the protective effect of
      the dexmedetomidine on respiratory function in patients undergoing palatopalatyngoplasty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is common among people, especially among obese people, Which
      is characterized by periodic or complete upper airway obstruction and hypoxia during sleep.
      Intermittent hypoxia contributes to the lung damage by increased oxidative stress,
      inflammation. Some researchers suggested that dexmedetomidine can inhibit inflammatory
      reaction and lessen the damage of respiratory function. The aim of this study is to
      investigate the efficacy of dexmedetomidine on oxygenation index, respiratory index and
      inflammatory factors, and to explore the protective effect of the dexmedetomidine on
      respiratory function in patients undergoing palatopalatyngoplasty.
