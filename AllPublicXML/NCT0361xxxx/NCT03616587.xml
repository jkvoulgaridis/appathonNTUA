      This is a first-in-human study of AZD9833 monotherapy (Parts A and B) and AZD9833 in
      combination with palbociclib (Parts C and D) in women with ER Positive HER2 Negative advanced
      breast cancer that is not amenable to treatment with curative intent. Parts A and C of the
      study allow for an escalation of AZD9833 dose alone (Part A) or in combination with
      palbociclib (Part C). In Parts B and D of the study, eligible subjects will be randomised to
