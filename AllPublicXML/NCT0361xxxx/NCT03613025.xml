  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Incidence and morbi-mortality of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) are increasing. Early and fast
      diagnosis and treatment improve PCP prognosis. Biological diagnosis is based on the detection
      of Pneumocystis jirovecii, mainly by PCR, in broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) obtained from
      bronchial fibroscopy. However this invasive exam is not always possible in emergency in
      suspected patient and others non invasive (sputa) and/or non-targeted (bronchial aspiration)
      are sent to the laboratory (25% of cases, data from the Grenoble University Hospital).
      Diagnosis performances of these non invasive/non-targeted samples are not clearly
      established.

      In this study, the investigators aimed to establish the diagnosis value of non-invasive
      and/or non-targeted respiratory samples (oral fluids, sputa and bronchial aspiration) for the
      PCP diagnosis, compared to the gold-standard (Pneumocystis PCR on BAL, beta-D-glucans testing
      on serum and radio-clinical records).
