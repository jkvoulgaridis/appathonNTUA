    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Drug: modafinil, Provigil, Alertec, Modavigil
Dosage form, frequency and duration: Each participant receives a single pill of placebo or active drug (modafinil 100 mg or 200 mg) 30 minutes after arriving at the lab. The participant then completes approximately 6 hours of testing in the laboratory. The participant stays at the lab for 7.5 hours in order to monitor physical condition in case the participant received the active pill. One week later, that participant receives a single pill of an alternate comparator and is again tested in the laboratory. Thus, in total, each participant receives one placebo pill and two active pills, each time separated by one week.</description>
