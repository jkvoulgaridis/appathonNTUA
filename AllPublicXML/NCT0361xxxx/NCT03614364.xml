      1. Study outline This is a multicenter, single-arm, phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy
           and safety of nanoxel plus herzuma combination chemotherapy in patients with metastatic
           salivary ductal cancer. Approximately 41 patients will be enrolled. Treatment will be
           continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities. Response evaluation will
           be performed every 2 cycles.

        2. Dosing &amp; Treatment schedule D1 Nanoxel 75 mg/m2 + D5W 100mL MIV over 1hr D1 Herzuma
           8mg/kg (loading dose) + N/S 250mL miv over 90mins 6mg/kg (maintenance) + N/S 250mL MIV
           over 30mins (since 2 cycle) repeated every 3 weeks (In case of discontinuation of
           nanoxel without progression, single agent herzuma can be administered until progression)
