  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to demonstrate the effects of 28-days supplementation with a novel
      probiotic formulation on mental fatigue following a cognitive load in healthy adults. Half of
      the participants will receive the probiotic formulation while the other half will receive
      placebo.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 128 participants will be recruited to take part in this trial.

      The supplement contains selected strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria which have been
      well studied in human clinical trials. Previous clinical trials have demonstrated
      improvements in cognitive function and mood after supplementation with various combinations
      of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria.

      The specific strains present in the current investigation have been studied in a number of
      clinical trials in which no adverse events were linked to the strains. The benefits of
      probiotic supplements on health is well established, and has led to an increase in use, as
      well as the addition of probiotic strains in dietary supplements. Despite this, only a small
      number of controlled trials have directly investigated the cognitive benefits associated with
      probiotic supplementation.

      The current study therefore aims to investigate the anti-fatigue effects of a probiotic
      supplement after a period of cognitive demand. We will be measuring the effects of the
      probiotic supplement compared to a placebo using assessments of mental fatigue, cognition,
      memory and mood.

    <measure>Mental fatigue score (VAS-mental fatigue)</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Difference in mental fatigue score as the participant moves through six cycles of a cognitive demand battery (CDB). The cognitive demand battery consists of three tasks (RVIP, serial threes and serial sevens, described below), and is designed to increase cognitive load. Six cycles of the battery are completed in succession at each testing visit. The mental fatigue scale (VAS-mental fatigue) is completed after each cycle of the CDB (6 times over the course of one hour, per visit). Participants rate their level of mental fatigue on a 100-mm scale from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;extremely&quot;. The primary outcome is difference in mental fatigue score (VAS-mental fatigue) as the participant moves through the six cycles of the CDB, (after cognitive load) absolute change from baseline (Visit 2) to 28 days (Visit 3) between the active vs placebo group.</description>

The PSQI is a self-rated scale measured over a one-month interval. The scale is comprised of 19 individual items that generate 7 &quot;component&quot; scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, use of sleep medications, and daytime dysfunction. The scale also has five items to be answered by a bed partner, if applicable, but these answers are not included in the scoring of the scale. For the current study, these five questions will be removed from the scale.</description>

    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Depression, Anxiety and Stress scale (DASS-21) is a 21-item questionnaire that is split into three factors: depression, anxiety and stress. The DASS-21 is made up of affect-related questions pertaining to both physical (e.g. 'dry mouth') and mood symptoms (e.g. 'down-hearted'). Each item is scored on a 4-point scale from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating a higher degree of dysfunction. It is important to note that lower scores reflect a lack of symptoms and not a more positive mood. Furthermore, as the experience of such symptoms is common in every-day life, the DASS-21 is considered suitable for use in non-clinical settings.</description>

    <description>The Depression, Anxiety and Stress scale (DASS-21) is a 21-item questionnaire that is split into three factors: depression, anxiety and stress. The DASS-21 is made up of affect-related questions pertaining to both physical (e.g. 'dry mouth') and mood symptoms (e.g. 'down-hearted'). Each item is scored on a 4-point scale from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating a higher degree of dysfunction. It is important to note that lower scores reflect a lack of symptoms and not a more positive mood. Furthermore, as the experience of such symptoms is common in every-day life, the DASS-21 is considered suitable for use in non-clinical settings.</description>
