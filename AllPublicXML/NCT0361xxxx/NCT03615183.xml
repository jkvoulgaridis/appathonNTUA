  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the antiretroviral activity of MK-8527 inHIV-1 infected, ART-naive
      participants. The primary hypothesis is at that MK-8527 has superior antiretroviral activity
      compared to placebo, as measured by change from baseline in plasma HIV-1 ribonucleic acid
      ([RNA] at 168 hours postdose.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to five panels (Panels A-E) of 6 participants each will be enrolled in a sequential
      manner. In each panel, participants will receive a single dose of MK-8527 up to 50 mg.
      Historical data from previous single does studies will be used for placebo (control)
      comparisons.
