  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, randomized, 3-treatment, 2-period, 2-sequence study in healthy
      subjects to evaluate the single-dose PK of milademetan when given as monotherapy and when
      administered with steady-state levels of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitors itraconazole or
      posaconazole.

      The duration of the study for each individual subject will be approximately 49 days from the
      start of Screening through Study Discharge. Subjects will remain in-house for up to 23 days,
      including 22 overnight stays.
