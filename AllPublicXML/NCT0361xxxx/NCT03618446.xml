  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective cohort study was carried out for all pelvic fracture patients admitted to
      Assiut University Trauma Unit (AUTU), a level-1 trauma center. (AUTU) is located in Upper
      Egypt and provides healthcare to over 30,000 patients per year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2010, a Pelvic Injury Registry was developed to document treatment and outcomes in a
      standardized manner. All patients admitted to AUTU sign an informed consent to permit using
      their data for research purposes. Patients' data are prospectively collected and stored in a
      local database specifically designed for this purpose.

      Data collected included age, gender, mechanism of injury, fracture classification, associated
      injuries, and admission to ICU, the length of hospital stay and presence of abdominopelvic
      collection as diagnosed by Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) at admission.
      The primary outcome measure was in-hospital mortality. Predictors of in-hospital mortality
      were identified by comparing characters of survivors and non-survivors. Secondary objectives
      were to analyse the differences between adults and children and to analyse the causes and
      timing of death.

        1188 patients were considered eligible for analysis. These were further divided into an
        adult cohort whose age is above 16 years (951 patients) and a pediatric cohort (237
        patients).
