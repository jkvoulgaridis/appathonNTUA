    <description>Measurement of dyspnea using the London Chest Daily Activity Living (LCADL) questionnaire.
This 15-item, self-administered questionnaire allows an evaluation of dyspnea in patients with COPD during daily activities divided into four components: self-care, domestic, physical, and leisure. Patients could score from 0: &quot;I would not do anyway&quot; to 5: &quot;I need someone else to do this&quot;. LCADL score is calculated by aggregating the points assigned to each question, with a higher score representing maximal disability.</description>

    <measure>Compare dyspnea in daily life between the 2 groups</measure>
    <time_frame>At inclusion and week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of dyspnea using mMRC scale. mMRC dyspnea scale is the first self-administered scale which assesses the impact of dyspnea on ADL. It consists of five grades increasing in severity of chronic respiratory disease from 0 : &quot;I only get breathless with strenuous exercise&quot; to 4 : &quot;I am too breathless to leave the house or I am breathless when dressing or undressing.&quot;</description>

    <description>Measurement of dyspnea using Dyspnea-12 questionnaire. This 12-item self-administered questionnaire measures dyspnea severity in both its physical and affective components, independently from activity limitation. Patients score ranges from &quot;none&quot; (corresponding to score 0) to &quot;severe&quot; (score 3). Dyspnea-12 score is calculated by aggregating the points assigned to each question; the higher the score, the greater the severity.</description>
