  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of a twice daily at-home olfactory
      training program with a twenty scent, essential oil-based smell test in patients with
      olfactory dysfunction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study randomizes participants to receive either a four scent or fourteen scent olfactory
      retraining protocol. Baseline olfaction will be tested with a currently commercially
      available smell test as well as an essential oil based smell test. The protocol involves
      twice daily retraining where the participant inhales the scent and makes a mental note of
      what they should be smelling. The training period is six months total with a visit at 3
      months to re-assess smell function as well as at six months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in ability to detect odorants - Sniffin' Sticks</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Sniffin Sticks are a battery of 12 scents within a tube. The subject smells each scent and then chooses from 4 multiple choice options which is the scent they smelled. Increased number of correct responses indicates better sense of smell. 12/12 is the maximum score. 0/12 is the minimum score.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in ability to detect odorants - AROMA</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>AROMA is a essential oil based test. The subject is asked to respond if they detect a smell. If yes, they proceed to a 4 multiple choice items and select the item the smell. If no, they proceed to the next item. Higher number correct indicates better sense of smell. It consists of 13 odorants and 1 blank. Improved sense of smell would also increase the number of correctly identified odorants out of the 14 (including noting the 1 blank).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements (QOD-NS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The QOD-NS includes 17 statements that are graded on a scale from 0 to 3. Total score ranges from 0 to 51. Higher QOD-NS scores reflect better quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SF-12 (Short Form Health Survey)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>SF-12 is a validated general measure of quality of life instrument that includes physical and mental scales. There are a total of 12 questions. Each aspect of the scale is weighted differently to yield a composite score. In general, a higher score is associated with better health.</description>
