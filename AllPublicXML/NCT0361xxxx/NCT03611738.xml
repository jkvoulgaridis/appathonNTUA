  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to find out what effects (good and bad) ceritinib
      (Zykadia®) used in combination with docetaxel (Taxotere®) will have on participants and their
      cancer. The results will help to determine the best safe dose of the combination of the
      medications Ceritinib (Zykadia®) and docetaxel (Taxotere®) and to find out if this
      combination of drugs will help people that have this type of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
      (NSCLC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this phase I/IB clinical trial, participants with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who
      have progressed on prior platinum-based chemotherapy (maximum number of prior distinct
      regimens = 2) and are anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-negative/epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR) wild-type (WT) will receive a combination of ceritinib and docetaxel.

      Study rationale is that targeting ALK- and EGFR-negative lung tumors with ceritinib and
      microtubule inhibitors results in synergistic antitumor effects. Therefore, treatment with
      ceritinib and docetaxel is a rational combination.

    <measure>Phase Ib: Overall Response (OR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 months</time_frame>
    <description>OR: Defined as the participant being alive and the tumor size evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 on subsequent imaging assessment consistent with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Overall response rates will be calculated with a 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI). Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm (&lt; 1 cm). Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS: Defined as the time from study entry to disease progression, relapse or death due to any cause, whichever is earlier, will be summarized with the Kaplan-Meier curve. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm (0.5 cm). (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression). Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>

    <description>The design will recruit participants in cohorts of three patients each and will not allow for dose-skipping during escalation. A maximum of 18 participants will be enrolled for the phase I dose escalation. Three ceritinib dose levels have been identified for dose escalation (150 mg, 300 mg, and 450 mg), plus docetaxel at 75 mg. A backup dose (ceritinib 150 mg with docetaxel at 60 mg) is also prepared in case the three dose levels are too toxic. Therefore, four potential dose levels will be used for determination of maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The first cohort will start at dose level 1 (ceritinib 150 mg with docetaxel at 75 mg).
Level -1 Backup Cohort: 150 mg ceritinib; 60 mg/m^2 docetaxel Level 1 Starting Cohort: 150 mg ceritinib; 75 mg/m^2 docetaxel Level 2 Cohort: 300 mg ceritinib; 75 mg/m^2 docetaxel Level 3 Cohort: 450 mg ceritinib; 75 mg/m^2 docetaxel</description>
