  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combination of chemotherapy with PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade agents demonstrated
      promising results especially in the neo-adjuvant and early metastatic setting in TNBC.
      However, a substantial proportion of patients do not derive benefit from this approach.

      CD73 is an adenosine-generating enzyme overexpressed in several cancers and associated with
      poor prognosis and reduced anti-tumor immunity in TNBC. Monoclonal antibodies directed
      against CD73 could help to reprogram the tumor microenvironement by decreasing the adenosine
      mediated immunosuppression, particularly as a synergistic immunotherapeutic combination with
      immune checkpoint blockade.

      The SYNERGY trial investigates the role of an anti-CD73 (MEDI9447) in a randomized phase II
      trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of the combination of chemotherapy (paclitaxel +
      carboplatin) with immunotherapy (durvalumab [anti-PD-L1] +/- MEDI9447 [anti-CD73]) in
      previously untreated locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic TNBC.

      A large translational research program is planned including baseline and dynamic biomarkers

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial consists of two parts:

      PHASE I Part 1 is a phase I trial examining the combination of paclitaxel, carboplatin,
      durvalumab and oleclumab in order to define the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of oleclumab
      in this treatment combination.

      The period for DLT evaluation is defined as the time from receiving the first dose of
      oleclumab until the planned administration of the third dose; this corresponds to 28 days
      after receiving the first dose of oleclumab in case no treatment interruption occured.

      Patients who develop a DLT will stop study treatment permanently.

      PHASE II Part 2 is a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial investigating the role of an
      anti-CD73 monoclonal antibody (oleclumab) in combination with an anti-PD-L1 antibody
      (durvalumab) plus chemotherapy (paclitaxel + carboplatin) as first-line treatment for locally
      recurrent inoperable or metastatic TNBC.

      Patients will be randomized between chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin) with
      immunotherapy including durvalumab with or without oleclumab (1:1 ratio).

      PHASE I and PHASE II

      Paclitaxel and carboplatin will be given weekly for a total of 12 injections. Immunotherapy
      (durvalumab with or without oleclumab) will be given as long as the patient benefits.
      Premature discontinuation of paclitaxel/carboplatin or discontinuation of
      durvalumab/oleclumab is indicated in case of:

        -  Progressive disease (PD) using RECIST v1.1 criteria or iRECIST assessed locally

        -  Unacceptable toxicity

        -  Intercurrent illness that necessitates discontinuation of study treatment

        -  Investigator's decision to withdraw the subject

        -  Pregnancy

        -  Subject noncompliance with the study treatment or procedure requirements

        -  Withdrawal of consent to treatment

        -  Death

        -  Administrative reasons requiring cessation of study treatment.

      Initial disease status will be evaluated by imaging studies (contrast-enhanced CT scan of the
      chest, the abdomen and the pelvis or MRI of the chest, the abdomen and the pelvis) during the
      screening phase. Disease status will be followed by imaging studies at weeks 8 (± 3 days), 16
      (± 3 days) and 24 (± 3 days) post start of treatment (allowing efficacy data to be captured
      as close to 24 weeks post start of study treatment as possible for a more accurate evaluation
      of DCR). Thereafter imaging will continue every 12 weeks (± 3 days; contrast-enhanced CT scan
      or MRI) independent of any treatment delays.

      Patients who stopped all study treatments for reasons other than PD will continue
      post-treatment imaging studies for disease status follow-up as described in the schedule of
      assessment until verified PD, start of a new anti-cancer treatment, withdrawal of consent to
      study participation, death, or end of the study whichever comes first.

      Note: Pseudo-progression related to immunotherapy: Patients experiencing PD as defined by
      RECIST v1.1 can continue the study treatment in case of good clinical condition assessed by a
      stable or even improved ECOG performance status. If the next assessment of tumour burden (8
      weeks later) confirms PD (as defined by iRECIST) study treatment must be discontinued.
      Unconfirmed PD as defined by iRECIST (iUPD) can only be assigned for the first 2 imaging
      assessments (week 8 and week 16) and several times as long as confirmed progression (iCPD) is
      not confirmed at the next assessment. If PD is not confirmed, reassessments continue as
      originally planned.

             patients not previously treated with systemic treatment and which cannot be treated
             with curative intent. Newly diagnosed patients with de-novo metastatic disease are
             eligible

          6. Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) negativity (&lt; 1% positive
             staining cells in the invasive tumour) determined locally using IHC per ASCO/CAP
             criteria58

          7. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negativity (negative IHC staining
             [score 0 or 1] or negative fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] based on the
             ASCO/CAP guidelines and recommendations from 2013) and determined locally59 Note:
             patients initially diagnosed with hormone receptor-positive and/or HER2-positive
             breast cancer are eligible if the tumor biopsy obtained from a local recurrence or
             distant metastasis site confirms the TNBC disease.

          8. Confirmed tumour PD-L1 and CD73 IHC assessment as documented through central testing
             of a representative tumour tissue specimen for stratification purposes (only for phase
             II)

          9. Provision of recurrence/metastatic tissue samples (at least 1 FFPE [Formalin-Fixed
             paraffin-embedded] tumour tissue and 1 frozen core as a priority, if feasible 2
             additional fresh tumour tissue cores should be collected too) including those from
             resections, core-needle biopsies or excisional, incisional, punch, or forceps
             biopsies. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) (defined as samples that do not preserve tissue
             architecture and yield cell suspension and/or smears), brushing, and cell pellets from

                  rate (eGFR) ≥ 60 ml/min as calculated using the method standard for the
                  institution. If eGFR is lower than 60 ml/min, a 24-hour urine creatinine
                  clearance can be performed to rule out an underestimation of the eGFR.

               5. Total serum bilirubin (TBL) ≤ 1.5 x ULN unless the subject has documented Gilbert
                  syndrome in which case up to 3 x ULN is acceptable

               6. Aspartate and alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN unless liver
                  metastases are present, in which case it must be ≤ 5 x ULN

               7. International Normalized Ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5 x ULN unless subject is receiving
                  anticoagulant therapy as long as INR and activated partial thromboplastin time
                  (aPTT) is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants

             of the study through 6 months after the last study drug administration. FSCP must have
             a negative serum pregnancy test done within the 28 days before treatment start. FSCP
             are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free of menses for
             at least 1 year.

         16. Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those
             conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial

         17. Absence of any concurrent illness that would preclude the evaluation of safety

         18. Agreement to provide tissue and blood samples for research purposes

             Subjects with previously treated brain metastases with local treatment (stereotactic
             radiosurgery or whole brain radiation therapy) may participate provided they have
             stable brain metastases on a recent brain MRI (performed during the 2 weeks prior
             inclusion) and have measurable disease outside the CNS. Note: Known brain metastases
             are considered active (and not eligible for trial), if any of the following criteria
             are applicable:

               1. Recent brain imaging demonstrates progression of existing and/or appearance of
                  new lesions

               2. Neurological symptoms attributed to brain metastases have not returned to
                  baseline

               3. Steroids were used for management of symptoms related to brain metastases within
                  14 days of enrolment

               4. Completion of local therapy for brain metastases within 28 days of enrolment

         11. Major surgical procedure (as defined by the principal investigator) within 28 days
             prior to enrolment. Note: Local surgery of isolated lesions for palliative intent is
             acceptable.

         12. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited to,

               1. Symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina
                  pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia. Patients previously treated with anthracyclines are
                  eligible if a recent cardiac work up (&lt; 6 months) demonstrated a normal left
                  ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF≥50%).

               2. Interstitial lung disease

               3. Serious chronic gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhoea

               4. Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
                  requirement, substantially increase risk of incurring AEs or compromise the
                  ability of the patient to give written informed consent

         13. Past medical conditions, including,

               1. Class II-IV congestive heart failure

               2. Myocardial infarction within 12 months prior enrolment,

               3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or thrombo-embolic event within 12 months prior to
                  enrolment

               4. History of stroke or transient ischemic attack requiring medical therapy

               5. Intra-abdominal inflammatory process within the last 12 months prior to enrolment
                  such as, but not limited to, diverticulitis, peptic ulcer disease, or colitis

               6. History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, organizing pneumonia (e.g.
                  bronchiolitis obliterans), drug-induced pneumonitis, idiopathic pneumonitis, or
                  evidence of active pneumonitis

               7. History of another primary malignancy except for malignancy treated with curative
                  intent and with no known active disease ≥5 years before the first dose of IP and
                  of low potential risk for recurrence, adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer
                  or lentigo maligna without evidence of disease, adequately treated carcinoma in
                  situ without evidence of disease

               8. Status post allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or solid organ transplantation

         14. Pregnant or lactating women.
