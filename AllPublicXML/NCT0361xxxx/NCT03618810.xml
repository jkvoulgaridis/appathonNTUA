  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is a multiple center, registering and real-world conditional research.
      The breast cancer patients planning for chemotherapy evaluated with medium-high risk of
      febrile neutropenia (FN) are recruited, receiving the first level prophylactic use of
      PEG-rhG-CSF or the second level prophylactic use of PEG-rhG-CSF in at least two cycles of
      chemotherapy according to real-world clinical judgement and choice by physicians in local
      cancer center. Comparing real conditional-FN rate, FN-caused hospitalization rate and
      antibiotic use rate, direct/indirect medical cost.

      The breast cancer patients planning for neo-adjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy evaluated with
      medium-high risk of febrile neutropenia (FN) according to NCCN and ASCO guideline are
      recruited, receiving the first level prophylactic use of PEG-rhG-CSF or the second level
      prophylactic use of PEG-rhG-CSF according to real-world clinical judgement and choice by
      physicians in local cancer center for at least two cycles of chemotherapy. The primary
      outcome is FN rate, the second outcomes are rate of 3-4 grade decrease of ANC, FN-caused
      hospitalization, FN-caused antibiotic use rate, rate of reduction of chemotherapy dose, delay
      of chemotherapy, safety and pharmacoeconomics.
