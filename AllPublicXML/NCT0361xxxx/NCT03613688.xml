  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, cross-over study on the effects of consumption of Deepure
      puerh tea extract (PTE) on glucose tolerance and metabolic markers.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will involve consuming three different doses: 1 gram, 1.5 grams, and 2 grams, and
      will be given in warm water, with a bland meal. The effects on glucose and insulin after
      consumption will be evaluated.The subjects will be randomly assigned to one of four groups
      with different sequences.
