  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the C3S study is research an equivalence with longitudinal, radial and
      circumferential, global and segmental strain value, in left Ventricular in 2 and 3 dimension
      between two echograph General Electric Vivid 9 (GE Vingmed, Horton, Norway) et Philips Epiq
      7.

      Healthy volunteer will be inform about the study by email and press. They could join the
      clinical research team by email and phone to ask more questions about the study. Then the
      investigator, verify the eligibiliy of the volunteers and schedule an appointment for the
      visit of inclusion. During this visit, the patient's consent will be collected. One
      echocardiography will be complete on echograph General Electric Vivid 9 to collect the
      clinical data necessary for the study and to eliminate the presence of criteria of
      exclusions, the acquisition of the loops of ultrasound will be realized on both echographs by
      a first investigator. A second investigator will make the post-treatment of the ultrasound
      images on consoles ECHOPAC PC version 201, General Electric Medical System and Q Station
      version 3.5, Philips Healthcare in two different times, to obtain the values of the various
      strain.

      Furthermore, an clinical exam, an ECG, a questionnary will be realized.
