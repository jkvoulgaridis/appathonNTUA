  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Removal of the uterus (hysterectomy) is the most commonly performed major gynaecological
      procedure in women. Obstetricians and gynaecologist (O&amp;G) surgeons conduct the majority of
      hysterectomies. Surgical approaches to removal of the uterus include laparoscopic
      hysterectomy, vaginal hysterectomy with or without laparoscopic assistance and open
      hysterectomy through an abdominal incision. It is widely accepted that laparoscopic
      hysterectomy and vaginal hysterectomy are less invasive procedures, cause fewer surgical
      complications, less postoperative pain, require a shorter hospital stay and are associated
      with quicker recovery than abdominal hysterectomy. In Australia and despite the evidence,
      Total Abdominal Hysterectomy (TAH) rates are unreasonably high (~40%) and only 13% of all
      hysterectomies are done via Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy (TLH) in Australia.

      This study aims to implement and evaluate a training program in TLH for gynaecologists. The
      potential benefits to the community are:

        -  A reduction in the incidence of overall surgical adverse events in patients receiving a
           hysterectomy

        -  A reduction in the length of hospital stay for patients requiring a hysterectomy

        -  A reduction in the direct hospital costs for hysterectomy

    <description>RANZCOG accredited O&amp;G specialists who are proficient in RANZCOG laparoscopic skills level 3 or higher;
Surgical capabilities will be assessed using The Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills (GOALS) Tool which is an adapted GOALS tool for hysterectomy. GOALS measures depth perception, bimanual dexterity, efficiency, tissue handling and surgeon autonomy each on a 5 point Likert scale. An experienced mentor will assess each surgeon using this scale and skills will be validated against objective outcomes (surgical adverse events recorded in the baseline period).
Will be able to attend each of the 10 training days.</description>
