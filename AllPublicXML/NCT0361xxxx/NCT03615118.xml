  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a huge public health problem in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Mental
      health care systems in most LMICs are extremely limited, impeding the dissemination of
      WHO-recommended models for improving care via &quot;task-shifting&quot; services to community health
      workers (CHWs) who deliver evidence-based treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy
      (CBT). This comprehensive intervention will use IVR and text messaging (SMS) to support
      effective depression care. Intervention patients will receive weekly automated (IVR) calls
      and daily text messages (SMS) throughout the 12 week intervention. Patients with more severe
      depression will receive up to 12 weekly CHW-delivered telephone CBT sessions, based on WHO
      recommendations and a treatment model developed and tested in India. CHWs will use patients'
      IVR contacts to enhance psychoeducation and they will use SMS plus web-based reports based on
      patients' IVR calls to identify individuals needing additional follow-up. The CHWs' clinical
      supervisor will use SMS messages to CHWs to reinforce best practices and monitor service
      delivery.

      Patients will be enrolled from Colombian clinics associated with the Universidad de Los Andes
      in Bogota, Colombia. 114 patients will be randomized to either a usual enhanced care or
      intervention group. Intervention group patients will receive weekly automated (IVR) calls and
      daily text messages throughout the duration of the 12 week intervention. Patients with more
      severe depression will receive up to 12 weekly CHW-delivered telephone CBT sessions, based on
      WHO recommendations and a treatment model developed and tested in India. CHWs will use
      patients' IVR contacts to enhance psychoeducation and they will use SMS plus web-based
      reports based on patients' IVR calls to identify individuals needing additional follow-up.
      The CHWs' clinical supervisor will use SMS messages to CHWs to reinforce best practices and
      monitor service delivery. Program components will be modified to fit the local culture and
      clinical environment via iterative engagement of health professionals and patients with
      depression.

      Those patients in usual enhanced care will receive the study manual and daily text messages
      and feedback throughout the duration of the program. Patients in the enhanced usual care
      group who present with more severe depression will be referred to the national program office
      for depression services support - a free service available to all citizens diagnosed with
      depression.

    <measure>Health related quality of life as measured by Short Form Survey (SF12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in SF12 score at Baseline and 3 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 is composed of 12 questions, selected from the SF-36 Health Survey (Ware, Kosinski, and Keller, 1996). The 12 questions are combined, scored, and weighted, assessing mental and physical functioning and overall health-related-quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in score at Baseline and 3 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The SDS is a brief, 5-item self-report tool that assesses functional impairment in work/school, social life, and family life. 0=not at all, 1-3=mild, 4-6=moderate, 7-9=marked, 10=extremely. Total score 0-30 (0 unimpaired, 30 highly impaired). Questions are broken into 3 assessed categories: Work/school (0-10); Social life (0-10); Family life/home responsibilities (0-10). Scoring: Scores of ≥5 on any of the 3 scales indicate a high score, and high scores are associated with significant functional impairment.</description>

    <description>Daily mood rating on a 1-9 scale reported via SMS. Daily mood score of 1 indicates a low mood, where as 9 indicates a high or positive mood.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to the intervention group will receive the AniMóvil intervention, including: the Sentirse Mejor manual that patients can refer to for information about CBT and skill practice, weekly IVR depression symptom assessments and psychoeducational messages, daily SMS mood monitoring and CBT reinforcement messages, and CHW telephone CBT sessions in the event of elevated PHQ-9 scores during the study. CHWs will use information from patients' IVR/SMS monitoring to support intervention-group patients' depression self-management under close supervision from their mental health specialist supervisor. Intervention patients will be part of a 'stepped' intervention based on the severity of their depression upon entry into the program and assessment throughout the intervention.</description>

    <description>Enhanced usual care patients will receive usual care, including the Sentirse Mejor manual developed by the research team in conjunction with local Ministries of Mental Health and tailored by the study team, emphasizing CBT principles, and daily SMS messages asking participants to report their mood on a 1 to 9 scale. Enhanced usual care group patients who report mood scores of 1 or 2 (worst scores) for at least 3 days per week and 3 consecutive weeks will be called by the Community health worker and referred to the national program office for depression services support - a free service available to all citizens diagnosed with depression. Enhanced usual care patients will be part of a 'stepped' program based on the severity of their depression upon entry into the program and assessment throughout the intervention.</description>
