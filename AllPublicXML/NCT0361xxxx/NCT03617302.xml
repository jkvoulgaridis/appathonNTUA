  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effect of dietary inorganic nitrate supplementation on 1) large
      elastic artery stiffness and hemodynamics and 2) cerebrovascular function in middle-aged and
      older adults. Participants will be randomized to consume either nitrate-containing or
      nitrate-depleted beetroot juice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reduced nitric oxide bioavailability with aging contributes in part to increased large
      central artery stiffness and cerebrovascular dysfunction. Large central artery stiffness is a
      risk factor for cognitive decline mediated in part by the development of cerebrovascular
      dysfunction. This study will investigate the degree to which improving nitric oxide
      bioavailability using dietary inorganic nitrate supplementation improves cerebrovascular
      function through reductions in large central artery stiffness in middle-aged and older
      adults.
