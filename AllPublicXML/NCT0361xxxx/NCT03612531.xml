      This trial studies how well manual therapy works in treating fibrosis-related late effect
      dysphagia in head and neck cancer survivors. Manual therapy is the use of massage and
      stretching exercises to increase blood flow and muscle movement in the neck, throat, jaw, and
      mouth, which may help to improve swallowing ability and range of motion in participants who
      have had treatment for head and neck cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility and safety of manual therapy for treatment of
      fibrosis-related dysphagia in head and neck cancer survivors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine preliminary efficacy, dose-response (number of treatment sessions to normalized
      cervical range of motion), and durability of manual therapy for improving cervical range of
      motion in head and neck cancer survivors with fibrosis-related late dysphagia.

      II. To examine functional outcomes after manual therapy in head and neck cancer survivors
      with fibrosis-related late effects and their association with change in dysphagia grade,
      cervical extension, and other cofactors.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive 10 manual therapy sessions performed by a speech pathologist during
      weeks 1-6. After completion of 6 weeks of therapy, participants perform manual therapy at
      home daily for 6 weeks.

Completion rate will be defined by completion of the 6 week clinical manual therapy (MT) program without withdrawing and attending a minimum of 2 sessions and the post-treatment assessment. Session attendance will be monitored separately to assess adherence and fidelity. Will summarize fidelity and adherence to the standard MT protocol using quantitative and qualitative methods.</description>
