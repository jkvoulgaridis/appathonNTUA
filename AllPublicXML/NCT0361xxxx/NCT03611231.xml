      Chidamide，a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor has been approved for the treatment of
      relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma in China. The aim of this study was to
      observe the efficacy and safety of Chidamide as Maintenance Treatment After Autologous
      Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients With Relapsed, Refractory or High-risk
      Lymphoma

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with B-NHL,NK/T-NHL and HL were confirmed by histopathology examination had
             received autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (including secondary
             transplantation). Transplantation interval was 6-8 weeks before in the study. The
             first diagnostic risk classification or pre-transplant disease status of each type of
             lymphoma is as follows: 1)B-NHL: patients who are at high risk according to the
             corresponding international prognostic index in the first diagnosis(IPI&gt;3 /aa IPI &gt;2
             /FLIPI&gt;3); Patients must have received at least one first-line induction therapy but
             did not achieve CR or had relapse after CR; 2)NK/T-NHL: Including all patients,
             unlimited risk classification and pre-transplant disease status; 3)HL: Patients must
             have received at least one first-line induction therapy

             volume at one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusing capacity of
             lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) ≥ 50% of expected corrected for hemoglobin. Adequate
             cardiac function with left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 50%. No symptomatic cardiac
             disease;

          5. Blood routine test: absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5×109/L, platelet ≥75×109/L, Hb ≥
             90g/L;

          6. Life expectancy no less than 3 months;

          7. Patients willing to sign the Informed Consent Form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients relapsed after ASCT

          2. Patients with HBsAg positive or HBcAb positive patients also detected HBV-DNA copy
