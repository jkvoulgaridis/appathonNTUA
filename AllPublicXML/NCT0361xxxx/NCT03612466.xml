  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose finding study of a novel radiopharmaceutical agent, 153Sm-DOTMP. It will be
      studied alone and then in combination with external beam radiotherapy. The study design
      includes six cohorts, Levels 1-6. The first three cohorts of participants will receive
      153Sm-DOTMP alone, and if this is determined to be safe, subsequent cohorts will receive the
      radiopharmaceutical followed by external beam radiotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose escalation study of a new radiopharmaceutical agent, 153Sm-DOTMP. Eligible
      participants will have osteosarcoma metastatic to bone, other solid tumors with bone
      metastases, or an unresectable localized osteosarcoma. Because of anticipated prolonged
      myelosuppression, participants will have a peripheral blood stem cell harvest. They will then
      be treated with 2 doses of 153Sm-DOTMP given 7 days apart. Twenty-four days after the initial
      dose, stem cells will be reinfused if needed. The first three cohorts of participants will
      receive only radiopharmaceutical. If Dose Level 3 is not the maximally tolerated dose (MTD),
      subsequent dose levels will include external beam radiotherapy, administered beginning on Day
      15. The dose of external beam radiotherapy will be determined by dosimetry studies performed
      after each administration of study agent, and will be targeted to a tumoricidal dose of
      radiation. All participants will have disease re-evaluation 30 days following completion of
      all study treatments, and then at 4, 6, 8, and 12 months, unless they experience disease
      progression.

    <measure>Maximally Tolerated Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>MTD will be determined based on DLTs experienced by participants during the first 42 days after administration of 153Sm-DOTMP for Dose Levels 1-3 and during the first 70 days after administration for Dose Levels 4-6</time_frame>
    <description>The maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of 153Sm-DOTMP will be determined. The MTD will be defined as the dose that produces a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in 30% of the participants. The dose limiting toxicity is the dosage at which side effects are serious enough to prevent an increase in dose or level of that treatment. DLTs will be defined as any grade 3, 4, or 5 non-hematologic toxicity experienced during a 42-70 day observation window.</description>

    <measure>Time To Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be evaluated 4, 8, and 12 months after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The time to progression of participants with bone metastatic osteosarcoma will be determined. Time to progression is defined as the time from study enrollment until the first radiographic evidence of progressive disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). RECIST is a set of published rules that help define whether cancer patients improve, stay the same, or get worse with treatment. This study uses the revised RECIST 1.1 guidelines.</description>

    <description>Dose Levels 1-3 will consist of treatment with radiopharmaceutical (153Sm-DOTMP) alone. If the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) has not been reached at Level 3, external beam radiotherapy will be added to each of Levels 4-6. Participants enrolled on Dose Levels 4-6 will be treated with external beam radiotherapy to all radiographically evident sites of disease. If an MTD has not been determined at Level 6, the study will end and Dose Level 6 will be declared the Recommended Phase 2 Dose.
Participants will be given prophylactic / supportive treatment protocols including Calcium Carbonate, mozobil, and neupogen injectable product.</description>
