      1. To figure out the effect of soccer play (once a week for 8 weeks) on pulmonary function
           in children with cerebral palsy

        2. To find out if the leisure activity (soccer) increase the quality of life, motor
           function, gait function etc..

        3. Safety of soccer play in children with cerebral palsy

      1. 1 hr of play once a week for 8 weeks of soccer program was done in the experimental
           group.

        2. Both the experimental and control group were children with ambulatory cerebral palsy
           aged 5 to 12 years.

        3. Several outcomes were measured before and after the program

             -  pulmonary function test including FVC, FEV1

             -  GMFM-88, PBS, walking test, muscle power sprint test, timed up and go, gait
                parameters

             -  Child Health Questionnaire Parent Form 50 (CHQ-PF50)

             -  KIDSCREEN

        4. An accelerometer was worn before the program and during the program for a week
           (experimental group only)
