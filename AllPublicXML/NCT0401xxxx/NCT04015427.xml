      Abstract

      Aim:

      The primary aim of this study is to test whether or not cement residues in the submucosal
      environment of implants lead to a change in the microbiota and induce inflammation of the
      periimplant tissues.

      Material and Methods:

      24 patients in need of a single tooth replacement will be enrolled in this cross-over
      controlled clinical study. All patients will receive a two-piece dental implant, which will
      be restored with both a cemented and a screw-retained single crown. At the time of impression
      taking, patients will be randomized into two groups.

      Patients in group A will receive a screw-retained crown. Every 8 weeks microbiological
      samples using sterile paper points will be collected and analyzed for bacterial content by
      real-time PCR. Additionally, two host markers (MMP8, IL-1ß) will be determined by ELISA.
      Following this first period of 16 weeks, the screw-retained crown will be replaced by a new
      intraorally cemented crown. Cement removal will be preformed according to best clinical
      procedure. These crowns will again be left for another period of 16 weeks and followed up for
      the harvesting of microbiological samples every 8 weeks. After the second 16-week the crowns
      will be removed to evaluate any excess cement. All patients will be fitted with the original
      screw-retained crown. Clinical parameters for inflammation and probing depths will be
      obtained after each 16 week-period.

      In group B the crowns will be incorporated in a reverse pattern. During the first 16 weeks
      any possible cement residues will be removed according to best clinical procedure, while for
      the second period of 16 weeks patients will be fitted with a screw-retained single crown.
      Again, microbiological and clinical parameters will be obtained at the same intervals as in
      Group A.

      After the second 16 week period the screw-retained crowns will be (re-) inserted in all
      patients, single tooth x-rays taken and clinical baseline values obtained. Additionally, a
      soft tissue biopsy will be harvested at the time of insertion of the final screw-retained
      crown. Patients will be followed up for another 16-week period.

    <description>A single-tooth x-ray will be obtained at the time of implant placement and again at abutment connection in order to ensure sufficient osseointegration of the implant before entering the prosthetic phase. At the time of insertion of the respective reconstruction in both groups, another periapical radiograph will be obtained to ensure the fit of the reconstruction and to check for eventual cement residue. A final x-ray will be taken at insertion of the final screw-retained implant crown to serve as baseline regarding marginal bone level at the time of final crown insertion.</description>
