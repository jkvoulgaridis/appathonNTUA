  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a group of important cardiovascular risk factors: abdominal
      obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and high blood pressure. Treatment requires the
      introduction of pharmacological management that includes different medications for each
      component. Ellagic acid (EA) is a polyphenol that has shown health benefits in multiple
      experimental studies. AE is consumed by patients without a prescription; considering there
      aren't studies that demonstrate it's effectiveness on MS, it is important to evaluate the
      possible effects of AE on this pathology. METHODOLOGY: Current study is a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled clinical trial. The aim of this study is evaluating the effect of AE on
      the components of metabolic syndrome, insulin sensitivity, and insulin secretion.

      INTRODUCTION: Ellagic acid (EA) is a polyphenol that has shown health benefits in multiple
      experimental studies; mainly as an antioxidant, but also in hepatic steatosis, endothelial
      damage, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, visceral fat accumulation, dyslipidemia, insulin
      resistance, atherosclerosis, etc. There aren't studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of
      EA on MS; and since it is consumed by patients without any prescription, it is important to
      evaluate the effect of the administration of EA on the components of metabolic syndrome,
      insulin sensitivity, and insulin secretion. The current design is a randomized double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, clinical trial. METHODS: Male and female volunteers between 31 to 60
      years of age, with MS diagnosis of MS according to the criteria of the International Diabetes
      Federation will be included, whether they accept participating and signing the informed
      consent. Patients with one or more of the following criteria will be excluded: History of
      liver, kidney, heart, or thyroid disease; systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg, diastolic blood
      pressure ≥90 mmHg, fasting blood glucose: ≥126 mg / dL, triglycerides ≥400 mg / dL, LDL
      cholesterol &gt; 190 mg / dL; pregnancy or lactation; consumption of medications or supplements
      which interact with EA or that have effects on any of the components of the MS. Patients
      included, may be withdrawn from the study if they meet any of the following conditions:
      Withdrawal of the informed consent; compliance with some exclusion criteria during the study;
      treatment adherence &lt;80%; intolerance to EC or placebo. OBJECTIVES: Main objectives are
      measuring and comparing before and after the intervention, the effect of EA or placebo on
      metabolic syndrome components, insulin sensitivity, and insulin secretion. HEADQUARTERS: The
      study will be carried out in the facilities of the Institute of Experimental and Clinical
      Therapeutics (INTEC), of the University Center of Health Sciences, in the University of
      Guadalajara. Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.
