  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The difference in Pulmonary Function assessed via Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) between participants with moderate to severe OSA and without OSA.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Using an open-circuit spirometry, participants will undergo 3 FVC maneuvers. At each maneuver, participant will put on a sterile mouthpiece and nose clips. Participants will begin breathing normally, then they will be instructed to take in a deep breath to maximum inhalation and forcefully exhale. The open-circuit spirometry will store FVC over Force Expiratory Volume after 1 second (FEV1) measurements. The highest of the three trials will be used.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The difference in Pulmonary Function assessed via Maximum Inspiratory Pressure (MIP) between participants with moderate to severe OSA and without OSA.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be instructed to exhale completely and then pull in hard on a disposable cardboard mouthpiece fitted to a differential pressure gauge. The largest negative pressure sustained for at least one second on the pressure gauge will be noted. In between a minute of rest, the participants will be asked to complete the maneuver two more times. The best of the three recordings will be used for this data outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The difference in Motor Function assessed via hand grip strength measured by maximum grip strength (MGS) between participants with moderate to severe OSA and without OSA.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be instructed to squeeze the hand grip dynamometer with maximal effort for 3-5 seconds. This will be repeated three times for each hand with 1 minute of rest between trials. The highest value obtained will be used as the MGS.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The difference in Motor Function assessed via hand grip strength measured by electromyographic (EMG) recordings between participants with moderate to severe OSA and without OSA.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Electrodes will be secured on the participant to measure EMG. Participants will then be asked to press the index finger against a custom lever. The participant will perform three brief maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) for 3-5 seconds separated by 60 seconds of rest. The highest of the three values will be used.</description>

    <description>Serum Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) biomarker levels in pg/ml will be evaluated. At baseline, the blood samples will be collected after 12 hours of overnight fasting.</description>
