    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to pilot test a culturally tailored Family Psychoeducation model
      (KUPAA) for adults with psychotic disorders and their relatives that is appropriate for
      cultural settings inclusive of both traditional and biomedical ideas about mental illness and
      that incorporates relatives as co-facilitators of the intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Family psychoeducation (FPE) is an evidence-based practice used in high-income countries to
      help individuals with psychotic disorders and their relatives to cope more effectively with
      the illness. FPE has never been tested in a low-resource country nor have the mechanisms of
      action for this psychosocial intervention been fully identified in any context. The goal of
      this study is to pilot test a culturally tailored Family Psychoeducation model (called KUPAA)
      for adults with psychotic disorders and their relatives that is appropriate for cultural
      settings inclusive of both traditional and biomedical ideas about mental illness and that
      incorporates relatives as co-facilitators of the intervention. Formative research has already
      been conducted to culturally tailor the model for the Tanzanian context. This pilot study is
      a small randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 72 patient/relative dyads that will test the
      KUPAA intervention to a) assess the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted family
      psychoeducation intervention for 12 weeks, and b) explore its impact on patient relapse,
      quality of life and disability.

      Primary study objectives

        1. To pilot test the KUPAA intervention to explore its impact on patient relapse, quality
           of life and disability

           Secondary study objectives

        2. To elucidate the mechanisms of action for KUPAA (e.g. hopefulness, self-efficacy) and
           refine the mediation and study outcome measures for a future R01/fully powered clinical
           trial

    <measure>Change in Disability, as measured by the WHODAS 2.0 (World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Scores are measured from the 36-item WHODAS 2.0, the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule, which measures health and disability. WHODAS 2.0 produces domain-specific scores for six different functioning domains - cognition, mobility, self-care, getting along, life activities (household and work) and participation. Each item is ranked on a 5-point scale from 0-4 and calculated as 0-100% for each domain score with 0 being no disability and 100% being extreme disability. An overall score is created by averaging the domain score.</description>

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life, as measured by the WHOQOL-BREF (World Health Organization Quality of Life- Abbreviated)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Scores are measured from the 26-item WHOQOL-BREF (the abbreviated version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life 100 scale), which produces a quality of life profile with four domain scores (physical health, psychological, social relations, environment) and two individually scored items about an individual's overall perception of quality of life and health. The four domain scores are scaled in a positive direction with higher scores indicating a higher quality of life. The mean scores of items within each domain are used to calculate the domain score. One transformation methods converts scores to a range of 4-20, with data being comparable to the WHOQOL-100. Another transformation methods converts the domain scores to a 0-100 scale.</description>

    <description>Patient/caregiver dyads will be assigned to a KUPAA group composed of approximately 6 patients and 6 matched caregivers. The dyads will first participate in 1-2 joining sessions with a provider, followed by a 1-day group educational workshop. Participants will then attend weekly family psychoeducation group sessions (~1.5-2 hours) for 12 weeks.</description>

    <intervention_name>KUPAA Intervention Group (Culturally Tailored Family Psychoeducation)</intervention_name>
    <description>KUPAA is composed of 3 key components:
1-2 Joining sessions [~30 to 45 minutes each] give the facilitator and participants a chance to get to know each other before KUPAA groups begin and allows time for questions.
Educational Workshop is an interactive, one day workshop offering information about biological, psychological and social aspects of mental illness; the nature, effects and side effects of psychiatric treatments; what families can do to help recovery and prevent relapse; and guidelines for managing mental illnesses.
12 Family psychoeducation group sessions [~1.5 hours each session] occur weekly in multi-family groups. These sessions follow an empirically tested format and focus on solving problems that interfere with treatment, illness, and symptoms management and that support coping skills and personal care. Case management may also be provided.</description>
