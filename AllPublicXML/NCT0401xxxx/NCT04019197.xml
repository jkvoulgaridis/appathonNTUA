  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial designed to assess the effect
      of the GLP-1 receptor agonist, semaglutide, on visceral and ectopic fat, insulin resistance,
      inflammation markers, and the downstream effect of cardiovascular risk in people with HIV. A
      similarly-designed study will enroll overweight/obese participants without HIV who will match
      the participants with HIV by gender, age, and BMI, and will run in parallel to the HIV study.
      The primary endpoints will be visceral and ectopic fat changes over the study period. The
      secondary endpoints will include changes in markers of inflammation, immune activation, gut
      integrity, and cardiovascular disease risk assessment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase IIb, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial of
      semaglutide in people with HIV-associated lipohypertrophy. Two populations (individuals with
      HIV and lipohypertrophy and gender-, age-, and BMI-matched HIV-uninfected controls who are
      overweight/obese) will be studied in separate but similarly-designed studies running in
      parallel. Participants will be recruited from 2 different sites (Cleveland, OH and
      Charleston, SC). The duration of the study will be 56 weeks. The interventional phase will
      last 32 weeks, followed by a 24-week observational phase to assess the sustainability of the
      intervention. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive semaglutide by subcutaneous
      injection once weekly for 32 weeks (8-week dose escalation phase followed by full-dose for 24
      weeks) or matching placebo.The primary objective of this clinical trial is to determine the
      efficacy of semaglutide in treating lipohypertrophy among non-diabetic people living with HIV
      by reducing fat accumulation and ectopic fat deposition, altering adipokine levels, improving
      endothelial function and arterial stiffness, down-regulating key pro-inflammatory cytokines
      and immune activation without modifying microbial translocation and gut integrity markers. A
      secondary objective is to determine the difference (if any) in the efficacy of semaglutide in
      people with HIV compared to an overweight/obese group without HIV.

    <ipd_description>Sharing of data generated by this project is an essential part of our proposed activities and will be carried out to comply with the NIH policy on Sharing Research Data. We wish to make our results available both to the community of scientists interested in HIV infection, immune activation and co-morbidities, as well as to people living with HIV infection. The data generated in this project will be presented at local, national and international conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals in a timely fashion. All final peer-reviewed manuscripts that arise from this project will be submitted to PubMed Central. The PI will work to facilitate any request made for data produced under this proposal upon publication of data, using standard, university-approved material/data transfer agreements.</ipd_description>
