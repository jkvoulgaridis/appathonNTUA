  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment for malignant lacrimal sac tumors is difficult and the prognosis is poor. The
      conventional strategy is surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy with or without
      concurrent chemotherapy. This approach has many drawbacks including positive surgical margins
      due to large tumor size, distant metastasis due to intraoperative squeeze, and implant
      exposure due to high doses of radiation. In previous research, the investigators innovatively
      adopted neoadjuvant radiotherapy (or chemoradiotherapy) and withdrew radiotherapy after
      surgery. Preoperative radiotherapy can effectively reduce the tumor size and encapsulate the
      tumor in a fibrotic cyst, and therefore enables en-bloc excision of the tumor and
      simultaneous orbital reconstruction. This multidisciplinary approach can reduce the risk of
      recurrence and metastasis, lower the dose of radiation, and avoid implant exposure after
      reconstruction.

      In order to compare the long-term outcomes between neoadjuvant radiotherapy and conventional
      treatment approach, the investigators will prospectively recruit 94 patients with malignant
      lacrimal sac tumors and randomly assign these subjects into the study group (neoadjuvant
      radiotherapy, 47 cases) and the control group (conventional treatment, 47 cases). The primary
      outcomes include overall survival, disease-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival,
      and locoregional control at 2-year, 5-year and 10-year intervals. The secondary outcomes
      include ocular functions (visual acuity and diplopia, tear film stability and tear secretion,
      globe dystopia and motility, and corneal topography), acute and chronic radiation-related
      toxicity, cosmesis (medial canthal tendon dystopia and eyelid retraction), and assessment of
      quality of life.

Based on the tumor type and tumor stage, subjects will be conducted with neoadjuvant radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy followed by radical surgery and simultaneous orbital reconstruction. After surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy will be determined based on the tumor histology, local tumor invasiveness, proximity of the surgical margins from the tumor, and pronouncement of tumor margins on permanent section tissue review.</description>

    <description>After assignment into the control group, subjects will receive radical surgery without simultaneous orbital reconstruction. Adjuvant radiotherapy / chemoradiotherapy will initiate within two weeks after surgery.
