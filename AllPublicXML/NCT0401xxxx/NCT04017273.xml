    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the recommendations of a screening tool called: ER2 (Emergency Room
      Evaluation and Recommendations Form).This stool is used in Emergency Department by nurses,
      and it supposes to measure patient risk score.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crowding and delay became chronic conditions in emergency departments (EDs) in high income
      countries. Emergency medicine has the mandate to provide care to any patient requesting
      treatment 24 hours a day. As there is a lack of primary care physicians who are able to
      provide the necessary care to patients, they are forced to seek care in ED. Among these ED
      users, more and more patients are aged over 65 and account for up to a quarter of all ED
      users. Older ED users comparted to their younger counterparts are more at risk for long
      length of stay in ED and hospital, and hospital admission during an index ED visit. The
      occurrence of these short-terms adverse events may be reduced if older ED users risk is
      assessed upon their ED arrival. Few studies have examined risk for short-terms adverse
      events. They suggested that clinical tools based on a brief geriatric assessment with timely
      appropriate interventions could reduce the occurrence of short-terms ED adverse events.
