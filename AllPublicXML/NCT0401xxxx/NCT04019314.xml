  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are observing the values of proEnkephalin (PENK) via a blood draw in hospitalized
      patients that are volume overloaded requiring diuresis. If changes in PENK are found,
      physicians may predict values of change in kidney function during treatment.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study will be to probe if values of proEnkephalin, called PENK in this
      proposal, can identify those patients who develop AKI. This biomarker is an opioid that is
      rapidly released in response to renal injury. At a cut-off value of 100pmol/L, it has been
      reported to have excellent sensitivity and specificity for detecting renal injury. PENK has
      been shown to be prognostic of WRF and outcomes in patients with acute heart failure but
      requires evaluation of efficacy in detecting AKI in standard of care clinical practice
      settings. In this study we propose to evaluate the baseline presence of plasma and/or serum
      levels of biomarkers of renal injury and changes in these biomarkers during the course of
      in-hospital intravenous diuretic therapy. The question is if threshold values of the
      biomarkers can be identified and if those threshold values would indicate a clinically
      significant change in renal function that would warrant a change in diuretic therapy to
      occur. In this context the quantitative assessment of intravascular volume will provide
      objective corroboration as to volume status in relation to biomarker levels and changes
      during treatment. If this approach can be proven to be fruitful, it would be anticipated that
      a subsequent study, a clinical trial, to test the hypothesis that biomarkers of AKI,
      specifically PENK, could be used to identify and avoid AKI in hospitalized patients with
      decompensated HF.
