  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with resectable melanoma will receive neoadjuvant nivolumab followed by surgical
      resection. Post-operatively, subjects will receive open-label treatment with up to 1 year of
      adjuvant nivolumab or ipilimumab plus nivolumab as determined by pathologic response at the
      time of resection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with Stage III resectable melanoma will receive one dose of nivolumab 480 mg IV,
      then undergo standard definitive surgery approximately 4 weeks after the initial dose of
      nivolumab. Post-operatively, subjects will receive open-label treatment with up to 1 year of
      adjuvant nivolumab 480 mg IV every 4 weeks or ipilimumab plus nivolumab, as determined by
      pathologic response at the time of resection. Subjects with pathologic complete response or
      near pathologic complete response (PathCR/nearCR) (Arm A) receive adjuvant nivolumab for up
      to one year. Subjects with &lt;PathCR/nearCR are randomized 1:2 to either adjuvant nivolumab
      (480 mg) for up to one year (Arm B) or adjuvant ipilimumab (1mg/kg) plus nivolumab (3mg/kg)
      for 4 doses and then nivolumab (480 mg) alone for a total of one year (Arm C).

             months (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or
             immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or
             physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency,
             etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.

          -  Has evidence of active interstitial lung disease or a history of (non-infectious)
             pneumonitis that required steroids or has current pneumonitis.

          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

          -  Patients known to be positive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) if they have a
             CD4 count of less than 350 mm3 and a serum HIV viral load &gt; 25,000 IU/mL

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 5 months,
             if female, or 7 months, if male, after the last dose of investigational drug.

          -  Prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated.
