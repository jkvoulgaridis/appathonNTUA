      There are a series of symptoms such as ischemic stroke、transient ischemic attack 、hemorrhagic
      stroke、headache 、seizure and so on in moyamoya disease( MMD) patients .Nowadays,
      revascularization is the only effective way for ischemic MMD and there is no effective
      conservative treatment for MMD. This study was to explore the safety and efficacy of remote
      ischemic conditioning(RIC ) on adult MMD patients.

      There are a series of symptoms such as ischemic stroke、transient ischemic attack 、hemorrhagic
      stroke、headache 、seizure and so on in moyamoya disease. Nowadays, revascularization is the
      only effective way for ischemic MMD while controversial for hemorrhagic MMD patients.
      Surgical complications including hyperperfusion syndrome, cerebral infarction or bleeding
      often occurred postoperatively. There is no effective conservative treatment for MMD up to
      now.

      Remote ischemic conditioning is Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) is a noninvasive and
      easy‑to‑use neuroprotective strategy, and it has potential effects on preventing ischemia
      reperfusion injury and ischemic infarction.This study was to explore the safety and efficacy
      of remote ischemic conditioning on adult MMD patients.
