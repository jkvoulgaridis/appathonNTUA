  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective was to compare the differences of PSG parameters and plasma melatonin
      levels before and after treatment with escitalopram for 8 weeks. Polysomnography (PSG) was
      detected over a night and blood samples were collected at 4 h intervals for 24 h from 13 male
      healthy controls and 13 male MDD patients before and after treatment with escitalopram for 8
      weeks. The outcome measures included the levels of plasma melatonin, PSG parameters (include
      sleep architecture and power analysis) and scales.

      1. Design and participants: The patients with MDD were screened from the hospital, age- and
           gender-matched healthy controls were recruited by advertising from the community who
           signed written informed consent before participation.

        2. Assessments: The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRSD-17) , Montgomery-Asberg
           Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale (CGI-S),
           and 14-item Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA) were assessed at baseline and after 8 weeks'
           treatment with escitalopram for patients with MDD. As for healthy volunteer, these
           measures were evaluated only once. In addition, all participants were assessed
           Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI).

        3. Treatment: Each patient was provided with escitalopram.

        4. Collection of peripheral blood samples: Test the levels of plasma melatonin at 4 h
           intervals for 24 h from all participants.

        5. Sleep and EEG recordings: The PSG of participants was evaluated for one night at
           baseline (all participants) and 8 weeks treatment (MDD).

        6. Analysis the PSG architecture and power ratio.
