  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the research study is to develop and test a prepartying (aka
      &quot;pregaming&quot;) specific brief mobile app intervention that is intended to help college students
      reduce their prepartying drinking behavior. Such behavior has been identified as a major
      contributor to alcohol-related negative consequences among young people. The investigators
      will first develop the intervention content based on theory and research supporting
      mechanisms of change in brief interventions with college students and document normative
      drinking information from 500 college students for inclusion in the intervention content.
      Investigators will then beta test the intervention with a sample of 14 heavy drinking college
      students. Focus group feasibility and acceptability feedback will inform the final
      intervention content. Investigators will then pilot test the mobile-based intervention in a
      randomized controlled trial of 500 college students who preparty frequently (n = 250
      intervention, n = 250 attention control) and determine the efficacy of the intervention on
      (1) preventing heavy consumption levels during and after prepartying and on (2) reducing
      students' global levels of heavy drinking and consequences one and three months
      post-intervention.

    <description>The intervention is comprised of a theoretically-informed and empirically-supported, brief, accessible, and personalized intervention to address prepartying drinking. the prepartying intervention app will be tailored toward an individual's personal goals, beliefs (perceptions, expectancies, self-efficacy), and behavior (protective strategies), and focus on the core components of brief interventions that have been cited as constructs that mediate the effects of multiple component intervention programs (e.g., correcting perceived norms, use of protective behavioral strategies, increased self-efficacy, challenging expectancies, feedback on blood alcohol level).</description>
