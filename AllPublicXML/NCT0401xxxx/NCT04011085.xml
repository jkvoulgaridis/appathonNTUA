      Breast cancer ranks top 4 Taiwan mortality cause in 2016 and the incidence rate has been
      increasing. Since advances in screening and treatment over last decades, disease-free
      survival in HER2 positive breast cancer improved and relapse rates decrease as well. While
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and productivity benefit is not currently formally
      assessed by Taiwan Health Technology Agency (HTA) in Taiwan, the value of therapy in terms of
      a wider societal benefit is a critical factor which is increasingly being considered as part
      of the overall assessment of the value of a new medicine.

      Sort of productivity study in cancer is lack of in Taiwan. Referenced Roche UK team published
      comprehensive productivity studies1 Taiwan Epidemiology Association wants to initiate study
      to understand holistic value in each stage of breast cancer and quantify the value of new
      drug to support HTA assessment.

      The data will be collected through study, and adapt to cost-effectiveness model for future
      reimbursement submission.

    <description>the FACT-B consists of the following subscales: physical well-being (PWB), functional well-being (FWB), emotional well-being (EWB), social/family well-being (SWB), and breast cancer-specific concerns (BCS). A total FACT-B score is calculated by summing the subscales. The instrument has a total of 41 items asking respondents to rate how true each statement is for the last 7 days. Response scales range from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much).</description>
