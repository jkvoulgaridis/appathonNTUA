  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total Knee Replacement (TKR) significantly improves function, pain, and overall quality of
      life in patients with end-stage arthritis of the knee. However, studies show that obesity
      increases complications and costs associated with TKR. The American Academy of Orthopaedic
      Surgeons (AAOS) clinical guidelines recommend that patients with a BMI &gt; 25kg/m2 lose 5% of
      their body weight prior to surgery. Consequently, although it is not clear how to patients or
      providers achieve weight loss in this population, some providers and hospitals decline to
      perform TKR in patients with obesity. Low Calorie meal replacement diets (LCD) are a feasible
      way to safely promote short-term weight loss of 8-15% at 3-6 months prior to some elective
      surgeries.

      This is a pilot efficacy study to test whether a short-term program using a 3-month LCD leads
      to weight loss and improved patient reported and functional outcomes. 75 patients eligible
      for knee replacement surgery and willing to undergo non-operative weight management treatment
      at NYU Langone Comprehensive Obesity Center. This study will establish feasibility and weight
      loss outcomes in preparation for a multicenter effectiveness trial.

    <measure>Change in quality of life measured by SF-36 questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>18 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability. To calculate the scores it is necessary to purchase special software. Pricing depends on the number of scores that the researcher needs to calculate.
The eight sections are:
vitality
physical functioning
bodily pain
general health perceptions
physical role functioning
emotional role functioning
social role functioning
mental health</description>
