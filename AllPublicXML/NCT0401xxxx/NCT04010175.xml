  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral functioning changes with age in order to respond to the impacts of different
      external and internal factors on the brain, and more generally on the human body. Scaffolding
      Theory of Aging and Cognition proposes that during life the brain develops specific neural
      networks to handle with cognitive activities. When these networks are impaired due to factors
      that damage brain structure and/or brain functioning, the brain adapts and elaborates new
      networks to cope with this situation. A cognitive reserve built throughout life and an
      appropriated care such as for example cognitive training, are in the centre of this model
      because they are involved in building these networks. In general, studies exploring cognitive
      training in normal aging and in patients suffering from neurodegenerative disease such as
      Alzheimer's disease have shown some benefits of the training on cognitive functioning. It has
      been shown not only that the cognitive training improves older adults' cognition, but also
      that these effects last for a long time and positively influence older people everyday
      activities. In fact, the benefits from memory training were observed 5 years after the end of
      the training and those of reasoning and of speed of processing even after 10 years. In
      addition, majority of the participants declared to notice improvement of their everyday life.
      Concerning Alzheimer's disease, several studies have observed positive results of cognitive
      training although there are some controversies about its' effects. Numerous studies point out
      that for cognitive training being the most efficient, the intervention has to take place as
      early as possible, preferentially in a premorbid stage of the disease and that it is
      important to propose trainings that minimize the withdrawal. In this sense, the importance of
      using computer based training was put forward because it allows the elaboration of multiple
      exercises with playful aspect and more importantly it can adapt on line the difficulty of the
      exercises to the patient's performance. However, if it is commonly admitted that computer
      based training has an important role in physician's, psychologist's or speech therapist's
      office less is known about the efficiency of this type of training performed at distance, at
      the patient's place of residence. It seems probable that to propose distance training as an
      additional training to that performed in a practitioner's office would increase training
      benefits. To investigators knowledge this was not investigated in a systematic way with
      Alzheimer's disease patients. The more important advantages of a such additional training
      are: (1) reduction of patients' travelling, (2) increased flexibility of training scheduling
      and (3) increased frequency of training sessions per week.

      Thus, in the present study investigators will examine in a systematic way, whether the
      distance training, as an additional training to this performed in practitioner's office,
      brings incremental short- and long-term benefits coming from cognitive training in mild to
      moderate Alzheimer's disease patients. Investigators second objective is to determine what
      would be the best frequency per week of such an additional training.

    <description>Participant will perform 1-hour cognitive computer based training one time per week in a practitioner's office during 4 months (16 weeks of training = 16 hours of training). This training will include 10 short tasks of increasing difficulty. Performance of these tasks involve cognitive functions such as: executive functions, reasoning, auditive, visual and visuo-spatial memory, speed of processing, short-term memory and working memory. Thus the training aims to exercise all these cognitive functions.</description>
