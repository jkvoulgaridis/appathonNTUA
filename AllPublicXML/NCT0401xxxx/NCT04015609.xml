  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project has four phases. In the first phase, the study team will work to adapt and
      transcreate (the source text is rewritten to convey the concepts and achieve the aims of the
      source text, while accounting for both language and cultural considerations) the manual based
      on the R21 CA180831 findings. In the second phase, mental health providers will be
      interviewed to explore additional needed adaptations. In the third phase, key components of
      the intervention will be pre-piloted with patients. The fourth phase will consist of an RCT
      pilot study to further adapt and tailor MCP-L for Spanish-speaking patients, evaluate the
      preliminary effects, and to explore its acceptability and feasibility. Phase 1: Initial
      Adaptation. The first phase of the adaptation will be conducted by the PI, her mentors and
      collaborators (FG, GB, EC, CJG). This team will review the intervention manual and plan how
      to adapt the manual incorporating the findings of the R21. The adaptations will be
      highlighted and comments will be kept in the margin. The team will maintain fidelity to the
      intervention concepts, goals, and theoretical model, while adapting it to the language,
      metaphors, intervention strategies, cultural context and values that will be acceptable to
      the Latino cultural group. Members of the team (RCM, FG, EC, CJG) will independently review
      the manual and then consensus meetings will be held to discuss every session of the manual,
      provide feedback and discuss further modifications until consensus is reached. GB will review
      the text to ensure that the adaptation considered the dimensions of the EVF. CJG (linguistic
      advisor) will review both versions of the manual and make recommendations to maintain
      non-regional language, low reading level and linguistic similarity. Because there are
      differences in Spanish by regions, the initial translation will be reviewed by professionals
      from different backgrounds (Puerto Rico, Mexico, Spain, Argentina, and Nicaragua) to ensure
      the manual would be comprehensible across diverse Latino cultures. Phase 2: Key Informant
      Feedback (Aim

      1a). The PI then will conduct video conference interviews with 15 key informants (mental
      health professionals, MHP).

      The MHP will be recruited from the membership directory of FIPOL, (stands for Training on
      Psychosocial Oncology Research for Latino-America in Spanish) which is an international
      network developed by the PI that aims to connect Latino-serving psycho-oncologists,
      clinicians, and researchers interested in Psychosocial Oncology. Through FIPOL 525
      clinicians, researchers, and trainees from Spain, Latin America, and USA receive newsletters,
      announcements and invitations to a remote monthly seminar. The PI is a founding member, part
      of the steering committee, and has access to the registry. Based on recommendations of Guest
      and colleagues we will recruit 15 providers using purposive sampling. The purposive sampling
      selection of data involves choosing information-rich cases that provide valuable information
      about the central issues or the purpose of research. Eligible providers are: (1)
      professionals working in the mental health field; (2) with a caseload of five or more Latino
      cancer patients per month; and (3) able to communicate and read in Spanish.

    <measure>Spiritual Well-Being measured with the FACIT Spiritual Well-Being Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to post assessment 7-14 weeks after</time_frame>
    <description>FACIT Spiritual Well-Being Scale is a brief self-report measure designed to assess the nature and extent of individual spiritual well-being. This measure, which generates two sub-scales, one corresponding to Faith (the importance of faith and spirituality) and a second assessing Meaning-Peace (one sense of meaning and purpose in life), has been demonstrated to have strong internal reliability for both the total score as well as each subscale (coefficient alpha equals .87 for the total scale, .88 for the faith factor and .81 for the meaning factor). In additional, strong support for the external validity of this measure has been demonstrated in a several large samples of cancer and AIDS patients and with Spanish speaking populations.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression and Anxiety measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to post assessment 7-14 weeks after</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a validated scale used to measure anxiety and depression. This scale has been validated against structured or semi-structured clinical interviews, the gold standard for the assessment of mental disorders, in a significant number of studies. Further strengths of this scale for the assessment of emotional distress in cancer patients stem from the joint assessment of anxiety and depressive symptoms without referring to physical symptoms of anxiety or depression. Given the high comorbidity of anxiety of cancer as well as the systematic exclusion of confounding physical symptoms, the scale seems especially appropriate for use in this patient group. The HADS consists of 14 items which reflect a 7-item anxiety and a 7-item depression subscale. This scale has sound psychometric properties in Spanish.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hopelessness measured with the Beck Hopelessness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to post assessment 7-14 weeks after</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) comprises 20 true/false questions that assess degree of pessimism and hopelessness. Several studies have demonstrated a high degree of internal consistency and construct validity. Scores ranging from 4 to 8 typically indicate a &quot;mild&quot; degree of hopelessness, 9 to 12 correspond to &quot;moderate&quot; hopelessness, and scores about 12 reflect &quot;severe&quot; levels of hopelessness.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life measured with the FACIT Spiritual Well-Being Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to post assessment 7-14 weeks after</time_frame>
    <description>The FACIT Spiritual Well-Being Scale (FACIT-Sp-12) is a brief self-report measure designed to assess the nature and extent of individual's spiritual well-being. This measure (range 0-48), which generates two sub-scales, Faith (the importance of faith/spirituality, range 0-16) and Meaning /Peace (one's sense of meaning and purpose in life, range 0-32). The total score for the FACIT-Sp scale is the sum of the two subscales Faith and Meaning /Peace. It has been demonstrated to have strong internal reliability for both the total score as well as each subscale (coefficient alpha = .87 for the total scale, .88 for the faith factor and .81 for the meaning factor). Higher scores represent a higher level of spiritual well-being, faith or meaning-peace. In addition, strong support for the external validity of this measure has been demonstrated in a several large samples of cancer and AIDS patients and with Spanish speaking populations. Administration time takes approximately 4 minutes.</description>
