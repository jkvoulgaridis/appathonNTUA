  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial with the following
      objectives: to compare the incidence of post-operative descemet membrane detachment (DMD) in
      phacoemulsification surgery between modified and conventional 2.2mm microincision.

      2.2mm incision is considered an ideal incision size in phacoemulsification. However, DMD is a
      common and serious complication in 2.2mm microincision phacoemulsification for hard nucleus
      age-related cataract. DMD is originated from the incision in the operation. How to construct
      the appropriate incision shape and size for reducing the occurrence of DMD is an important
      problem to be solved urgently in phacoemulsification surgery.

      The investigators found that enlarging the internal incision could increase the range of
      motion of surgical instruments and reduce the friction of instruments to incision.
      Therefore，the incidence of DMD would be reduced. The investigators developed this technique,
      modified 2.2mm incision, to reduce the incidence of incision-site DMD and not to increase
      other incision related complications.

      In this trial, the investigators aim to compare modified and conventional 2.2mm incision with
      regard to safety and efficacy in reducing the incidence of DMD.
