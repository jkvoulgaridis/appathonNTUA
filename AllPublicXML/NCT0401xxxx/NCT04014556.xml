      Purpose: To evaluate the role of adjuvent micropulse laser with Aflibercept injections in the
      management of treatment naïve centre involving DME, looking at decreased treatment burden and
      increased efficacy as outcomes.

      Methods: This was a prospective, single centre, randomized trial that included 40 eyes (40
      patients) with previously untreated centre involved DME. Patients were randomly assigned to
      receive either Aflibercept plus micropulse laser (group A) or Aflibercept monotherapy (group
      B).

      Patients were randomly distributed in a 1:1 ratio between the two studied groups. Group A
      received 3 monthly injections of Aflibercept 2 mg/0.05 mL (Eylea; Bayer, Berlin, Germany) as
      a loading dose, followed one month later by one 577 nm yellow micropulse laser session with
      monthly PRN Aflibercept injections. Group B received 3 monthly injections of Aflibercept 2
      mg/0.05 mL as a loading dose, followed by monthly PRN Aflibercept injections. Patients in
      both groups were assessed one month after the end of loading phase; At this point, group A
      received the micropulse laser session and started PRN Aflibercept injections, while group B
      started PRN Aflibercept injections without receiving the micropulse laser session. After
      that, both groups were followed for 12 months.

    <description>Micropulse session details:
Mainster focal grid contact lens (×1.05 laser magnification) was used to perform laser. The 577-nm yellow laser (OcuLight SLx, Iridex Corp., Mountain View, California, USA) was used. Fixed treatment parameters were used in all cases: 200-μm spot size, 200-ms exposure duration, 400-mW power, and a 5% duty cycle. Confluent applications with no spacing were administered using 5x5 grid pattern over the entire edematous area including the fovea.</description>
