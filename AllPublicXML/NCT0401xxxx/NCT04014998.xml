  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Virtual reality application has been increasing in recent years for pain control, distraction
      in wound care, treatment of anxiety disorders and support for physical rehabilitation. For
      example, it has been found to be effective in reducing pain when used in addition to medical
      treatment during bandaging of severe burns. The studies related with chronic pain patients
      were stated that virtual reality application was found to be interactive and fun by patients.
      Therefore, The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of virtual reality on pain
      threshold, disability, balance, proprioception, exercise sustainability, muscular performance
      in neck region, quality of life and anxiety / depression in addition to the exercise program
      that includes stabilization exercises in patients with chronic neck pain.

    <description>Virtual reality group will have virtual reality for 20 minutes in addition to stabilization exercises for 20 minutes. Virtual reality will apply using Oculus Go. On the other hand control group will have only exercise for 40 minutes. Exercises will include same exercises in both groups, but exercise group will perform exercises twice compared to virtual reality group.</description>
