  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a nonrandomized, open-label, dosed escalation, safety activity, and PK study to
      determine the MTD and optimal dosing regimen of Eribulin ORA.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and activity study.
      Eligible subjects will be adults with advanced solid tumors.

      Groups of 3 to 6 subjects will receive a single dose of Eribulin ORA on Day 1 and Day 8 of a
      21 day cycle and will be followed for toxicity. If non linearity in PK is observed,
      additional subjects will be added with study drug administered on Day 1 and 8 once every
      three weeks cycle. Subjects who tolerate the study drug and have stable disease or better
      response will be eligible to receive ongoing treatment.
