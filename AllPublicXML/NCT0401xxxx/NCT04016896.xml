  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using an indicated prevention approach, investigators propose to enroll 150
      spousally-bereaved adults aged 60 years and older in the first 6 months after spousal death
      who are at high risk for major depression disorder because of subthreshold symptoms of
      depression. A confirmatory efficacy trial will be conducted in which participants will be
      randomly assigned to (a) self-monitor sleep, meals, and physical activity for 12 weeks using
      digital monitoring plus motivational health coaching (WELL; n=75); or (b) enhanced usual care
      (EUC, usual care plus study assessments, n=75). Objective actigraphic measures of the 24-hour
      pattern of day and nighttime activity - known as the rest-activity rhythm - will be measured
      to evaluate circadian rhythms as a mediator of treatment outcomes. Participants will be
      assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 3, 6,12, 18-months post-intervention.

      The primary aim of this R01 application is to test the efficacy of a new behavioral
      intervention that targets the timing and regularity of sleep, meals, and physical activity to
      stabilize circadian rhythms, for reducing symptoms of depression during the spousal
      bereavement period.
