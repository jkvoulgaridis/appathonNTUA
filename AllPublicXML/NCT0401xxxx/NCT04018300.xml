  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to examine patient-reported gastrointestinal side effects, as
      well as iron status indicators, inflammatory markers and oxidative stress following
      administration of ferrous sulfate and iron-enriched Aspergillus oryzae supplementation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) afflicts more than 2 billion people globally, making it the most
      prevalent nutrient disorder, today. Inadequate dietary intake of iron results in consequences
      like cognitive decline, fatigue, abnormal growth and adverse pregnancy outcomes. These
      ramifications have associated burdens on economical progression due to decreased market
      productivity. Inorganic iron supplements like ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) are most commonly used
      to treat IDA, however known associated side effects occur, decreasing compliancy in
      individuals. Moreover, inorganic iron salts present a large bolus of iron to the intestinal
      lumen, resulting in non-transferrin bound iron which leads to systemic inflammation and
      further exacerbation of chronic diseases. Organic iron compounds have strong potential to be
      utilized for supplementation, however only under circumstances in which contain high
      absorbance. Seventeen subjects were randomized in a three-armed, double-blinded crossover
      design to examine the differences among three treatments (FeSO4, ASP-s and placebo). Outcomes
      will be to assess acute inflammatory proteins, oxidative stress, iron status indicators,
      non-transferrin bound iron and gastrointestinal-related side effects.

    <intervention_model_description>Three armed, cross-over, double blinded design. Fifteen subjects will be randomized to treatment FeSO4, ASP or placebo for two week per treatment. Following each treatment, will be a two week washout period whereby subjects will not consume a supplement. Baseline and final blood draws of each treatment will be collected, in addition to serum collection at 0h, 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h following one dose to determine NTBI concentration curve.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Subjects will take a 65 mg Fe capsule of ferrous sulfate, once daily for 21 consecutive days. The first treatment capsule will be consumed with a semi-purified meal (egg albumin, sugar, vanilla, maltodextrose and corn oil) and will have blood drawn hours 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 post consumption. Serum will be used to determine non-transerrin bound iron, serum iron and percent saturation. Throughout the treatment period, subjects are informed to consume the capsule with food and report symptoms in an online questionnaire. Following three weeks treatment, participants return for a blood draw and oxidative stress indicators are measured. A three week washout period with placebo treatment takes place between treatment crossover.</description>
