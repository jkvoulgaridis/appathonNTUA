      This study evaluates the difference between PRISMA-7 and ER2 tool. There are some differences
      between PRISMA-7 and ER2 tool. The differences consist in evaluation criteria that are used
      to perform the both surveys. We suppose that evaluation criteria of PRISMA-7 is not
      accurately enough to calculate the length of hospital stay and to predict the short-term
      outcomes.

      The &quot;Program of Research on Integration of Services for the Maintenance of Autonomy&quot;
      (PRISMA-7) is the Ministry of Health and Social Services' reference tool for the assessment
      of older ED users in Quebec (Canada). PRISMA-7 has been initially designed to screen
      disability in community-dwelling older adults and has never been validated for risk for
      short-term adverse events in older ED users. &quot;Emergency room evaluation and recommendations&quot;
      (ER2) is another clinical tool which is currently evaluated in Quebec. Compared to PRISMA-7,
      ER2 has been especially designed for assessing risk for short-term ED adverse events. No
      study has compared PRISMA-7 and ER2 risk for short-term adverse events. We hypothesised that
      ER2 could be a better prognostic tool compared to PRISMA-7 for long length of stay in ED and
      hospital stay, and hospital admission because it was designed and validated for this specific
      goal. The study aims to 1) examine and compared PRISMA-7 and ER2 risk for long length of ED
      and hospital stay and hospital admission, and 2) to establish their performance criteria
      (i.e., sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value,
      likelihood ratios) for these three short-term adverse events in older ED users.

    <description>Each participant will be evaluated at Emergency Department based on ER2 screening tool (Emergency Room Evaluation and Recommendation Form). Six closed-ended format questions (i.e., yes versus no) composed ER2 assessment: Age category (≥ 85), male, polypharmacy (≥ 5 different medications per day), use of formal (health care or social professional) and/or informal (family and/or friend) home support, use of a walking aid regardless its type, and temporal disorientation (inability to give the current month and/or year).</description>
