  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to:

        -  Test how well the study medicine Abemaciclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, works to shrink lung
           cancer tumors in the body.

        -  Test the safety of Abemaciclib when given to participants with small cell lung cancer
           (SCLC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, non-randomized, phase 2, single arm study to determine the efficacy
      and safety of Abemaciclib as a single agent in patients with biopsy-proven wild type Rb
      extensive stage of SCLC,with platinum refractory disease (defined as no response after 1-2
      cycles of chemotherapy or relapse defined as initial response but relapse after completing
      platinum-based chemotherapy).

      Abemaciclib (CDK4/6 inhibitors) is an investigational drug that works by interrupting the
      rapid and uncontrolled growth of cancer cells. Some cancer cells develop because their cells
      overrun the molecular brakes that normally permit cell to divide only when they are needed to
      replace old ones. These brakes are regulated by a group of enzymes known as cyclin-dependent
      kinases (CDKs). Alterations causing over-activity of two of these enzymes, CDK4 andCDK6, are
      found in a variety of cancers, including small cell lung cancer with retinoblastoma (Rb)
      protein.The drugs work by selectively turning off the overactive CDK4 and CDK6. As a result,
      the cancer cells' division cycle is halted, preventing them from proliferating.

      The objectives of this study include determining:

        -  Overall Response Rate (ORR) after the first cycle (4 weeks) and then every 8 weeks.

        -  Progression Free Survival (PFS)assessed at 6 months and Overall Survival (OS).

        -  Safety and adverse events

        -  Duration of response in all responders

    <description>Duration of response in all responders (DoR using RECIST 1.1) assessed from the time that measurement criteria met until progressive disease is objectively documented.
Progressive disease defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.

          -  The patient has serious preexisting medical condition(s) that would preclude
             participation in this study (for example, interstitial lung disease, severe dyspnea at
             rest or requiring oxygen therapy, history of major surgical resection involving the

             etiology, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, sudden cardiac arrest, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  The patient has active bacterial infection (requiring intravenous [IV] antibiotics at
             time of initiating study treatment), fungal infection, or detectable viral infection

             for enrollment.

          -  HIV-positive subjects on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with Abemaciclib. In addition, these
             subjects are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow
             suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in subjects receiving
             combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
