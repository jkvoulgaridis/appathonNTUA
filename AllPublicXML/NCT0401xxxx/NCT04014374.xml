  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional cohort study evaluating non-relapse mortality and toxicities in
      patients with CTCL or ATLL treated with mogamulizumab pre- or post- alloHCT for patients
      transplanted beginning January 1, 2012 until accrual is complete.

    <textblock>
      This is an observational, retrospective and prospective study where subjects who have
      received mogamulizumab either within one year before or within 18 months after
      transplantation will be followed for data collection. Data will be collected at baseline
      (retrospectively), 100 days post alloHCT, 6-months, 1 year and at 2 years post alloHCT
      (retrospectively and prospectively).

      A cut-off time limit of 18 months post alloHCT exposure will allow at least 6 months of
      follow-up within the 2 years post-alloHCT follow-up period.

        The study population will include a minimum of 50 patients with CTCL or ATLL who received
        mogamulizumab within one year prior to alloHCT. At least 40 patients should have been
        diagnosed with CTCL and at least 33 patients should have received mogamulizumab as last
        therapy line before alloHCT. Data will be collected from no more than 100 controls with
        similar characteristics to the mogamulizumab-treated patients, and who have undergone
        alloHCT without exposure to mogamulizumab pre- or post-alloHCT. Information on patients
        receiving mogamulizumab within 18 months after alloHCT will also be collected.
