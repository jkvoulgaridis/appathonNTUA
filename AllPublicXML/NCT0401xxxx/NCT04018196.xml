  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is associated with impairments in cognitive function, particularly motor learning and
      memorizing, impacting functional capacities. Older adults are still able to learn new skills
      but at a slower rate, and they forget quickly the new-learned skill because of an alteration
      in motor memory. Motor imagery, which is a mental simulation of an action without actual
      execution, has been demonstrated to improve performance in young adults and stabilize
      performance after a short break in older adults. However, in very old adults (&gt;80 years old)
      for whom the decline in motor and cognitive functions is greater, it is unknown whether motor
      imagery training during a short break is still efficient. Previous studies on old adults were
      performed on upper limb muscles. Because aging differentially affects upper and lower limb
      muscles, the present study will aim to explore the effects of motor imagery on motor
      memorizing in both upper and lower limb muscles.

      The primary purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness of motor imagery to improve the
      performance of very old people (&gt; 80 years) through learning a task of the upper limbs.
