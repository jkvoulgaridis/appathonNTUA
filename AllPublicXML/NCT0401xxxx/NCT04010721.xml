      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of varying additional factors on loudness
      summation in Neuro Zti Cochlear Implant users.

      Primary objective:

      - To assess the effect of the number and spatial distribution of active electrodes on the
      stimulation charge required to achieve the loudness associated with C and T levels
      (Experiment 2).

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To assess how loudness is affected by changes in electrical charge of individual pulses
           made by adjusting the pulse amplitude versus adjusting pulse duration (Experiment 1).

        -  To assess how loudness elicited by a train of pulses is affected by the duration of that
           pulse train (Experiment 3).

      Experiment 1:

      The test will investigate the effect of loudness on changes in electrical charge of
      individual pulses, made by separately adjusting pulse amplitude or pulse width. The
      electrical charge required to elicit different loudness (&quot;just-audible&quot;, &quot;soft&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;,
      &quot;comfortable&quot;, &quot;loud but comfortable&quot;) either when increasing the amplitude or the duration
      of the pulses.

      Experiment 2:

      The test will investigate the effect of the number of stimulating electrodes and their
      distribution within the cochlea on the stimulation levels required to achieve T-levels and
      C-levels and to elicit different loudness (&quot;just-audible&quot;, &quot;soft&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;, &quot;comfortable&quot;,
      &quot;loud but comfortable&quot;).

      Experiment 3:

      The test will investigate the effect on loudness of trains of pulses elicited by
      modifications to the duration of those trains, when operating around T and C levels.
      Stimulation durations ranging from 10 to 600 ms will be tested. Pulse trains will be
      presented to either one or several electrodes to elicit different loudness (&quot;just-audible&quot;,
      &quot;soft&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;, &quot;comfortable&quot;, &quot;loud but comfortable&quot;).
