      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy male or non-pregnant female aged ≥ 12 and ≤ 40 years with a clinical diagnosis
             of acne vulgaris.

          2. Subjects who are 18 years of age or older (up to the age of 40 inclusive) must have
             provided IRB approved written informed consent. Subjects ages 12 to 17 years of age
             inclusive must have provided IRB approved written assent; this written assent must be
             accompanied by an IRB approved written informed consent from the Subject's legally
             acceptable representative (i.e., parent or guardian). In addition, all Subjects or
             their legally acceptable representatives (i.e., parent or guardian) must sign a HIPAA
             authorization.

          3. Subjects must have a minimum ≥ 25 non-inflammatory lesions (i.e., open and closed
             comedones) AND ≥ 20 inflammatory lesions (i.e., papules and pustules) AND ≤ 2
             nodulocystic lesions (i.e., nodules and cysts), at baseline on the face. For the
             purposes of study treatment and evaluation, these lesions should be limited to the
             facial treatment area. All lesions will be counted, including those present on the
             nose. Subjects may have acne lesions on other areas of the body which will also be
             excluded from the count, treatment, and the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA)
             evaluation (e.g., on the back, chest and arms).

          4. Subjects must have a definite clinical diagnosis of acne vulgaris of severity grade 2,
             3, or 4 as per the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA).

          5. Subjects must be willing to refrain from using all other topical acne medications or
             antibiotics during the 12-week treatment period for acne vulgaris, other than the
             Investigational Product.

          6. Female Subjects of childbearing potential (excluding women who are premenarchal,
             surgically sterilized or postmenopausal for at least 1 year), in addition to having a
             negative urine pregnancy test, must be willing to use an acceptable form of birth
             control during the study from the day of the first dose administration to 30 days
             after the last administration of study drug . For the purpose of this study the
             following are considered acceptable methods of birth control: oral or injectable
             contraceptives, contraceptive patches, Depo-Provera® (stabilized for at least 3
             months) NuvaRing® (vaginal contraceptive);Implanon™ (contraceptive implant), double
             barrier methods (e.g. condom and spermicide),Intrauterine Device (IUD), Essure, or
             abstinence. If a subject who was abstinent becomes sexually active during the study, a
             2nd acceptable method of birth control should be documented. A sterile sexual partner
             is NOT considered an adequate form of birth control. Hormonal contraceptives should
             not be initiated or changed during the study.

          7. All male Subjects must agree to use accepted methods of birth control with their
             partners, from the day of the first dose administration to 30 days after the last
             administration of study drug. Abstinence is an acceptable method of birth control.
             Female partners should use an acceptable method of birth control as described in the
             above Item Number 6.

          8. Subjects must be willing and able to understand and comply with the requirements of
             the protocol, including attendance at the required study visits.

          9. Subjects must be in good health and free from any clinically significant disease,
             including but not limited to, conditions that may interfere with the evaluation of
             acne vulgaris. Such conditions include, but are not limited to the following:
             autoimmune disease, rosacea; seborrheic dermatitis; perioral dermatitis;
             corticosteroid-induced acne; carcinoid syndrome; mastocytosis; acneiform eruptions
