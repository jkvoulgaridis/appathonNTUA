  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nivolumab (BMS-936558) is a fully human, IgG4 (kappa) isotype mAb that binds PD-1 on
      activated immune cells and disrupts engagement of the receptor with its ligands PD-L1 (B7
      H1/CD274) and PD-L2 (B7-DC/CD273), thereby abrogating inhibitory signals and augmenting the
      host antitumor response. In early clinical trials, nivolumab has demonstrated activity in
      several tumor types, including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC).

      Nivolumab is in clinical development for the treatment of patients with NSCLC, RCC, melanoma,
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and other tumors (eg, glioblastoma
      multiforme, mesothelioma, small cell lung cancer, gastric).

      Nivolumab is approved in the United States (US), European Union, and other countries for the
      treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, advanced NSCLC with
      progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy, advanced RCC whose disease progressed on
      an antiangiogenic therapy, classical Hodgkin lymphoma that has relapsed or progressed after
      autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and post-transplantation brentuximab
      vedotin treatment, and recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
      with disease progression on or after a platinum-based therapy.

      The proposed study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of preoperative administration of
      Nivolumab or Nivolumab combined with nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin in neoadjuvant setting
      and administration of Nivolumab in adjuvant setting in patients with high-risk resectable
      NSCLC, and will facilitate a comprehensive exploratory characterization of the tumor immune
      microenvironment and circulating immune cells in these patients. Data obtained in this study
      will provide valuable information for planning further prospective clinical trials of
      anti-PD-1 and other immunotherapies in NSCLC, both in the peri-operative and advanced disease
      setting. Ultimately, it is highly desirable to discover prospective biomarkers of response
      and toxicity to allow patients with NSCLC who are most likely to derive benefit to receive
      anti-PD-1 treatment, and conversely to minimize the risk of toxicity and ineffective
      treatment for patients who are unlikely to benefit.
