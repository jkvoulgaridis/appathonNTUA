    <textblock>
      This cross-sectional study will evaluate the association between sociodemographic,
      occupational, clinical conditions, psychological (sense of coherence), sleep quality
      variables and SB diagnosed by PSG, the gold standard exam with audio-visual resources
      obtained at Pelotas Sleep Institute.

      Sleep bruxism is defined as a masticatory muscle activity during sleep that is characterised
      as rhythmic (phasic) or non-rhythmic (tonic) and should be considered a risk factor rather
      than a disorder in otherwise healthy individuals.

      The diagnosis of sleep bruxism often is challenging and despite the use of questionnaires,
      clinical exams and portable devices, based on current knowledge, the polysomnography with
      audio-video recordings emerges as the gold-standard criteria for a definite sleep bruxism
      diagnosis.

      Included on the questionnaire there is a registration form, which contains: included: age at
      time of data collection , gender, marital status , and education level ; Occupational:
      individuals were asked about work outside home, and working hours; Clinical condition: body
      mass index, smoking; alcohol consumption; use of sleeping pills; respiratory allergy and
      Psychological: sense of coherence .

    <description>The data were obtained from polysomnography records in which masseter electromyography (EMG) burst was detected based on a predefined EMG threshold (20% of maximal voluntary tooth clenching task). Right masseter EMG bursts exceeding 0.25 second in duration were selected for oromotor activity scoring according to published criteria. Oromotor episodes separated by 3-second intervals were recognized as rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA) if they corresponded to 1 of the 3 following patterns: phasic (3 or more EMG bursts, each lasting 0.25 to 2 seconds), tonic (1 EMG burst lasting more than 2 seconds), or mixed (both burst types) episodes. EMG bursts were considered within the same RMMA episode if the interval between them was shorter than 2 seconds. Participants had SB diagnosed by polysomnography (PSG) if the RMMA index was greater than 2 episodes per hour of sleep.</description>

    <description>The polysomnography (referred to as type I) allows assessing several sleep physiologic parameters (eg, EEG, electrooculogram, electromyogram, electrocardiogram, airflow, respiratory effort, oxygen saturation), whereas audio-video recording enables documenting tooth-grinding sounds and distinguishing between rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA) and orofacial (eg, swallowing) and other muscular activity (eg, head movements) during sleep. Based on the RMMA index (number of episodes per hour of sleep), sleep bruxism is diagnosed when RMMA episodes are greater than or equal to 2 (low-frequency SB, mild bruxism) or RMMA episodes are greater than or equal to 4 (high-frequency SB, severe bruxism)</description>
