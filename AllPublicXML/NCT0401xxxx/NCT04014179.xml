  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research project will compare two methods of testing and treating hepatitis C virus
      (HCV) in adults with a history of recent injecting drug use at Needle and Syringe Programs
      (NSP) in Australia. . NSPs will be randomised (i.e. allocated by chance) to one of two
      groups: 1. Testing for HCV using dried blood spots and 2. Testing for HCV using a new
      finger-stick test. The primary goal is to compare the proportion of people with hepatitis C
      virus who start treatment after 12 weeks between the two groups.

      The TEMPO study will compare dried blood spot testing and point-of-care HCV RNA testing as
      strategies to enhance HCV treatment uptake among people with HCV and recent injecting drug
      use attending NSP services. Peer support to enhance engagement and facilitate linkage to
      nursing care will be provided in both arms of this study.

      The study is a pragmatic, two-arm, parallel cluster randomized trial. The clusters will be
      primary needle syringe programs (20 primary needle syringe programs which provide services to
      people who inject drugs and have hepatitis C treatment services) located in Australia.

      Clusters will be randomized to either HCV RNA testing via dried blood spot or point-of-care
      HCV RNA testing using a computer-generated randomization scheme minimised based on cluster
      characteristics with a 1:1 allocation ratio (10 sites with point-of-care and 10 sites with
      dried blood spots).

      At enrolment, participants will be tested for HCV infection with dried blood spot or
      point-of-care, depending on cluster randomisation.

      HCV RNA negative participants will have no further assessments or visits as part of the study
      protocol. Participants who are HCV RNA positive will be enrolled in the cohort. Screening
      will continue until 300 HCV RNA positive participants are enrolled in each arm of the cohort
      (600 HCV RNA positive participants total).

      HCV RNA positive participants will be assessed for treatment based on standard eligibility
      criteria for government reimbursement of therapy. If eligible, they will be treated as per
      standard of care with a pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) approved pan-genotypic HCV DAA
      treatment. Participants will be encouraged to take the first dose on the day of treatment
      work-up where possible. On-treatment and post-treatment testing and monitoring will be based
      on the site investigator as per standard clinical practice.

      All HCV RNA positive participants will be followed up at 12 weeks, 24, weeks and 12 months
      post HCV RNA test.
