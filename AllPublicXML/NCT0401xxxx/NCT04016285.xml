  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare quadriceps muscle strength, pain, opioid consumption
      and patient function during the first three months after short-stay total knee replacement
      between patients treated with short-duration tourniquet knee replacement with the Aquamantys®
      bipolar sealer versus those treated with the standard of care (tourniquet used throughout the
      case and no Aquamantys®).

      By doing this study, investigators hope to learn if short duration tourniquet knee
      replacement with the Aquamantys® bipolar sealer is more effective than standard of care
      (tourniquet used throughout the case and no Aquamantys®). The purpose of this study is to
      compare quadriceps muscle strength, pain, opioid consumption and patient function during the
      first three months after short-stay total knee replacement between patients treated with
      short-duration tourniquet knee replacement with the Aquamantys® bipolar sealer versus those
      treated with the standard of care (tourniquet used throughout the case and no Aquamantys®).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Isometric quadriceps strength</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The participant will sit in a seated position and a stabilizing strap will be placed around the bottom of the participant's shank and attached to a hand-held dynamometer. The participant will be asked to slowly kick the foot as hard as they can into the dynamometer pad (muscle testing hardware), and force will be measured. Increased measured force indicates greater quadriceps strength.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperative, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be measured using the visual analog scale (VAS), which assess pain levels on a scale from 0-10. Lower numbers indicate less pain while higher numbers indicate more pain.</description>

    <measure>Knee Osteoarthritis (KOOS,JR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperative, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Knee injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Joint Replacement (KOOS,JR) patient-reported outcome score. The KOOS, JR contains 7 items from the original KOOS survey. Items are coded from 0 to 4, none to extreme respectively. KOOS, JR is scored by summing the raw response (range 0-28) and then converting it to an interval score. The interval score ranges from 0 to 100 where 0 represents total knee disability and 100 represents perfect knee health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Emotional Health (VR-12 MCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperative</time_frame>
    <description>The Veterans Rand-12 Mental Component Score will be used to quantify the impact of the participants emotional health on their daily activities. The VR-12 consists of 12 questions, is scored from 0-100 with lower scores indicating that emotional health has a more dramatic impact on the participant's daily life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knee function questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperative, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The knee function questionnaire is a study-specific questionnaire to assess knee problems that may affect everyday life. It consists of three questions: one about walking support, one about going up stairs and one about coming down stairs. Responses are categorical, and will be used to compare the proportion of patients in each group that can walk without a walker or cane, or navigate stairs without the use of upper body support. The knee function questionnaire is not a graded scale, but will be used to assess the proportion of each group that self-reports the ability to perform these 3 tasks at each of the study time points.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sit to stand test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a timed test used to measure mobility and function. Participants are positioned in a standard 16&quot; office chair with their arms at their sides and back located against the back of the chair. Participants are instructed to stand and sit as quickly as possible 5 times. The test is timed using a stopwatch and the timer is stopped when the individual achieves a standing position on the 5th trial. Shorter times indicate better mobility and function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Opioid Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperative, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Opioid use will be assessed with a single question with a binary response (either yes the participant is taking opioid medications or no they are not).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Isometric quadriceps strength</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Strength will be assessed at multiple time points during the study. The participant will sit in a seated position and a stabilizing strap will be placed around the bottom of the participant's shank and attached to a hand-held dynamometer. The participant will be asked to slowly kick the foot as hard as they can into the dynamometer pad (muscle testing hardware) placed on the anterior aspect of the participant's distal tibia. One practice trial followed by 3 actual trials will be performed. The participant will receive a 30-second rest in between each trial and a 1-minute rest in between legs for each test to prevent fatigue. Increased measured force indicates greater quadriceps strength.</description>
