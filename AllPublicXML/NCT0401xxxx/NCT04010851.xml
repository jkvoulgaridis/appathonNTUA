  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ADHD is associated with a substantial burden on families, and systems pertaining to health,
      social care, and criminal justice, and there is a need for more knowledge of the effects of
      non-pharmacological interventions. Educational and parental activation interventions may
      improve ADHD symptoms, and may enhance parent activation. Although the results of these
      studies are promising, few interventions have been carried out in collaboration with user
      representatives, which is required by Norwegian legislation. As such, there is a need for
      clinical studies that document the effects of educational group interventions based on user
      involvement that seeks to improve parental activation. Furthermore, it is not clear which
      type of educational intervention that should be offered, and which aspects of parenting
      behaviour to focus on. There is a lack of studies investigating whether adding an
      intervention designed specifically for families of children with ADHD will be more effective
      than treatment as usual (TAU). The purpose of the present study is to determine the
      feasibility and expected size of a substantive randomized controlled trial comparing an ADHD
      peer co-led educational programme added to TAU.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the
      intervention, to assure that procedures are adequate for a subsequent full size randomized
      controlled trial (RCT), and to determine the likely size of the trial comparing an ADHD
      specific parenting peer co-led intervention for parents of children with ADHD symptoms.

      Specific objectives are:

      (I) investigate whether parents of children recently diagnosed with ADHD are willing to be
      randomized to the intervention, (II) whether sufficient numbers of families can be recruited
      and retained such that a full-scale RCT is likely to be feasible, (III) whether research
      procedures and efficacy measures are feasible and acceptable to participating families and
      the outpatient clinics, and (IV) whether families participating in the intervention are
      satisfied with the intervention.

      This feasibility study is not designed to detect a treatment effect, therefore a maximum of
      50 parents will be recruited. The measurements will be taken in the children (at baseline and
      3 months) and parents (at baseline, two weeks, pre-post intervention and 3 months follow-up)
      to determine the feasibility and acceptability. These measures are chosen because they
      address key components of the intervention (activation, quality of life and psychological
      well-being). Multiple measures of similar constructs will be administered where possible
      (e.g., psychological well-being and quality of life) to determine which measure to include in
      the definitive trial according to feasibility, acceptability, and sensitivity.

      Feasibility assessments:

        -  Feasibility of recruitment.

        -  Acceptability of randomization and procedures will be determined by measuring loss to
           follow-up (post-test and 3-month follow-up), and reasons for withdrawal will be used
           collected.

        -  Acceptability of the intervention will be determined based on the number of sessions
           attended by participants in the peer co-led education. We will also reported on
           satisfaction with the program.

        -  Feasibility of quantitative measures will be deemed acceptable if no questionnaires are
           missing in full in more than 25% of the participants and if reliability was higher than
           0.70.

        -  Follow-up response rates (post-intervention and 3 months follow-ups).

    <intervention_model_description>The intervention is delivered in a group format, which takes the form of a full day's training, focusing on ADHD diagnosis, its treatment, how to cope with the challenges related to living with ADHD, as well as coping with challenges of parenting a child with chronic health conditions. After this one day-intervention, the participants can continue in self-help groups, which meet once a week for a 2-hour evening session. User representatives lead these weekly self-help groups, which do not require user-fees and aim to offer practical tools, support and information to increase the parent's skills, knowledge and confidence. Participants are encouraged to adopt an active role in order to achieve a positive parent/provider partnership.</intervention_model_description>
