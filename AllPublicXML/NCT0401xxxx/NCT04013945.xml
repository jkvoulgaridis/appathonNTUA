      Study to determine the effect of 12 weeks daily consumption of Superba Boost as compared to
      placebo on changes in Trans-Epidermal Water-Loss (TEWL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial in 70
      healthy adult male and female subjects between 20 and 50 years. The primary objective is to
      assess whether Superba Boost krill oil administered at a dose of 1 g per day for 12 weeks (84
      days) has a positive effect on the TEWL, skin hydration and elasticity. At screening, the
      subjects must have TEWL values of &gt;10 g/m2/h and &lt;24.9 g/m2/h when measured by a TEWAmeter,
      i.e. within the range defined as normal and healthy skin. The change in omega-3 index,
      defined as EPA and DHA as percentage of total fatty acids in red blood cells, will be
      measured and correlated to the changes in the skin parameters.

      The study consists of 4 visits: the screening visit (V1), baseline visit / week 0 / Start of
      treatment (V2), Interim / Week 6 (V3) and week 12 / end of treatment (V4) . In this study,
      subjects must have a low habitual consumption of fatty fish and seafood, defined as a
      frequency of twice per month or less will be recruited. Each subject must fulfill all
      inclusion criteria and will not be allowed to meet any of the exclusion criteria.

    <measure>12 weeks daily consumption of Superba Boost as compared to placebo on changes in Trans-Epidermal Water-Loss (TEWL) will be measured.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Trans-epidermal water loss (the loss of water that passes from inside the body through the skin to outside the body) measured at baseline and after 12 weeks of intervention using a TEWAMetre will be considered. This measurement provides information on the integrity of the skin protective barrier functions. Subjects eligible for the study will have a TEWL value &gt;10 and ≤ 24.9 g/m²/h. In comparison, A TEWL value between 0-9 is classified as a &quot;very healthy&quot; barrier function and values between 25-34 are in the &quot;strained&quot; range. These participants will therefore be deemed ineligible for the study. Additionally, subjects with a TEWL value of &gt;35 will have a skin barrier function classified as &quot;critical&quot; and will also be ineligible for the study.</description>

    <description>The effect of daily consumption of Superba Boost as compared to placebo on changes in Trans-Epidermal Water-Loss (TEWL) from baseline to 6 weeks after start of treatment, and from 6 weeks of treatment to the end-of-study will be measured.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The effect of daily consumption of Superba Boost as compared to placebo on changes in skin hydration will be measured.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of daily consumption of Superba Boost as compared to placebo on changes in skin hydration from baseline (pre-study) to 6 weeks after start of treatment, and from 6 weeks of treatment until end-of-study will be considered. The Corneometer indicates the hydration level of the top layers of the skin. The value of the dielectric constant is directly proportional to the level of skin hydration. i.e. higher value= more hydrated skin. The measurements for skin hydration are as follows: 0-29.9 (Very Dry), 30-44.9 (Dry), 44-130 (Normal).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The effect of daily consumption of Superba Boost as compared to placebo on changes in skin firmness will be measured.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of daily consumption of Superba Boost as compared to placebo on changes in skin firmness from baseline (pre-study) to 6 weeks after start of treatment, and from 6 weeks of treatment until end-of-study will be considered. The Cutometer measures the resistance of the skin to be sucked up by negative pressure (firmness) and its ability to return into its original position (elasticity). Elasticity is measured from 0 (no elasticity) to 1 (maximum elasticity).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The effect of daily consumption of Superba Boost as compared to placebo on subjective evaluation by study subjects, using questionnaires will be studied.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of daily consumption of Superba Boost as compared to placebo on subjective evaluation by study subjects, using questionnaires, after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment will be considered. Subjects will be provided with a &quot;Subject Skin Evaluation&quot; Questionnaire and will answer questions regarding &quot;Overall Skin Condition&quot;, &quot;Skin Hydration&quot;, &quot;Skin Moisture&quot; and &quot;Skin Elasticity and Firmness&quot; of their own skin. Changes in the subjects' interpretation of their own skin condition will therefore be reported over the 12-week study period.
Each subject reports their opinion of their own skin condition through a numeric scale measuring from 0 to 100mm. 0mm is the &quot;worst&quot; skin condition and 100mm is the &quot;best&quot;.</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of daily consumption of Superba Boost as compared to placebo on Omega-3 index, using a blood spot collected by fingerpick will be considered. The higher the percentage (%), the higher the Omega-3 content of the blood.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Depending on the outcome of the primary and secondary objectives, further exploratory analysis may be performed on the skin samples to meaure the effect of Superba Boost versus the placebo on the Lipid content of skin</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis will be performed on the following lipids: Nonhydroxydehydrosphingosine (NdS), Nonhydroxysphingosine (NS), Nonhydroxyphytosphingosine (NP), Nonhydroxy-6-hydroxysphingosine (NH), Alphahydroxydehydrosphingosine (AdS), Alphahydroxysphingosine (AS), Alphahydroxyphytosphingosine (AP), Alphahydroxy-6-hydroxysphingosine (AH), Omegahydroxysphingosine (EOS), Omegahydroxyphytosphingosine (EOP), Omegahydroxy-6-hydroxysphingosine (EOH), Omegahydroxydehydrosphingosine (EOdS)); diacylglycerol; free cholesterol; cholesterol esters; triacylglycerols. In the case of all the above lipids, the higher the percentage (%), the higher the lipid content of the skin.</description>
