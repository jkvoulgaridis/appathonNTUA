  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, multicenter prospective study including up to 260 subjects with
      type 1 or type 2 diabetes who use insulin injections (either basal insulin only or multiple
      daily injections (MDI)) and CGM or SMBG to manage their diabetes. The study aims to generate
      the database needed for future development and verification of insulin-glucose modules of
      subjects with diabetes using insulin injections.

      During the study, subjects will continue their regular diabetes management using their
      regular glucose monitoring method (either CGM or SMBG), insulin injections and oral
      medication (as applicable). Subjects will be requested to document glucose levels and insulin
      delivery during basal only or basal/bolus insulin treatment. In addition, subjects will have
      their daily activities recorded (meals, physical activity etc) using electronic log
      (implemented on the CGM/FGM receiver, Dedicated App, Neura App and/or other logbooks). Data
      will be captured during regular daily life using Insulin Connected pens and daily diary
      application software, for a period of 1 month.

        Up to 260 subjects with diabetes mellitus will be recruited in the following distribution:
        up to 100 T1D and up to 160 T2D. All subjects will be using multiple daily injections of
        insulin or basal injections only and self-monitoring blood glucose or continuous glucose
        monitoring.

                  a week 7-point profile. Document blood glucose level, insulin delivery, meals and
                  daily activities. Optional: wear blinded CGM.

               2. For CGM users: Document insulin delivery, meals and daily activities. Optional:

             Measure capillary blood glucose in addition.

             treatment for T2) or any significant diseases /conditions including psychiatric
             disorders and substance abuse that in the opinion of the investigator is likely to
             affect the subject's ability to complete the study or compromise subject's safety
