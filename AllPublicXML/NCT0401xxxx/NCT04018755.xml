  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sanfilippo syndrome, or mucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPS III), is a disorder of
      metabolism, associated with insufficient production of a lysosomal enzyme needed for normal
      cell function. As a consequence of the cellular dysfunction, patients with this disorder
      develop progressive, irreversible neurodegeneration. Sadly, to date no evidence-based
      treatments are available.

      Inflammation has been connected with disease pathogenesis in the MPS disorders. Therapies
      aimed at decreasing inflammation are currently being studied in many MPS disorders and
      benefits in both brain and other parts of the body have been reported.Decreasing
      interleukin-1 (IL-1) in an animal model of MPS III showed benefits in brain disease and
      behavior. Thus, we think that anakinra (Kineret), which decreases IL-1 levels in the body,
      will improve behavioral and other problems in children with MPS III.

      Anakinra is approved by the FDA for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and neonatal-onset
      multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID). It is not approved for any MPS disorder.

      The design of this study is an open-label, single center, pilot study of 20 participants with
      MPS III. There will be an initial screening visit, followed by an 8-week observational
      period, then a 36-week treatment period, and finally another 8-week observational period to
      determine any effects of withdrawal from the treatment.

      During visits the participants will undergo a medical history, a physical examination, and
      anthropometric measurements. Blood, urine, and stool will be collected for biomarker levels
      and safety laboratory studies. Questionnaires will be completed with questions related to
      behavior, stooling, sleep, and activities of daily living. Seizure and movement disorders
      will be monitored as well.

      The most common risks of receiving anakinra, based on RA and NOMID experience, include local
      injection site reactions, headache, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, and flu-like symptoms. The
      most serious potential risk is a serious infection and neutropenia. However, because so few
      people with MPS have been treated with anakinra, all the risks related to MPS patients
      receiving anakinra are not currently known. Additional risks related to taking part in the
      study include some pain, bruising, and/or bleeding due to blood draws/peripheral IV
      placement, and discomfort with completing some of the questionnaires.

      The expected potential direct benefits include, but are not limited to, improved behavior,
      sleep, stooling, communication, mood, and gait; as well as decreased seizure frequency,
      disordered movement and fatigue. However, there is no guarantee that participants will get
      any benefit from being in this study.

    <description>MDRI composite outcome comprised of the Sanfilippo Behavior Rating Scale, Children's Sleep Health Questionnaire, Autism Parent Stress Index, PROMIS fatigue survey, seizure log, movement disorder log, and Non-communicating Children's Pain Checklist - Revised. MDRI will be calculated as the sum of scores from the components. Subjects will receive a score for each component of the MDRI listed above. A score of 0 will be given for a change in score less than the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID). A score of +1 (improvement) or -1 (worsening) will be given for a change in score of ≥ 1 MCID and &lt; 2 times MCID. A score of +2 (improvement) or -2 (worsening) will be given for a change in score of ≥ 2 and &lt;3 times MCID. A score of +3 (improvement) or -3 (worsening) will be given for a change in score of ≥ 3 times MCID.</description>
