  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antimicrobials (drugs that kill or stop the growth of microorganisms including bacteria,
      thereby treating infections) commonly used to treat patients with infections are becoming
      less effective over time as bacteria develop resistance to them. Antimicrobial usage itself
      can lead to development and spread of antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial resistance is
      now a major threat to patient safety. To conserve the effectiveness of antimicrobials the
      investigator need to develop ways to use them more sensibly healthcare professionals who
      diagnose and treat infections must be able to access antimicrobial guidelines and test
      results at the patient bedside. This needs to be provided rapidly and with support to make
      sure that the decisions on prescribing antimicrobials are the best that can be made.

      Prototype software to achieve this has been developed through collaboration between
      healthcare professionals and biomedical engineers. This prototype software (run on a mobile
      device) retrieves patient results from various laboratory and clinical databases (securely
      within the Trust firewall) and displays this to the clinician making the prescribing
      decision. Furthermore a machine learning algorithm is applied to the data, and similar
      anonymised historical cases (and the antimicrobials prescribed and the clinical outcomes) are
      also displayed to the clinician to further inform their decision making. The prototype has
      been designed for use in intensive care, where the risk of infection is high, but through the
      research project detailed here, the software will be developed and validated across other
      areas of hospital patient care. Furthermore there is a key need to engage patients with how
      decisions are made around antimicrobial prescribing. The investigator propose to adapt the
      prototype to meet these needs. This system should improve patient safety and help preserve
      the effectiveness of existing antimicrobials

        Patients may be asked to participate in the qualitative evaluation of the the patient
        module.

        For prescriber recruitment to use the application the following methods of identifying
        participants will be undertaken:

        Phase 1: Participants will be identified based on their roles within the infectious disease
        team (level and areas of the hospital covered) and will be directly approached by the study
        PI / clinical infection lead to request their support with this phase of the project.

        Phase 2: Participants (physicians) will be identified based on the wards that they work in.
