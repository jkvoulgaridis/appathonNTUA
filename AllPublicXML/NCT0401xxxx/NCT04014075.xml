    <textblock>
      This study will find out if trastuzumab deruxtecan is safe and works for participants with
      certain kinds of cancer.

      They must have HER2-positive gastric or gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) cancer:

        -  that cannot be removed surgically

        -  that has moved to other parts of the body

        -  that got worse during or after treatment that included trastuzumab

      The study will enroll about 72 participants at about 25 to 30 sites. Sites will be in North
      America, Australia, Israel, and the European Union. There might be other countries as well.
