  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Work-related stress is a problem due to its repercussions on workers' health and
      productivity, which is why workplace interventions are required to reduce stress levels
      through coping techniques. One of the interventions in mental health to reduce levels of work
      stress are those based on the Internet and mobile applications, with proven effectiveness.
      Among the interventions are cognitive-behavioral therapies and within these the Problem
      Solving Therapy (PST).

      Therefore, there is a need to study the effect of Problem Solving Therapy offered through a
      web platform on the levels of self-perceived stress. However, there have been no studies on
      mental health interventions such as the TSP for the reduction of stress levels in office
      workers. For this reason, the objective of the study is to determine, through a randomized
      cluster trial, the effectiveness of problem-solving therapy offered through a web platform on
      self-perceived stress levels. Two scales will measure the levels of stress; one for
      self-perceived stress and another for work-related stress. Workers who have a high score on
      both scales will be enrolled. The establishments assigned to the intervention will receive
      the TSP distributed in 4 sessions. The establishments in the control group would have access
      to a web page with information on stress management. Immediately after having finished the
      last session, self-perceived stress levels will be evaluated. One month later a new
      measurement will be made to evaluate the persistence of the effect.

      The objective of the study is to determine, through a randomized cluster trial, the
      effectiveness of problem-solving therapy offered through a web platform on self-perceived
      stress levels.

      Overall objective Evaluate the effect of Problem Solving Therapy offered through a web
      platform, on the self-perceived stress level of administrative workers.

      Specific objectives

        -  Develop and validate a web platform with problem-solving therapy.

        -  Determine the cut-off point of self-perceived stress measurement scales.

        -  Evaluate the factors associated with stress in office workers.

        -  Compare the levels of Perceived stress scale (PSS) before and after the use of a web
           platform with educational material in Problem Solving Therapy (PST).

        -  Compare the effect of a conventional platform versus the Problem Solving Therapy offered
           through a web platform on self-perceived stress levels.

        -  Compare the levels of occupational stress (OSS) before and after the use of a web
           platform with educational material in Problem Solving Therapy (PST).

        -  Compare the effect of Problem Solving Therapy offered through a web platform versus a
           conventional web platform on work stress levels (WSS).

        -  Evaluate the correlation between the perceived stress scale and the occupational stress
           scale (OSS).

    <description>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) It's formed by 14 items that measure the degree to which, during the last month, people have felt upset or worried or, on the contrary, have felt confident in their ability to control their personal problems. Scale scores between 0-56, with higher scores indicating greater stress perceived. Use a five-way Likert response format with a range of 0 &quot;Never&quot;) to 4 (&quot;Very often&quot;). The cut point for determinate stress is 20.9 points (14 + 1 SD (6.9)) for hispanics. [ L. Harris Pol]</description>

    <description>Change in Occupational stress scale. This instrument has as author ILO-WHO. The questions are 25 with 7 alternatives such as answers ranging from the score from 1 to 7, of as follows.
[1= if the condition 'Never' is a source of stress. 2 = if the condition 'Rarely' is a source of stress. 3 = if the condition 'Occasionally' is a source of stress 4 = if the condition 'Sometimes' is a source of stress. 5 = if the condition 'Frequently' is a source of stress 6 = if the condition &quot;specifically&quot; is a source of stress. 7 = if the &quot;Always&quot; condition is a source of stress.] The scale determinate the cut point for stress in 120 for Peruvian population.

    <description>Problem Solving Therapy offered through a web platform. There will be four sessions, during the first four weeks of treatment, and subsequent sessions are dedicated to refining problem-solving skills. Participants set treatment goals; different ways to reach goals are discussed and evaluated; action plans are created, and its effectiveness is evaluated to achieve the objectives. Participants are expected to implement plans and apply the problem-solving model to additional problems between sessions. In the last two sessions, participants create a relapse prevention plan using the problem-solving therapy model.</description>
