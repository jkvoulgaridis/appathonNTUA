  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to investigate the effect of a standardized liquid breakfast
      containing a food grade propionate colon release form on ad libitum eating and appetite
      perception in healthy overweight humans using a double-blinded, randomized, cross-over study
      design
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine, in healthy overweight subjects, the acute effect of a standardized liquid
      breakfast containing a propionate colon release form compared with placebo on appetite and GI
      comfort, food intake, serum glucose and insulin, plasma ghrelin, total GLP-1 and serum PYY
      concentrations, and plasma propionate concentrations

    <time_frame>Every 30 minutes during an interval of 6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective measurements of motivation to eat and GI physical comfort will be assessed using validated questionnaires, i.e. Visual Analog Scales (VAS). Each of the questions on the VAS is a 100 mm line anchored at each end with opposing statements. Participants mark a vertical line on the line at a point that they felt reflect their feelings at the moment the test was taken. Scores will be assessed by measuring the distance between the intersection of the vertical line with the line and the left end of the line. VAS include a set of questions, such as feelings of fullness, feelings of hunger, prospective food consumption.</description>
