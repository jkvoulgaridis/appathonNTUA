    <textblock>
      To assess the safety, tolerability, analgesic, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen
      1300mg (IV APAP) dosed every eight hours relative to placebo and acetaminophen 1000mg (IV
      APAP) dosed every 6 hours relative to placebo over a 24 hour period in patient experiencing
      moderate to server pain following the surgical removal of third molar.

      This will be a randomized, double-blind, single-site, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
      study to assess similarities in safety, tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of 1300
      mg of injectable acetaminophen given in three doses, each 8 hours apart, relative to placebo,
      and 1000 mg of injectable acetaminophen given in four doses, each 6 hours apart, relative to
      placebo over a 24-hour period in patients experiencing moderate to severe postsurgical pain
      within 7 hours following surgical removal of 2 or more molars
