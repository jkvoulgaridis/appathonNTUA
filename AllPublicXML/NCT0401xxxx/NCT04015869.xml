  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine whether intravenous infusion of allopregnanolone
      (ALLO) attenuates stress-induced craving and stress-induced anxiety in a clinical laboratory
      setting. The secondary objective of this project is to characterize the behavioral effects of
      ALLO in heavy drinkers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study that will randomize 60 heavy &quot;at risk&quot;
      drinkers to 2 groups: targeted dose of targeted dose of 100 nM of ALLO (N=30) or placebo
      (N=30). Participants will receive a continuous infusion of ALLO (or placebo) for 175 min.
      Sixty min. after the start of the infusion, when ALLO levels are relatively stable, the
      stress induction paradigm will be introduced. Participants will be presented with a stress
      cue and a neutral cue in random order. Stress and neutral cues will consist of personalized 5
      min. scripts created prior to testing. Measures of stress-induced craving and stress-induced
      anxiety will be presented before the cue (pre), immediately following the cue (post) and 10
      min after (recovery).The study outcomes will include measures of stress-induced craving and
      stress-induced anxiety as well as measures of subjective mood effects, cognitive performance,
      and motor coordination.

    <measure>Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (AUQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (AUQ) is an 8-question, self-administered measure of drinking urges. Questions are in the form of a 7-point Likert scale with participants endorsing the extent to which they agree or disagree with statements relating to desire to drink (4 items), expectation of a desired outcome from drinking (2 items), and inability to avoid drinking if alcohol was available (2 items). Scores range from 8-56</description>

    <measure>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6) is a psychological inventory based on a 4-point likert scale with 6 questions and is self-report. The STAI measures two types of anxiety - state anxiety, or anxiety about an event, and trait anxiety, or anxiety level as a personal characteristic. Higher scores are positively correlated with higher levels of anxiety. Scores range from 20-80.</description>

    <description>The Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale (BAES) is a 14-item self-report adjective rating scale that will be used to measure the stimulant and sedative effects of alcohol. Scores range from 0-140</description>
