  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is a randomized pilot study of an intervention to address food insecurity among
      intermediate risk Boston Accountable Care Organization (BACO) members receiving primary care
      at Boston Medical Center (BMC).

      The investigators propose a parallel group, randomized pilot study among intermediate risk
      Medicaid ACO patients at BMC who have experienced food insecurity in the past 12 months, with
      a total enrollment of 120 participants (N=120). Half of the pilot study participants (n=60)
      will receive usual care: tailored printed paper referral guides to address health-related
      social needs, including resources for food insecurity (via the Health System's THRIVE
      Screening &amp; Referral Program) and referrals to Boston Medical Center's Preventative Food
      Pantry. The other half (n=60) will receive access to a mobile fresh produce market and a
      monthly stipend to purchase items available on the mobile food trucks.

      This pilot study will partner with Fresh Truck, a Boston-based 501(c)(3) organization that
      deploys mobile fresh produce trucks throughout Boston neighborhoods. Fresh Truck recently
      launched a new system, called 'Fresh Connect,' which addresses affordability as a barrier to
      healthy eating. 'Fresh Connect' enables healthcare systems to pay for fresh produce purchased
      by their patients from the Fresh Truck mobile markets.

      The study protocol comprises three steps:

        -  Risk stratification before consent process to determine if the patient, at baseline, is
           within the top 3-20% of cost and utilization among BACO members. (This process is part
           of usual care operations in the Health System for ACO members).

        -  Of BACO patients identified as intermediate risk, patients will be screened for
           proximity to Fresh Truck mobile markets (zip code is among current Fresh Truck service
           area), nutritional need (food insecurity identified in the last 12 months), and not
           documented as housing insecure.

        -  Half the pilot study population will receive access to a mobile fresh food market
           intervention, Fresh Truck, and a stipend to purchase fresh produce aboard the trucks.
           The other half will receive usual care.

      Pilot study participation is 6 months and will include collection and measurement of data
      from the following sources: baseline interview; final (6-months post-enrollment) interview,
      electronic medical records (EMR), BMC Clinical Data Warehouse (BMC CDW), and BMC HealthNet
      Plan (BMCHP) claims.

    <intervention_name>THRIVE screening and referral</intervention_name>
    <description>The THRIVE screening tool includes questions to identify eight potentially unmet health-related social needs associated with health outcomes and healthcare utilization: housing and food insecurity, inability to afford medications, need for transportation, trouble paying for heat and electricity, need for employment or education, and difficulty taking care of children or other family members. The survey is written at a 3rd grade reading level, is available in multiple languages, and requires less than five minutes to complete. The paper screener consists of two parts: part one screens patients for health-related social needs in the eight domains. Part two asks patients to indicate the resources they want help accessing across the eight domains. Patients who request resources in one or more domains receive paper guides that describe available hospital and community resources to address the specific domain(s) indicated.</description>
