  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to study whether Suprathel, a synthetic temporary skin substitute
      developed by PolyMedics Innovations GmBH aids in the management of patient pain and wound
      healing when compared to the current standard dressing used of a primary Xeroform dressing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute burn and donor site dressing changes are among the most traumatic and painful
      procedures performed on awake children and adults (7, 8). As a result, it is important to
      utilize dressings that: 1) stabilize open burn wounds and donor sites; 2) limit the frequency
      of dressing changes; 3) optimize burn wound and donor site healing; and 4) minimize scarring.
      Anecdotal evidence and a growing body of literature suggest that Suprathel may offer superior
      pain control and a decreased frequency of dressing changes, when compared to Xeroform.

      At Children's Hospital Colorado, the standard of care is to use Xeroform to dress split
      thickness skin grafts and donor sites. Xeroform is an inexpensive, bacteriostatic,
      non-adherent petroleum gauze dressing that is supplied in strips, sheets and rolls. It is
      used to protect freshly skin grafted areas and donor sites, it is then covered with gauze
      followed by BandNet. When Xeroform is applied to a split thickness donor site, it adheres to
      the open wound bed, where it is allowed to dry out. As the donor site heals, the Xeroform
      begins to separate from the wound bed, until the Xeroform eventually sloughs off.

      Suprathel is a biosynthetic dressing developed by PolyMedics Innovations in Germany.
      Potential advantages to the use of Suprathel include its water solubility, elongation
      capacity, and porosity, which prevents fluid accumulation at the burn site. In a prior study,
      Suprathel was associated with favorable burn scar formation (improved Vancouver Scar Scale
      Scores) and decreased pain with dressing changes. In another study, adolescent and adult burn
      patients dressed in Suprathel reported significantly less pain than those who were dressed in
      Mepilex dressings. In post-treatment surveys, patients preferred the use of Suprathel when
      compared to Mepitel. In a study that compared Suprathel to other standard burn dressings,
      there was no statistical difference in wound healing, scar formation, and epithelization.
      Given the limitations in sample size and scarce pediatric data in prior studies, further
      research is necessary to determine the efficacy of Suprathel in the pediatric population and
      whether this is a dressing material that should be offered to hospital patients.

      New outpatients and inpatients who meet study inclusion criteria and require split-thickness
      skin grafting, will be randomized into the Suprathel group or the control group on the day of
      surgery. The investigators will use even calendar operative days for Suprathel and odd
      calendar operative days for Xeroform. Parental consent and/or patient assent will be obtained
      prior to the operative procedure.

    <measure>Change in Pain as Assessed by Bieri Faces Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly change in pain for 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Bieri faces scale was developed in 1990 for children to self-report their pain levels by selecting a face corresponding to their pain severity. The Bieri faces scale has been validated in children &gt;5 years old. Children are asked to select one of 7 faces ranging from no pain to worst possible pain.</description>

    <measure>POSAS Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly change in scar from 3rd week to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is a validated tool that will be adapted so that parents and providers score the child's wound based on several criteria. The observer/provider will evaluate vascularization, pigmentation, thickness, surface roughness, pliability, and surface area. The patient's parents will score six items: pain, pruritus, color, thickness, relief, and pliability. It is widely used in the burn literature to evaluate and report on the appearance of healed burn scars. Moreover, it routinely used in the burn clinic at CHCO to assess and serially document changes in the appearance of burn scars over time.</description>

    <description>Once hemostasis is obtained, the Suprathel material will be handled with a new pair of sterile gloves. It will be cut so that the material extends 1-2 cm beyond the donor site margins, then applied to the donor site. The Suprathel will be secured with a protective layer of Rylon extending 1-2 cms beyond the margins of the Suprathel. The primary dressing will be covered with cotton gauze (4x4 fluff gauze pads) and wrapped with rolled gauze). The outer dressing will be changed 7-10 days post-op. The Suprathel and Rylon will remain in place until they can be easily peeled off. To facilitate the pain-free and easy removal of the primary Suprathel dressing, practioners will apply Vaseline or lotion to saturate and loosen the material. The patients will be followed on average about once per week in an outpatient clinic until the Suprathel (and Rylon) are removed, but they may continue to be seen until the STSG is fully healed.</description>

    <description>The surgical procedure for recovery of a skin graft will be the same for all patients as follows. Once the patient is taken to the operating room, the selected donor site will be prepared and harvested with a Zimmer Dermatome set at 0.007 to 0.009 thousands of an inch for pediatric patients and 0.12 to 0.14 thousands for adult patients. After the harvesting procedure, the donor site will be covered with Telfa saturated with 1:10,000 epinephrine in normal saline until hemostasis is achieved. The Telfa will be irrigated off the donor site with the epinephrine saline solution. The surgeon will don a new pair of sterile gloves to handle the donor site dressing. The randomized dressing will be applied over the hemostatic donor site with an approximate 1-2cm border. Next, the wound will be dressed with 4x4 cotton gauze pads (fluffs), rolled gauze (Kerlix) and either Coban or BandNet.</description>
