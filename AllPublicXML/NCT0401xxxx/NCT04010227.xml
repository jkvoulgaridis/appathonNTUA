  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial tests telephone-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), a type of
      psychotherapy, to reduce fatigue interference with activities, mood, and cognition in
      advanced gastrointestinal (GI) cancer patients and family caregiver burden. ACT includes
      mindfulness exercises (e.g., meditations, performing activities with greater awareness),
      identifying personal values (e.g., family, spirituality), and engaging in activities
      consistent with these values. A total of 40 patient-caregiver dyads will be randomly assigned
      in equal numbers to either the ACT intervention or an education/support condition. Dyads in
      both conditions will participate in six weekly 50-minute telephone sessions. Outcomes will be
      assessed at baseline, 2 weeks post-intervention, and 3 months post-intervention. The
      investigators hypothesize that ACT will lead to improved primary and secondary outcomes as
      compared to education/support. Study findings will inform a large-scale trial of intervention
      efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial evaluates the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of
      telephone-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) on fatigue interference in advanced
      gastrointestinal (GI) cancer patients and family caregiver burden as well as secondary
      outcomes. The study team will recruit advanced GI cancer patients receiving care at the
      Indiana University Simon Cancer Center or Eskenazi Health hospital. Potentially eligible
      patients will be mailed an introductory letter signed by their oncologist and the PI along
      with a consent form. The letter will have a number to call if they do not wish to be
      contacted further. A research assistant (RA) will call all prospective participants who do
      not opt out approximately 1 to 2 weeks after the letter is mailed. The RA will describe the
      study as outlined in the consent form and answer any questions. Then the RA will administer
      an eligibility screening to those who consent to participate. Eligible and consenting
      patients will identify a potentially eligible family caregiver. If the family caregiver is
      eligible and consents to participate, then the patient and caregiver will each complete a
      baseline phone assessment. Following baseline assessments, patient-caregiver dyads (N = 40
      dyads) will be randomly assigned in equal numbers to ACT or education/support using a
      stratified block randomization scheme to balance the groups by patient performance status
      (patient-reported Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] scores 0 or 1 vs. 2). Dyads in
      both study conditions will complete six weekly 50-minute telephone sessions with the first
      session occurring one week after baseline. For ACT participants, adherence to home practice
      during the past week will be assessed and recorded during each session. Feasibility will be
      examined via accrual, attrition, and adherence rates, and acceptability will be evaluated
      using a mixed methods approach (qualitative and quantitative). Blind interviewers will assess
      outcomes during follow-up phone assessments at 2 weeks and 3 months post-intervention.

    <time_frame>2 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Seven items are rated on 11-point scales (0=no interference to 10=extreme interference) that assess the extent to which fatigue in the past week interfered with general level of activity, ability to bathe and dress, normal work activity (including housework), ability to concentrate, relations with others, enjoyment of life, and mood. Higher scores indicate greater fatigue interference. This is the primary outcome for patients.</description>

    <time_frame>2 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Twelve items are rated on 5-point scales (0=never to 4=nearly always) that assess personal strain and role strain due to caregiving. Higher scores indicate greater caregiving burden. This is the primary outcome for caregivers.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PROMIS Sleep-Related Impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This 8-item measure assesses the perceived interference of sleep problems with activities, mood, and cognition (e.g., difficulty concentrating or completing tasks). Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much) with higher scores indicating greater sleep-related impairment. This is a secondary outcome for patients.</description>

    <measure>PROMIS Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This 6-item measure assesses participants' ability to participate in social roles and activities. The items measure difficulty engaging in social and recreational activities as well as usual work (including housework). Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (never) to 5 (always) and is reverse coded such that a higher score indicates greater ability to participate in activities. This is a secondary outcome for both patients and caregivers.</description>

    <measure>Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II</measure>

    <description>This 7-item measure assesses psychological flexibility, or the ability to fully experience the present moment while persisting in actions aligned with personal values. Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (never true) to 7 (always true). Higher scores indicate greater levels of psychological inflexibility. This is a secondary outcome for both patients and caregivers.</description>

    <description>Across six weekly 50-minute sessions, advanced GI cancer patients and caregivers will practice various mindfulness exercises, clarify their values, and set specific goals in alignment with their values. Through in-session and home practice of skills, participants will learn new and more adaptive ways to respond to unwanted internal experiences (e.g., fatigue, distress). Participants will receive handouts on session topics and a CD that we developed to guide mindfulness practices.</description>

    <description>Across six weekly 50-minute sessions, advanced GI cancer patients and caregivers will be directed to resources for practical and health information and contact information for psychosocial services. Sessions will include an orientation to the patient's medical center and treatment team, education regarding common quality-of-life concerns experienced by cancer patients and caregivers, and an overview of medical center and community resources for addressing these concerns. The therapist will also describe resources for addressing financial concerns and methods of evaluating health information available via the Internet and other modalities. Participants will receive handouts summarizing session topics and will be asked to review them as homework.</description>
