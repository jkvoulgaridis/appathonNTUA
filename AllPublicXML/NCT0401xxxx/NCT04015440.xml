  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how people respond on a word completion task relates to
      how they behave and respond to situations in the real world. This is a two part research
      study. At time-point one, participants will fill out some brief personality surveys. They
      will also read several short scenarios and imagine how they would react and/or interpret
      these situations in real life. They will also complete a vocabulary task where they will sort
      word fragments based on type as quickly as they are able. Participants will be asked to
      return in 24-96 hours for part two where they will repeat a similar scenario reading activity
      as during time one and fill out a brief questionnaire about your recent behaviors.

    <intervention_model_description>This is an online study. Volunteer assignment to each of the two experimental conditions is semi-randomized (i.e. random except that computer ensure equal sample sizes across experimental conditions). The randomized assigning of participants is done by the study web-page/program at volunteerscience.com. The computer program randomly assigned volunteers to one of the two conditions when they begin the study.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Angry Cognitions Scale/HAB measure: This measure asks respondents to read hypothetical scenarios and indicate how they would interpret and respond to them. It was developed by Martin and Dahlen (2007) and will be used as a measure of HAB. Responses range from very unlikely to very likely (numerically, 1-5). Scoring requires converting responses to the corresponding number, and summing responses for each of the following six subscales: misattributing causation, catastrophic evaluating, overgeneralizing, demandingness, inflammatory labeling, and adaptive (i.e., each question corresponds to a different subscale).</description>

    <measure>anger</measure>
    <time_frame>24-96 hours post HBMT</time_frame>
    <description>Trait Anger Scale: Brief measure of trait anger validated by Wilk et al., (2015). Scale (1-5, strongly disagree to strongly agree); Two questions regarding individual's perspective on their anger.</description>

    <measure>aggression</measure>
    <time_frame>24-96 hours post HBMT</time_frame>
    <description>State Aggression Survey: This survey is adapted from several others in the literature to measure variance along the normal spectrum of aggressive behaviors in daily life that the average person might display (Álvarez-García, et al., 2016; Deffenbacher, et al., 2001; Deffenbacher, J. et al., 2002). The survey specifically asks about driving behaviors (e.g., yelling at other drivers), and public online behaviors (e.g., posting mean comments on social media), as well as generic public displays of aggression items (e.g., Gotten angry and slammed a door). Scoring 1-5 (frequency: never - five or more times) per question.</description>
