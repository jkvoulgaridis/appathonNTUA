    <textblock>
      This study looks at the way a new medicine tablet called semaglutide moves in and throughout
      the body over time. It will also look at if the medicine is safe and the body can accept it.
      The new medicine is planned to treat diabetes. The aim of the study is to see how semaglutide
      tablets work in healthy people who are Chinese. Participants will either get oral semaglutide
      tablets or placebo (dummy) tablets - which treatment is decided by chance. The tablet form of
      semaglutide is a new medicine that cannot be prescribed. Doctors can prescribe semaglutide as
      an injection only. It is for the treatment of diabetes in some countries. Participants will
      get 1 tablet per day for 12 weeks (84 days). Participants will get 1 tablet a day to take
      with up to half a glass of water (maximum 120 mL). Participants must take the tablet first
      thing in the morning on an empty stomach (water is allowed until 2 hours before taking the
      tablet). After taking the tablet, participants must not eat or drink anything for at least 30
      minutes. After 30 minutes, they can have their first meal of the day and take any other
      medicines they may need, such as birth control tablets, routine vitamins and use of
      paracetamol at times.
