  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major abdominal surgery continues is one of the most performed surgical procedures in the
      world, both electively and urgently. One of the main problems of this type of intervention is
      postoperative pain. it is shown that it increases health costs related to longer recovery
      times, longer hospital stay and related complications such as the increased risk of
      presenting chronic POP pain, which it has been estimated up to 20%, much higher if the
      surgery involves surgery in the gastrointestinal system.

      The goal of analgesia in the postoperative setting is precisely to provide comfort to
      patients, minimize adverse effects and complications arising from the procedure.

      The epidural analgesic technique (has been proposed as an analgesic management standard,
      since multiple studies have shown that it reduces opioid consumption, improves recovery and
      is a useful strategy for pain control. However, it is an invasive technique, with risk of
      complications such as hematomas and epidural abscesses, and it may be difficult to perform.

      Currently it has been shown in multiple studies that the intravenous infusion of a local
      anesthetic, such as lidocaine, in this type of surgical scenarios can reduce the intensity of
      pain, opioid consumption, hospital stay and ileus with few adverse effects. In addition,
      these studies propose that, being a less invasive technique, it could be easier to implement
      and even be safer than the epidural technique.

      The main hypothesis of this study is precisely that the infusion of lidocaine may be
      non-inferior to epidural analgesia in the analgesic management of patients undergoing major
      abdominal surgery.

    <intervention_model_description>All patients who accept participation in the study and meet all inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned at the time of anesthetic induction. The assignment to the group of epidural analgesia vs IV lidocaine will be 1: 1 randomly using permuted blocks generated by a computer operated by an external assistant to the investigation. The size of the blocks will be variable between 4, 6, and 8, and will be kept confidential to guarantee the concealment of the groups.</intervention_model_description>
    <primary_purpose>Treatment</primary_purpose>
    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>The masking process will be done as follows:
Masking of the data collection and analysis staff: The investigative staff who performs the data collection and who evaluates the outcomes after the anesthetic act, will not have information about the intervention received by the patient. Those who participate in the data analysis phase will also be blind to the intervention.
For practical and ethical point of view, it is not possible to mask the doctors who perform the intervention and neither the patients. A &quot;SHAM&quot; or simulated intervention is not possible given that this would require an unnecessary invasive procedure that would not be used, which would make it ethically questionable.</masking_description>

    <description>The placement of the thoracic epidural catheter will be located depending on surgical incision as follows:
Surgery of the upper abdomen: T7-T8.
Surgery of lower abdomen: T8-T9. The epidural catheter placement technique will be determined by the treating anesthesiologist. However, once the epidural space is located and the respective catheter is inserted, the correct location of the catheter should be tested with lidocaine at 2% CE 5 cc and a sensitivity test with temperature should be performed on the target dermatomes. A negative test for an adequate location of the catheter indicates that the procedure should be repeated until the epidural space is correctly located. Once this is achieved, the catheter will be left 4 cm away from the skin. The catheter will be fixed according to the institutional protocol.</description>
