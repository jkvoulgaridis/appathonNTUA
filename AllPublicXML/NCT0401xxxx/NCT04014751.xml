  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a quality improvement study that aims to improve on the timely identification and
      management of symptoms and supportive care needs in patients with cancer. The study will be
      evaluating the relative success of an existing on-line patient-reported symptom and needs
      assessment, and then the implementation and use of an updated version of the symptom and
      needs assessment with Northwestern Medicine (NM) cancer patients. It also aims to evaluate
      the impact of the symptom and needs assessment system on healthcare delivery and quality of
      care. Participants who complete the symptom and needs assessment as part of their usual care
      are invited to participate in the study by agreeing to complete an on-line survey (at 3
      different time points) that asks about quality of life, adverse symptoms related to cancer
      and cancer treatment, patient experiences with their cancer care team, and the healthcare
      services they have received. Patients may also be invited to participate in a one-time
      interview or focus group about patient experiences with the symptom and needs assessment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients' under-identified symptoms and concerns can result in treatment interference,
      poor care satisfaction, compromised health-related quality of life, and taxed healthcare
      systems. Cancer care organizations have emphasized the need for symptom assessment and
      management within quality cancer care delivery. We have leveraged health information
      technology to pilot and implement the Lurie Screening Initiative in the Robert H. Lurie
      Comprehensive Cancer Center (RHLCCC) within the Central region of Northwestern Medicine (NM).
      Following two pilot implementation projects, the screening initiative program is live in
      RHLCCC clinics. It allows patients to complete Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement
      Information System computer adaptive tests (PROMIS CATs) assessing depression, anxiety,
      fatigue, pain, and physical function, along with checklists of supportive care needs, within
      the electronic health record (EHR). Patients can do so at home via MyChart (a patient portal
      of their EHR) or in clinic via an EHR hyperlink. Assessment results immediately populate the
      EHR; severe symptoms and endorsed supportive care needs trigger notifications to clinicians
      (social workers, dieticians, oncologists &amp; oncology nurses) who can then make referrals and
      care decisions in real time.

      This study will expand and evaluate implementation of the screening initiative via these
      aims:

      Aim 1. Evaluate the impact of system-wide implementation of the program on patient and system
      outcomes over 12 months via (a) a quality improvement study (estimated n=4,000 cases) to
      compare the impact of the program (versus usual care) on EHR-documented health care usage and
      patient satisfaction using a stepped wedge design in which clusters of study sites will
      gradually be assigned to cross from serving as a control to implementing the program and (b)
      a human subjects substudy (n=1,000) with patients who will complete the symptom monitoring
      and other patient-reported outcomes (PRO) measures of health care usage and satisfaction at
      baseline, 6 &amp; 12 months. We will examine differences in PROs between participants whose
      screening responses trigger clinical alerts and those who do not. We will also explore
      longitudinal trajectories of PRO scores

      Aim 3. Identify implementation facilitators and barriers to system-wide expansion of the
      program. We will conduct qualitative research to gather feedback from patients participating
      in the program expansion (n=50). This will include multiple assessments throughout
      implementation.

    <description>Quality of life will be assessed using a brief, validated 7-item patient-reported questionnaire (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General 7-item or FACT-G7) that asks about symptoms of fatigue, pain, and nausea, sleep quality and contentment with life.</description>

    <description>Symptom severity will be assessed via a Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer adaptive test (CAT) that will ask about depression, anxiety, pain, fatigue, and physical functioning. CAT items are dynamically selected for administration from an item bank based upon the respondent's previous answers. Patient usually completes 4-12 items with a high level of measurement.</description>

    <description>This cohort will include up to1,050 cancer patients being seen at regional Northwestern Medicine (NM) cancer centers for their cancer care. Patients who have recently completed an on-line, EHR-integrated patient-reported symptom and needs assessment as part of their regular care will be invited to complete a survey at baseline, 6- and 12-months targeting the assessment of their symptoms, healthcare experiences and utilization. Patients may also be invited to participate in a one-time interview or focus group designed to help study investigators better understand the value of the symptom and needs assessment from the patient perspective.</description>

    <intervention_name>Symptom Monitoring Intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>This study involves a cancer care delivery process improvement component where all cohort participants, at specified timepoints, are assessed for psychological distress, pain, fatigue, physical function, practical and supportive needs, and dietary and nutritional needs. Patients with severe elevations in psychological distress, physical symptoms or those who endorse supportive care and/or dietary needs are triaged in real time to appropriate providers within the health system (i.e., social work, nursing pool, nutrition services) to address elevated scores and/or stated needs. As such, within the context of this process improvement care delivery project, real time referrals function as interventional processes within the health system to route patients to relevant points of care based on their needs.</description>
