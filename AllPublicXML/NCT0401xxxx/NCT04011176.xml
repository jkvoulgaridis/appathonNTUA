  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the efficacy of standard pain treatment and placebo (a microcurrent faux
      treatment) as opposed to standard pain treatment and microcurrent therapy in any primary care
      patients over a three month period.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is not intended to be definitive and should be considered an exploratory
      randomized trial to determine conditions for which microcurrent is more effective. Thus,
      extensive subgroup analyses will be performed so that definitive trials can be developed.
      This is a single-blind study where subjects will not know if they are receiving microcurrent
      treatment.

    <description>PROMIS measures provide a common metric: the T-score (mean = 50, standard deviation = 10). In most cases 50 equals the mean in the U.S. general population.

    <description>MYMOP measures the outcomes that the patient considers the most important.The patient chooses one or two symptoms that they are seeking help with, and that they consider to be the most important. They also choose an activity of daily living that is limited or prevented by this problem. These choices are written down in the patient's own words and the patient scores them for severity over the past week on a seven-point scale. Lastly wellbeing is scored on a similar scale.
