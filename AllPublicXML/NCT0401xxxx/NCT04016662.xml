    <textblock>
      A multi-center, randomized, crossover trial consisting of three sequential 12-week periods,
      with the HCL feature used during one period, the PLGS feature used during one period and SAP
      therapy (control) during one period. The crossover trial will be preceded by a run-in phase
      in which participants will receive training using the study devices (Dexcom G6 and Tandem
      t:slim X2 pump). After the last crossover period, participants will be given the opportunity
      to use study devices for an additional 12 weeks to assess preference of system use (PLGS, HCL
      or SAP) and associated characteristics, durability and safety in a more real-world setting
      with less frequent study contact.

    <textblock>
      Automated insulin delivery (AID) technologies hold the promise of optimizing glycemic control
      and reducing the burden of diabetes care for patients with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). However,
      clinical trials of lower burden AID technologies have not included older adults in sufficient
      numbers to allow for focused evaluation of efficacy and quality of life (QOL) impacts that
      may differ from those observed in younger age groups. Most notably, primary endpoints have
      focused on reducing hyperglycemia, while avoidance of hypoglycemia is of upmost concern for
      older adults with T1D. T1D Exchange clinic registry data have shown severe hypoglycemia (SH)
      occurs more commonly in older adults with longstanding T1D than in younger individuals with
      events occurring just as often with HbA1c levels &gt;8.0% as with HbA1c levels &lt;7.0%. These data
      do not support the strategy of &quot;raising the HbA1c&quot; as being an effective approach for
      hypoglycemia prevention in older adults with T1D. In addition to acutely altered mental
      status, hypoglycemia is associated with an increased risk for falls leading to fractures, car
      accidents, emergency room (ER) visits, hospitalizations, and mortality resulting in
      substantial societal costs. The occurrence of hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia unawareness and fear
      of hypoglycemia have adverse effects on overall QOL of both individuals with T1D and their
      families.

      While continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology alone has the potential to be beneficial
      in reducing hypoglycemia in older patients, our preliminary data from the Wireless
      Innovations for Seniors with Diabetes Mellitus (WISDM) trial shows a majority of patients
      still have frequent hypoglycemia even when using CGM. Thus, knowledge of CGM alone may not be
      sufficient to avoid hypoglycemia in this population. Predictive low-glucose suspend
      algorithms have particular promise when the primary goal is hypoglycemia avoidance rather
      than glucose reduction. Whether the added complexity of closed loop systems provides
      additional glycemic benefit is not known. There is a critical need to determine whether
      automated insulin delivery can reduce hypoglycemia in the older adult population with T1D.

    <description>The system components include the t:slim X2 with Control-IQ Technology and the Dexcom CGM G6. The modular control algorithm has a safety supervision module that limits insulin delivery to prevent hypoglycemia at all times. The algorithm gradually decreases hyperglycemia from bedtime to reach a target of 120 mg/dL by waking time. During awake hours, the control algorithm attempts to maintain glucose within a target range (112.5 to 160 mg/dL) with meal time insulin boluses delivered based on usual bolus procedures undertaken by patients on an insulin pump (Hybrid closed loop).
The system components include the t:slim X2 with with Basal-IQ Technology and the Dexcom CGM G6. The PLGS System is able to stop and resume basal insulin delivery automatically in response to predicted or low sensor glucose values, thereby reducing the incidence and duration of hypoglycemic episodes. The pump includes the hypoglycemia minimization strategy that will issue insulin delivery commands.</description>
