  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prevalence of depression shows great heterogeneity in patients with psoriasis. This could be
      explained by the psychometric properties of the questionnaires assessing depressive symptoms:
      these tests have not been developed in a context of dermatosis. The complaints and symptoms
      associated with psoriasis can be misidentified by questionnaires as a manifestation of
      depressive symptomatology and may overestimate depressive symptoms.

      In other diseases such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis, tools have been validated
      specifically to take into account these symptoms.

      The purpose of this study is to validate and compare assessment tools for depression in
      patients with psoriasis.

      The study does not modify the management of patients. Patients will be contacted by phone.
      The protocol, the modalities and the objectives of the study will be presented during a first
      telephone interview. A second telephone interview will be scheduled with the patient 3 days
      later for the collection of his informed consent, if he agrees to participate, and the
      completion of the questionnaires of the study. The online questionnaires will be sent by
      email during this call.

        1. Telephone interview (5 minutes) Presentation of the study. Schedule a telephone
           appointment 3 days later.

        2. Telephone interview (10 minutes) Collection of consent. Sociodemographic questionnaire:
           sex, age, marital status, level of education Medical questionnaire including the
           consumption of tobacco and alcohol, the collection of current treatments, their
           indications and their start dates.

           Semi-directed telephone interview to identify the presence of depressive or dysthymic
           disorders (MINI).

        3. mailing of the self-questionnaires (20 to 30 minutes) Medical questionnaire: duration of
           psoriasis, simplified index of psoriasis, presence of pruritus, pain EVA (cutaneous and
           articular), fatigue.

           Self-questionnaires BDI, PHQ9, IDS, QIDS, HADS assessing the intensity of depressive
           symptoms.

        4. Retest (10 minutes) Some patients will be offered to re-fill the self-questionnaires
           assessing the intensity of depressive symptoms 15 days after completion of the survey.
           All participants selected for the retest will not complete all questionnaires again: the
           questionnaires will be distributed among the patients. The retest requires 50 patients
           who declare themselves stable (identified by one item) for each questionnaire.
