      This retrospective study has a primary objective to estimate the incidence of NTRK gene
      fusion depending on the histological diagnosis. The tropomyosin receptor kinase (Trk)
      receptor family comprises 3 transmembrane proteins referred to as Trk A, B and C (TrkA, TrkB
      and TrkC) receptors that are encoded by the NTRK1, NTRK2 and NTRK3 genes, respectively. These
      receptor tyrosine kinases are expressed in human neuronal tissue and play an essential role
      in the physiology of development and function of the nervous system through activation by
      neurotrophins. Gene fusions involving NTRK genes lead to transcription of chimeric Trk
      proteins with constitutively activated or overexpressed kinase function conferring oncogenic
      potential. These genetic abnormalities have recently emerged as targets for cancer therapy,
      because novel compounds have been developed that are selective inhibitors of the
      constitutively active rearranged proteins. Developments in this field are being aided by next
      generation sequencing methods as tools for unbiased gene fusions discovery. However, the
      incidence of NTRK aberrations in solid tumors is unknown as well as the natural history of
      NTRK-rearranged tumors This study will provide better knowledge of NTRK gene fusion incidence
      to allow recommendations for pathological diagnosis.

        who have received at least one systemic anti-cancer therapy for advanced disease and for
        which there is available both outcome information and tumor material.
