  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alopecia areata (AA) is a common autoimmune disease that results in loss of body hair in
      varying degrees. The condition is estimated to affect more than 6.5 million people in the
      United States alone (naaf.org), with a worldwide prevalence of 0.1% to 0.2% and calculated
      lifetime risk of 2%. AA is the most common form of the disease, in which areas of complete
      hair loss arise within normal hair-bearing skin. Other forms include alopecia totalis (AT),
      characterized by total loss of scalp hair, and alopecia universalis (AU), characterized by
      complete loss of body hair. AA and its variants can have devastating effects on patients'
      quality of life and social functioning. At present, curative therapy for AA does not exist.
      Therapeutic options are currently very limited, such as intralesional injections of
      glucocorticoids and induction of allergic contact dermatitis. These therapies are not
      effective for many patients and are generally impractical for patients with diffuse AA, AT or
      AU. Recently, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors were effective for the treatment of severe AA.
      However, for those patients who do respond, relapses are common after discontinuation of
      treatment, due to the existing of autoimmune memory T cells. Stem Cell Educator (SCE)
      therapy, which uses only autologous mononuclear cells that are externally exposed to cord
      blood stem cells, has previously been proven safe and effective in subjects for the
      improvement of type 1 diabetes (T1D), T2D and other autoimmune diseases such as alopecia
      areata. Minoxidil is the FDA approved drug for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia (AGA)
      in 1988. This trial will explore the therapeutic potential of Stem Cell Educator therapy for
      the treatment of AA in combined with oral minoxidil.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult patients ( 18 years)

          2. Must have a clinical diagnosis of AA, at least 50% hair loss involving the scalp

          3. For cases in which there is 80% or more scalp hair loss, the duration of the severity
             of hair loss must be 10 years or less

          5. Patients must not have received any treatments known to affect AA within 2 months of
