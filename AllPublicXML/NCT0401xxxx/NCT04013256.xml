  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the health effects of dermal and inhalational exposure to thirdhand
      cigarette smoke to those of inhalational exposure to secondhand cigarette smoke in healthy,
      adult nonsmokers. Our hypothesis is that dermal exposure increases exposure to the tobacco
      specific carcinogen, NNK and may affect both endothelial function and epidermal integrity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirdhand cigarette smoke is the smoke chemicals that persist in the environment after
      smoking. Indoors, they can be found both on surfaces and in the air. Thirdhand smoke derives
      from secondhand smoke and contains the chemicals that stick to surfaces, are re-emitted into
      the air and that form by chemical reactions both on surfaces and in the air.

      Thirdhand smoke can contain higher concentrations of the tobacco-specific nitrosamine and
      known carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) than secondhand smoke,
      because nicotine reacts to form NNK in the indoor environment. Dermal exposure to thirdhand
      smoke includes nicotine, NNK and other tobacco-specific nitrosamines, polycyclic aromatic
      hydrocarbons, and volatile organic compounds. Inhalational exposure to thirdhand smoke
      includes nicotine, ultrafine particles and volatile organic compounds. Previous studies have
      shown that inhalational exposure to secondhand cigarette smoke causes endothelial
      dysfunction, which is a risk factor for heart disease and heart attacks.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, caused by pollution exposures, measured by ultrasound</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (before exposure) 30 minutes (after 30 minutes exposure) and 3 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>High-resolution ultrasound of right brachial artery is performed 1 cm distal to antecubital fossa with a 10 megahertz (MHz) linear array probe coupled to a General Electric (GE) Vivid 7 Imaging System. To assess endothelium-dependent dilation, after recording baseline B-mode ultrasound images of the brachial artery and spectral Doppler images of flow velocity, a forearm cuff is inflated to 250 mmHg for 5 minutes to induce reactive hyperemia. Immediately after deflation, Doppler images are obtained to measure reactive hyperemia. FMD of brachial artery will be determined every 15 seconds between 30 and 120 seconds after cuff deflation to capture maximal dilation.The % FMD will be calculated as ratio between the maximum post cuff release brachial artery diameter and baseline diameter. By comparing changes in FMD before exposure, after exposure and next day, we will be able to assess effects of exposure on endothelial function and the potential recovery from these effects.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in trans-epidermal water loss caused by pollution exposures, comparing intact skin to tape-stripped skin</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 30 minutes, 3 hours, 2 days, 5 days</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) on the volar forearm using a dermal relative humidity monitor (model IP52, Delfin Technologies Inc.) on adjacent circles of intact skin and skin that has been tape stripped prior to exposure. By comparing changes in TEWL at these two sites, before and after exposure and at day 2 and day 5, we will be able to detect any effects of dermal cigarette smoke exposure on skin barrier function and the rate of barrier function recovery.</description>
