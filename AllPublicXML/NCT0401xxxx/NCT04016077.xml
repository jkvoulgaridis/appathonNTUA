  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the effect of hepatic impairment on the
      pharmacokinetic(s) (PK) of PF-06651600 following administration of multiple once daily doses
      of PF-06651600. The safety and tolerability of PF-06651600 will also be evaluated in this
      study.
