    <textblock>
      This study develops an initial prototype of a mobile tool that will support
      clinician-directed behavioral/organizational skills treatment for adolescents with Attention
      Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) with input guided from key stakeholders.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common childhood mental
      health disorders, affecting 7-9% of children and adolescents, and leading to substantial
      impairment in adolescence. Despite evidence suggesting that behavioral interventions are
      efficacious, approximately 40-60% of adolescents receiving behavioral treatment show little
      to no improvement and skills are rarely generalized beyond treatment sessions. Lack of
      adolescent motivation and engagement, between-session skills use, reward saliency, and family
      involvement are key contributors to these limited effects. Mobile digital health (dHealth)
      strategies and gamification techniques, offer unique opportunities for overcoming the
      barriers of treatments specific to ADHD by using interactive tools to reinforce in-vivo skill
      practice, providing opportunities for immediate reinforcement, and motivating adolescents
      with digital rewards. The primary goal of this study is to develop and preliminarily test the
      integration of a digital health tool into organizational/behavioral skills treatment for
      adolescents with ADHD by improving executive functioning skills, providing in-vivo skills
      reinforcement, and monitoring adolescents' skill utilization. The proposed research will use
      an iterative stakeholder-centered design to develop, refine, and preliminarily test a novel
      digital health tool, applied as an adjunct to behavioral treatment for adolescents with ADHD
      (ages 11-15). This includes focus groups with key stakeholders and an open preliminary
      feasibility trial and usability testing. Data collected from focus groups will inform what
      content and features could be developed to overcome challenges to adolescent engagement and
      parent involvement. During the open trial (N=20) we will assess intervention feasibility,
      usability, and acceptability. During and after the clinical trial, we will collect continuous
      feedback from users on the usability and utility of the tool. At the end of this study we
      will complete debugging and programming to maximize usability before a future larger clinical
      trial.

    <measure>Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Rating Scales (VADRS) Parent Version</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline (month 0) to Post-Intervention (up to 12 weeks later)</time_frame>
    <description>The Vanderbilt scales are DSM-based with teacher- and parent-report forms (Wolraich et al., 1998, 2003). The 18 ADHD symptom items on the Vanderbilt have excellent internal consistency reliability, Cronbach's alpha &gt;.90, and high concurrent validity with other instruments (see Wolraich et al., 2003). Items are rated from 0 (Never) to 3 (Very Often) and the total ADHD severity score range from 0 to 54 with higher scores representing presence of greater parent-rated symptom severity. The present study will examine change in ADHD symptom severity from baseline/pre-intervention (month 0) to post intervention (up to 12 weeks later).</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline (month 0) to Post-Intervention (up to 12 weeks later)</time_frame>
    <description>The IRS (7-items) was developed to assess the areas of functioning that typically characterize youth with ADHD and is effective in discriminating between youth with and without ADHD (Fabiano et al., 2006). All items are rated from 0 (No Problem) to 6 (Extreme Problem), with higher scores indicating higher levels parent-rated of functional impairment. The present study will examine change in functional impairment levels from baseline/pre-intervention (month 0) to post intervention (up to 12 weeks later).</description>

    <measure>Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF 2) Parent Version</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline (month 0) to Post-Intervention (up to 12 weeks later)</time_frame>
    <description>The BRIEF is a 86-item measures of executive functioning abilities (Gioia et al., 2000) and generates two index scores: the behavioral regulation index and the metacognition index (MI), and eight clinical scales: Shift, Inhibit, Emotion Control, Initiate, Working Memory, Organization of Materials, Plan/Organize, and Monitor scales. Higher scale scores on the BRIEF represent greater severity of executive functioning difficulties. The present study will examine change in executive functioning from baseline/pre-intervention (month 0) to post intervention (up to 12 weeks later).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scales (RCADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline (month 0) to Post-Intervention (up to 12 weeks later)</time_frame>
    <description>The RCADS (Chorpita et al., 2005) is a 47-item measure (in the public domain) that assesses adolescent-report of DSM-based anxiety and depression symptoms. The RCADS has been validated for use with students in 3rd through 12th grade. The RCADS has excellent reliability and validity in clinical and school-based samples (Ebesutani et al., 2010). Items are rated from 0 (Never) to 3 (Always), with higher scores indicating higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms. The present study will examine change in anxiety and depressive symptom severity from baseline/pre-intervention (month 0) to post intervention (up to 12 weeks later).</description>

    <measure>Behavioral Inhibition System/ Behavioral Activation System, BIS/BAS Scales</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline (month 0) to Post-Intervention (up to 12 weeks later)</time_frame>
    <description>The BIS/BAS Scales (Carver &amp; White, 1994; Pagliaccio et al., 2016) is a 24-item (includes 4 filler items) self-report measure of reinforcement/reward sensitivity rated on a four-point scale to assess theoretical concepts of BIS and BAS function and their roles in motivation, behavior, and affect. Specifically, items on BAS assess pursuit of appetitive goals, reward responsivity, tendencies to seek new, potentially rewarding experiences, and tendencies to act quickly towards goals. Items assessing BIS sensitivity focus more narrowly on concerns about possible negative/punishing events and sensitivity to the occurrence of such events. Higher scores on the BIS and BASC scales indicate greater sensitivity to rewards and punishments. The present study will examine change in reward and reinforcement sensitivity from baseline/pre-intervention (month 0) to post intervention (up to 12 weeks later).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1) Youth ages of 11-14 years (6-8th grade) that are attending a participating school

          -  2) referred by SMHP as a youth with apparent ADHD-related problems,

          -  3) ≥6 symptoms (item score ≥2) of Inattention or Hyperactivity-Impulsivity on the
             pooled parent and teacher Vanderbilt ADHD Rating Scale

          -  4) ≥3 on the Impairment Rating Scale by parent and teacher (cross-situational
             impairment)

          -  5) Parent consent and adolescent assent must be provided; b)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1) No presence of conditions that are incompatible with this study's treatment
             including: Parent or adolescent report of a prior diagnosis of either Autism Spectrum
             Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, a Dissociative Disorder, Severe visual or hearing
             impairment, severe language delay or intellectual impairment, or a Psychotic Disorder
             will be excluded. Rationale: Individuals with these disorders often have very
             dysregulated behavior and impairments that deviate from the focus of this study.

          -  2) Adolescent is in all-day special education classes or if core classes not in
             regular education classrooms. Rationale: The vast majority of adolescent with ADHD are
             served in regular education classrooms and students in full-day self-contained
             classrooms often have different challenges than students in regular education.

          -  3) Adolescent planning to change (start or stop) psychotropic medication. Note:
             Adolescents taking medication will be required to meet all entry criteria, including
             impairment criteria, thus indicating a need for the intervention. Adolescent taking
             medication for attention or behavior are eligible as long as their medication regimens
             are stable. Participating parents will also need to be able to read/speak English
             because all measures are in English, and the intervention will be conducted in
             English.
