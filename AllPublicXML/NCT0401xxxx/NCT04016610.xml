      To evaluate the safety, and efficacy of the ASR device for the temporary improvement in the
      appearance of a keloids. To demonstrate improvement in the keloid scars, without unexpected
      adverse events (UAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) directly attributable to the ASR
      device or treatment.
