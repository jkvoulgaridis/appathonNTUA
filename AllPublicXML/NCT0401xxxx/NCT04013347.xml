  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant radio-chemotherapy (NRCT) represents a milestone in the treatment of selected
      rectal tumours. Ideal time interval between the end of NRCT and surgery is still debated; a
      6-8 weeks time interval is considered optimal, but shorter or longer intervals have been
      associated with better oncological outcomes. Moreover, there is a lack of data about clinical
      postoperative outcomes and different time intervals after the end of NRCT. Here, effect that
      different time intervals have on postoperative complications with particular regard to the
      anastomotic dehiscence have been evaluated.

      Methods One hundred-sixty-seven patients underwent surgery after long-course NRCT. Three
      different time intervals were considered: (0-42; 43-56; &gt;57 days).

      Neoadjuvant radio-chemotherapy (NRCT) represents a milestone in the treatment of selected
      rectal adenocarcinoma. Even though a 6-8 weeks' time interval after the end of NRCT and
      surgery is considered ideal, the optimal time for surgery is still controversial.
