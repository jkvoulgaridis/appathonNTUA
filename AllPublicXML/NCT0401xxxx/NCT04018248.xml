  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, multi-center, open-label, FIH study comprising of 2 study parts (Phase Ia
      and Phase Ib).

      The Phase Ia (dose escalation) part of the study is designed to determine the safety,
      tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of
      BR101801 in patients with relapsed/refractory advanced hematologic malignancies except acute
      leukemia and multiple myeloma.

      The Phase Ib (dose expansion) part of the study is designed to assess tumor response and
      safety in specific advanced relapsed/refractory hematologic malignances at a dose of BR101801
      identified in Phase Ia.

      1. Phase Ia (Dose Escalation)

           Primary Objectives

             -  To assess the safety and tolerability of BR101801 in patients with
                relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma, CLL/SLL, and PTCL.

             -  To assess DLT and to determine the MTD and/or the RDE dose for BR101801 when
                administered orally on a daily schedule in 4-week cycles until disease progression.

           SecondaryObjectives

             -  To characterize the plasma and urine PK of BR101801.

             -  To assess the preliminary antitumor activity of BR101801.

        2. Phase Ib (Dose Expansion)

      Primary Objectives

      •To assess the safety and tolerability of BR101801 at the RDE dose in patients with relapsed
      and/or refractory B-cell lymphoma, CLL/SLL, and PTCL.

      SecondaryObjectives

        -  To assess clinical activity of BR101801 when administered orally on a daily schedule in
           4-week cycles until disease progression.

        -  To assess the plasma PK of BR101801

      OUTLINE: This is a Phase I, multi-center, open-label, FIH study. Safety monitoring committee
      (SMC) will be responsible for safety oversight.
