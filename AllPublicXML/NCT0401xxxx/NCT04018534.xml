    <textblock>
      This study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial on fixed orthodontic appliance
      candidates (n = 90) assigned into a control group (n = 30) and two different study groups (n
      = 30 in each). Patients who requiring non-extraction fixed orthodontic treatment, crowding
      under 5mm in the incisors and heaving at least 20 permanent teeth with healthy periodontal
      tissue and devoid of caries were included in the study. The control group received a standard
      printed educational material assisted with verbal information. The study groups either
      received video assisted or hands-on training about fixed orthodontic appliance and oral
      hygiene. The time requirements for all three educational interventions were recorded at the
      initial visit. The adequacy of oral hygiene is documented through plaque and gingival indices
      at the initial visit and 8th week of the treatment.

    <intervention_model_description>90 consecutive fixed orthodontic appliance treatment candidates in compliance with the above mentioned criteria were randomly assigned to 3 groups (n = 30 in each); Control group: The patients in control group received a standard printed educational material assisted with verbal information in accordance with BOS educational goals.
Study group 1: The patients in one of the study groups received a video assisted education .
Study group 2: The patients in other study group received a hands-on training.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Plaque index(PI) for oral health assessment.</measure>
    <time_frame>PI was measured at the 8 weeks later in each patient.</time_frame>
    <description>The brushing habits of the patients were checked at each appointment and were recorded with PI. This measurement of the state of oral hygiene by Silness-LÃ¶e plaque index is based on recording both soft debris and mineralized deposits on the following teeth.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gingival index(GI) for oral health assessment.</measure>
    <time_frame>GI was measured at the 8 weeks later in each patient.</time_frame>
    <description>This index was used to assess the severity and prevalence of gingivitis.Probe was used as a sensor for GI scoring and the mesial, distal, buccal and lingual surfaces of the teeth were evaluated in patients undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment.</description>

    <description>The video training consisted of two separate sessions, each one lasting 5 minutes, one about the treatment materials and the other about the oral hygiene successively and in compliance with the British Orthodontics Society (BOS) educational obligations. All of the candidates were allowed to rewind and watch the video presentation until they reach all of the educational goals. The accomplishment of the educational goals was documented through a written examination form filled in by the candidates themselves. All of the candidates have rated fullscore in the written examinations on both topics.</description>

    <description>The hands-on training consisting of two separate sessions was performed by one of the authors (E.A). The first is about the treatment materials and the second one is about the oral hygiene successively. They are in accordance with the British Orthodontics Society (BOS) educational obligations. All of the patients were allowed to ask questions freely until they reach all of the educational goals. The accomplishments of the educational goals were documented through a written examination form filled in by the candidates themselves. All of the candidates have rated fullscore in the written examinations on both topics. The time requirements for all three different educational interventions were recorded separately.</description>
