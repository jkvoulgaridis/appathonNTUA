      Despite demonstrated effectiveness, evidence based practices are not widely incorporated into
      existing residential and outpatient treatments. For implementation (and sustainment) of
      effective practices to be successful, it is critical that agencies be able to independently
      assess their own strengths and weaknesses and develop plans for organizational improvement.
      This application will extend scientific and field knowledge by providing a low-cost and
      sustainable alternative for improving agency preparedness for change.

      For implementation (and sustainment) of new interventions to be successful, it is critical
      that barriers are identified and addressed prior to change. It is challenging, however, for
      agencies to independently assess their own strengths and weaknesses and to develop plans for
      organizational improvement. Furthermore, the sheer number of strategies to promote
      implementation makes it difficult for agency leadership to decipher which are most
      appropriate for their own contexts and needs. This application proposes to develop and pilot
      test Mapping Approaches to Prepare for Implementation Transfer (MAP-IT), an organizational
      intervention that includes four key elements: (1) guidelines on forming an implementation
      workgroup to inform and promote implementation efforts, (2) instruction on mechanisms known
      to impact implementation, (3) tools and instruction for conducting an agency-driven diagnosis
      of potential implementation barriers, and (4) tools for developing an implementation
      blueprint to address identified barriers (including instruction on strategies for addressing
      potential barriers prior to implementation). The premise of this application is significant
      in that MAP-IT would provide a low-cost (agency-driven opportunity for deliberate
      implementation preparedness, without ongoing external coaching) and sustainable (skill
      development for multiple individuals within the organization that can be applied to future
      implementation efforts) alternative to promoting organizational adoption of new practices.
      The specific aims of the proposed research are as follows: Aim 1 - Synergistically integrate
      and adapt three established implementation intervention tools to promote deliberate agency
      implementation preparation - organizational assessment and feedback; taxonomy of
      implementation strategies; and visual-spatial decision making techniques - as combined into a
      comprehensive training and manualized bundle, MAP-IT. AIM 2 - Conduct a 2-arm cluster
      randomized efficacy trial of the MAP-IT intervention with 12 substance abuse treatment
      community-based residential and juvenile justice secure agencies serving adolescents
      (including those with opioid use disorders) randomized to either MAP-IT (EBP and MAP-IT
      trainings) or the non-intervention control condition (EBP training only). Successful
      completion of the aims is expected to (1) establish preliminary evidence for the efficacy of
      a low-cost, sustainable alternative for improving implementation preparation that agencies
      can use to support and expedite implementation transfer, (2) shift the current paradigm by
      encouraging researchers (designing uptake studies) and health care agencies (independently
      striving to implement new practices) to place greater emphasis on pre-implementation
      preparations for change, (3) provide an empirical examination of how exploration and
      preparation can support implementation, using established measurement platforms and
      theoretical frameworks, and (4) provide documentation of agency selection of implementation
      strategies for promoting change in real-world settings. Findings from the proposed R21 will
      inform intervention effectiveness testing and implementation strategy selection in a future
      R01 aimed at improving uptake of best practices within behavioral healthcare delivery
      services using a full-scale randomized control trial.
