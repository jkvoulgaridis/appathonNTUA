  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims at demonstrating the efficacy of self-modulated functional electrical
      stimulation (SM-FES) in promoting upper-limb (UL) motor recovery in chronic stroke patients
      with severe and severe-moderate paralysis.

      The effect of such experimental therapy will be compared to dose-matched, goal-oriented
      standard care (SC).

      SM-FES consists of intensive, goal-oriented, repetitive functional exercises assisted by
      electrical stimulation. The patient actively self-administers the electrical stimulation on
      the impaired limb by controlling the electrical stimulation device with the non-impaired
      hand.

      The duration of the intervention is 90 min per day, 5 days per week, for 2 weeks.

      After the informed consent process, each centre will screen potential participants according
      to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Each recruited participant will be randomly assigned to one group:

        -  experimental group - patients will receive self-modulated functional electrical
           stimulation SM-FES;

        -  control group - patients will receive standard care SC.

      This first main phase of the study includes 10 days intervention delivered to the two groups
      and assessments pre-intervention, post-intervention and after 3 months (follow-up).

      After the follow-up, participants initially recruited in the control group will be able to
      enter a secondary exploratory phase and receive further 10 days of treatment with SM-FES.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the motor part of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) scale, calculated from baseline to post-intervention (2 weeks)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to post-intervention (2 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The FMA-UE measures the upper limb motor impairment. FMA-UE consists of 33 items. Each item is scored on a 3-point ordinal scale (0, 1, and 2) with 0 generally corresponding to no function, 1 to partial function, and 2 to perfect function. The items are summed to the final maximal score of 66 (no impairment).The FMA may also be divided into shoulder/elbow and wrist/hand sub-scores consisting of 18 and 15 tasks, with a maximum score of 36 and 30, respectively. Higher scores indicate less impairment.</description>

    <measure>Change of upper limb function measured by the Action Research Arm test (ARAT) from baseline to post-intervention (2 weeks) and to 3 months follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to post-intervention (2 weeks) and to 3 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The ARAT measures of the upper limb function. It contains 19 items grouped into 4 subscales: grasp, grip, pinch and gross motor. In the first 3 subscales, the scale assessed the ability to grasp, move, and release objects of differing size, weight, and shapes. The last subtest evaluates 3 gross movements (place hand behind head, place hand on top of head, and move hand to mouth). Each item is graded on an ordinal scale from 0-3, all of which are summed to yield a score of 0 to 57. Higher scores indicate less impairment.</description>

    <measure>Change of perceived upper limb function measured by the Motor Activity Log (MAL) from baseline to post-intervention (2 weeks) and to 3 months follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to post-intervention (2 weeks) and to 3 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The MAL is a measure of perceived upper limb disability in activities of daily living.
The MAL-14 includes 14 items, scored on an 11-point amount of use (AOU) scale (range 0-5) to rate how much the arm is used and an 11-point quality of movement (QOM) scale (range 0-5) to rate how well patients are using their affected upper extremity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of hand and arm spasticity measured by the REsistance to PASsive movement (REPAS) from baseline to post-intervention (2 weeks) and to 3 months follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to post-intervention (2 weeks) and to 3 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The REPAS consists of several items across different defined joints, each of which are rated according to the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) (0 = no increase in muscle tone to 4 = limb rigid in flexion or extension), and includes assessments of the shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist, finger. A higher score indicates more severe impairment, with a maximum upper limb score of 64.</description>
