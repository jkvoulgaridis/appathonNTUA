  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet is effective in improving gastrointestinal
      symptoms, quality-of-life, intestinal inflammation and gut microbiota composition in
      mild-to-moderate UC compared to a standard omnivorous diet.

    <textblock>
      This study will review whether a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet is an optimal dietary therapy to
      achieve a clinical response in mild to moderate UC as an adjunctive treatment to current
      medical therapies. The proposed RCT will be used to evaluate the efficacy of a lacto-ovo
      vegetarian diet together with its effect on the microbiota to create an enhanced
      understanding of the role diet plays in the management of UC. Using a socially acceptable
      diet it is anticipated that food-related quality-of-life measures will improve for
      participants. Dietary modification could be a more economical, safer and more effective means
      of reducing symptoms and flare-ups compared to pharmacological therapy.

    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>A clinical response is defined as a decrease from baseline in the total Mayo score of at least three points, with an accompanying decrease in the subscore for rectal bleeding or at least 1 point or an absolute subscore for rectal bleeding of 0 or 1</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants achieving clinical remission at week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with changes to IBDQ score at week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Change in total score from baselines. IBDQ - normal quality of life score is 170 points (range 32 to 224) and a quality of life response is a change of 16 points.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participants Food related quality of life in IBD (Fr-QoL 29) score at week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Change in total score from baseline. Lowest score of 29 reflects poor quality of life, maximum score of 145 reflects highest quality of life score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants achieving a change in gut microbiome diversity at week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The gut microbiome will be examined using ITS2, 16S rRNA gene and metagenomics.</description>
