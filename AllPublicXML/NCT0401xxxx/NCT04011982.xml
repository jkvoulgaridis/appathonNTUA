    <textblock>
      PATAKESS is a monocentric non interventional cohort study (prospective (alive patients) and
      retrospective (dead patients with biological material from surgery and/or biopsies already
      collected)).

      PATAKESS consists of clinical and biological analyses of exocrine pancreatic tumors. Data are
      derived from tumor samples taken for routine health care purposes in patients managed at
      Centre Léon Bérard (Lyon-France) since January 2010. The main objective is to determine
      correlation between biological and clinical characterizations of patients suffering from
      exocrine pancreatic tumor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic adenocarcinoma cancer is an aggressive cancer which represents 95% of pancreatic
      cancer. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma cancer is one of the deadliest cancers (5th cause of death
      per cancer) ; it has a very poor prognosis: 5-year survival (regardless of all stades at
      diagnosis). Pancreatic adenocarcinoma cancer is characterized by early metastasis. Therefore,
      development of efficient systemic therapeutics is one of the keys to improving prognosis.
      Newly developed immune check-point inhibitors seem to have limited efficacy in pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma except for MSI‑H (Microsatellite instability-high) or dMMR (mismatch repair
      deficient)/MSI-H tumors.

      However, recent data suggest that immune surveillance could control metastatic dissemination
      of pancreatic adenocarcinoma cancer. Several studies showed strong interactions between
      pancreatic tumor cells and tumor stroma in metastatic dissemination and in resistance to
      conventional therapeutics. Many data about pancreatic primitive tumors from murine animals
      models are available ; however few data on tumor stroma and its interactions with tumor cells
      of metastasis from adenocarcinoma pancreas are available. Few data on correlation between
      molecular alterations types (mutations, deletions, amplifications) in pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma cells and tumor stroma characteristics (primitive and metastatic stroma (cells
      composition, immune infiltration)) are also available.

      In PATAKESS study, clinical and biological data are derived from tumor samples taken for
      routine health care purposes in patients managed at Centre Léon Bérard (Lyon-France) since
      January 2010.
