    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized, and controlled study to compare the effectiveness of PROKERA® SLIM
      plus standard of care (SOC) in the PROKERA® SLIM Arm to SOC alone in the Control Arm.
      Subjects presenting with moderate DED defined as corneal fluorescein staining score of ≥ 3
      points out of 9 will be recruited.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with moderate dry eye defined as corneal fluorescein staining score of ≥ 3

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Distance best corrected visual acuity better than 20/60 Snellen equivalent in each eye

          -  Willing to sign a written informed consent to participate

          -  Able to follow study instructions, with the intention of completing all required
             visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of persistent corneal epithelial defect or ulcer in either eye

          -  Presence of active ocular infection in either eye

          -  Presence of ocular inflammation that is not related to keratoconjunctivitis sicca,
             e.g., allergy, severe blepharitis

          -  Presence of other corneal disorder(s) that give rise to reduced corneal sensitivity,
             such as recurrent herpes keratitis

          -  Presence of corneal diseases other than dry eye that can disturb the pre-corneal tear
             film such as epithelial basement membrane dystrophy (EBMD)

          -  Contact lens wear

          -  History of recent ocular surgery/trauma, which could affect corneal sensitivity, e.g.,
             corneal transplantation, LASIK

          -  Presence of cicatricial ocular surface diseases

          -  A medical or ocular condition, or a personal situation, which in the principal
             investigator's opinion, is not appropriate for participation in the trial

          -  Any scheduled or planned ocular or systemic surgery or procedure during the study

          -  Pregnancy and women who are expecting to be pregnant.

          -  Current enrolment in another interventional drug or device study or participation in
             such a study within 30 days of anticipated entry into this study
