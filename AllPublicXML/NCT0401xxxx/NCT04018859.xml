  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP)
      in the treatment of mild to moderate eyebrow hypotrichosis.

      This is a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effect of autologous platelet rich plasma
      in subjects with mild to moderate eyebrow hypotrichosis. Approximately 40 subjects will be
      randomized to receive platelet-rich plasma (PRP) or saline injections. The study is designed
      as an 9-month study. This study was a pilot study designed to determine feasibility of this
      procedure.

      Subjects currently living in the Chicago metropolitan area and meet inclusion/exclusion
      criteria will be considered for enrollment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males or females 18-85 years old.

          2. Subjects are in good health as judged by the investigator.

          3. Patients with mild to moderate eyebrow hypotrichosis (modified GEyA grades of 3 and 4
             at the time of screening, see Appendix A).

          4. Those who have less eyebrows and therefore, desire to enhance eyebrows (modified GEyA
             grades of 3 and 4 at the time of screening, see Appendix A).

          5. Subjects who are willing and have the ability to understand and provide informed
             consent for participation in the study and are able to communicate with the
             investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with uncontrolled systemic disease (including alopecia areata or any other
             form of alopecia) which could inhibit hair growth

          2. Patients with thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction, hypofibrinogenemia, anemia,
             cancer, active infections with Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, or Enterococcus, history of
             trichotillomania, thyroid diseases, eye diseases, atopic dermatitis, seborrheic
             dermatitis, lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, leprosy, or syphilis.

          3. Patients who have started used agents that may affect eyebrow hair growth (e.g.
             minoxidil or bimatoprost) within 6 months of screening. Patients who have been using
             agents that may affect eyebrow hair growth for at least 12 months may be included if
             the patient agrees to continue their current dosing regimen for the duration of the
             study.

          4. Known disease, infection, or abnormality in the treatment area or hair shaft

          5. Patients with tattoos, scars, hyperpigmentation, or other features which could prevent
             accurate evaluation of hair growth in the eyebrow area.

          6. Evidence of another skin condition affecting the treatment area that would interfere
             with clinical assessments

          7. Unwilling to refrain from washing face or using face care products 24 hours before and
             after treatment visits

          8. History of a clinically significant hematologic disorder as determined by the
             investigator.

          9. Subjects currently receiving anticoagulant or anti-platelet therapy.

         10. Subject is known to be HIV positive.

         11. Known genetic disorders affecting fibroblasts or collagen, such as achondroplasia,
             osteogenesis imperfecta, etc.

         12. Pregnant or breast feeding

         13. Uncooperative patients or patients with neurological disorders who are incapable of
             following directions or who are predictably unwilling to return for follow-up
             examinations.

         14. Subjects who are unable to understand the protocol or give informed consent (including
             non-English speaking patients).
