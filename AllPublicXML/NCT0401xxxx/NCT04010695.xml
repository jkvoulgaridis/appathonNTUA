    <textblock>
      Cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study with up to 250 patient participants with a goal of
      obtaining 20 deficient and 20 intermediate samples. The clinic will recruit and consent study
      participants. Clinic staff will draw 3 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) whole blood
      tubes and obtain finger stick capillary blood. Clinic staff will perform the investigational
      Standard Diagnostics (SD) Biosensor point-of-care (POC) test for glucose-6-phosphate
      Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and a HemoCueÂ® hemoglobin test on finger stick capillary
      blood and on the EDTA anti-coagulated venous blood samples. Another EDTA anti-coagulated
      venous blood sample will be sent to a clinical laboratory improvement amendments
      (CLIA)-certified lab for G6PD reference testing by the gold standard assay: G6PD measurement
      by spectrophotometry; this sample will also have a hemoglobin measurement by a hematology
      analyzer. Individuals identified as G6PD deficient with the reference test will be notified
      of their results by the clinic and referred to their physician for follow-up.

      Objective To assess the accuracy of a POC G6PD test as compared to a reference assay in
      detecting G6PD activity

      Endpoints

        -  Sensitivity and specificity of SD Biosensor POC G6PD test compared to the Pointe
           Scientific test kit for identifying G6PD deficient individuals and women with
           intermediate G6PD activity

        -  Accuracy between the SD Biosensor POC G6PD test measure of G6PD activity and the Pointe
           Scientific test kit

        -  Accuracy between the SD Biosensor POC G6PD test measure of hemoglobin (Hb) and HemoCue
           201+, a point of care reference haemoglobin assay

        -  Comparison of the SD Biosensor POC G6PD test results for capillary and venous samples.

      Population 250 male and female participants 18-65 years of age presenting at the clinic for
      care. Individuals who have received a blood transfusion within the last 3 months, according
      to self-report, will be excluded.

    <intervention_name>STANDARD G6PD</intervention_name>
    <description>The STANDARD G6PD Analyzer is designed to measure the quantitative determination of total Hb concentration and G6PD enzymatic activity in fresh human whole blood specimens based on reflectometry assays. The test is intended to aid in the identification of people with G6PD deficiency. The test is currently not licensed for use in the US and is considered an investigational product. System components shall be labeled in accordance with regulatory requirements, including the following statement, &quot;For Investigational Use Only. The performance characteristics of this product have not been established.&quot;</description>
