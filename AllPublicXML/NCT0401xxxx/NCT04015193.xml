  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Raynaud's phenomenon is a vasospasm of the extremities, leading to extensive
      discomfort in daily life and potentially severe ischemia. Some patients are resistant to
      conventional vasodilatory drug treatment. In the University Medical Center Groningen,
      single-port thoracoscopic sympathicotomy (SPTS) was developed. This is a new minimally
      invasive endoscopic technique, extensively limiting surgical burden. In many hospitals in the
      Netherlands, this operation is sometimes performed on patients with Raynaud's phenomenon.
      However, the techniques used are more invasive than the SPTS technique. Furthermore, studies
      on sympathectomy and sympathicotomy in Raynaud's are limited and encompass obsolete more
      invasive techniques. Also, it is unclear which patients would benefit the most and for how
      long and in which percentage of patients treatment effects persist over time. In a recent
      study on the new SPTS technique, it was found that one month after the procedure, the
      Raynaud's attacks were substantially reduced and the hand perfusion increased on the operated
      side. Based on these short term effects and previously reported broad experience with this
      technique for other indications, it is possible to offer this option to a broader range of
      patients with Raynaud's as a reasonable and safe treatment option. However, whether the
      effects persist on the long-term needs to be established.

      Main research question: The aim of the study is to assess the 5 year efficacy and outcome in
      patients with primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon in whom SPTS has been performed.

      Design (including population, confounders/outcomes): Patients with Raynaud's, who will
      undergo SPTS in patient care setting, will be included. Data from the patient file will be
      collected, including vascular measurements to assess hand perfusion, a Raynaud diary (Raynaud
      condition score, duration and frequency of the attacks), quality of life questionnaires, and
      adverse events.
