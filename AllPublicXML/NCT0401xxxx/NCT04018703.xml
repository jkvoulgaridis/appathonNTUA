  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the delicacy and long duration of the procedure, ophthalmic surgery put forward higher
      requirements to anesthesia management:

        1. The patient with local anesthesia without sedation is in a state of awareness, which
           will cause intense stress resulting in increased blood pressure, heart rate, muscle
           tension and even sense of pain;

        2. Traction of extraocular muscles and eyeballs can induce oculocardiac reflex, followed by
           bradycardia, atrial or ventricular arrhythmia, conduction block, and even more worsen,
           life-threatening cardiac arrest may occur;

        3. With the increase in average life expectancy and the improvement of quality of life
           requirements, the number of elderly patients in ophthalmic surgery is also increasing.
           These elderly patients are often combined with hypertension, diabetes, etc. and
           decreased tolerance of with general anesthesia;

        4. For some retinal detachment surgery with difficulty in resetting, the patients will be
           required to change to the prone position immediately after surgery to improve the
           success rate of resetting. Conventional general anesthesia management are cumbersome and
           costly, which may not be likely to achieve the swift emergence.

      Nowadays, monitoring Anesthesia Care (MAC) has developed into a flexible and unique
      anesthesia technology combining intravenous anesthesia with regional block anesthesia. MAC
      provides reasonable balance between economy, comfort and safety, efficiency by continuous
      monitoring of changes in respiratory and circulatory system, during process of sedation and
      analgesia. Airway management will be another issue as surgeons operate on the side of head
      and face. Studies have shown that MAC can achieve adequate sedation and analgesia to decrease
      blood pressure, provide acceptable surgical fields and reduce adverse reactions such as
      perioperative stress, pain and anxiety. Meanwhile, MAC make patients comfortable enough to
      cooperate with the surgeons, easy to be awakened with relatively short operation duration and
      improvement of perioperative safety.

      The allocation sequence is generated by computer random number generation, and the allocation
      is placed in sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes by a non-investigator. Enrolment
      and data collection are performed by trained research staff who are not involved in the care
      of the patients. The treating clinicians are not possible to be blinded to the assignment
      group, but all other staff involved in both the collection and collation of data, and
      administration of neurocognitive testing, are blinded to group allocation.
