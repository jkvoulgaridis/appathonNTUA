  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to 2011 HAS recommendations, early detection of Alzheimer disease is the major
      objective in order to allow an earlier care and support. These recommendations strengthen
      general practitioner role, who plays a key role in the identification of cognitively impaired
      patients. HAS recommendations are the use of MMSE like test (Mini Mental State Examination)
      at general practitioner office. A self-screening test, without medical presence, would allow
      a self-administered cognitive assessment by the patient. A review of the literature about
      self-administered cognitive tests has been realized. The Self-Administered Gerocognitive
      Examination (SAGE) has been chosen. It is a brief, valid and reliable cognitive assessment
      tool, rated on 22 points, which allows an early detection of cognitive impairment, with a
      sensitivity close to the MMSE test. Nevertheless, SAGE has never been tested at home without
      medical supervision. In this study, the investigators will determine if SAGE scores at home
      correlates with MMSE scores at general practitioner office.

      Patients with inclusion criteria will be recruited during the general practitioner
      consultation and will have a clinical assessment included MMSE and clinical data collection.
      Then, SAGE will be given to the patient in order to be completed at home without medical
      supervision and send to the general practitioner.

    <description>The Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) is a widely used test of cognitive function among the elderly; it includes tests of orientation, attention, memory, language and visual-spatial skills. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or Folstein test is a 30-point questionnaire that is used extensively in clinical and research settings to measure cognitive impairment.</description>

    <description>SAGE test contains a series of questions that assess the cognitive functioning. Sage was developed by the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. it's an online, at-home, self-screening dementia tool that has been scientifically evaluated, and it's demonstrated good results in accurately identifying cognitive deficits.</description>
