Other important medical events which based on medical or scientific judgement may jeopardize the patients, or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the above</description>

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

             signing the ICF

          -  Study participants who are overtly healthy as determined by medical evaluation,
             including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and cardiac
             monitoring. In addition, elderly study participants must be considered to be in
             general good physical and mental health

          -  Study participants must have a body weight of at least 50 kg for males and 45 kg for
             females, and a body mass index within the range of 18 to 32 kg/m2 (inclusive)

             participate in this study, or a history of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder,
             bipolar disorder, or severe unipolar depression. The presence of potential psychiatric
             exclusion criteria will be determined based on the psychiatric history collected at
             Screening

          -  Study participant has history or presence of cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic,
             renal, gastrointestinal, endocrinological, hematological, or neurological disorders
             capable of significantly altering the absorption, metabolism, or elimination of drugs;
             constituting a risk when taking the study intervention; or interfering with the
             interpretation of data

             Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) at Screening

          -  Study participant has past or intended use of over-the-counter or prescription

          -  Study participant has any clinically relevant electrocardiogram (ECG) finding at
             Screening or at Baseline. Study participant has an abnormality in the 12-lead ECG
             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, increases the risks associated with
             participating in the study. In addition, any study participant with any of the
             following findings will be excluded: (a) QT interval corrected for heart rate using
             Bazett's formula (QTcB) or Fridericia's formula (QTcF) &gt;450 ms in study participants
             in 2 of 3 ECG recordings; (b) other conduction abnormalities (defined as PR interval
             ≥220 ms); (c) irregular rhythms other than sinus arrhythmia or occasional, rare
             supraventricular or rare ventricular ectopic beats. In case of an out of range result,
             1 repeat will be allowed. If out of range again, the study participant cannot be
             included
