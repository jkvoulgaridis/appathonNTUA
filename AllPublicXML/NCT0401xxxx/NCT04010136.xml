  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the last decades, the number of people living with chronic diseases had increased, mainly
      due to the aging of the population. Such chronic, progressive, life threatening and burdening
      diseases, play an important role in this new era of palliative care.

      Despite the growing scientific and social interest in palliative care, there is still a delay
      in the identification of patients with palliative care needs. This leads to a late
      integration in a palliative care network and consequent deprivation of the major advantages
      of an early and progressive integration.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of palliative care training and the use of a
      structured tool, in the identification of the elderly population in need of palliative care
      by family physicians. And also to conduct a prevalence study to further the knowledge about
      how many elder people in primary care have the need of a palliative care approach.

      The study consists of two phases:

        1. Randomized trial with General Practitioners (GP) to determine the role of two different
           training programs and a structured tool in the identification of geriatric patients with
           palliative care needs.

        2. Cross-sectional, analytical study of the prevalence and patterns of geriatric patients
           with Palliative Care (PC) needs, managed in primary care in Portugal's Center Healthcare
           Administrative Region.

    <intervention_model_description>The GPs (fellows and specialists) from Center Healthcare Administrative Region will be invited to take part in this trial. The invitations will be conducted with the help of the Center Healthcare Administrative Region and by spreading the invitation in some general practice professionals' mailing lists and online platforms.
First, GPs will be contacted and those who accept to participate will be randomized into one of the four-harm study groups - 1. Control Group, 2. Identification tool group, 3. Standard PC training, 4 - Clinical cases based PC training.
The accuracy on the identification before and after intervention will be compared within each group and between the four groups using a clinical record based identification tool (CCB-PCId).
A PC expert panel will build a tool, clinical record based, to evaluate the accuracy of palliative care needs identification.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Each GP will have to identify, before each intervention, from a set of fictitious clinical cases constructed for this purpose, which patients need palliative care. After each intervention, they will re-evaluate the same clinical cases and will be asked to identify again which patients need palliative care.
Each intervention will be measured according to the identification accuracy.</description>

According to previous reports , patients with palliative care needs will be defined as ≥2 positive general indicators or ≥1 positive disease-specific indicators in the SPICT.
Comparisons between two or more independent groups of quantitative variables will be performed using Pearson's Chi2 test or Fisher's exact test, analysis of variance (ANOVA) or non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test. All tests will be two-sided using a significance level of 0.05. Statistical analysis will be conducted using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) V.24.0 or higher.</ipd_access_criteria>
