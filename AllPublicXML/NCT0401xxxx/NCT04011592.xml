  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum depression is a non-psychotic major or minor depressive episode that occurs during
      pregnancy or within 12 months of post-partum period. The nature of symptoms is same as
      depressive episode characterized by depressed mood, anxiety, sleep difficulties, suicidal
      thoughts, tiredness and diminished interest in pleasurable activities. Severe maternal
      depression affects children by increasing the risk of emotional and behavioral and physical
      health problems and cognitive difficulties. Thus early screening and intervention is critical
      in reducing the negative impact of PND in the mother and child, family and the community.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics and antidepressant
      efficacy of sub-anesthetic dose of intravenous ketamine in perinatal depression.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in depressed mood as indicated by Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 24 hours post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) score ranges from 0-53. A score of 0-7 is generally accepted to be within the normal range (or in clinical remission), while a score of 20 or higher indicates at least moderate severity of depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change in Postnatal Depression as indicated by Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 24 hours post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score ranges from 0 to 30. Higher scores indicate worse outcome, with a score of 10 or greater indicating depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Anxiety as indicated by Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 24 hours post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7) Scale score ranges from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating greater anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Depression as indicated by Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 24 hours post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score ranges from 0 to 27, with greater scores indicating more severe depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Behavioral suicidal events (Suicidal Ideation), as assessed by the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 24 hours post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>The C-SSRS is a suicidal ideation and behavior rating scale with yes/no responses. The first part (Items 1-5) rates an individual's degree of suicidal ideation on a 0-5 scale, ranging from &quot;wish to be dead&quot; to &quot;active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent and behaviors&quot;. The C-SSRS outcomes are categories and have binary responses (yes/no). Suicidal ideation is considered when the patient responds a &quot;yes&quot; answer at any time during treatment to any one of the five suicidal ideation questions (Categories 1-5) on the C-SSRS. The sum of the 5 intensity item scores create a total score (range 0 to 25) to represent the intensity rating (higher scores indicate more severe suicidal ideation).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Behavioral suicidal events (Suicidal Behavior), as assessed by the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 24 hours post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>The questions 6-10 of the C-SSRS are related to suicidal behavior, and the outcome is a simple yes/no response. Suicidal behavior occurs if the patient answers a &quot;yes&quot; at any time during treatment to any one of the five suicidal behavior questions (Categories 6-10) on the C-SSRS.</description>
