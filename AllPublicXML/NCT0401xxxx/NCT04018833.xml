      PURPOSE: To evaluate the efﬁcacy of switching from bevacizumab to ranibizumab (Lucentis;
      Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) or aflibercept (Eylea; Regeneron, Tarrytown, NY) in eyes
      with diabetic macular edema (DME) nonresponders to bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech, South San
      Francisco, CA).

      METHODS: Single-center retrospective comparative study of patients with DME unresponsive to
      intravitreal bevacizumab that were switched to ranibizumab or aflibercept. Best-corrected
      visual acuity and central foveal thickness will be analysed prior to and 3 months after the
      switch. OCT biomarkers will also analyzed.

      A p value of 0.05 or less will be considered to be statistically significant. HYPOTHESIS:
      Patients will improve anatomically and functionally after switch.

    <time_frame>Immediately before switch (one month after last bevacizumab intravitreal injection); 4 months after switch. Minimum of three intravitreal injections before and after switch.</time_frame>
    <description>The central foveal thickness (CFT), measured by Optical Coherence Tomography, was automatically measured by the software in the central 1 mm. A CFT &lt;250 µm or &gt;300 µm is considered pathological. A CFT between 200 and 300 µm is considered physiological. CFT has no defined minimum or maximum values.
Since patients with diabetic macular edema usually have CFT &gt;300 µm the goal of treatment is to lower the CFT to values between 200 and 300 µm. A clinical significant anatomical improvement was considered for a change in CFT≥10%.</description>

    <measure>Functional change</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before switch (one month after last bevacizumab intravitreal injection); 4 months after switch. Minimum of three intravitreal injections before and after switch.</time_frame>
    <description>Functional change was measure by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Scale (ETDRS) which measures the best-corrected visual acuity with an ETDRS-like chart at 4 meters in number letters or at 1 meter when patients are unable to read any letters on the ETDRS chart at 4 meters. The ETDRS scale varies from 1 to 85 letters (85 letters correspond to a 20/20 in the Snellen scale).
The higher the value the better the outcome. A clinical significant functional improvement was considered for a gain of ≥5 EDTRS letters.</description>

        All patients followed on the ocular diabetes consultation of Centro Hospitalar
        Universitário do Porto, Portugal, with DME unresponsive or incompletly responsive to
        intravitreal bevacizumab (1,25 MG/0.05 ML).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus patients

          -  older than 18 years

          -  with center-involved DME, defined as central subfield thickness (CST) of more than 300
             µm on spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT).

          -  nonresponsive to bevacizumab, deﬁned as having persistent intraretinal and/or
             subretinal fluid on optical coherence tomography (OCT), i.e CSF&gt;300µm after a minimum
             of 3 monthly injections, 4 months before switch, regardless of visual acuity (VA).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  additional ocular diseases that could significantly affect the visual acuity such as:

          -  significant vitreoretinal interface abnormality on SD-OCT that may contribute to
             macular edema

          -  age-related macular degeneration

          -  retinal vascular occlusion

          -  central corneal opacity
