  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goals of this study are to 1) assess awareness of interest in the use of
      pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in Croatia and Slovenia, countries in Central Europe
      with very high smoking prevalence, and 2) investigate whether cytisine is at least as
      feasible and effective as varenicline in helping smokers to quit in a real-life setting:
      family medicine practices in Croatia and Slovenia. The investigators propose to survey
      patients from 40 primary care practices (20 in Croatia and 20 in Slovenia) to assess desire
      to quit smoking and awareness and interest in pharmacotherapy. Additionally, 380 patients
      with interest in quitting smoking will be randomly assigned to use varenicline or cytisine to
      help quit smoking.

      The investigators hypothesize that cytisine is at least as feasible and effective as
      varenicline in helping smokers from primary care practices in Croatia and Slovenia to quit
      smoking.

    <description>Varenicline treatment will start one week prior to the patient's target quit date at 0.5 mg/day for days 1-3, 0.5 mg twice daily for days 4-7. On the target quit date (day 8), the dose will be increased to 1 mg twice daily and maintained for day 8-week 12. Patients will receive weekly calls during the first 4 weeks and at weeks 8, 12, and 24 to inquire about medication adherence and smoking status, motivate the patient to take the medication, encourage them not to smoke, and ask about possible side effects or other issues.</description>
