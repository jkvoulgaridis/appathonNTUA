  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the separate and combined effects of a high-protein
      (HP) diet and resistance training (RT) on body composition and potential biological
      moderators of body weight in men and women &gt;50y. All participants will receive dietary
      physical activity guidance through our in-person, group-based weight loss program, State of
      Slim (SOS). These participants will be randomized to receive either a counseling-based HP
      diet plan or RT plan. Body composition assessments at 8 wk will identify responders and
      non-responders; the latter will be re-randomized to &quot;augment&quot; (HP: add protein supplements;
      RT: supervise RT) or &quot;combine&quot; (HP with protein supplements + supervised RT).

    <description>16 week weight loss program with high protein diet Approximate macronutrient distributions (carbohydrate:protein:fat) will be 32%:40%:28%. Because this protocol uses a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design, response will be assessed after 8 weeks. Non-responders will be randomized to either combine the diet with resistance training counseling or add a protein supplement.</description>

    <description>16 week weight loss program with normal protein diet and resistance training counseling. Approximate macronutrient distributions (carbohydrate:protein:fat) will be 53%:21%:25%. Because this protocol uses a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design, response will be assessed after 8 weeks. Non-responders will be randomized to either combine resistance training with a high-protein diet or add supervised sessions with a personal trainer (2 days per week) to the resistance training regimen.</description>
