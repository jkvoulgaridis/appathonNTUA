  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will determine the independent and combined effects of high intensity interval
      training and time-restricted eating on blood sugar regulation among women in reproductive-age
      who have overweight or obesity. The intervention period will be seven weeks. Before and after
      the intervention, blood sugar regulation, body composition and physical fitness will be
      measured and compared between groups who are doing either high intensity interval training,
      time-restricted eating, both high intensity interval training and time-restricted eating, or
      who are in a control group. Physical activity, sleep quality, continuous glucose monitoring,
      adherence to the interventions and hunger/satiety will also be measured.
