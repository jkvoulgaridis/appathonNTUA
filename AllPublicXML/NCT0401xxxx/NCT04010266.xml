  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled study of the appliedVR RelieVRx
      headset in subjects undergoing Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA). This study will evaluate two
      primary endpoints - effectiveness of a single use of RelieVRx in the reduction of acute
      postoperative pain by 20%; and overall effectiveness of RelieVRx as an opioid-sparing
      intervention, where opioid consumption is reduced by at least 20% over a 90-day postoperative
      period in the interventional, standard of care (SOC) plus RelieVRx group compared to the
      control, SOC group.

      This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled study of the appliedVR RelieVRx
      headset in subjects undergoing Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA). Patients will be randomized to
      one of the two groups after study enrollment, and patients in the test arm will be educated
      about the device preoperatively to facilitate its use in the acute post-operative period. The
      goals of VR will be presented in the context of an alternate method of pain control to
      opioids. This study will evaluate two primary endpoints - effectiveness of a single use of
      RelieVRx in the reduction of acute postoperative pain by 20%; and overall effectiveness of
      RelieVRx as an opioid-sparing intervention, where opioid consumption is reduced by at least
      20% over a 90-day postoperative period in the interventional, standard of care (SOC) plus
      RelieVRx group compared to the control, SOC group.
