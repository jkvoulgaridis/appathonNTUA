    <textblock>

      Patient recruitment will be carried out in the 6 participating hospital centres.

      All patients willing to participate, will benefit from an Inclusion Visit (J0): Conducted in
      hospital in acute geriatric services before discharge from hospital. Verification of
      inclusion criteria, collection of patient consent by investigator, assignment of patient
      identification number, declaration of inclusion, and collection by investigator of inclusion
      data (age, sex, weight, height, appetite, dietary intake scale, risk factors for
      undernutrition by HAS, albumin, CRP, exit treatment, ADL, IADL and GIR, technical aids for
      walking, presence of professional and non-professional home workers).

      Home visit J7 (30 min to 1 hour): initial dietary assessment, will be carried out between 24
      hours and 7 days after discharge from hospital. During this visit, the dietician will perform
      several measurements (MNA-SF, weight, height, appetite assessment, ingest/24h Consumption of
      NOCs if prescribed in hospital, Quality of Life, ADL, IADL, acceptance of visit, follow-up of
      dietary advice and intercurrent medical events).

      Home visit J30, J60 (30 min to 1h): Made by the dietician, during these visits will be
      carried out various measurements and questionnaires: Appetite assessment, weight,
      ingesta/24h, consumption of NOCs, acceptance of the visit, follow up on dietary advice,
      compendiums of intercurrent medical events.

      Home visit J90 = Final visit. This visit is identical to the initial assessment (J7).
      Patients who are undernourished or at risk of undernutrition will receive an additional J15
      home visit (15 days after discharge from hospital). This visit will be identical to visits
      J30, J60.
