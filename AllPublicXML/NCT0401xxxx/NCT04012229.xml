  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Relationship between the presence of the BRCA mutation (BReast Cancer) and outcomes is
      unclear in high-risk early breast cancers (BC).

      This study is a multi-center retrospective cohort of patients treated in region Franche-Comté
      for an early BC by neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy.

      The primary aim was to describe clinical and pathological characteristics considering BRCA
      mutated (BRCAm) patients versus BRCA wild type (BRCAwt) patients or untested patients. The
      second objective was to assess the prognostic impact of germinal BRCAm in this high-risk
      population.
