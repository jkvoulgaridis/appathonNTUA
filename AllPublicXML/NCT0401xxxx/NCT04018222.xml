  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating the development of a diagnostic test intended to predict flares
      in patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. Over a six-month period, the participant will
      donate blood samples for researchers to evaluate the types of proteins that are in their
      blood. During this time the participant will also visit a research physician to undergo a
      physical exam that will include an evaluation of the disease's level of activity.
      Questionnaires will be answered too, either via email, phone call, or a research app for
      android and iPhone devices. During this six-month period, if the participant experiences a
      lupus flare, they are strongly encouraged to visit the research physician to receive a
      complimentary medical evaluation.

      The purpose of this study is to further validate an algorithm used in a lupus
      flare-prediction that has been developed. The investigators will be looking at different
      proteins in the blood that are commonly associated with lupus flares and could warn of the
      risk of a future flare. Participation in this study will involve three separate visits with a
      research physician for six months. These will proceed as a baseline visit, a three-month
      visit, and a six-month visit. During each of these visits the physician assesses the
      participant's physical condition and take blood samples for both research and medical
      purposes. Throughout this study, the participant will also complete a series of
      questionnaires to assess their wellness and day-to-day challenges. After the initial visit,
      the participant will be contacted to complete a monthly survey that evaluates if there have
      been any changes in your condition. This survey can be completed either via email, a phone
      call discussion, or the study's unique research app. Three of these six surveys will be
      completed during the physician's visit, however, the other three will be completed in the
      preferred medium. Throughout the six-month period while you are on this study, if at any
      point the participant experiences a flare, they are encouraged to visit the research
      physician. During this visit, they will receive a physician's evaluation to ensure your
      medical condition and collect blood samples for our research at no cost to the participant.
