  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a great need for effective treatments and prevention therapies that can provide
      symptomatic and disease modifying benefits for those at risk for Alzheimer's disease. The
      proposed multi-site collaborative project brings together research teams at the University of
      Florida (UF) and University of Arizona (UA) to test a novel, relatively low cost, low risk,
      and potentially high impact therapeutic intervention in older adults who are at increased
      risk for Alzheimer's disease. The intervention involves transcranial and intranasal delivery
      of near infrared (NIR) light via light emitting diodes, aka photobiomodulation. Prior
      research in cellular and animal models suggest that red and infrared light are
      neuroprotective and thought to improve mitochondrial function by promoting increased
      production of intracellular ATP. Transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease demonstrate
      reduced beta-amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles in response to transcranial NIR versus sham
      stimulation. Preliminary human studies have also shown promising behavioral findings in young
      adults and those with TBI, aphasia, and Alzheimer's disease. From this study team, pilot
      phosphorous magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P MRS) and cognitive data in older adults
      support this mechanism of action and provide compelling evidence for a Phase II clinical
      trial. To more fully determine whether this novel stimulation approach has potential for
      enhancing cognition in cognitively normal but &quot;at risk&quot; individuals for Alzheimer's disease,
      the investigators plan to conduct a multi-site double blinded randomized sham-controlled
      Phase II clinical trial. The investigators' overall hypothesis is that exposure to NIR
      stimulation will have beneficial effects on brain health via influence on mitochondrial
      function as measured by changes in 31P MRS-based markers of ATP, neural network changes in
      functional connectivity (rs-fMRI), and improved cognitive performance. To test this
      hypothesis, the study team plans to randomize 168 older adults with subjective cognitive
      complaints, and a first-degree family history of Alzheimer's disease to sham or real
      treatment groups and evaluate neuroimaging and cognitive outcome measures, before and after a
      12-week intervention involving transcranial and intranasal NIR-PBM. The protocol will involve
      &quot;lab&quot; and &quot;home&quot; sessions, and a 3 month post-intervention follow-up. This trial will
      determine: 1) whether NIR stimulation, relative to sham, improves performance on memory and
      executive tasks sensitive to hippocampal and frontal brain function in older adults with
      increased risk for Alzheimer's disease; 2) whether NIR stimulation, relative to sham,
      enhances brain function and connectivity measured by changes in MRS phosphorous ATP and
      resting state functional connectivity; and 3) how differences in demographic, neuroimaging,
      and Alzheimer-related risk factors influence the brain response to NIR stimulation versus
      sham in older adults with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease. Results will provide key
      insights into whether this novel NIR intervention can enhance cognition in older adults with
      increased risk for Alzheimer's disease and will provide the necessary data for a future Phase
      III randomized clinical trial.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized to the Active or Sham condition. The study biostatistician will randomize participants using a 1:1 allocation scheme with stratification based on age, education, and sex. When a new participant arrives, she/he will be randomized to Active or Sham groups depending on covariate characteristics (age, education, sex) and the cumulative distribution of assignments regarding these variables at that point.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Use of a sham-controlled approach provides stringent experimental control, enabling the investigators to control for placebo/expectations, behavioral activation (engaging in study procedures) and practice effects related to repeated administration of the same cognitive tasks.
The MedX and Vielight devices used for delivery of active and sham NIR stimulation are identical in all respects regarding design, warmth and operation, except that no stimulation is delivered by the sham devices. Because NIR light is invisible, participants will not be able to discern if receiving active or sham stimulation. The participants, interventionists, and outcome assessors will be blinded to the participants' intervention status: Active vs Sham. At completion of the study, all participants will receive a Placebo Control Questionnaire that asks questions pertaining to what group the participant had been assigned. This data will be examined to determine the effectiveness of blinding.</masking_description>

    <measure>Change in Active group ARENA scores compared to Sham group ARENA scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure is a spatial navigation task (ARENA), a human analogue to the Morris WaterMaze. Participants navigate a virtual room on a computer. The task consists of 3 phases: practice, learning, and memory probe. During the learning trials, the target is invisible until the participant hovers over it. The target is located in the same location and the participant must use spatial cues to locate it. In the memory probe trial, the target is removed unbeknownst to the participant. On each learning trial, path length, time to acquire the target, and target acquisition (yes-no) are recorded. On the probe trial, path length and percent of time spent in each quadrant are recorded. The primary outcome is a composite z score, consisting of mean z scores for the following: path length(.25 weight)+time to acquire target (.25 weight)+time spent in proximal target on trial 9(.50 weight). Higher Z scores indicate better performance. Expected range of composite Z is -4 to 4.</description>

    <description>For transcranial stimulation, the study team will use two MedX units (1116 Rehab Console, MedX Health), whereas intranasal stimulation is delivered using the 810 Intranasal device (Vielight Inc). During each lab session, six transcranial LED clusters will be placed on the scalp in two distinct configurations guided by 10-20 EEG system. Total transcranial stimulation time is 40 minutes, 20 min per cluster. Concurrently, two 810 intranasal devices will be placed in each nostril for 25 min of total dose per nostril. For at home sessions, participants will use the standalone 810 Intranasal device only.
Total amount of sessions:
16 sessions of stimulation will occur in the laboratory. Each session will last approximately 90 minutes and will include two 20-minute segments of NIR stimulation.
AND
44 sessions of intranasal stimulation in the home. Each session will last 25 minutes and will occur on weekdays when there is no in-lab session.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the Sham control group will undergo identical procedures as the Active group. The only difference is that the &quot;sham&quot; NIR devices are modified not to deliver stimulation. Because NIR is invisible, participants are unable to detect whether NIR is being delivered.</description>
