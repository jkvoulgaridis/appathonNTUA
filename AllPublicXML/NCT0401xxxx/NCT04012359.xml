  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a frequent disease affecting a growing number
      of adults in the world which is responsible for a large public health burden through heavy
      morbidity and mortality.

      Emphysema is one of a wide spectrum of pulmonary complications linked to COPD, defined as the
      abnormal permanent enlargement of the airspaces distal to the terminal bronchioles
      accompanied by destruction of the alveolar wall. Disease progression is correlated to
      worsening and enlargement of emphysema lesions, sometimes conflating in sizeable bullae,
      deleterious to normal mechanical pulmonary function. Bullous emphysema (BE) is sometimes
      eligible to invasive curative treatment through surgery or interventional bronchoscopy.

      Diagnosis of BE relies on computerized tomodensitometry (CT), the gold-standard for
      evaluating pulmonary parenchyma. However, CT is not always available, and bullous emphysema
      can present as pneumothorax on chest radiography.

      The practice of lung ultrasound is currently growing in respiratory medicine and emergency
      departments owing to an increasing amount of evidence showcasing its reliability as a
      diagnostic tool, most notably for pneumothorax and other pleural diseases. Despite BE having
      been reported to present similarly to pneumothorax in ultrasound, its characteristics have
      not yet been precisely described.

      The primary aim of this study is to describe BE using lung ultrasound. Participants with
      known BE on CT will undergo a simple ultrasound examination. The secondary aim is to compare
      the characteristics of BE to those of pneumothorax using lung ultrasound. To achieve this, a
      second group of participants with currently treated pneumothorax will also undergo lung
      ultrasound.

    <description>Calculation of sensitivity values of lung ultrasound for bullous emphysema for each sonographic sign. Study design prohibits calculation of specificity.
A quantitative discrete score will be constructed by enumerating signs which are positive in favor of bullous emphysema, able to discriminate between both diseases. AUC will be calculated. An AUC &lt; 0.75 will be considered as insufficient for establishing lung ultrasound as a diagnostic test for bullous emphysema. An AUC &gt; 0.75 would prompt further studies.</description>
