  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the adaptations in skeletal muscle that occur in response to 10
      weeks of weight training with or without peanut protein supplementation in older adult men
      and women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aging is associated with declines in muscle mass, physical strength and physical function.
      Adequate quality protein intake in aging adults is critical to preventing functional decline.
      Peanuts provide a unique blend of amino acids that can provide several health benefits to
      aging adults. While supplementing with peanut protein (PP) powder as part of a resistance
      training program may increase myofibrillar protein synthesis (i.e., the gold standard
      molecular assessment in deciphering a muscle-building response), and improve skeletal muscle
      quality and body composition, no study to date has made this determination.

      This is a two-phase study using both novel and conventional methods to assess how PP
      supplementation affects muscle tissue in older individuals who engage in resistance training.
      These two phases will be conducted as part of a 10-week randomized controlled trial in which
      men and women aged 50 years and older (n=60), will be stratified by gender and randomized to
      a resistance training intervention (whole body, two days per week) with PP powder (72g daily;
      n=15 males, n=15 females) provided during the intervention (immediate group, IG) or after the
      intervention (wait-list control, WLC, n=15 males, n=15 females). The aims of this study are
      to determine the acute (deuterium oxide tracer) and chronic (peripheral quantitative computed
      tomography) effects of PP during resistance training on skeletal muscle myofibrillar protein
      synthesis rates, changes in skeletal muscle size and quality, changes in whole and
      appendicular body composition (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry), changes in inflammatory
      markers and the fecal microbiome.
