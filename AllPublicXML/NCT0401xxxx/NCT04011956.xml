  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a systemic research of Chinese aortic coarctation patients, aiming to determine risk
      factors and serial biomarkers of aortic coarctation in prognosis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to determine how much the left ventricle remodeling pre-operation and how it
      changes in the following-up duration after surgery, so does in the blood pressure and heart
      function. Risk factors associated with complications and prognosis are investigated and
      analyzed. Identification of novel biomarkers is needed to help predicting the prognosis, such
      as the left ventricle anti-remodeling, heart function and blood pressure improvement, as well
      as the exercise tolerance post-operation. The findings of this study will help the
      investigators developping new tests to monitor affected patients and optimize the operation
      as well as the follow-up procedure.
