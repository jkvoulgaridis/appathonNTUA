  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IDinsight is conducting a randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of various sized
      cash incentives for caretakers of infants that require a 9-month measles vaccination on the
      completion rate for the vaccine in Nigeria. The purpose of the experiment is to help New
      Incentives (NI) determine the optimal size of the incentive as they scale to the North West
      region of Nigeria.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Measles Vaccination Coverage Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>We assessed whether eligible infants received measles vaccination at any time during the 4 month study period. Children were a minimum of 9 months at the beginning of the study and a maximum of 7 years at the end of the study.</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome of interest is the measles coverage rate among the eligible randomized infants. Coverage is measured using the measles vaccination information recorded on the child's health card. The child health card information was immediately entered into the New Incentives' database by their field staff when they disbursed the cash incentives at program clinics. Information from the New Incentives' database was used for the analysis.</description>

    <description>A New Incentives' team member reminded caregivers of their child's measles immunization date and the total amount of incentive they would receive once their child was vaccinated. If the caregiver could not be reached on the first attempt, the team made additional attempts at different times of the day on five different days across two weeks (up to 10 attempts were made per caregiver).</description>
