    <textblock>
      Chinese Cardiovascular Association is an association dedicated to establishing Chest Pain
      Centers in hospitals that have basic qualifications and meet pre-designed quality control
      targets.The vision of Chinese Cardiovascular Association is the cardiovascular health of
      every Chinese, and the mission is to realize the early arrival of the inflection point of
      cardiovascular events in China.The institute of China Heart House is responsible for the
      daily management and implementation of Chinese Cardiovascular Association and the
      implementation and management of the Chest Pain Center construction project.In order to
      improve standard treatment and chest pain system management to achieve better outcomes for
      patients, China Heart House established the chest pain center database.The database includes
      patients in 4129 registered hospitals in 31 provinces in China who have been admitted with
      chest pain.The database can reflect the clinical characteristics, treatment and outcome of
      patients with chest pain in China.

      This non-interventional, retrospective study analyzed the chest pain center database to
      understand the demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment patterns and clinical
      outcomes of patients with chest pain, and to analyze the effects of different treatment
      patterns, including chest pain centers and related collaborative treatment networks.The
      results of the study will assess the gap between the real-world situation and the
      recommendations of the guidelines and reflect the effect of chest pain centers and related
      collaborative treatment networks on the treatment process and service quality.The research
      results can be directly translated into the basis of medical treatment system intervention,
      and also provide decision-making reference for improving the certification standards and
      quality control of chest pain centers.

        The study population was inpatients (18 years and older) admitted to the Chest Pain Central
        database with symptoms of chest pain.The database registration of this study was conducted
        in 4129 registered hospitals in 31 provinces in China.All hospitals participating in the
        Chest Pain Center program are encouraged to manage patients in accordance with local
        standard practices (as recommended by current Chinese guidelines).

        This study will include data on all patients in the chest pain central database.
