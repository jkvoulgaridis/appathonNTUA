  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior research has identified profound sleep disruption in individuals with PSP. Not only
      were these individuals sleeping relatively short periods at night, they were also not
      recuperating lost sleep during the day. Research also showed the relative preservation of a
      series of nuclei key in regulating wake and arousal. Investigators believe that
      therapeutically targeting wake promoting centers with a specific medication will improve
      sleep quality and overall well-being in PSP. To study this, investigators will be doing a
      double blind, within subject, remote clinical trial with 3 conditions: suvorexant- which
      targets a wake promoting system, zolpidem- a standard hypnotic that engages sleep promoting
      systems, versus placebo. Each condition will last 1 week and will be separated by a 1 week
      washout period on no sleep medications. Investigators will measure sleep patterns and daytime
      symptoms to determine if suvorexant, zolpidem, or both medications are safe and effective for
      treating sleep disturbances and improving overall well-being in PSP.

    <time_frame>7th day of treatment for each of the two hypnotic drugs and placebo (weeks 2, 4 and 6) compared to baseline (week 1).</time_frame>
    <description>Change in functionality is assessed using the Tau functional scale. This is a questionnaire, which both the patient and caregiver work together to complete. The total range of scores is 0-124 with subscores for &quot;motor experiences of daily living&quot; (0-48 points), &quot;Language/cognitive/behavioral&quot; concerns (0-52) and &quot;Other non-motor experiences of daily living&quot; (0-24).

    <description>Change in cognition will be assessed using working memory measures of digits forward and digits backward, and executive function measures of categorical fluency and verbal fluency. The range of scores for digits forward and digits backward is 0-16 each, with higher scores indicating better cognition. The likely range of scores for the fluency measures are 0-60 with higher scores associated with better executive function. Rule violations and repetitions are also counted and scored with greater scores in these domains associated with poorer cognition.</description>
