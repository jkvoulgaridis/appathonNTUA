  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autologous ADSVF constitutes an innovative therapeutic strategy that concentrates various
      types of regenerative stem cells and paracrine factors able to promote angiogenesis and
      tissue repair. Together with the ease of collection from a minimally manipulated
      lipoaspirate, the unique properties of ADSVF offer new opportunities for fistulas' healing in
      patients with CD. The use of ADSVF is currently developed in many clinical fields based on
      safety and efficacy data.

      Our ADICROHN pilot study evaluating safety and tolerance of local administration of
      autologous ADSVF with microfat in CD patients with complex perianal fistula refractory to
      conventional medical and surgical therapy showed that this novel therapeutic approach appears
      feasible and safe.

      However the therapeutic potential of local this combined treatment in healing refractory
      perianal Crohn's fistulas still remains to be demonstrated.

      The main objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of local injection of autologous
      ADSVF and microfat versus placebo for the treatment of complex refractory perianal Crohn's
      fistulas at week 24.

      The efficacy will be assessed on clinical assessment of closure of all the external openings
      that were drained at baseline, and MRI confirmation of absence of collections &gt; 2 cm of the
      treated perianal fistulas at week 24.

      B. Primary objective/endpoint The main objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of
      local injection of autologous ADSVF and microfat versus placebo for the treatment of complex
      refractory perianal Crohn's fistulas at week 24 (W24), The efficacy will be assessed on
      clinical assessment of closure (despite gentle finger compression) of all the external
      openings that were drained at baseline, and MRI confirmation of absence of collections &gt; 2 cm
      of the treated perianal fistulas at week 24.
