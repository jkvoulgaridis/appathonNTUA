  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the context of the ageing of the French population, drug iatrogeny in the elderly is a
      major public health issue, responsible for approximately 7,500 deaths per year and 3.4% of
      hospitalizations among patients aged 65 and over.

      The interest of the Medication Reconciliation (MR) in reducing medication errors and
      unintentional discrepancies in prescriptions at transition points in patients' medication
      care pathways no longer seems to be in doubt both in France and abroad.

      On the other hand, the literature on the clinical impact of these drug errors (i. e.
      occurrence of an adverse drug event (ADE) or readmission rates) is currently limited in
      France and presents variable results abroad.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The medication reconciliation implementation mobilizes human resources (pharmacists, pharmacy
      technician, nurses...) and constitutes an investment for healthcare institutions. However,
      the resulting improvement in patients' health status (and the potential reduction in ADEs)
      could reduce their care consumption and thus reduce costs from a healthcare system
      perspective. We therefore propose to assess the cost-effectiveness of this care strategy.

      Finally, we will study the impact of the MR deployment on existing professional
      organizations, both in hospital and between community healthcare professionals and hospital
      as well as its conditions of implementation.

    <description>During hospitalization, the hospital pharmacist will carry out a pharmaceutical analysis for all patients included in the study, each time the prescription is changed and within a maximum of 24 hours (working days).
If necessary, in consultation with the doctor in charge of the patient, the pharmacist may also propose a pharmaceutical interview to the patient at any time during his hospitalisation (e.g. proposal for the de-prescription of benzodiazepines, Proton Pump Inhibitors, etc., according to the recommendations in force).</description>
