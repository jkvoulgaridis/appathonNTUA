      Aim: Gingival enlargement is a common clinical condition which requires surgical approaches
      to alleviating these enlargement areas. The aim of this study was to investigate
      epithelization, gingival temperature, inflammation and pain levels in post-operative healing
      process in 4 different gingivectomy techniques including Er:YAG laser, Nd:YAG laser,
      electrosurgery and conventional gingivectomy in treatment of chronic inflammatory gingival
      enlargements.

      Material and Method: A split-mouth designed study was conducted on 37 systemically healthy
      patients consisting of 19 females and 18 males, who had gingival enlargement areas on the
      left and right of maxillary and mandibular anterior regions. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF)
      samples were collected, clinical periodontal parameters and gingival temperature levels were
      recorded at baseline and in the postoperative period. The gingival temperature was measured
      during surgical procedures. Gingival temperature and epithelization levels in 3rd, 7th, 10th
      and 15th days; GCF levels in 15th, 30th, and 90th days and pain levels in 2nd and 8th hours
      and between 1st-7th days of post-operative healing process were evaluated.

    <intervention_model_description>The present study was designed as a controlled clinical study with a randomized design. The study protocol was approved by the local ethical committee of Clinical Studies of Ondokuz Mayis University. The study population consisted of 37 participants (19 women, age 23.10±2.78, 18 men age 21.11±2.63).</intervention_model_description>
