  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a FIH, open-label, dose escalation, phase I clinical trial to assess the safety and
      immunogenicity of the candidate ChAdOx1 Zika vaccine in healthy volunteers given as a
      standalone vaccine or in coadministration with ChAdOx1 Chik. Both vaccines will be
      administered intramuscularly.

      Volunteers will be recruited and vaccinated at the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and
      Tropical Medicine (CCVTM), Oxford. There will be 7 study groups and a total of 57 volunteers
      will be enrolled. Groups 1-3 will receive ChAdOx1 Zika alone. Groups 4-7 will receive a
      co-administration of ChAdOx1 Zika and ChAdOx1 Chik administered contralaterally. Staggered
      enrolment will apply for the first three volunteers within each group.
