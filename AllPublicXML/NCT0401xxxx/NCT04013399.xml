    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of treatment of obstructive sleep apnea on insulin
      sensitivity in pregnant women. Women in their third trimester of pregnancy will be randomized
      to receive treatment or no treatment for one month.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) worsens over pregnancy and is related to increased risk of
      gestational diabetes. Despite the fact that sleep disturbances are common during pregnancy,
      OSA remains under-diagnosed, and poorly understood particularly in pregnancies affected by
      obesity. At least 25 percent of pregnancies are now affected by obesity, a leading risk
      factor for OSA, yet the effect of treatment of OSA on patterns of metabolic function and
      specifically decreased insulin sensitivity in pregnant women with obesity is a neglected area
      with major therapeutic implications to improve maternal health. Inflammation with OSA may
      decrease insulin sensitivity. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a known effective
      treatment for OSA and has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity outside of pregnancy. Our
      overall hypothesis is that, compared with standard care, CPAP will improve nighttime
      breathing, blood and tissue oxygenation, decrease markers of inflammation, and increase
      insulin sensitivity. Using a randomized controlled trial, we will determine the effect of
      CPAP on metabolic dysfunction induced by OSA in pregnant women with obesity.
