  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcoidosis is a heterogeneous disorder of unknown etiology whose signature lesions are
      granulomatous inflammatory infiltrates in involved tissues. Tissue commonly affected are
      lungs, skin, eyes, lymph nodes and the heart. In this latter case, cardiac sarcoidosis (CS)
      can lead to atrioventricular (AV) blocks, ventricular arrhythmias, heart failure (HF) and
      sudden cardiac death. Similar to other involved organs, cardiac disease generally progresses
      from areas of focal inflammation to scar. However, the natural history of CS is not well
      characterized complicating an immediate and definitive diagnosis. The management of CS often
      requires multidisciplinary care teams and is challenged by data limited to small
      observational studies and from the high likelihood of side effects of most of the treatments
      currently used (eg: corticosteroids, methotrexate and TNF-alfa inhibitors).

      Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is the prototypical pro-inflammatory cytokine, also referred to as
      master regulator of the inflammatory response, involved in virtually every acute process.
      There is evidence that IL-1 plays a role in mouse model of sarcoidosis and human pulmonary
      lesions as the presence of the inflammasome in granulomas of the heart of patients with
      cardiac sarcoidosis, providing additional support for a role of IL-1 in the pathogenesis of
      CS. However, IL-1 blockade has never been evaluated as a potential therapeutic agent for
      cardiac sarcoidosis.

      In the current study, researchers aim to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IL-1 blockade
      with anakinra (IL-1 receptor antagonist) in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis.

      Researchers will perform a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of
      anakinra (recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, Kineret, SOBI, Sweden) given for 4 weeks in
      28 patients with cardiac sarcoidosis (defined using Heart Rhythm Society diagnostic
      criteria).

      Specific Aim #1: To determine the effects of anakinra on systemic inflammation

      Specific Aim #2: To determine the effects of anakinra on cardiac inflammation and fibrosis
      (scar tissue)

        INCLUSION CRITERIA (all 3 criteria need to be met)

          -  Clinical diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis according to the Heart Rhythm Society based
             on one of the 2 diagnosis pathways:

               1. Histological diagnosis from myocardial tissue - cardiac sarcoidosis is diagnosed
                  in the presence of non-caseating granuloma on histologic examination of
                  myocardial tissue with no alternative cause identified (including negative stain
                  for microorganisms - as applicable);

               2. Clinical diagnosis from invasive and/or non-invasive studies - it is probable
                  that there is cardiac sarcoidosis if there is (a) histological diagnosis of
                  extracardiac sarcoidosis and (b) one or more of the following: steroid +/-
                  immunosuppressant responsive cardiomyopathy or heart block; unexplained reduction
                  in LVEF (&lt;40%); unexplained sustained (spontaneous or induced) ventricular
                  tachycardia; Mobitz type II 2nd degree or 3rd degree AV block; patchy uptake on
                  dedicated cardiac PET (in a pattern consistent with cardiac sarcoidosis); late
                  gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance (in a pattern consistent
                  with cardiac sarcoidosis); positive gallium uptake (in a pattern consistent with
                  cardiac sarcoidosis) and (c) other causes for the cardiac manifestation(s) have
                  been reasonable excluded.

          -  Cardiac fluoro-deoxyglucose uptake on recent PET (performed within the prior month).

          -  CRP high-sensitivity assay &gt;2 mg/l.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Age&lt;21 years;

          -  Pregnancy;

          -  Inability to obtain consent from patient or legally authorized representative;

          -  Contraindications to treatment with Anakinra (Kineret)(i.e. prior allergic reaction to
             the drug or to E. coli derived products or severe allergy to latex);

          -  Severe anemia (Hgb&gt;8 g/dl - due to the need of more frequent blood sampling with this
             study).

          -  Acute or chronic active infections (not including treated/cured HCV with negative
             viral load).

          -  Acute or chronic inflammatory disease or immunosuppressive therapies (including oral
             corticosteroids at a dose of prednisone equivalent of 0.5 mg/kg/day but not including
             inhaled or low dose oral corticosteroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).

          -  Active acute or chronic psychiatric illness that in the opinion of the investigator
             may prevent from complying with study instructions;

          -  Patients may be on stable doses of steroids or steroid-sparing agents including
             methotrexate but not other biologic agents including TNF-blockers.

          -  Limited English Proficiency that in the opinion of the investigator may prevent
             participants from safely completing the study procedures.
