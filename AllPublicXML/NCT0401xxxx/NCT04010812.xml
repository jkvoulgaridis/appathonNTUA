  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study's purpose is to determine if a patient's perception of readiness for discharge from
      sub-acute rehabilitation, as measured by Readiness For Hospital Discharge Scale Patient
      Self-Reports Form, correlates with the patient's success after discharge, measured by patient
      reported number of falls, emergency room visits and hospitalizations 30 days post discharge.

    <textblock>
      All sub-acute rehabilitation patients will be approached for study participation one day
      prior to discharge day from the facility. Patients will be approached in their private room
      within the facility to obtain consent. Consent will be reviewed with patient by
      investigators. Patients will be asked to demonstrate understanding of the study and what
      consent will imply utilizing the teach back method. If patient is able to demonstrate
      understanding and gives consent the MoCA will be administered. If MoCA scores falls between
      22-30 they will be included in study. If MoCA score falls below 22 they will not be included
      in study and that will be explained to them at that time. MoCA scores will be included in
      patient medical record. Patient name and assigned ID number, phone number, second contact and
      consent will be recorded on the confidential roster sheet and stored in a locked file cabinet
      located in director's office at Peconic Landing. The day of discharge patients will complete
      the RHDS survey. Investigators will complete the study data sheet including ID number, MoCA
      score, RHDS score, length of stay, discharge date, and recommended discharge therapy- home
      care, outpatient, none. Thirty to thirty-seven days after discharge investigators will call
      patient and ask 3 questions from scripted form. &quot;How many falls have you had since discharge
      home:, &quot;How many visits to the emergency room have you had since your discharge home&quot;,&quot;How
      many admissions to the hospital have you had since your discharge home.&quot; Following completion
      of telephone questions, confidential roster sheet and consent form will be shredded.
