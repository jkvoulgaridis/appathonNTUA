  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel epidural delivery regimen was developed: Variable volume automated mandatory bolus
      (AMB) (VVAMB) will advance individualisation of labour epidural analgesia, by which a larger
      volume of bolus may contribute to better spread of the local anaesthetics within brief period
      and thereby reduces the chances of motor blockade that could reduce instrumental deliveries.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidural analgesia is the gold standard of pain relief for labour pain. Despite this, up to
      50% of parturients continue to experience pain leading to suffering and increased caregiver
      workload. There is also higher risk of motor blockade found in those receiving epidural
      analgesia, and these factors is associated with dysfunctional labour requiring obstetric
      intervention (instrumental delivery). Automated mandatory bolus (AMB) of variable-frequency
      (VAMB) has been shown to provide better pain relief as compared with conventional
      patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) with basal infusion, however its long lockout
      time per hour is associated with unsuccessful patient bolus requests, with similar motor
      block to conventional regimens.

      The investigators therefore proposes to develop a novel epidural delivery regimen: Variable
      volume AMB (VVAMB) will advance individualisation of labour epidural analgesia, by which a
      larger volume of bolus may contribute to better spread of the local anaesthetics within brief
      period and thereby reduces the chances of motor blockade that could reduce instrumental
      deliveries. This algorithm development including pilot and clinical trial will compare VVAMB
      with VAMB regimens, in reducing the incidence of motor block in 216 term women requesting for
      labour epidural analgesia.

    <time_frame>During labour (1 day)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of event of motor block throughout the labour. Previous studies have shown that epidural analgesia using high concentrations of local anaesthetics could lead to decreased motor functions, and are subsequently associated with an increased incidence of instrumented delivery and longer second stage of labour. In this study, the intensity of motor block is assessed by the patient's ability to move their lower extremities via a modified Bromage scale. In the modified version, a scoring of 0 implies no motor block (Free movement of both legs and feet), scoring of 1 implies partial block (Just able to flex knees with free movement of feet), 2 implies almost complete block (Unable to flex knees but with free movement of feet) and 3 implies a full block (Unable to move legs/ feet).</description>

    <description>The Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, and Respiration (APGAR) score is a test given to newborns soon after birth. In the test, five are being evaluated: Appearance (skin color), Pulse (heart rate), Grimace response (reflexes), Activity (muscle tone) and Respiration (breathing rate and effort). Each is scored on a scale of 0 to 2, with 2 being the best score; a total score of ten represents the best possible condition.</description>
