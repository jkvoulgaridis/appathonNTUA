  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal hearing screening may fail due to some perinatal and neonatal factors. It is well
      known that false positivity in newborn hearing screening increases cost and maternal anxiety
      and anxiety. There is still widespread concern about the use of opoid analgesics to relieve
      pain during labor. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of pethidine
      administered during labor on neonatal hearing screening test false positivity rates.

      The study group consisted of patients receiving 50 mg intramuscular (I.M) pethidine at the
      beginning of the active phase of labor and the control group consisted of patients not
      receiving pethidine. Newborns were evaluated by otoacoustic emission (OAE) test. The OAE test
      was performed before the patients were discharged. Perinatal and neonatal variables and test
      results were recorded and the relationship between false positivity and pethidine use was
      evaluated.
