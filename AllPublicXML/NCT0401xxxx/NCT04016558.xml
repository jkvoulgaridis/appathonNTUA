    <textblock>
      This study is comparing three programs to reduce Diabetes Distress (the worries and concerns
      that people with diabetes may experience as they struggle to keep blood glucose levels in
      range) in adults with type 1 diabetes. About a third of participants will take part in the
      TunedIn program, about a third will take part in the FixIt program, and about a third in the
      StreamLine program.

    <textblock>
      Diabetes Distress (DD) is the personal, often hidden side of diabetes: it reflects the unique
      emotional burdens and strains that individuals with diabetes may experience as they struggle
      to keep blood glucose levels within range. When high, DD can have a major, negative impact on
      disease management and glycemic control. High DD is characterized by frustration, feeling
      overwhelmed, and feeling hopeless and discouraged by the unceasing demands of diabetes. DD is
      also linked to an individual's beliefs, expectations, current life situation, and personal
      and social resources.

      The proposed study is a three-arm, 12-month randomized comparison trial to test the added
      value of a DD-targeted (TunedIn) intervention vs. a unified DD and management intervention
      (FixIt), relative to a traditional, educational/behavioral-management intervention
      (StreamLine). Each of the three programs (arms) will follow a separate, standardized
      protocol. All participants will receive three months of intervention with nine months of
      follow-up.

    <intervention_name>StreamLine</intervention_name>
    <description>StreamLine is an education/disease management program that focuses on systematic methods to identify and resolve specific blood glucose problems, primarily through changes in carbohydrate consumption, and use of basal and bolus insulin. Participants will attend a brief, four-hour meeting with a Certified Diabetes Educator (CDE) and, using standardized blood glucose data, will learn how to employ a five-point blood glucose management system to identify and resolve blood glucose problems (e.g., excursions, lows) that have the greatest HbA1c or hypoglycemic impacts.
Participants will then meet individually (30 minutes) with their CDE to review their blood glucose data, identify a specific blood glucose problem, and use the five-point program to create a plan to address the problem. Four additional individual meetings (30 minutes) will occur at approximately two to three-week intervals to best support individualized and participant-tailored management-change efforts.</description>

    <intervention_name>TunedIn</intervention_name>
    <description>TunedIn utilizes emotion regulation-based strategies to help participants observe that how they feel affects what they do regarding diabetes management. Participants will attend two highly interactive group workshops (6 hours followed by 2 hours) facilitated by a psychologist or social worker experienced in diabetes. Each will identify and discuss common emotional responses related to blood glucose management (e.g., over-reacting, avoiding, and lack of mindfulness).
Between the two workshops (two weeks), participants will complete a &quot;feeling log&quot; to document feelings, situation/context, and resolution around specific management events. Two individual meetings with the interventionist (30 minutes) will allow participants to identify and address a specific diabetes distress-related problem. Four web-based video group meetings (60 minutes, monthly) will continue to support participants over time.</description>

    <intervention_name>FixIt</intervention_name>
    <description>FixIt combines components of StreamLine and TunedIn to allow participants to explore feelings and expectations alongside the identification of problematic blood glucose patterns. StreamLine will be co-facilitated by a psychologist/social worker experienced in diabetes and a CDE. Participants will attend two group workshops (six hours followed by four hours), separated by two weeks.
Between the two workshops, participants will record their blood glucose data and keep a parallel &quot;feeling log&quot; to provide context. Four individual meetings with an interventionist (30 minutes) will allow participants to identify and address a specific blood glucose problem and create a plan to address it. Full discussion of diabetes distress-related aspects of the plan will take place to enhance mindfulness and identify typical emotion regulation strategies to ease problem resolution. Three web-based video group meetings (60 minutes, monthly) will continue to support participants over time.</description>
