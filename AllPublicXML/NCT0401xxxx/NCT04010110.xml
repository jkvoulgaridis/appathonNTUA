      This study assesses the ocular toxicity in patients on high dose hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as
      per the latest guidelines of the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an anti-malarial drug that is used to treat a variety of
      autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, juvenile
      idiopathic arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome. Hydroxychloroquine is a less toxic metabolite of
      chloroquine. There is an ongoing increase in the number of patients who are using HCQ for
      prolonged duration because of the expanding indications and the relatively safe systemic
      profile.

      Hydroxychloroquine can cause variable ocular adverse effects including corneal deposits,
      posterior sub-capsular cataract, ciliary body dysfunction and toxic retinopathy. Toxic
      retinopathy caused by HCQ has been recognized for many years. Patients with toxic retinopathy
      usually complain of blurry vision. The classical clinical picture of HCQ toxic retinopathy is
      a bilateral bull's-eye maculopathy, which is caused by a ring of parafoveal RPE
      depigmentation that spares the fovea. The exact mechanism responsible for the development of
      this pattern is not fully understood, however, it is believed that the primary damage is in
      the photoreceptors and outer nuclear layer leading to secondary disruption of the RPE.

    <description>A data collection sheet used to collect patient's information regarding the dose per body weight and duration of hydroxychloroquineuse and any risk factors associated with the use of the medication as per the latest AAO guidelines for hydroxychloroquine screening.
Complete ophthalmic examination including assessment of visual acuity, anterior segment examination looking for corneal verticillata and a dilated fundus examination looking for retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) depigmentation either in a para-foveal or extra-macular distribution within the retina. Ancillary tests including visual field (10-2) testing, spectral domain ocular coherence tomography (SDOCT) fundus auto-fluorescence and multifocal Electroretinogram (ERG).</description>

    <description>A data collection sheet was used to collect patient's information. All patients underwent a complete ophthalmic examination including assessment of visual acuity, anterior segment examination looking for corneal verticillata and a dilated fundus examination looking for retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) depigmentation either in a para-foveal or extra-macular distribution within the retina. Ancillary tests were done which included: visual field testing (10-2), spectral domain ocular coherence tomography (SDOCT). Fundus auto-fluorescence and mf-ERG were done if further ancillary testing was needed in doubtful cases or to confirm findings.</description>

    <description>The diagnosis of toxic retinopathy was based on the positivity of at least two objective tests to confirm the subjective findings. The presence or absence of toxicity was recorded.</description>
