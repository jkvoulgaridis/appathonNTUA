    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of perampanel as measured by the 50
      percent (%) responder rate during the maintenance period of the core study for seizure
      frequency in participants with pediatric epileptic syndrome (Cohort 1) and partial-onset
      seizures (POS) (Cohort 2).

    <description>Assessment of disease severity will utilize the CGIC scale at end of treatment to evaluate participant's change in disease status since initiation of treatment. The CGIC is a 7-point scale that measures a physician's global impression of a participant's clinical condition. Scale ranges from 1 to 7 with lower scores indicating improvement (1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally improved), higher scores indicating worsening (5=minimally worse, 6= much worse, 7=very much worse), and a score of 4 indicating no change.</description>

    <description>SGIC is a 7-Point scale that provides a participant-determined summary measure of change from baseline of participant's status. Scale ranges from 1 to 7 with lower scores indicating improvement (1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally improved), higher scores indicating worsening (5=minimally worse, 6= much worse, 7=very much worse), and a score of 4 indicating no change.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, End of Treatment Period of Core Study: Week 23, End of Extension Phase: Week 56</time_frame>
    <description>The CDR System Global Cognition Score (cognitive test battery) is derived from 5 CDR System domain scores, also called factor scores: Power of Attention, Continuity of Attention, Quality of Episodic Memory, Quality of Working Memory, and Speed of Memory. The CDR assessment and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) will be administered to participants 6 years and over and 2 years and over, respectively, using an age-appropriate version to assess cognitive function and behavior.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, End of Treatment Period of Core Study: Week 23, End of Extension Phase: Week 56</time_frame>
    <description>The CBCL is a questionnaire to assess behavioral and emotional problems in children as reported by the primary caregiver. It is standardized to evaluate maladaptive behavioral and emotional problems in ages 1.5 to 5 years (CBCL 1.5/5) or 6 to 18 years (CBCL). The CBCL examines three domains (Social Functioning, Mood and Anxiety Symptoms, and Externalizing Symptoms) by assessing 140 problem items that describe specific behavioral and emotional problems. Respondents indicate how accurately the statements describe the child by selecting from options on a 3-point Likert-type scale (0=Not True, 1= Somewhat or Sometimes True, or 2=Very True or Often True).</description>

    <description>C-SSRS rates an individual's degree of suicidal ideation (SI) on a scale, ranging from &quot;wish to be dead&quot; to &quot;active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent.&quot; The scale identifies SI severity and intensity, which may be indicative of an individual's intent to commit suicide. C-SSRS is used to assess whether participant experienced SI (1:wish to be dead; 2:non-specific active suicidal thoughts; 3:active SI with any methods (not plan) without intent to act; 4:active SI with some intent to act, without specific plan; 5:active SI with specific plan and intent) and suicidal behavior (6:actual attempt; 7:interrupted attempt; 8:aborted attempt; 9:preparatory acts or behavior; 10:suicidal behavior). An assessment of SI and behavior using the C-SSRS will be performed throughout the study for participants aged 6 years and above at the time of consent. In participants younger than 6 years, SI and behavior will be monitored based upon clinical impression.</description>

          -  Have had 4 or more seizures during the 4-week screening/baseline period.

          -  Have had brain imaging (example, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] scan or computed
             tomography [CT] [or ultrasound for less than 1 year old]) before screening visit that
             ruled out a progressive cause of epilepsy.

          -  Currently maintained on stable doses of 1 to a maximum of 4 approved antiepileptic
             drugs (AEDs).

        Exclusion Criteria:

             Investigator for participants less than 6 years.

          -  Are scheduled or confirmed or both to have epilepsy surgery within 6 months after

             surgery will be allowed.

          -  Have a progressive central nervous system (CNS) disease, including degenerative CNS
             diseases and progressive tumors.

          -  Intermittent use of benzodiazepines for any indications other than epilepsy (eg,
             anxiety/sleep disorders) within 1 month before screening visit. Benzodiazepines used
             as rescue medication for seizure control are allowed.

          -  A vagal nerve stimulator (VNS), responsive neurostimulator (RNS), or deep brain
             stimulator (DBS) implanted less than 5 months before screening visit or changes in

          -  Use of perampanel within 30 days before screening visit, or perampanel was
             discontinued due to adverse reactions (perampanel-related) or lack of efficacy in case
             of previous exposure.
