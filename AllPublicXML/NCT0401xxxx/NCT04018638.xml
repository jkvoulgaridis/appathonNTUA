      This study will determine the safety and efficacy of using blood-flow restriction exercise
      enhancement (B-FREE) to overcome persistent quadriceps muscle weakness that occurs following
      a total knee replacement (TKR).

    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the safety and efficacy of using B-FREE to overcome persistent
      quadriceps muscle weakness that occurs following a TKR. We hypothesize that B-FREE can
      provide a safe training stimulus and offer a home-based program to restore quadriceps muscle
      strength and improve functional mobility. Specifically, subjects that have a TKR will perform
      B-FREE at home (light weights with resistance bands and walking) 3x/wk for 10 weeks.
      Quadriceps muscle strength, balance, and functional mobility will be assessed before and
      after the program. Changes in these variables will be compared to healthy age-matched
      uninjured controls.
