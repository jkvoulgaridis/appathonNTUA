  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the life course of SCFA and their regulatory role in human metabolism will be
      traced using a nose-intestine catheter. The investigators have methodological questions:
      investigate the envisioned kinetic profiles of stable isotope tracers of SCFAs, and to
      establish the time points of plasma sampling (to determine systemic availability of SCFAs).
      The resulting timepoints established in this pilot study will be applied during a future
      human intervention study.

      Background: Nowadays there is a strong interest in optimising human health through
      manipulation of non-digestible carbohydrates (NDC). NDC are fermented by the microbiota,
      hereby producing fermentation end products, mainly short chain fatty acids (SCFA) acetate,
      butyrate, and propionate. It is hypothesized that SCFAs mediate parts of the beneficial
      effects of NDC. In mice, the influx of SCFA into the host correlated strongly with
      improvements of markers of the metabolic syndrome, whereas concentrations of SCFA in the
      cecum did not. The production and influx/incorporation of SCFAs in humans will be
      investigated.

      Study design: At day 1 the catheter will be placed. After an overnight fast at day 2, 5
      subjects will consume a NDC bolus. Isotopically 13C-labelled SCFAs will be delivered in the
      cecum. Samples will be taken in the cecum and blood before, and continuously after dispensing
      the 13C-labelled SCFAs.

      Study population: 5 healthy male volunteers (18-60yrs, and BMI between 18.5-30 kg/m2).

      Main study parameters/endpoints: (isotopic) enrichments of SCFAs in cecum, and label
      incorporation in plasma metabolites such as organic acids, glucose, cholesterol, fatty acids.

    <intervention_model_description>All subjects will consume a NDC bolus. When fermentation has started, isotopically 13C-labelled SCFAs will be delivered inside the intestine. Thereafter, production and inter-conversion of SCFAs and breakdown of fiber will be studied in luminal samples. Also blood samples will be taken to study integration of the 13C-label into various metabolic compounds.</intervention_model_description>
