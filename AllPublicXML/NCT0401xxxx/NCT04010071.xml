  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators design a phase II clinical study to explore the efficacy and safety of
      axitinib plus toripalimab as a second-line treatment in patients with hepatobiliary malignant
      tumors and to analyze potential biomarkers of therapeutic response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is a single-arm, non-randomized and single-center clinical study.

      It is estimated that 60 patients who met the study criteria will be enrolled in PUMCH and
      treated with axitinib plus toripalimab. The investigators will follow up and collect
      subjects' data each month to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment, including overall
      survival and time to progression, until disease progression or death. Histopathology and
      multi-omics data analysis will be used to explore potential biomarkers of treatment response.

      Study Type: Interventional. Masking: Open Label.

        is permitted Child-Pugh score 2).

          -  There are no active autoimmune diseases that require systemic therapy in the past 2
             years (note: active state means requiring disease modulators, corticosteroids or
             immunosuppressive drugs use). Alternative therapies, such as thyroxine, insulin or a
             physiological corticosteroid replacement therapy are not considered as systemic
             therapy.

          -  Women with fertility agree to abstinence during the treatment period and at least 6
             months after the last dose (avoiding heterosexual intercourse) or using a
             contraceptive method with an annual contraceptive failure rate &lt;1%.

        If a female patient has menstruation and not reached the postmenopausal state (continuously
        no menstruation ≥ 12 months and no other causes), and has not undergone sterilization by
        removing the ovaries and/or uterus), then the patient has fertility.

        ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation,
        hormone-releasing intrauterine devices and copper intrauterine devices.

        The reliability of sexual desire should be evaluated relative to the duration of the
        clinical trial and lifestyle of patient. Periodic abstinence (eg. calendar days, ovulation,
        symptomatic body temperature or post-ovulation methods) and in vitro ejaculation are
        unacceptable methods of contraception.

          -  Male patients agree to abstinence (no heterosexual intercourse) or use of

        treatment and at least 6 months after the last dose of treatment, or use condoms and other
        contraceptive methods with contraceptive failure rate &lt;1%. At the same time, male patients
        must also agree not to donate sperm.

        When a female partner is pregnant, the male patient must abstinence or using a condom
        during the treatment period and at least 6 months after the last dose of treatment to
        prevent the fetus from being affected by the study.

        The reliability of sexual desire should be evaluated relative to the duration of the
        clinical trial and lifestyle of patient. Periodic abstinence (eg. calendar days, ovulation,
        symptomatic body temperature or post-ovulation methods) and in vitro ejaculation are
        unacceptable methods of contraception.

          -  Tumor tissue must be available for biomarker analysis prior to the first dose of
             treatment, If not available, participants can consult the investigator for enrollment
             agreement. (Note: If an unstained section is submitted, the new section should be
