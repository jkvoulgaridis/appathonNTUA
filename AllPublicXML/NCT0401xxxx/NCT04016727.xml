  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PRP from 5 ml blood was prepared and 60 units were injected into the buccal vestibule of
      patient before initiating canine retraction using NiTi coil spring. Pre and post cervical,
      incisal and mid distances were measured using Vernier calliper.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Platelet rich plasma was prepared using patients own blood. The production of PRP began with
      a 6-mL homologous blood sample that was withdrawn from the donor via venupuncture. One
      milliliter of the blood sample was set apart to determine the concentration of platelets and
      leukocytes in whole blood. The remaining 5 mL was mixed with an anticoagulant (3.8%, 1-mL
      sodium citrate) to prevent clotting. The blood sample was centrifuged at 113 g for 5 minutes
      to separate the plasma containing the platelets from the red cells. The plasma was drawn off
      the top and centrifuged for an additional 2 minutes at 3772 g to separate the platelets.
      Suitable platelet concentrations were achieved by the resuspension of PRP with plasma (high
      platelet concentration, 5 times the concentration in whole blood).

    <description>Platelet rich plasma was prepared using patients own blood. 60 units of PRP was injected on one side of the arch using insulin syringe. Each patient served as his/her own control (the side with PRP injected) and experimental group (the side without PRP injected). Whether the right or left side served as control or experimental was determined by lottery method. Patients were recalled after 4 weeks and the measurements were repeated again between lateral incisors and canines at mid, cervical and incisal of the teeth and their mean was recorded.</description>
