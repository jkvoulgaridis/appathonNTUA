  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study was to assess the effect of repeated oral doses of
      Rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic profile of a single dose of Fluzoparib.

      The secondary objective of the study was to assess the safety of Fluzoparib given alone
      versus Fluzoparib coadministered with Rifampicin.
