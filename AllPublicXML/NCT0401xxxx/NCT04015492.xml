  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to compare how the body distributes and excretes the drugs Jivi
      (BAY 94-9027) and Adynovi. Jivi is a recently approved blood clotting Factor VIII (FVIII)
      medication for the treatment of hemophilia A (bleeding disorder resulting from a lack of
      FVIII). Both drugs are FVIII products which have been manufactured via recombinant technology
      and have an extended half-live, i.e. they will stay longer in the body than other FVIII
      products. Therefore these products act longer in the body which reduces the frequency of drug
      injections. To compare the two drugs, a cross-over design was chosen, i.e. each patient will
      receive both products one after another.

      Patients participating in this study will receive one dose of Jivi and one dose of Adynovi.
      Both drugs are injected into a vein. Observation will last for about 10 weeks, and blood
      samples will be taken from the participants to measure the blood levels of FVIII. Generic
      name of Jivi is Damoctocog-alfa-pegol, generic name of Adynovi is Rurioctocog alfa pegol.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with severe hemophilia A (baseline FVIII activity FVIII:C &lt;1%),
             determined by measurement at the time of screening (following a washout period of at
             least 72 h after their last FVIII treatment for standard half-life FVIII products or
             of 120 h for extended half-life FVIII products) or from reliable prior documentation
             (e.g. measurement in other clinical studies, result from approved clinical laboratory
             or diagnostic genetic testing).

          -  ≥150 exposure days with FVIII concentrate(s) (plasma-derived or recombinant) as
             supported by medical records.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) within the range 18 kg/m2 to 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to stop FVIII treatment to complete a minimum of 72 h washout for standard
             half-life FVIII product or 120 h washout for extended half-life FVIII product
