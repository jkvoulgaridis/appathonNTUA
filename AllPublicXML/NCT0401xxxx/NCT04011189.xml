  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      FX Palo Alto Laboratory (FXPAL) has developed an algorithm for pain assessment based on
      automated video facial and body pose analysis. Through the collaboration with FXPAL, the
      investigators aim to assess the sensitivity of this algorithm in detecting pain in
      post-surgical patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-surgical pain, if inadequately controlled, has deleterious short and long term
      consequences for the patient. Although most patients are able to report their pain scores, a
      minority are unable to do so and assessing their pain can prove to be a challenge for
      healthcare professionals. In recent years, facial recognition tools have been developed based
      on the premise that subtle facial variations signifies pain. However, changes in body, and
      head posture can also represent pain. As such, these tools are with their limitations and are
      only validated on certain groups of patients, thus may not be sensitive enough to detect pain
      in post-surgical patients.

      This pilot study will be conducted on 20 patients presenting for major gynaecological
      surgery, with the obtained data used to fine tune the algorithm. The patients will be
      video-taped pre-surgically in the pre-evaluation anaesthetic clinic and post-surgically in
      the ward. They will be asked to rate their pain scores on the numerical rating scale and fill
      in questionnaires on their psychological and quality of health status. The pain scores will
      be correlated with the results obtained from the pain assessment algorithm. The refined
      algorithm can be subsequently evaluated with a larger group of patients undergoing different
      pain conditions, and could potentially be used in clinical practice as a tool to assess pain
      if found to be sensitive.

    <measure>Change in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Before surgery (1 day) and after surgery (1-2 days)</time_frame>
    <description>HADS Anxiety and Depression score before and after surgery. HADS is commonly used by doctors to determine the levels of anxiety and depression that a patient is experiencing. Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression. The HADS uses a scale and therefore the data returned from the HADS is ordinal. For each subscore (anxiety/depression), 0-7 = Normal; 8-10 = Borderline abnormal (borderline case); and 11-21 = Abnormal (case).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EQ-5D-3L score</measure>
    <time_frame>Before surgery (1 day)</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D-3L score before surgery. EQ-5D-3L is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. It is made up for two components; health state description and evaluation. The health status is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression; each dimension ranging from 1-3. From these five dimensions, EQ-5D index is calculated, having a value between 0-1. The evaluation part involves an analogue scale, asking to mark health status on the day of the interview on a 20 cm vertical scale with end points of 0 and 100. Zero corresponds to &quot; the worst health you can imagine&quot;, and hundred corresponds to &quot;the best health you can imagine&quot;.</description>

    <description>Upon successful recruitment of the study, patients will be asked to complete 2 questionnaires and rate their pre-surgical pain on the numerical rating scale in the pre-anaesthetic evaluation clinic. Their face and body pose from a frontal view will be videotaped.
The general anaesthesia technique and type of analgesia administered intra-operatively will be according to standard practice and is at the discretion of the attending anaesthesiologist. After surgery, patients will be reviewed at 12-36 hrs, 36 hrs till before discharge post-operatively in the ward. They will be asked to rate their pain scores and videotaping will be done from a frontal view.</description>

    <description>Before the videotaping, patients will be asked on their baseline pain scores.
