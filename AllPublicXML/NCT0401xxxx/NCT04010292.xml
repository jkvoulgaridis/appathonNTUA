  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient counseling is an essential part of any new treatment implementation. This process
      becomes even more important when it involves surgical counseling. This is when the patient
      and the surgeon discuss the possible surgical options and ideally establish a plan for the
      appropriate surgical intervention. Unfortunately, multiple studies have shown that patients
      tend to have poor recall of the key elements discussed during the consultation (1-3). In the
      investigators' experience, the concern lies specifically in the level of recall that patients
      have regarding their planned surgical procedure, as most patients cannot correctly state the
      planned intervention despite extensive counseling and explanation. Lack of knowledge about
      the type of surgery can have serious implications for the patient in the future. For example,
      knowing facts like the presence or absence of the cervix and whether future pap smears are
      needed or the presence of an implant, such as a mesh are necessary for the patient's
      well-being and proper medical care down the line, especially when the patient has multiple
      medical providers. In addition, previous research has demonstrated that low-quality
      counseling and the feeling of being &quot;unprepared for surgery&quot; directly correlate with patient
      dissatisfaction (4). This is especially relevant in the field of female pelvic reconstructive
      surgery, where the success of surgical interventions relies heavily upon subjective
      patient-reported outcomes (5).

      There have been many studies to augment the counseling process using supplemental materials.
      These have included use of multiple visual charts, anatomical models, and passive and
      interactive audiovisual aids (6). Some improvement in the outcomes has been observed in
      various fields of medicine with the dissemination of supplemental patient resources (7-10).
      However, in urogynecology, the effectiveness of surgical counseling sessions has not been
      achieved despite the different additional methods for patient education (6, 11). Reasons that
      urogynecologic supplemental materials have not seen the same level of success as those in
      other fields of medicine include the complexity of the surgeries and the language used in
      many of these educational aids (12). The investigators aim to address the problem of poor
      patient recall of their procedure by providing them with an easy-to-read patient card
      detailing the anticipated surgery at the time of their consult.

    <time_frame>Patients will receive questionnaires within 30 days prior to their scheduled surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>All patient present for a preoperative visit, which occurs within 30 days of the scheduled surgery. At this time, all patients will receive a questionnaire testing their knowledge about their upcoming surgery. We will compare the answers from patients who received the education card and those who did not at the time of their surgical counseling visit.
The name of the questionnaire is &quot;The 7-Question Knowledge Questionnaire,&quot; which was developed by the Urogynecology Department at Atlantic Health System. The scale consists of 7 questions and will have score ranges between from 0 to 7.</description>

    <description>All patients will receive questionnaires, testing their knowledge of the performed surgery, during their postoperative follow-up visit.
The questionnaire will include &quot;The 7-Question Knowledge Questionnaire,&quot; which was developed by the Urogynecology Department at Atlantic Health System. The scale consists of 7 questions and will have score ranges between from 0 to 7.</description>

    <description>A validated questionnaire, called the &quot;Leiden Perioperative care Patient Satisfaction questionnaire&quot; will be given at the postoperative visit to determine patient satisfaction. A part of this questionnaire will be used, which consists of 4 questions. The total score will range between 0 and 4.</description>
