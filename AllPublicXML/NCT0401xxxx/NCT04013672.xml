      The main purpose of this study is to assess the clinical activity of Pembrolizumab and
      SurVaxM in participants with recurrent glioblastoma.

      Primary objective: Assess clinical activity of Pembrolizumab and SurVaxM in participants with
      recurrent glioblastoma using progression free survival at 6 months (PFS-6).

      Secondary objective: : Assess safety and tolerability of Pembrolizumab and SurVaxM in
      participants with recurrent glioblastoma.

      This is a Phase II study of two arms in participants with recurrent glioblastoma. Arm A will
      include participants with first recurrence of glioblastoma who have failed prior chemotherapy
      and radiation but have not received any immunotherapy. Arm B is an exploratory arm of 10
      participants who have failed prior anti-PD1 therapy.

      All patients will receive the study drug combination consisting of SurVaxM and pembrolizumab
      (PEM) with no randomization, stratification or dose escalation.
