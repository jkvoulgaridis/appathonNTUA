      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of calorie and enteral feeding timing on
      survival in critically ill children receiving inotropic, vasopressor and inodilatory
      supplements. Early enteral nutrition will be initiated within the first 24 hours of
      hospitalization in critically ill children who have inotropic vasopressor and inodilator
      support without any problems and contraindications in gastrointestinal system functions. The
      energy requirement of the intubated patients will be measured by indirect calorie meter
      method. Schofield method will be used to calculate the daily energy needs of extubated
      patients. 30% of the targeted energy in the first 48 hours of hospitalization and 80% of the
      targeted energy in the first week will be achieved by enteral nutrition.Nutritional solutions
      with a concentrated formula of 1 / 1.5 will be given to patients with cardiac pulmonary or
      renal disease requiring fluid restriction.Patients will be followed up for vomiting,
      diarrhea, abdominal distention, feeding intolerance, gastric residues and gastrointestinal
      bleeding. If these findings develop, the patient's nutrition will be interrupted according to
      the clinician's assessment and enteral nutrition will be re-fed as soon as possible.
