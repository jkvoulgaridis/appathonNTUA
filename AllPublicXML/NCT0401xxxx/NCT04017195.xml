  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objectives of this study are to determine the bioequivalence of the hormones
      (example, norelgestromin [NGMN] and ethinyl estradiol [EE]) from the transdermal
      contraceptive patch using the newly sourced adhesive component as compared to the currently
      marketed EVRA patch using the adhesive component, evaluate the adhesion of the transdermal
      contraceptive patch using the newly sourced adhesive component as compared to the currently
      marketed EVRA patch using the adhesive component and show non-inferior adhesion of the
      transdermal contraceptive patch using the newly sourced adhesive component as compared to the
      currently marketed EVRA patch using the adhesive component.
