  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem disease characterized by viscid secretions in multiple
      organ systems. Lung infection and damage account for most of the disease burden. Acute
      changes in respiratory signs and symptoms termed Pulmonary Exacerbations require treatment
      with intravenous antibiotics and hospital admission. These episodes cause substantial
      disruption to people's lives and impact on lung function, quality of life and lifespan.
      Current treatment regimes require improvement but further study is needed to identify who
      might benefit from a different approach.

      This observational study aims to assess if multi-dimensional measurements taken during
      treatment correspond with later treatment response. This may allow us to personalise
      treatment more effectively in the future and to better understand how individuals respond to
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary Exacerbations in CF require treatment with intravenous (IV) antibiotics and
      hospital admission for between 10-21 days. These episodes cause substantial disruption to
      people's lives and impact on lung function, quality of life and lifespan.Robust evidence to
      support current treatment approaches is lacking with awareness that current regimes could be
      optimised.

      As yet there is no model for predicting how patients with CF will respond to IV antibiotic
      treatment- other than clinical judgement and lung function response.This is due to lack of
      robust measures to identify clinical response at the time of treatment and safely predict
      later clinical outcomes. The heterogeneity of the 21st Century CF population means a
      multi-dimensional composite measure is needed. This study has therefore been designed to
      provide an overall picture of people's response including clinical, biochemical and patient
      related outcome measures. Using multi-dimensional assessment we hope the measures assessed in
      this study will give a better picture of how people feel and how they respond to treatment.

      Expectorated sputum and blood samples will be collected. Samples will be processed within 24
      hours or stored at - 80°. Processing will remove any human DNA or HTA relevant material.

      Samples from participants who have given consent for samples to be for future research will
      be stored at - 80°C, in a locked freezer in a lab with keypad access. Access to the samples
      will be limited to researchers involved in the study. Standard University custodial
      arrangements will apply.

      For samples from individuals who did not give consent for samples to be stored for the
