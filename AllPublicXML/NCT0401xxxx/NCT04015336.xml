  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The therapy used in this study is called E7 TCR T cell therapy. This therapy is a type of
      treatment in which a participant s T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the
      laboratory to attack cancer cells. This treatment might help people with human papilloma
      virus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal cancer. Oropharyngeal cancer is a type of head and neck
      cancer that happens in the oropharynx (the part of the throat at the back of the mouth,
      including the soft palate, the base of the tongue, and the tonsils). Certain types of the HPV
      virus can cause this kind of cancer. This study is looking at treatments for cancer caused by
      HPV-16.

      Objective:

      The purpose of this study is to determine if E7 TCR T cells can be given safely without
      delaying standard treatment for HPV-16 associated oropharyngeal cancer. Standard treatment
      may be surgery or radiation therapy with chemotherapy.

      Eligibility: People ages 18 and older with Stage II or III HPV-16 associated oropharyngeal
      cancer

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with HLA typing (a blood test needed for eligibility) and HPV
      testing of the cancer tumor (to determine if the cancer is HPV-16 positive). A new biopsy may
      be needed if tumor from an outside location is not available for HPV testing. Eligible
      participants will come to the NIH campus to have a screening evaluation which will include
      physical exam, review of medical history and current medications, blood and heart tests,
      imaging (X-ray, CT scan, MRI or PET scan), and evaluation of participant s veins that are
      used for drawing blood.

      If the participant is eligible for the study based on the screening evaluation, they will
      have a baseline evaluation prior to receiving the experimental treatment. The baseline
      evaluation may include additional laboratory or imaging tests.

      Participants will have a large IV catheter inserted into a vein to undergo a procedure called
      leukapheresis. Leukapheresis is the removal of the blood by a machine to collect specific
      blood cells. The remaining blood is returned to the body. This procedure is needed to collect
      the cells that will be modified to target the cancer. These cells will be grown in the lab
      and given back to the participant through an IV. It takes 11-15 days to grow the cells.

      While the cells are growing, the participant will be admitted to the hospital about one week
      before cell infusion. They will receive 2 types of chemotherapy through an IV catheter over 5
      days. The main purpose of the chemotherapy is to make the cells more effective in fighting
      the cancer tumors. The cells will be given through an IV catheter 1-3 days after the last
      dose of chemotherapy. Within 24 hours after the cell infusion, participants will be given a
      cell growth factor called aldesleukin through an IV. Aldesleukin is thought to help the cells
      live longer in the participant s body. Participants will recover in the hospital until they
      are well enough to go home. This is usually about 7-12 days after the cell infusion or last
      dose of aldesleukin.

      Participants will have follow-up visits starting every 2 weeks after the date of cell
      infusion. These will be visits to monitor the safety of the treatment and to evaluate the
      response of the cancer to the treatment. These visits will continue if the cancer is
      shrinking. The participant will go back to their local cancer doctor for further care if the
      cancer stops shrinking, goes away completely or gets bigger.

      Participants will have blood drawn periodically to test if the cells have grown or changed.
      These blood tests will take place immediately before the cells are given, and then at 3, 6,
      12 months for the first year and then annually. These tests can be drawn locally and sent to
      the NIH. Participants will be asked to return to the NIH annually for a physical examination
      for 5 years after they receive the cells. After that time, participants will be asked to
      fill-out a questionnaire for the next ten years, for a total follow-up period of 15 years.

      Background:

        -  Human papillomavirus (HPV)+ oropharyngeal cancer is an increasingly common type of
           cancer that frequently affects young patients.

        -  The treatment for locoregionally advanced cancer carries substantial life-long
           morbidity.

        -  Although the overall prognosis for HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer is favorable, about 20
           percent of patients with stage II disease and 35 percent of patients with stage III
           disease will die within five years.

        -  Induction therapy is an area of active study in this type of cancer. The aims of
           induction therapy are to reduce the risk of disease recurrence and potentially to permit
           the study of de-intensified definitive treatment of locoregional disease.

        -  E7 TCR T cells, administered as a single infusion, have demonstrated safety and clinical
           activity in treatment-refractory metastatic HPV+ cancers.

      Objectives:

      -To determine the feasibility of systemic treatment with E7 TCR T cells for stage II or stage
      III HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients greater than or equal to 18 years old with stage II or stage III HPV+
           oropharyngeal cancer.

        -  The cancer must be HPV16+ and patient must be HLA-A 02:01+ HLA type.

        -  Patients must be treatment-naive.

      Design:

        -  This is a phase II, single arm, feasibility study of induction E7 TCR T cell therapy.

        -  Patients will receive a conditioning regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, a
           single infusion of E7 TCR T cells, and systemic aldesleukin.

        -  Patients will be referred for standard of care definitive therapy (chemoradiation or
           surgery) at the time of maximum tumor response

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed stage II or stage III (AJCC 8th edition)
             oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma that has not been treated.

          -  HPV16+ tumor and HLA-A 02:01+ HLA type (HLA-A 02 is also acceptable for determination
             of eligibility).

          -  Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria.

          -  Patient age 18 and older. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently
             available on the use of E7 TCR T Cells in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are
             excluded from this study. This reflects the age range of patients with the disease
             being studied.

          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because E7 TCR T
             Cells have unknown potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Women of
             child-bearing potential are defined as all women who are not post-menopausal or who
             have not had a hysterectomy. Postmenopausal will be defined as women over the age of
             55 who have not had a menstrual period in at least 1 year.

          -  The effects of E7 TCR T Cells on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this
             reason and because the chemotherapy agents used in this trial are known to be
             teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (intrauterine device, hormonal or barrier method of birth control;
             abstinence; tubal ligation or vasectomy) prior to study entry and for four months
             after treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she
             or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating
             physician immediately.

          -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. The experimental treatment being evaluated in this
             protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV seropositive can
             have decreased immune-competence and thus be less responsive to the experimental
             treatment.

          -  Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen and hepatitis C antibody. If hepatitis C antibody
             test is positive, then the patient must be tested for the presence of antigen by
             RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.

          -  Must be willing to participate in Gene Therapy Long Term Followup Protocol, which will
             follow patients for up to 15 years per Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
             requirements.

          -  Patients must have organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  leukocytes- greater than or equal to 3,000/mcL

               -  absolute neutrophil count- greater than or equal to 1,500/mcL

               -  platelets- greater than or equal to 100,000/mcL

               -  hemoglobin- greater than or equal to 9.0 g/dL

               -  total bilirubin- within normal institutional limits except in patients with
                  Gilbert s Syndrome who must have a total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT)- Serum ALT/AST &lt; 2.5 times ULN

               -  creatinine clearance- Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt;50mL/min/1.73m(2)
                  for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal (by the Chronic
                  Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation)

          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed
             consent document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  History of severe allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
             biologic composition to agents used in study.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations at the time of treatment that
             would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  There is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary
             to treatment of the mother with E7 TCR T Cells. For this reason, women may not
             breastfeed while receiving study treatment and for one year after the study treatment
             ends. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.

          -  Patients with any form of systemic immunodeficiency, including acquired deficiency
             such as HIV or primary immunodeficiency such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency
             Disease, are ineligible. The experimental treatment being evaluated in this protocol
             depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune competence may
             be less responsive to the treatment.

          -  Current use of immunosuppressive medication, EXCEPT for the following:

               -  Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injection (e.g.,
                  intra-articular injection);

               -  Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses less than equal to 10 mg/day of
                  prednisone or equivalent;

               -  Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT scan
                  premedication)

          -  Patients with autoimmune diseases such as Crohn s disease, ulcerative colitis,
             rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune pancreatitis, or systemic lupus
             erythematosus. Hypothyroidism, vitiligo and other minor autoimmune disorders are not
             exclusionary.

          -  Patients with a second active invasive cancer are not eligible if it may confound
             assessment of response to the current therapy.

          -  Patients who do not have a local physician to provide standard therapy post treatment.
