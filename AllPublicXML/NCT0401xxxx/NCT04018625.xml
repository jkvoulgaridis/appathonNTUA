  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present trial will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of
      inter-net-delivered mind-body program for prenatal maternal stress. The Stress Managment and
      Resiliency Training Program (SMART-Pregnancy program) is a 8-session Cognitive Behavior
      Therapy (CBT) based program which teaches strategies for eliciting the relaxation response,
      improving cognitive flexibility and developing adaptive coping strategies. Sixty pregnant
      women (&lt;20 weeks Estimated Gestational Age) will be screened and either enrolled in the
      online SMART Pregnancy program or referred for treatment as usual. Outcomes, including
      maternal perceived stress, depression and anxiety will be assessed at 8-weeks and 20-weeks
      post randomization. Potential impact on infant health outcomes will be assessed via
      post-delivery electronic medical record review.

      Aim 1: The investigators will conduct a randomized clinical trial (RCT; n=60) to assess the
      feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the Stress Management and Resillency
      Training program (SMART Pregnancy) delivered online versus treatment as usual (TAU). It is
      expected that SMART-pregnancy participants will demonstrate high levels of treatment
      engagement and adherence. It is predicted that participants in the SMART-Pregnancy condition
      will demonstrate improvements in emotional distress and stress regulation (as indexed by hair
      cortisol concentrations) at post-treatment and 3 month follow-up. Aim 2: The investigators
      will conduct a postnatal chart review to explore secondary treatment benefits including
      pre-and postnatal maternal health and birth outcomes.
