      The effects of different carrier frequencies of interferential current on pain and function
      in patients with knee arthrosis will be compared

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      60 patients with knee osteoarhthritis will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will be
      randomized to 3 groups. All patients will receive interferential currents to both their
      knees, with different carrier frequencies (2, 4 and 8 kilohertz (kHz) respectively). The
      effect of different types of carrier frequencies on pain, 10 meter walk test will be
      analysed.

    <time_frame>At baseline, on the 3rd week visit (last day of interference therapy) and on the 7th week visit</time_frame>
    <description>A visual analog scale value between 0-10. 0 meaning lack of pain and 10 meaning the worst pain the patient has experienced.</description>

    <measure>Change in functional status levels according to Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arhtiritis Incex (WOMAC) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, on the 3rd week visit (last day of interference therapy) and on the 7th week visit</time_frame>
    <description>Womac scale is a questionnaire assessing patients' level of pain and functional status. Scores. Scores range from 0 to 96, 0 representing best and 96 representing worst scores. Pain, stiffness and functional limitation subscores are added up to obtain a total WOMAC score.</description>
