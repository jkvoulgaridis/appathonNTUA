  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the clinical efficacy of online cognitive behavioural therapy supplemented with
      online neurocognitive remediation therapy to improve mood and cognition, decrease relapse
      rates and optimise work and occupational functioning.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is the most prevalent mental disorder with high relapse rates. Direct costs to
      Europe represent 1% of its total economy. Following usual treatment, mood improves or fully
      recovers but cognitive deficits often persist, preventing full return to normal social
      function. These deficits worsen with repeated depressive episodes and are a significant
      predictor of relapse. Preventing depression relapse remains one of the biggest therapeutic
      challenges in the field. While effective short-term therapies, such as cognitive behavioural
      therapy (CBT), exist, all are associated with high relapse rates. Online neurocognitive
      remediation therapy (oNCRT), by its potential to rehabilitate impaired cognition in
      depression, offers an innovative solution to this mental health problem.

      This trial aims to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of neurocognitively enhanced
      online CBT to improve mood and cognition in depression, optimise everyday functioning and
      prevent depression relapse over six months follow-up, using a randomised active-control
      parallel-groups research design. Individuals presenting with at least mild depression (n=134)
      are randomly assigned to one of two treatment allocations: online CBT (oCBT) or
      neurocognitively enhanced online CBT (oCBT+oNCRT) for 20 one-hour sessions over 5 weeks
      (i.e., four weekly sessions).

      Before randomisation and within a week of the final allocated session, mood, attention,
      memory and planning abilities will be assessed. All participants will be then followed for
      six-months to determine if the mood and cognitive benefits of the oCBT+oNCRT are maintained
      with the passage of time compared to the control group (oCBT alone). Standard measures of
      daily functioning (e.g., work ability, occupational function) and economic cost-effectiveness
      data will be obtained at the same time points. Demonstrating the oNCRT effectiveness as an
      adjunct to CBT will contribute towards optimising connected healthcare solutions for
      depression.

    <description>The Beck's Inventory for Depression - II (BDI-II; Beck et al., 1996) assesses the self-report severity of currently experienced depressive symptoms. The total score of 21 items is used.The scale score ranges 0 to 63, with higher values indicating more severe depression. Scores are to be interpreted as follows: 0-8: no depression; 9-13: subsyndromal depressive symptoms; 14-19: mild depression; 20-28: moderate depression; 29-63: severe depression.</description>

    <description>oCBT: MoodGym is a 5-week oCBT program developed by the Centre for Mental Health Research at the Australian National University. This program has been shown to be clinically effective at reducing mood symptoms in depression studies (see meta-analytical review of Twomey &amp; O'Reilly, 2017). MoodGym consists of a number of interactive modules to be completed sequentially and including work on own feelings, thoughts, methods to change dysfunctional thinking patterns, de-stressing, and relaxation. Each module is followed by an associated practical homework, while a personalised workbook allows the participant to track their mood profile and progress throughout the modules.</description>

    <description>NCRT involves the behavioural application of structured exercises targeting neurocognitive processes by mobilising neuroplasticity that is the brain's ability to adjust its function in response to environmental change. Computerised NCRT has demonstrated efficacy to improve attention, working memory and global functioning in depression (Motter et al., 2016; Semkovska et al., 2015). NCRT is delivered through the Cognifit online programme. The Cognifit modules were selected as targeting remediation of neurocognitive domains known to be impaired in depression, i.e. selective and divided attention, visual and verbal working memory, and everyday planning (Hammar and Ardal, 2009; Semkovska et al., 2019).</description>
