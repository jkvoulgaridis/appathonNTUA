  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Movement disorders are neurological syndromes leading to excessive movements or to limited
      control of voluntary and automatic movements. Many of these disorders are not
      life-threatening but represent serious difficulties in carrying out the activities of daily
      living and reduce patient's independence and quality of life.

      This project NeuroMOD (neuromodulation for patients with disorders of motor control) proposes
      the development of a neuromodulation-based platform for the rehabilitation and restoration of
      motor and cognitive functions of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD). Our
      project will focus on the application of a novel neurorehabilitation strategy, its functional
      and clinical validation, and on the evaluation of the impact of the use of the technologies
      involved in the musculoskeletal and the nervous system as well as user behavior.

      Parkinson's disease was selected as target pathology since it represents a paradigm of motor
      disorder diseases.

      Parkinson's disease affects adults and has a very high prevalence and a very high functional
      impact.

      In order to achieve this objective, we have defined the following research areas:

      Subproject 1. NeuroMOD: development of a neuromodulation platform composed by a TMS system,
      and an EMG (electromyography) and EEG (electroencephalography) system in combination with a
      system of virtual reality based on immersive glasses.

      Subproject 2. NeuroMOD-PD: development of therapies and evaluation of clinical evidence and
      motor and cognitive impact of NeuroMOD in the rehabilitation of patients suffering from
      Parkinson's disease impact.

      Subproject 3. NeuroMOD-Image: development of neuroimaging techniques to investigate the brain
      areas affected by the proposed therapies and temporary terms that neural plasticity is
      induced and evolves in Parkinson´s Disease.
