      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of an engineered donor graft
      (&quot;TregGraft&quot;, a T-cell-Depleted Graft With Additional Infusion of Conventional T Cells and
      Regulatory T Cells) in participants undergoing myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell
      transplant transplantation for hematologic malignancies.

    <description>This is a non-randomized, single-arm study. Patients will be grouped based on their underlying disease:
Group 1 will enroll subjects planning to undergo myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (MA-alloHCT) for the treatment of either acute myeloid, lymphoid or mixed phenotype leukemia in complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), and with no known minimal residual disease positivity.
Group 2 will enroll subjects Subjects planning to undergo MA-alloHCT for acute myeloid, lymphoid or mixed phenotype leukemia that is either:
not in morphologic CR with bone marrow infiltration by leukemic blasts of &lt;= 10%, or
in morphologic CR with evidence of minimal residual positivity by either multiparameter flow cytometric analysis or by a nucleic acid-based technique.
Group 3 will enroll subjects planning to MA-alloHCT for high or very high risk myelodysplasic syndrome (MDS) myelodysplastic syndromes.</description>

               -  acute myeloid, lymphoid or mixed phenotype leukemia

               -  high or very high risk myelodysplastic syndromes

          2. Patients with active acute leukemia (i.e. not in morphologic complete response) must
             have bone marrow infiltration by leukemic blasts of &lt;= 10%,

          3. Patients must be matched to a related or unrelated donor

          4. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &gt; 50 mL/minute

          8. Uncontrolled bacterial, viral or fungal infections (currently taking antimicrobial
             therapy and with progression or no clinical improvement) at time of enrollment

          9. Seropositive for HIV-1 or -2 antibody, HTLV-1 or -2 antibody, Hepatitis B sAg, or
             Hepatitis C antibody

         10. Any uncontrolled autoimmune disease requiring active immunosuppressive treatment

         11. Concurrent malignancies or active disease within 1 year, except non-melanoma skin
             cancers that have been curatively resected

         12. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding
