  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignant tumor that originates in nasopharyngeal
      epithelial cells. It is common in southern China and Southeast Asia, but the incidence rate
      is low in most parts of the world. According to the World Health Organization survey, 80% of
      nasopharyngeal carcinomas occur in China, with high incidence in southern China, as high as
      30-50/100,000, such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Fujian. In 2015, Chinese cancer
      statistics showed that there were about 60,600 new cases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in
      China, and the number of deaths was about 34,100. Radiation therapy is the main treatment for
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Early stage I and IIa achieved a 5-year survival rate (OS) of 90%
      and 84%, respectively . However, the treatment outcomes of most patients with locally
      advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma are not ideal.
