  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a first-in-human (FIH) study which is required to understand the PK
      characteristics, MTD, and safety profile of NOV1601(CHC2014) in subjects with solid organ
      malignancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is the first-in-human, Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study to
      investigate the safety, tolerability, PK, and clinical activity of NOV1601(CHC2014) in
      subjects with solid organ malignancies. The primary goal of the study is to determine the
      RP2D of NOV1601(CHC2014) in adult subjects with solid organ malignancies.

      Dose escalation will follow a 3+3 design and will be based on prior cohort review. There will
      be 2 branches of the dosing schedule, once a day(QD) and twice daily(BID).

        Inclusion Criteria(partial):

          -  Pathological confirmation of malignancy and evidence of metastatic or surgically
             unresectable disease

          -  At least one evaluable or measurable lesion should be present and identified according

                  drugs for symptom control at least 2 weeks prior to starting the treatment

               -  Stable dose of glucocorticoids and analgesic drugs for symptom control should be
                  maintained throughout the study

               -  Subjects should be off from radiotherapy for at least 14 days prior to the start
