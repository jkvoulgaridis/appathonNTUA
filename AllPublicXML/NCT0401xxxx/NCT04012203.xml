  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the evolution of sensory, motor and tissue variables following
      exercise-induced pain in wrist extensor muscles in healthy subjects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine how is the normalization process of sensory (pressure
      pain thresholds, subjective pain sensation, self-recovery perception), motor (maximal
      isometric strength, active range of motion, manual dexterity) and tissue (myotonometer)
      variables after an experimental pain model in the extensor forearms muscles, by delayed onset
      muscle soreness after an eccentric exercise in healthy subjects. This way will be possible to
      establish 1) if there are differences in the time of normalization for each variable; 2) if
      there is a correlation between each variable and self-recovery perception.

      Seven assessment sessions are performed in a 14-days period. Day 0 (baseline assessment 1),
      Day 7 (baseline assessment 2, pre exercise), Day 7 (post exercise), Day 8 (24-hours post
      exercise), Day 9 (48-hours post exercise), Day 10 (72-hours post exercise), Day 14 (1-week
      post exercise).
