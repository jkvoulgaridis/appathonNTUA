  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this trial is to investigate the relative bioavailability of BI 1323495
      in plasma when given as oral single dose together with multiple oral doses of itraconazole
      (Test,T) as compared to when given alone as oral single dose (Reference, R).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including Blood pressure (BP), Pulse rate

          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsade de Pointes (such as heart failure,
             hypokalaemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)

          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,
             because the subject is not considered able to understand and comply with study
             requirements, or has a condition that would not allow safe participation in the study
