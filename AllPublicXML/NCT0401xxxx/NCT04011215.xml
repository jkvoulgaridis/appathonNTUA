  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a sequentially recruited, cross-over-cohort, outpatient-based evaluation of the
      effectiveness of wool clothing, as compared to standard clothing, in reducing the severity of
      childhood atopic dermatitis (eczema) over two consecutive six-week periods.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will aim for a sample size of approximately 150 participants (equally distributed
      between 3 international sites) between the ages of 3 months and 5 years referred to the
      respective Dermatology Departments for management of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.
      They will be sequentially recruited and randomized to the wool-to-standard clothing arm or
      standard clothing-to-wool arm.

      The study will run for 12 weeks for each participant with two consecutive 6-week periods for
      each intervention, either of wool followed by standard clothing or standard followed by wool
      clothing. Participants will be assessed by a blinded trained researcher, at their initial
      appointment, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 9 weeks and 12 weeks post commencement of the first
      intervention.

      The primary outcome is the severity of atopic dermatitis at 6 weeks post commencement of each
      intervention i.e.at week 6 and week 12. Severity of atopic eczema will be measured using the
      Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI).

      Secondary outcomes include the severity and change in the severity of eczema using the EASI
      at 3 weeks, the validated Investigators Global Assessment for atopic dermatitis (vIGA-AD™)
      score and quality of life assessment using the children's Dermatology Life Quality Index
      (cDLQI) at 3 and 6 weeks of each 6 week intervention period, as well as weekly Patient
      Oriented SCORing Atopic Dermatitis index (PO-SCORAD) scores.

    <time_frame>week 3 of each 6 week period (ie week 6 and 12)</time_frame>
    <description>blinded assessor administered EASI (units on a scale), will assess change from baseline. A score is obtained ranging from 0-72 based on erythema, papulation, excoriation and lichenification, each graded 0-3 for each of four body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk, lower limbs) that are weighted according to surface area representation. A higher number indicates increased severity.</description>

    <time_frame>week 3, 6, 9, 12</time_frame>
    <description>blinded assessor administered vIGA-AD™ score (units on a scale), will assess change from baseline. This score assesses erythema, induration/papulation, lichenification and oozing/crusting on ascale of 0 to 4. A high score reflects greater severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (cDLQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>week 3, 6, 9, 12</time_frame>
    <description>patient administered cDLQI questionnaire (units on a scale), will assess change from baseline. Ten questions are each scored from 0 to 3, the total score ranging from 0-30. A higher score reflects greater impairment of quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Oriented SCORing Atopic Dermatitis score (PO-SCORAD)</measure>
    <time_frame>weekly over 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>patient completed PO-SCORAD score (units on a scale). It measures global severity using a scale ranging from 0 to 103, based on disease extent, six morphological parameters and two subjective markers (itch and sleep disturbance). High scores reflect greater severity.</description>

    <description>Standard clothing refers to the clothing normally worn by the infant/child. This will not be superfine merino wool as superfine merino is not generally available for baby wear. The exact nature of the standard clothing will be recorded by investigators. From previous data we expect it to be primarily cotton.</description>
