  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Of the 795,000 people who experience a stroke every year in the US, only a small percentage
      will achieve full recovery. While current therapies promote strength and endurance, none
      directly address the unique potential of the brain to reorganize following injury. The goal
      of this project is to explore the effects of a novel therapy, acute intermittent hypoxia
      (AIH). During this therapy, individuals receive brief bouts of reduced oxygen levels by
      inhalation through a face mask. (This is akin to being on top of a tall mountain). In brief
      exposures, AIH is known to trigger the release of specific proteins that help the brain adapt
      to oxygen reductions. Published results in people with incomplete spinal cord injury have
      shown that AIH enhances muscle strength and coordination rather quickly. The research team
      aims to study the effects of AIH in stroke survivors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the second leading cause of death and a leading cause of long-term disability
      worldwide. Despite the spontaneous recovery that occurs following a hemispheric stroke, more
      than half of stroke patients show substantial residual impairments, imposing a significant
      human and economic burden. This burden is likely to increase in coming decades, due to a
      rapidly aging population, and the associated progression of cardiovascular risk factors.
      Accordingly, new interventions to alleviate impairment in stroke survivors are urgently
      needed. The development and testing of one such novel intervention, termed Acute Intermittent
      Hypoxia (AIH), is the primary focus of this AHA Innovative Project Award.

      The aim is to answer questions related to safety and preliminary efficacy of AIH in stroke
      survivors. First, the Investigators will establish whether brief reductions in inhaled oxygen
      concentration can be safely tolerated in stroke survivors. A clinician will closely monitor
      subjects for any adverse events.

      The second aim is to establish the effects of AIH on elbow flexion/extension strength, and on
      hand grip and pinch strength. Subjects will be monitored closely for any adverse events
      during these experiments. Data will be analyzed to determine if there is an improvement in
      key outcomes at any dose level.

    <measure>National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 days</time_frame>
    <description>is a tool used by healthcare providers to objectively quantify the impairment caused by a stroke. The NIHSS is composed of 11 items, each of which scores a specific ability between a 0 and 4. For each item, a score of 0 typically indicates normal function in that specific ability, while a higher score is indicative of some level of impairment. The individual scores from each item are summed in order to calculate a patient's total NIHSS score ranging from 0-42.</description>

    <description>During each session, study participants will receive a single sequence of AIH, consisting of 15 x 60-seconds periods of hypoxia alternating with 90-seconds of normoxia (21% O2), for a total of 30 minutes, whilst in a seated upright position. AIH will be applied by directing gas flow to a reservoir bag connected via plastic tubing to a non re-breathing facemask/respiratory valve system while the participants are in a seated position. Defined gas mixtures will be delivered by manual adjustment of one-way valves attached to a hypoxia generator.</description>

    <description>An oxygen monitor will continuously measure and record the fraction of inspired oxygen delivered to the subject. Inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO2) of the gas mixture will be individually adjusted using the valve settings to reach the targeted SpO2. The gas mixtures administered during the four sessions will be 21% O2 (target SpO2 = 95%), 17% O2 (target SpO2 = 92%), 13% O2 (target SpO2 = 87%) and 9% O2 (target SpO2 = 82%).</description>
