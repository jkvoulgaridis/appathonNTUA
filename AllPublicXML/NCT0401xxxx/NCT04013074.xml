  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All consecutive patients with cirrhosis of liver who satisfy the criteria will be included
      and will be evaluated clinically along with all routine investigations and standard medical
      therapy will be continued among these patients. The patients between 18-60 yrs of age
      (cirrhosis diagnosed on the basis of clinical, biochemical, fibroscan &amp; imaging.) , with
      ascites and HVPG (Hepatic Venous Pressure Gradient) &gt;12, with 2 or more large volume
      paracentesis in last 3 month . CTP ≥ 7-13 will be considered for the study.

      At baseline, a complete history of the cause of cirrhosis of liver with clinical and physical
      examination, a record of demographic profile, standard of care biochemical investigations
      would be done.

      In this study patients who satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria as mentioned below
      will be enrolled to receive either standard medical therapy with Large volume paracentesis
      and albumin infusion or to be randomised to receive TIPS (Transjugular Intrahepatic
      Portosystemic Shunt).

      The patients in group A will be given standard medical therapy only included as per
      requirement nutritional therapy (high calorie intake- 2400 Kcal/ day) as and when required
      Large Volume Paracentesis (LVP) and albumin infusion and diuretics.
