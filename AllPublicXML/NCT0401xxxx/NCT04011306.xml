  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this feasibility study is to evaluate safety and effectiveness in
      healing outcomes of patients treated with Lumina24TM BLU (treatment), a Continuous
      Low-Irradiance Phototherapy (CLIP) device, as compared to standard of care (SOC) therapy
      (control) for the treatment of acute burns.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This feasibility study will consist of up to 15 subjects (Cohort I: up to 10 subjects with
      partial thickness second-degree burns; Cohort II: up to 5 subjects with deep partial
      thickness second- and/or full thickness third-degree burns). Each subject will be randomized
      to receive standard of care dressing on approximately half of the study burn site, and
      Lumina24TM BLU treatment on the remaining half of the study burn site. If the subject has
      bilaterally symmetric burns, they will be randomized to receive SOC or Lumina24TM BLU at the
      distinct anatomical burn locations (e.g. right/left thigh, right/left shoulder, etc.). The
      proposed feasibility study will inform critical primary and secondary outcome measures and
      procedural improvements necessary for a pivotal clinical study that would demonstrate both
      antimicrobial effectiveness and improved wound healing of acute burn wounds.
