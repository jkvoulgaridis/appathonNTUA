      This is an observational, prospective, consecutively enrolled, single-arm, multi-site
      registry of the use of the DABRA Laser System and other medical devices intended for
      endovascular treatment of peripheral artery disease.

      This study covers the use of endovascular devices including the DABRA Laser System and other
      devices commercially used in the United States for the treatment of lower extremity PAD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant's age ≥ 22 years.

          -  Participant presents with a Rutherford category of 2 to 6.

          -  Participant has at least one peripheral lesion, ≤ 140mm, in a native vessel that is
             treated successfully with DABRA Laser System.

          -  Participant is able and willing to be anti-coagulated.

          -  Ability and willingness of participant to give written informed consent and comply
             with follow-up.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant, breastfeeding, planning to become pregnant - If women of reproductive
             capability will be enrolled, status will be assessed via pregnancy testing. Subject
             must agree to use effective birth control measures for duration of study. Pregnancy
             during study must be reported immediately.

          -  Endovascular interventions within 90 days prior to study enrollment (on leg to be
             treated).

          -  Participation in another cardiovascular or peripheral vascular study that might, in
             the judgement of the Investigator, affect the results of the study.

          -  Disorders or allergies precluding use of radiographic contrast including renal
             insufficiency severe enough to contraindicate use of radiographic contrast.

          -  Inability or unwillingness of the patient to comply with study examinations.

          -  Necrosis necessitating major amputation.

          -  Subject has an anticipated life span of less than one (1) year.

          -  Medically non-compliant subjects, based on Investigator judgment (e.g., subject is
             non-compliant in following medical advice regarding blood pressure medication,
             cholesterol medication, and/or maintenance of healthy blood sugar levels).

          -  No run-off vessel is present when treating above the knee. A run-off vessel is
             required when treating above the knee, however, it is not required when treating below
             the knee.
