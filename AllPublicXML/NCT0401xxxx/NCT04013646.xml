  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a clinical trial for the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of
      umbilical cord blood (UCB) therapy, UCB and erythropoietin (EPO) combination therapy in adult
      stroke patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      UCB is a high-quality source of mesenchymal stem cells, and studies are being actively
      developed for stroke patients. UCB therapy has a neuroprotective effect through
      anti-inflammatory effect and anti-apoptosis.

      However, UCB alone has not been able to provide sufficient improvement and is being studied
      for combination therapies with growth factors that can exert its effects. Among the various
      growth factors, EPO is a powerful factor that can act as a neurotrophic factor in neurons,
      astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, endothelial cells, and neural stem/precursor cells.

      In our previous study of subacute stroke animal models, investigators confirmed that the
      combined administration of UCB and EPO improved the behavioral assessment (mNSS, Cylinder
      test) compared to UCB only administration.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the difference in therapeutic effects between UCB
      alone therapy and UCB and EPO combination therapy.
