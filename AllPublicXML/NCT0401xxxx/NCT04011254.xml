      1. Assessing how the rapid removal of salt and water by haemodialysis alters regional brain
           activity (by measurement of the brain blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal using
           functional MRI) during tasting of soup of differing salt concentrations.

        2. Identify differences in the brain response to salt taste pre- and post-haemodialysis
           between haemodialysis patients who are either able or unable to control between dialysis
           weight gain

      HeMSA Study Phase 2 Up to 20 male, haemodialysis patient who have average %IDWG &gt;4% will be
      recruited with the target, to proceed to scanning, of 14 patients. Following consent the
      patients will complete questionnaires (including Salt intake questionnaire - DSQ (Gkza and
      Davenport, 2017), Edinburgh handedness questionnaire (Oldfield, 1971), MRI checklist) and
      undergo salt taste preference and threshold testing during a 1 hour session prior to
      dialysis. The purpose of this visit is to establish the tasteless solution and 2 soup salt
      concentrations to be used in the salt taste fMRI paradigm, obtain baseline data regarding
      estimate of salt intake and ensure MRI is safe for this patient.

      Patients will then attend 2 MRI scanning visits at the Hammersmith Hospital Imperial Campus,
      one the morning immediately before haemodialysis and one the morning after haemodialysis.
      Prior to the MRI session, at the Imperial College Clinical Research Facility, the patient
      will undergo various clinical assessments and have venous blood samples taken. The MRI will
      be undertaken at the Imperial College Clinical Imaging Facility using a Siemens 3T Verio
      scanner. During the scan subjects will taste, via a taste delivery system, aliquots of
      tasteless solution, sucralose, and 2 soup with different concentrations of salt. Solutions
      will be delivered in a block design.

      HeMSA Study Phase 3 3 groups (healthy controls, haemodialysis (HD) patients with %IDWG &lt;4%,
      haemodialysis patients with %IDWG &gt;4% - patients froms phase 2 will contribute to the latter
      group) Protocol will follow that for HeMSA Phase 2. Healthy controls will also have 2 study
      visits at a similar period apart to the HD participants.
