  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social inequalities in the face of cancer are significant in all countries. They are
      characterized by higher mortality among people may be in the lower socioeconomic category.
      The care pathway may also be a source of inequality or accentuate inequalities. Socially
      vulnerable patients must be provided with appropriate care. It is therefore necessary to
      identify patients with such social vulnerabilities as early as possible and to take them into
      account throughout the care process. To meet this need, the DEFCO project (&quot;Detection of
      social frailties and coordination of the path of patients in cancer: a new approach by an
      expert computer system&quot;) was designed and conducted by the Centre Hygée at the Lucien
      Neuwirth Cancer Institute (ICLN) in 2014 and 2015, in partnership with an industrial
      engineering research laboratory, the DISP (&quot;Décision &amp; Information pour les Systèmes de
      Production&quot;). Its objective was to develop a tool for systematic screening of social
      fragility, involving few caregivers and making it possible to identify patients most at risk
      of social maladjustment. The choice was made to develop a self-administered questionnaire
      using tablets connected to a neural network. Since its implementation, the deployment of the
      DEFCO project (&quot;Detection of social frailties and coordination of the path of patients in
      cancer: a new approach by an expert computer system&quot;) tool at the Lucien Neuwirth Cancer
      Institute (ICLN) has required several training and awareness-raising activities to strengthen
      the motivation of the various stakeholders. These same actors have also implemented different
      strategies to optimize the functioning of the tool. Developed in a specialized institution,
      this tool must demonstrate, in this second stage of the project, it transferability and it
      possibilities of implementation in other structures. It is also necessary to evaluate it in
      terms of it is impact, particularly on the fluidity of care pathways and on the social
      consequences of the disease.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the implementation of the DEFCO (&quot;Detection of social
      frailties and coordination of the path of patients in cancer: a new approach by an expert
      computer system&quot;) social fragility tracking tool over one year.
