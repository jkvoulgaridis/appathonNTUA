  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a novel BTK inhibitor, ICP-022. During this study, dose
      escalation will be conducted in patients diagnosed with refractory/relapsed (r/r) B-cell
      malignancies including only patients with Grades1-3a follicular lymphoma (FL); marginal zone
      lymphoma (MZL); mantle cell lymphoma (MCL); and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small
      lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL).
