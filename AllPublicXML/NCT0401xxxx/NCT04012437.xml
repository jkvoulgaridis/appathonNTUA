      Randomized control trial to determine if we can produce increases in the IELT using a new
      masturbator electronic in subjects with premature ejaculation in combination with a exercise
      app, producing improvements in the quality and satisfaction of the sexuality of the patient.

      This project of research will use one experimental groups, It will manage the affairs the
      therapy &quot;sphincter control training&quot; (SCT) into app combined with the external device called
      Myhixel I .Experimental groups will receive therapy with the protocol of exercises SCT.

      The main measure will be the &quot;fold increase&quot; (FI) of the IELT, which was calculated using the
      geometric mean of post-treatment IELTs (period B) divided by the geometric mean of
      pre-treatment IELTs (period A): FI = (geometric mean of IELT_7wk)/(geometric mean of
      PRE_IELT)

      The efficiency on the EP will see (IELT) reflected in an increase in the times of latency of
      intravaginal ejaculation and in punctuations of subjective perception, of the therapy on the
      line base.

      The subjects that will be born in mind will be all the interested parties in informing that
      their answer to the campaign of national advertising that will be started.

      The duration of the treatment will be 8 weeks during which a series of exercises app will be
      practised usin the masturbation device Myhixel I.

      The material used in the research will be innocuous and his responsible use does not produce
      adverse reactions of interest.

Its objective is to provide patients with greater knowledge, awareness, and control of the external urethral sphincter. The groups use of a masturbation aid device called Myhixel I from the spanish company New Wellness Concept SL.</description>
