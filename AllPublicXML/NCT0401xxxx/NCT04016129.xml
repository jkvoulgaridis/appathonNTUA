  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate safety and efficacy of a combination of 4th generation chimeric
      antigen receptor gene-modified T cells targeting CD19 negative ALL that express CD22, CD123,
      CD38, CD10, CD20 and TSLPR, as many patients developed CD19-negative disease after CD19 CART
      immunotherapy. Clinical response and development of a standardized lentiviral vector and cell
      production protocol will be investigated. This is a phase I/II trial enrolling patients from
      multiple clinical centers.

    <textblock>
      Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy has demonstrated unprecedented treatment
      responses in relapsing/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL). However,
      many studies have reported that a subset of patients still relapse and about 30-50% of those
      relapses are characterized by the loss of CD19 surface antigen. Patients with CD19-negative
      relapse after CD19 CAR-T-cell therapy usually have a poor prognosis. The mechanisms
      underlying CD19-negative relapses are not fully understood and it is important to develop
      solutions to supplement post-CD19 immunotherapies.

      Potential markers for recurrent leukemic blasts in an emerging CD19-negative blast population
      include many known B-cell lineage antigens. To prevent further target escape and improve the
      therapeutic effects, CAR gene-modified T cells targeting CD22, CD123, CD38, CD10, CD20 or
      TSLPR have been considered in post CD19 CAR-T immunotherapy. This study aims to evaluate
      safety and efficacy of administrating one or multiple non-CD19 targeting CAR-T cells to
      patients with CD19-negative B cell malignancies.
