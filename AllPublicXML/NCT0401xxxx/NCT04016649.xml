      Non-interventional study aiming to ascertain the mechanical properties of human saphenous and
      popliteal vein tissue.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to mechanically characterise saphenous and popliteal vein segments
      that have been deemed waste following varicose vein procedures, lower limb amputation and
      lower limb bypass surgery.

      By characterising the stress-stretch relationship of the vein vessel wall, treatment
      techniques can be better understood. Mechanical device design can be bteer informed and the
      the suitability of vein as a conduit for bypass and AVF procedures can be assessed.

        Study population will consist of individuals under the care of a Vascular Consultant.
        Patients will be asked to participate if they are going for a procedure in which there will
        be vein tissue waste that would usually be discarded in the operating theatre. The
        procedures of interest are Varicose Vein Procedures, Lower Limb Amputation and Lower Limb
        Bypass Surgery.
