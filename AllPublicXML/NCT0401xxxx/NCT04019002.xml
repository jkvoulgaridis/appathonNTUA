  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether new metabolic imaging will be useful to
      physicians and patients with glioblastoma for making treatment decisions and seeing how well
      various types of treatment work. The goal is to improve the way patient care is managed in
      the future.

      If you chose to be in this study, you will be receiving novel magnetic resonance (MR)
      metabolic imaging with standard MR imaging. The research component includes an injection of
      an investigational agent, called hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate, to obtain dynamic metabolic
      imaging.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The new metabolic imaging will use hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate, which allows for pictures of
      the brain that we won't be able to get with standard imaging. Hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate has
      not been approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is available for
      research only. This investigational agent is a non-radioactive isotope of carbon.

      There are three groups in this study. Assignment to a study group depends on the status of
      your disease and the type of treatment you will be receiving.

      Subjects in Group 1 will have two MR examination time points. Each time point includes a
      hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate injection for research imaging as well as standard MR. The MR
      examinations will occur before receiving standard of care treatment with radiation and
      chemotherapy, and at the first post-radiation follow-up scan.

      Subjects in Group 2 will have one MR examination time point with hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate
      injection for research and standard MR. This MR examination occurs before surgery.

      Subjects in Group 3 will have three MR examination time points. Each time point includes a
      hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate injection for research imaging as well as standard MR. The MR
      examinations will occur prior to initiating therapy (baseline), at approximately 7-14 days
      after initiation of therapy, and 6-8 weeks after the initiation of therapy.
