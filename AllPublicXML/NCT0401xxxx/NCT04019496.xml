  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to improve the pathophysiological understanding of migraine in in a
      longitudinal observational study investigating changes of established neurophysiological and
      imaging parameters in line with changes of the clinical phenotype.

      The study's focus is the investigation of mechanisms that are directly related to the cyclic
      character of migraine and its core structures. In this context, the primary endpoint is a
      change in the nociceptive blink reflex, an established brain stem reflex to study the
      trigemino-spinal system, associated with changes in migraine frequency and severity. In order
      to reliably detect changes in the trigeminal pain system, investigations are performed in
      patients before starting a prophylactic therapy and 3 months afterwards. Several secondary
      endpoints are used to evaluate changes of multimodal sensory and cortical information
      processing. Cerebral imaging will include examinations of structural and network effects of
      altered migraine disease activity.

        All patients seen in the local headache clinic are screened for eligibility to participate
        the study. Clinical routine is not influenced by participation in this observational study,
        importantly choice of prophylactic treatment solely depends on the physician's and
        patient's decision based on national guidelines.
