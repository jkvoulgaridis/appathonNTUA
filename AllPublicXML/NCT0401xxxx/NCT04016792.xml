      analog classroom study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 200 mg/day SPN-812 compared to
      placebo in the treatment of children aged 6 through 11 years with ADHD.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female subjects, 6 to &lt;12 years of age at screening.

             with comorbidity of mild to moderate oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) according to
             the DSM-5, confirmed with the MINI-KID at screening.

          3. ADHD-RS-5 (Home Version: Child, Investigator Administered and Scored) score ≥28 at
             screening and at baseline (can be assessed 1 to 2 days before Visit 3).

          4. CGI-S score ≥ 4 at baseline (can be assessed 1 to 2 days before Visit 3).

          5. Body weight ≥ 20 kg.

          6. Free of medication for the treatment of ADHD for at least 1 week prior to
             randomization and agreement to remain so throughout participation in the study.

          7. Have the ability to complete PERMP assessments by qualifying for at least the Basic
             level at screening (see Section 6.1.2).

          8. Considered medically healthy by the Investigator via assessment of physical
             examination, medical and psychiatric histories, clinical laboratory tests, vital
             signs, and ECG.

          9. Written informed consent obtained from the subject's parent or legal representative,
             and written informed assent (if applicable) obtained from the subject.

         10. Subject and parent(s)/legal guardian(s) are willing and able to comply with all of the
             procedures and requirements defined in the protocol, including parents(s)/legal
             guardian(s) oversight of the morning dosing of SM.

         11. Subject has lived with the same parent(s)/legal guardian(s) for &gt; 6 months.

         12. FOCP must be either sexually inactive (abstinent) or, if sexually active, must agree
             to use one of the following highly effective contraceptive methods beginning 30 days
             prior to the first dose, throughout their participation in the study:

               1. Simultaneous use of male condom and intra-uterine contraceptive device placed at
                  least 4 weeks prior to the first SM administration;

               2. Surgically sterile male partner;

               3. Simultaneous use of male condom and diaphragm with spermicide;

               4. Established hormonal contraceptive.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current diagnosis of major psychiatric disorders or intellectual disabilities are
             excluded, including severe ODD, conduct disorder, autism spectrum disorders, simple
             phobias, or learning disorders. Subjects with a history of Major Depressive Disorder
             are eligible if the subject has not experienced an episode or required pharmacotherapy
             within the 6 months prior to the screening visit.

          2. Current diagnosis of major neurological disorders. Subjects with seizures or a history
             of seizure disorder within the immediate family (siblings, parents). Febrile seizures
             are not exclusionary and will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. If for any reason
             the subject received medication for a febrile seizure, this it will be exclusionary.

          3. Subject has failed two treatment courses (dose and duration) of stimulant or
             nonstimulant for ADHD; subjects who are treatment naïve are not excluded from
             participating.

          4. In the opinion of the investigator, current diagnosis of significant systemic disease.

          5. Body mass index greater than 95th percentile for the appropriate age and gender.

          6. At screening, uncontrolled thyroid disorder defined as thyroid stimulating hormone ≤
             0.8 x the lower limit of normal or ≥ 1.25 x the upper limit of normal for the
             reference laboratory.

          7. Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory test, urine test, ECG result, or
             physical exam finding that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with
             the safety of the subject.

          8. Evidence of suicidality (defined as either active suicidal plan/intent or active
             suicidal thoughts within the year prior to screening visit, or a lifetime suicide
             attempt).

          9. History of an allergic reaction to viloxazine or its excipients.

         10. Any food allergy, intolerance, restriction or special diet that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, could contraindicate the subject's participation in this study.

         11. Subjects who received any investigational drug within the longer of 30 days or 5
             half-lives prior to Day 2 dosing of SM.

         12. Subjects who participated in previous SPN-812 clinical trials.

         13. Subjects who have participated in another analog classroom study within 6 months prior
             to screening visit and subjects who have participated in more than one classroom
             study.

         14. Positive urine drug screen at screening visit. A positive test for amphetamines is not
             exclusionary for subjects receiving a stimulant ADHD medication at the time of the
             screening visit, however, an additional urine drug screen should be performed at Visit
             3. Subjects must discontinue all prohibited/ADHD medication (including stimulant,
             clonidine and guanfacine) at least 7 days prior to Visit 3.

         15. Pregnancy, breastfeeding, or refusal to practice abstinence or acceptable birth
             control during the study (for FOCP).

         16. Any reason that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would prevent the subject from
             participating in the study.

         17. Subjects currently taking specific concomitant medications known to be CYP1A2
             substrates (e.g., theophylline, melatonin, olanzapine, duloxetine).
