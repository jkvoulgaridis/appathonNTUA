  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The success of transplantation is significantly hindered by the lack of sufficient number of
      available donors. Many potential donor organs cannot be utilized in clinical transplantation
      because donors have chronic viral infections such as hepatitis C (HCV) infection. This study
      will test the possibility of safely transplanting organs from HCV-infected donors into
      HCV-uninfected recipients. Prior to transplantation, recipients will receive an initial dose
      of highly effective antiviral prophylaxis using approved direct-acting antivirals (DAAs)
      Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir (G/P) and they will also receive ezetimibe, a cholesterol-lowering
      medication that also blocks entry of HCV into liver cells. They will then receive daily
      dosing of the same medications for 7 days after transplant. The aim of the study is to show
      that transplantation of organs from HCV+ donors is safe in the era of DAAs. The investigators
      hypothesize that rates of HCV transmission to recipients will be prevented by the use of DAA
      prophylaxis and any HCV transmission that does occur will be readily treatable and curable.
      If successful, the knowledge from this study can have a large impact to patients with end
      stage organ diseases by providing a large novel source of donors for organ transplantations.

      The investigators aim to transplant 40 recipients with end-stage organ disease (20 lung, and
      20 other organs) using organs from HCV+ donors. Lungs to be used for transplantation will be
      exposed to ex vivo lung perfusion with use of ultraviolet C light during perfusion if
      clinically indicated for lung-related outcomes (ie. not determined by the study
      investigators). Ex vivo organ perfusion will not be used for other organs. Recipients who are
      scheduled to receive an HCV-infected organ will receive glecaprevir (300mg)/pibrentasvir
      (120mg) supplied as three fixed-dose combination tablets once a day starting prior to the
      transplant as soon the patient is in the hospital and it is confirmed that the transplant is
      proceeding. HCV treatment will continue for 7 days post-transplant (total 8 doses).
      Recipients will also receive ezetimibe (10 mg) once daily starting at the same time as G/P
      and continued until 7 days post-transplant. Recipients will have blood samples taken daily
      for the first 2 weeks and then weekly until 12 weeks post-transplant for HCV PCR (with
      additional final sample taken at 6 months post-transplant). The investigators hypothesize
      that HCV transmission to recipients will be prevented by the use of potent DAA prophylaxis
      plus ezetimibe with or without ex vivo organ perfusion in the immediate peri-operative
      period.

    <intervention_model_description>Investigators aim to transplant 40 recipients (20 lung; 20 other organs) on the transplant wait-list. Donor organs will be selected based on usual donor selection criteria. Recipients will be selected based on usual hospital protocol for selecting suitable recipients. After transplantation, recipients will receive highly effective antiviral prophylaxis using approved direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir (G/P) and they will also receive ezetimibe, a cholesterol-lowering medication. Additionally, lung transplant recipients will receive donor lungs treated with normothermic ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) prior to transplant.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Intervention description: recipients on the wait-list for lung, heart, kidney, and/or pancreas transplants will all receive antiviral treatment in the form of 8 total doses of oral tablets. Lung recipients will also receive donor lungs that are treated with normothermic EVLP (details of both described below).
Drug: All recipients will receive glecaprevir (300mg)/pibrentasvir (120mg) supplied as three tablets per dose 6-12 hours prior to transplant, and for 7 days post-transplant. Other Names: Maviret. Patients will also receive ezetimibe (10mg), supplied as one tablet per dose to be taken at the same time as Maviret tablets (6-12 hours prior to transplant in addition to 7 daily doses post-transplant).
Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion (EVLP): Normothermic EVLP is a method of donor lung preservation, assessment, treatment, and repair of injured organs. This method allows donor lungs to be treated for at least 12h under protective physiological conditions. Other names: Normothermic EVLP.</description>
