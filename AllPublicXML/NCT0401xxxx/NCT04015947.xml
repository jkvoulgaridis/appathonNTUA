  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary study objective is to evaluate local response to split-thickness skin grafts from
      a matched bone marrow donor to chronic GVHD-affected skin in a hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant patient.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While the mechanisms are still under active study, GVHD is thought to be a donor T-cell
      mediated attack that preferentially targets three organs: skin, intestine, and liver. T
      lymphocytes from the donor identify the patient's organ tissues as foreign and initiate
      inflammation, leading to end organ damage. The investigator's traditional approach has been
      to use immune suppressing drugs to dampen this inflammatory response after transplantation.
      However, this approach is ultimately ineffective for a significant percentage of patients.
      Therefore, the primary objective of this proposal is to test a novel non-immunosuppressive
      approach to treatment of cutaneous GVHD using allogeneic skin grafting in an effort to
      tolerize the engrafted immune system to skin it previously recognized as foreign. The
      potential benefit to transplant patients is tremendous, including reduced immunosuppression,
      improved quality of life and lower mortality.

      A potential novel approach is to apply split-thickness skin grafts from the bone marrow donor
      to the affected patient's skin. There are four existing case reports that have shown positive
      outcomes in wound healing in chronic GVHD-associated ulcers. In all four cases, skin grafts
      were harvested from the patient's allogeneic HLA-matched sibling donors and placed over
      non-healing wounds (2-5). One case described global improvement in affected skin distant from
      the site of skin graft application, allowing for tapering of immunosuppressive medications.
      This suggests potential induction of tolerance by immune cells within the donated skin.
