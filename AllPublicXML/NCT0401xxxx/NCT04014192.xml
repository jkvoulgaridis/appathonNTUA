  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus is insulin resistance and insufficient
      secretion of insulin by pancreatic beta cells. SGLT2 (sodium-glucose synergistic transporter
      2) inhibitor is a kind of newly developed hypoglycemic medicine, which increases urinary
      glucose excretion and lowers blood glucose in an insulin-independent manner. The mechanisms
      of its effects on insulin resistance, insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells and glucagon
      secretion by pancreatic alpha cells, are not well studied in domestic and foreign, and there
      is no unified conclusion. A few studies concerning SGLT2 inhibitors have observed that
      insulin resistance and islet beta cell secretion function can be improved by the improvement
      of glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity, but its effect on pancreatic alpha cell function to
      increase glucagon level, thereby increasing liver glucose output, may be one of the
      mechanisms of its side effects. In this study, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were
      treated with three domestic listed SGLT2 inhibitors (dapagliflozin, empagliflozin and
      canagliflozin) for one week, which were expected to improve the glucotoxicity, but excluding
      the effects on lipotoxicity and body weight, to observe the changes of islet beta cell and
      alpha cell function and insulin sensitivity. Three different SGLT2 inhibitors were used in
      order to make clear whether this effect is the unique effect of different structure of drugs
      or the similar effect of this kind of drugs.

    <textblock>
      In this study, type 2 diabetes patients were treated with three kinds of SGLT2 inhibitors
      (dapagliflozin, empagliflozin and canagliflozin) for one week. With routine dose applied,
      (dapagliflozin 10mg/d, empagliflozin 10mg/d, canagliflozin 100mg/d), blood glucose level
      could be improved with small expected effect on body weight and no effect in lipid metabolism
      after the treatment period of one week. Normal glucose tolerance subjects (diagnosed of OGTT)
      were included as the control group.According to previous studies in three major SGLT2
      inhibitors currently on the market, an increase in urinary glucose excretion and a decrease
      in blood glucose within three days after application in mice and human could be observed.
      Therefore, the short-term treatment cycle in this study is intended to be set at one week,
      and can be extended to two weeks if there is no significant decrease in blood glucose.

      The insulin sensitivity, islet beta cell secretion function and islet alpha cell function of
      diabetic patients were measured at baseline (before taking SGLT2 inhibitors) and one week
      after taking SGLT2 inhibitors, of normal glucose tolerance subjects were measured only at
      baseline. The effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on islet cell function and insulin sensitivity would
      be evaluated in order to study the extrarenal action mechanism of SGLT2 inhibitors.
