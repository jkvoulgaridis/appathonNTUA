  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates how brains change as a result of a treatment for depression called
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). People who receive rTMS will have
      pictures of their brains and brain activity taken by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      scanner before and after their treatment, as well as up to three times during the six-week
      treatment course. These images will be examined to see if the rTMS is placed correctly to
      help treat their symptoms, and what changes in brain activity are happening during the rTMS
      treatment

      Veteran patients can be referred to receive a Neuromodulation Clinic consult at the
      Providence VA Medical Center (PVAMC). Following this consultation, patients who are to begin
      rTMS therapy for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) will be recruited to
      participate in this study. About 1 week prior to the scheduled beginning of rTMS therapy,
      research participants who provide informed consent will complete baseline neuropsychological
      measures. Within a few days of completing these measures, and before beginning rTMS therapy,
      participants will receive an MRI scan, including structural and functional imaging.
      Participants will have a similar set of MRI scans up to three times during the course of rTMS
      therapy, and complete neuropsychological measures at these scanning sessions. A final MRI
      scan will be conducted within a week of completing the rTMS therapy course, and
      neuropsychological measures will be completed at this session.

    <description>A marker visible on MRI will be placed on the treatment location for the MRI scan after treatment completion. Functional MRI will be used to localize the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the brain region targeted by rTMS. The distance between these two points will be calculated for each participant.</description>
