  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Teeth with furcation grade III defects will be treated with open flap debridement, with or
      without osteoplasty. The study is designed to examine the effect of osteoplasty in the
      treatment of teeth with furcation grade III defects with open flap debridement.
