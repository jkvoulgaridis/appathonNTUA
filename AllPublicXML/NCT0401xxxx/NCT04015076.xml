  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first in human (FIH), single-centre, double blind, randomised, cross-over, SAD
      followed by a MAD study of Inzomelid. The study is designed to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, PK, PD, and food effect of Inzomelid in healthy adult participants and to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary clinical efficacy of Inzomelid in
      adult patients with CAPS. Oversight will be provided by a safety monitoring committee (SMC)
      comprised of the Investigator, the Sponsor's Medical Monitor and an Independent Medical
      Monitor.

        Exclusion Criteria- CAPS Patients:

          -  Live vaccinations within 3 months prior to Screening, for the duration of the study
             and for up to 3 months following the last dose of study drug;

          -  Positive QuantiFERON test at the Screening visit or within 2 months prior to
             Screening.

        Participants who have a positive QuantiFERON test with documentation of BCG vaccination,
        who are at low environmental risk for TB infection or reactivation, and have a negative
        chest X-ray can be included;

        * Pregnant or lactating at Screening or planning to becomepregnant (self or partner) at any
