  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disorder, especially among patients with chronic kidney
      disease, diabetes mellitus, or heart failure. Globally, the reported incidence of
      hyperkalemia varies from 1.1 to 10 per 100 hospitalizations, depending on the patient cohort
      and comorbidities. Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disturbance
      that can be fatal if left untreated. Several studies have established the association between
      hyperkalemia and all-cause mortality. Because of the deleterious cardiac effects of
      hyperkalemia, its management is an emergency intervention. However, robust evidence is
      lacking to guide the emergency management of patients with hyperkalemia. Emergency treatment
      approaches are largely based on small studies, anecdotal experience, and traditionally
      accepted practice patterns within institutions. Therefore, a rigorous evaluation of the
      first-line treatments of hyperkalemia in emergency departments is needed and a large scale
      randomized clinical trial is warranted before robust recommendations for clinical practice
      can be made. Our clinical trial will improve the safety of patients with acute hyperkalemia
      and will help clinicians in their day by day practice to choose the treatment that
      significantly reduces morbidity and mortality during acute hyperkalemia management. Our
      results will be delivered in a timely fashion, owing to the high prevalence of hyperkalemia
      in the emergency department setting and to the commitment of the INI-CRCT network of
      Excellence, along with ED specialists used to work jointly.

      the primary objective of our trial is to compare insulin/dextrose intravenous infusion,
      nebulized salbutamol or combination of nebulized salbutamol and insulin/dextrose intravenous
      infusion to reduce serum potassium concentration at 60 minutes, as first-line treatment, in
      emergency departments.

      InSaKa trial is a therapeutic, controlled, open label, with parallel groups of treatment in a
      1:1:1 ratio, multi-centre, national and randomized clinical trial to compare insulin/dextrose
      intravenous infusion, nebulized salbutamol or combination of salbutamol and insulin/dextrose
      to reduce serum potassium levels at 60 minutes. Eligible patients will be recruited in the
      emergency department and included in the study after testing for inclusion and non-inclusion
      criteria. Patients will be eligible for the randomization if they had a serum potassium
      concentration superior or equal to 6 mmol per liter. Randomization, which will be performed
      centrally, will be stratified 1) according to the serum potassium level at baseline of the
      initial treatment phase (6 to &lt; 6.5 mmol per liter [moderate hyperkalemia] AND superior or
      equal to 6.5 mmol per liter [severe hyperkalemia]), and 2) according to the prescription or
      not of intravenous diuretics during the 6 previous hours. The protocol will be approved by
      the ethical committee (random allocation) of the IRB. All patients will provide written
      informed consent and the study will be performed in accordance with the International
      Conference on Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. All electrocardiograms
      will be read at a core electrocardiographic laboratory. At the time of screening, patients
      who meet all the inclusion and do not have non-inclusion criteria will be assigned to one of
      the 3 groups of treatment. The serum potassium will be then measured at 60 minutes. If the
      patient still has hyperkalemia at 60 minutes, the patient will be re-administered a
      treatment, left at the discretion of the physician in charge. This treatment might include
      insulin/dextrose intravenous infusion, nebulized salbutamol, the combination of nebulized
      salbutamol and insulin/dextrose intravenous infusion, bicarbonate, diuretics or dialysis.
      Especially, bicarbonate should be prescribed in case of metabolic acidosis or hypovolemic
      shock, and diuretics in case of acute heart failure. Importantly, if the patient has a major
      cardiovascular event before 60 minutes, all these treatments might be prescribed at the
      discretion of the physician in charge, if the clinical situation requires one or more of
      these therapeutic options, and based on up-to-date clinical practice guidelines and
      recommendations. Serum potassium levels will be measured at local laboratories at baseline
      and 60, 180 minutes and 24 hours. They will perform a visual inspection and a validated
      semi-quantitative test on each blood sample as an assessment for hemolysis. An independent
      adjudication committee will adjudicate all major cardiovascular events. The trial will be
      monitored by a Data Safety Monitoring Board.
