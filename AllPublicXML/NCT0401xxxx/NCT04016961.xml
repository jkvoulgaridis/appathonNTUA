    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the addition of therapy dogs in inpatient physical and occupational
      therapy. Data will be collected across 10 PT and 10 OT sessions, half of which will
      incorporate a therapy dog.

    <textblock>
      Children with acquired brain injuries (ABI) treated on an inpatient rehabilitation unit are
      at significant risk for long term functional impairment, highlighting the importance of
      maximizing the effectiveness and utilization of inpatient rehabilitation therapies. The
      proposed study seeks to explore the value of animal-assisted therapy (AAT) during inpatient
      rehabilitation following pediatric ABI. Investigators will employ a within subjects
      cross-over trial; all participants will have a volunteer dog involved in 50% of their
      physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT) sessions over a 2-week study period. AAT
      will consist of integration of a dog from the hospital volunteer dog program in PT and OT
      sessions, while the non-AAT condition will be treatment as usual (TAU) as identified by the
      patients' treatment team. Information regarding patient engagement/participation in therapy,
      affect, and physiological variables will be collected during each session. Session notes will
      also be coded for additional qualitative information. Qualitative feedback from patients and
      families, therapists, medical teams, and dog handlers will also be collected throughout the
      project to examine feasibility and satisfaction with the intervention as well as potential
      barriers and areas for improvement. Investigators will 1) examine the effect of AAT on level
      of patient participation and patient affect during PT and OT sessions, 2) Explore the effect
      of AAT on functional outcomes using a historic cohort comparison group, and 3) explore the
      physiological response of patients, and examine a number of variables (injury type/severity,
      child sex and anthropomorphism, therapist factors, and dog handler factors) to begin to
      determine which patients are most likely to benefit from AAT during inpatient rehabilitation
      for ABI.

    <measure>Patient Participation - AAT</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout study completion, an average of 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient participation during AAT sessions will be assessed using the Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation Scale (PRPS)The PRPS is a 6-item Likert-type, clinician-rated measure that quantifies observed patient participation in their therapy session. Therapists report their observations regarding patient's completion of exercises, effort applied to exercises, and level of support needed to complete activities. Scores range from 1 (None) to 6 (excellent). Therapists will complete this measure at the end of each AAT session. Ratings across the 5 (on average) AAT sessions will be used to create an patient participation - AAT score.</description>

    <time_frame>Throughout study completion, an average of 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Objective session participation will be assessed via videotaped sessions for at least 2 AAT sessions. Coders will provide an objective measure of participation by rating patient in session participation using the Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation Scale (PRPS). Coders will score participation using the PRPS and rate the participants level of participation from 1 (None) to 6 (Excellent). These coder ratings will be used to create an overall objective session participation AAT score.</description>

    <measure>Patient Affect - AAT</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout study completion, an average of 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient affect will be assessed via the Symptom Inventory Scale - Short.This measure is a 4-item measure, where the patient reports the degree (from 0-10) they are experiencing each feeling/condition presented (Happy, fatigue, distraction, irritability). The patient will be asked to complete this measure at the beginning and end of each AAT session. These ratings will be used to create happy, fatigue, distracted, and irritable - AAT scores. Greater scores are reflective of greater levels of that emotion.</description>
