      Objective: The present study aimed to determine the expressions of nuclear receptors PPAR
      (Peroxisome proliferative activator receptor)-γ, RXR (Retinoid X receptor)-α, and vitamin D
      receptor (VDR) in healthy volunteers and periodontitis patients with different grade
      involvement.

      Methods: Group-1; healthy individuals, Group-2; periodontitis patients-stage 3 grade B,
      (H-GradeB), Group-3; periodontitis patients-stage 3 grade C, (D-GradeC). Clinical parameters
      as plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI) and clinical attachment levels (CAL) were measured.
      Fibroblast and inflammatory cells, PPAR-γ, RXR-α, and VDR levels were determined in
      histological slides.

    <description>Connective tissues were evaluated, and inflammatory cell infiltration were counted in the H&amp;E stained slides using a light microscope (Nikon Eclipse, E 600, Tokyo, Japan). For cell counting, connective tissue neighboring gingival epithelium was marked, and a cell counting frame of 10000 µm2 was marked. Inflammatory cells (neutrophil, lymphocyte, eosinophil, and macrophage cells) within the frame were counted. The measurements were performed from three different points, and the mean of these three measurements was recorded.</description>
