  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a new, non-invasive method for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) will be
      tested. In pre-clinical studies, we have identified 151 putative biomarkers for pulmonary
      embolism in the exhaled breath condensate (EBC). These biomarkers needs
      validation/consolidation in a clinical setting before further test of this new diagnostic
      method.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will compare the protein profiles of EBC collected from patients admitted to the
      department of cardiology with suspected pulmonary embolism and controls with same age (within
      a range of 10 years) and gender from the outpatient clinic awaiting elective cardiovascular
      surgery. The main-outcome (i.e. means of the relative amounts of specific proteins in the EBC
      samples) will be compared by unpaired t-tests after assessment of normality and standard
      deviations within the three groups (PE confirmed, PE suspected but not confirmed and
      controls). Furthermore, sensitivity and specificity will be calculated for relevant proteins.
      The results from analysis of EBC samples from the patients and controls will be compared with
      results from the porcine model in order to confirm and reduce the number of putative
      biomarkers for PE. Blood samples (i.e. excess plasma from routine blood samples drawn as a
      part of routine diagnostic work-up) from the study participants will be stored for
      standardization of the putative markers and verification and supplementing analysis of the
      EBC markers. In order to qualify the most suitable markers and substrates for
      standardization, the analysis of the EBC samples must be completed before the blood samples
      can be analyzed. Only biochemical, no genetic analysis will be conducted.

    <description>New method for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) in order to validate/consolidate 151 putative identified biomarkers for PE in the exhaled breath condensate (EBC).
The EBC will be collected by use of the RTube(R) system which has been used in previous studies of EBC. As the patient breathes through a mouth piece, the exhaled breath is led through a cooling chamber where the vaporous part of the exhaled breath condenses.
We aim at collecting a total minimum of 3.0 mL EBC per study subject in order to have a sufficient amount of protein for the subsequent analysis. We aim at collecting exhaled breath condensate for 2*15 minutes with the possibility to stop the collection after less than 15 minutes if the volume is sufficient.</description>
