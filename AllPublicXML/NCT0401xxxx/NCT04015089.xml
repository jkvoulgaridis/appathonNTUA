  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, parallel, double-blind clinical trial, comparing a partially hydrolyzed serum
      proteins infant formula with a conventional formula with intact protein in healthy infants
      that suffer from colic
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Demonstrate that an infant formula with partially hydrolized cow's milk protein of serum
      proteins is equivalent to an intact protein formula in healthy children in terms of safety of
      use and suitability, to prove that it can be a alternative with digestive health benefits in
      healthy children with infant colic.
