  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory volume monitor (RVM) (ExSpiron) is superior to continuous pulse oximetry in
      detection of postoperative respiratory depression in high risk patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aims are to: 1) Estimate the incidence of postoperative respiratory depression in high risk
      patients as detected by continuous pulse oximetry 2) Estimate the incidence of postoperative
      respiratory depression in high risk patients as detected by continuous respiratory volume
      monitor (RVM) (ExSpiron) 3) Assess the agreement between the continuous pulse oximetry and
      continuous respiratory volume monitor (RVM) (ExSpiron) in detection of postoperative
      respiratory depression in high risk patients

    <description>Respiratory volume monitor (RVM) (ExSpiron, is a non-invasive FDA approved device that monitors minute ventilation (MV) and provides an early indication of respiratory status in non-intubated patients. The system consists of a lightweight monitor, a patient cable, and a disposable electrode PadSet, which detects changes in breathing.</description>
