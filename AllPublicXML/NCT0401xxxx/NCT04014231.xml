      This clinical trial studies a novel single wave assessment in measuring cardiac dysfunction
      and metabolic syndrome in patients with cancer. The novel single wave assessment is a hand
      held device that can report left ventricular ejection fraction, which measures how well the
      heart is pumping blood (by giving a percentage) and measures how stiff the arteries are in
      the heart (pulse wave velocity). A novel single wave assessment may help identify patients at
      increased risk for type II diabetes and metabolic syndrome (disease where patients have
      increased blood pressure and high blood sugar level and excess body fat around the waist and
      abnormal cholesterol levels).

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the relationship between insulin resistance (delta omega) as measured by the
      single wave application and inflammation markers associated with insulin resistance and
      metabolic syndrome (MetS) in cancer patients, and to estimate the mean and standard deviation
      (sd) of delta omega in cancer patients with and without MetS for designing future, larger
      studies.

      II. To determine the degree of agreement between the single wave measure of left ventricular
      ejection fraction (LVEF) in cancer patients and that measured by the routine 2-dimensional
      (2D) echocardiography (standard of care).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo placement of a single wave application near the carotid region of the neck.

    <description>The agreement of the single wave-based ejection fraction (EF) to EF measured by 2-dimensional (2D) echocardiography will be estimated in this study. Generalized linear models will be fitted to insulin resistance as the dependent variable and the inflammation markers as independent variables, adjusted for sex, age, and other clinical factors, along with an indicator of MetS (1 if present; 0 if absent) and the interactions of MetS and the inflammation markers to examine their association with insulin resistance.</description>

    <measure>Difference in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measured by the single wave application and 2D echocardiography</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to end of single wave assessment</time_frame>
    <description>Initially, the measurements from the two methods will be plotted to visualize their agreement. The Bland-Altman plot will then be used to assess the degree of agreement. The difference in LVEF measured by the two methods will be plotted against the mean of the measurements from the two methods. The 95% confidence interval for the mean difference will be determined. Sensitivity and specificity of the single wave-based LVEF measure for various cutpoints of LVEF from 2D echocardiography (as the gold standard) will also be computed. Pearson correlation coefficient will be calculated.</description>
