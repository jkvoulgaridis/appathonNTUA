  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is the most common component of the morbidity seen in sickle cell disease (SCD), and may
      be acute or chronic. It is most commonly acute and a result of the hallmark vaso-occlusive
      episodes of the disease. Many patients however suffer from chronic pain - defined as pain
      lasting over three months- with neuropathic pain being a component of chronic pain.
      Neuropathic pain significantly contributes to the chronicity and morbidity of pain in SCD
      patients, and is an inadequately managed complication. There is a paucity of literature
      covering this area, and it has never been examined in the Jamaican population. The main
      objective of this study is to determine the epidemiology of pain among Jamaicans with SCD,
      and determine the prevalence of chronic and neuropathic pain among these patients. A second
      objective is to validate, using gold-standard measures, screening tools to determine
      neuropathic pain among the study population. This cross-sectional study will investigate the
      prevalence of neuropathic pain and complications in a sample of persons with SCD in Jamaica
      aged 14 years and older, with a validation sub-study to be conducted on a random 20 percent
      of the sample. With improved diagnosis of neuropathic pain, clinicians may potentially
      improve the management of pain in SCD, as clinicians should be able to direct our treatment
      toward medications and non-pharmacological methods of pain relief that are more specific for
      neuropathic pain. All data will be de-identified and maintained in a secure database, with
      access limited to key personnel. There is very minimal risk to participants.

      All study participants will complete all the questionnaires provided, specifically the Adult
      Sickle Cell Quality of Life Measurement Information (ASCQ-Me), Leeds Assessment of
      Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS), PainDETECT and Douleur Neuropathique 4 (DN4). All
      study participants will also have qualitative sensory testing and laboratory investigations
      done. Nerve conduction studies will only be done on a randomly selected 20 percent sub-study
      sample.

      Laboratory investigations include sample of blood (~ 10 mls) will also be collected for the
      participants and analysed for Haemoglobin (steady state), white blood cells, and lactate
      dehydrogenase, percent reticulocytes. These are common markers of disease severity in SCD.
      Disease severity is one of the variables which will be used in the epidemiological
      description of the study population as well as in the statistical analysis of the data.

      The Q-Sense will be used to conduct quantitative sensory tests. This allows specific degrees
      of heat/cold stimulation to assess sensation and pain thresholds to be applied and patients
      indicate at which degree they detect the stimuli and furthermore when it becomes painful, at
      each site. The results are then compared to known controls. Hypersensitivity and allodynia to
      thermal stimuli is considered diagnostic for neuropathic pain. The tests are considered safe
      in sickle cell patients and when tested have not resulted in any crisis. Patients may
      experience mild pain after the test, and therefore will be asked to take their regular
      analgesics immediately following the test.

      Nerve conduction studies (NCS): A subset of participants identified with chronic or presumed
      neuropathic pain will, in addition to QST, receive a standard neurophysiological evaluation
      by nerve conduction studies to determine the presence/absence of a large fibre neuropathy,
      whether a focal mononeuropathy or diffuse polyneuropathy. Polyneuropathies will be
      characterized by process as either axonal or demyelinating, and by pattern as sensory, motor
      or sensorimotor, with comparisons to findings on QST.

        Using the Sickle Cell Unit (SCU) of the University of the West Indies patient management
        system, a computer generated random selection of the sample will be carried out from a
        sampling frame of all patients aged 14 years and older who are coded as 'alive' upon last
        visit, and who have had at least one visit to the SCU in the last 2 years. The recruitment
        of participants to satisfy the sample size of 528 participants will be stratified according
        to five age-sex categories i.e. male and female 14 - 24; 25 - 34; 35 - 44; 45 - 54; 55 +
        years old. Selected participants will be recruited by phone to attend a clinic appointment
        where informed consent will be ascertained.
