  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), patients' response to positive
      end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is variable according to different degrees of lung
      recruitability. The search for a tool to individualize PEEP on the basis of patients'
      individual response is warranted.

      Measurement of end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) by the nitrogen washin-washout technique,
      bedside available from recent ICU ventilators, has been shown to reliably estimate
      PEEP-induced alveolar recruitment and may therefore help titrate PEEP on patient's individual
      requirements.

      The authors designed an open-label, multicenter, randomized trial to test whether an
      individualized PEEP setting protocol driven by EELV may improve a composite clinical outcome
      in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ARDS patients with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio equal or below 150 mmHg (during mechanical ventilation
      with PEEP 5 cmH2O) will be enrolled within 24 hours from endo-tracheal intubation.

      To standardize lung volumes at study initiation, all patients will undergo mechanical
      ventilation with tidal volume set at 6 ml/kg of predicted body weight and PEEP set to obtain
      a plateau pressure within 28 and 30 cmH2O for thirty minutes (Express PEEP).

      Afterwards, a 5-step decremental PEEP trial will be conducted (Express PEEP to PEEP 5 cmH2O),
      and EELV will be measured at each step. PEEP-induced alveolar recruitment will be calculated
      for each PEEP range as the difference between PEEP-induced change EELV and the predicted
      increase in lung volume due to PEEP (PEEP-induced overdistension, equal to the product of
      respiratory system compliance and PEEP change).

      Patients will be then randomized to receive mechanical ventilation with PEEP set according to
      the optimal recruitment observed in the PEEP trial (IPERPEEP arm) trial or according to the
      Express strategy (Control arm, PEEP set to achieve a plateau pressure of 28-30 cmH2O).

      In both groups, tidal volume size, the use of prone positioning and neuromuscular blocking
      agents will be standardized.

      Primary endpoint of the study is a composite clinical outcome incorporating in-ICU mortality,
      60-day ventilator free days and the area under the curve of serum Interleukin 6 over the
      course of the initial 72 hours.

      Prespecified subgroup analysis will be conducted according to:

        -  [(Express PEEP EELV)-(EELV PEEP 5 cmH2O)]/Functional residual capacity (FRC) ≥ and &lt; 73%
           during the PEEP trial

        -  Rec ≥ 19 ml/cmH2O and Rec &lt; 19 ml/cmH2O across the range between the lowest and highest
           PEEP tested during the PEEP trial

        -  P/F ratio≥ and &lt;100 mmHg at study inclusion

        -  IL-6≥ and &lt;400 pg/ml at study inclusion

    <description>Composite clinical outcome that incorporates ICU mortality, 60-day ventilation-free days (VFD60) and the Area Under the Curve of the InterLeukin-6 serum blood cytokine concentration (IL6AUC) during the first 72 hours of observation. Every participant in the treatment group will be compared with every participant in the control group and assigned a score resulting from each comparison. Mortality takes precedence over VFD60, which takes precedence over IL6AUC. Two VFD60's will be considered different for the purpose of scoring only if their difference is larger than 5 days. Similarly, two IL6AUC's measurements will be considered different only if their difference exceeds 10% of the smaller of the two. These individual-comparison scores are added up to obtain the cumulative score primary endpoint for each participant. The sum of scores for patients in the treatment group is compared to the sum of scores of subjects in the control group and compared according by use of Mann-Whitney test</description>

    <description>End expiratory lung volume (EELV) will be measured at each step during a 5-step decremental PEEP trial.
Set PEEP will be ≥5 cmH2O and chosen to ensure the maximum recruitment, with a maximum plateau pressure of 30 cmH2O. Recruitment across two adjacent PEEP levels will be normalized to the changes in applied PEEP: Recruitment/cmH2O (Rec) will be computed as the ratio of recruitment and PEEP difference.
Rec ≥ 19 ml/cmH2O will lead to the higher PEEP value.
Rec&lt; 7 ml/cmH2O will lead to lower PEEP value.
19 ml/cmH2O &gt;Rec≥7ml/cmH2O: the choice among two adjacent PEEP levels will be left to the attending physician.
In patients with airway closure, no PEEP lower than airway opening pressure will be tested or used (due to interferences with EELV measurement) for the whole duration of treatment. A 5-step PEEP trial will re-assess EELV at different PEEP levels every 12-24 hours,after body position or ventilator settings changes.</description>

    <description>In order not to delay weaning from mechanical ventilation, when a patient is managed with assist/control or assist ventilation with PEEP higher than 8 cmH2O, a daily PEEP weaning trial will be performed whether PaO2/FIO2 ratio&gt;150 mm Hg and FIO2&lt;0.5: PEEP will be decreased to 8-5 cm H2O and arterial blood gas will be sampled after 20 -0 minutes. Previous ventilatory settings will be resumed if during the procedure transcutaneous oxyhemoglobin saturation decreases below 88%, PaO2/FIO2 falls below 150 mm Hg or if the patient experiences abnormal changes in respiratory rate or other clinical signs suggestive of respiratory distress.
When PaO2/FIO2 is no lower than 200 mm Hg at PEEP≤8 cmH2O, the patient will be considered to have acceptable gas exchange on 8-5 cmH2O of PEEP and will be deemed capable to tolerate this setting</description>
