  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hp infection is closely related to upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients who need
      dual-antiplatelet after PCI. Taking anti-Hp treatment has the effect of reducing bleeding
      risk. Thus, we propose a scientific hypothesis: the C13 breath test may be used to assess the
      risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients who need dual- antiplatelet after PCI.

      Our study is to retrospectively analyze the clinical data of 1606 patients of acute
      myocardial infarction who need dual- antiplatelet after PCI.The diagnostic criteria for upper
      gastrointestinal bleeding is: 1.symptoms: digestive discomfort, such as abdominal pain,
      nausea, belching, acid reflux, etc.;2.mainly based on endoscopy examination, endoscopic
      examination showed that the stomach or duodenum showed spotted, linear or diffuse
      bleeding;3.the fecal examination:melena, tar-like stool, hematemesis, fecal occult blood,
      etc.The study was divided into two groups according to whether the C13 breath test was
      performed, and the C13 breath test component was the positive anti-HP treatment group and the
      non-anti-HP treatment group.And then compare the upper gastrointestinal bleeding rates of the
      above groups.
