  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine the
      effects of a 6-month Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention compared to an
      active control Stress Management Education (SME) on glucose control in adults with
      uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The study will randomize 290 adults with uncontrolled
      T2DM to a 6-month MBSR intervention or SME control. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline,
      2-months, 6-months and 1-year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aims are: 1) To conduct an RCT to determine the effects of a 6-month MBSR
      intervention compared to an active control Stress Management Education (SME) on glucose
      control in 290 adults with uncontrolled T2DM. The primary outcome will be hemoglobin A1c
      (HbA1c), a measure of average glucose levels over the past 3 months. The Investigators
      hypothesize that between the two groups, there will be a clinically significant 0.5% absolute
      difference in the mean change in HbA1c from baseline to month 6, and that this will be
      sustained at 1 year. The study team will also look at the 2-month HbA1c, however it may be
      too brief a time period to fully capture the impact of MBSR. A reduction in HbA1c of 0.5%
      would be expected to reduce the risk of any diabetes-related complication by at least 10%.
      Additionally, investigators will look at fasting glucose and glucose variability as they are
      also linked with adverse outcomes; 2) To determine the effects of MBSR compared to SME
      control on psychosocial, behavioral and physiological mechanisms potentially mediating its
      glucose-lowering effects in adults with uncontrolled T2DM. Subjective stress,
      diabetes-related distress and other psychosocial measures will be assessed. Accelerometry
      will be used to track physical activity. Unannounced phone calls will be used to obtain 24
      hour diet recalls. Physiologic measures include serum hsCRP as a marker of chronic
      inflammation, salivary cortisol to assess the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and
      salivary α-amylase to assess sympathetic nervous system activity. The proposed study has the
      potential to transform current standards of care for T2DM by using a novel long-term MBSR
      intervention as a powerful adjunct intervention for T2DM. MBSR could impact the clinical
      picture of T2DM by empowering patients with skills for strengthening their own internal
      resources to promote self regulation and adaptive coping and reduce stress reactivity, which
      are all essential for implementing healthy behaviors and are expected to lead to improved
      glucose control and reduced risk of diabetes complications. This proposal is relevant to the
      mission of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) to
      conduct research on diabetes to improve people's health and quality of life.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomized, parallel group two-arm trial that will determine the effects of a longer Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention (6 months instead of the standard 8 weeks) compared to Stress Management Education (SME) (active control) on glucose control in 290 patients with uncontrolled T2DM.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The PI, study coordinator, and all study personnel collecting outcomes, will be blinded from the treatment assignments. Only the MBSR and SME instructors and the study personnel who schedule the classes, videorecord the classes, and code the videos will have knowledge of the assignments, and these individuals will not be involved in the collection of outcomes. Subjects will be asked to keep their treatment assignment concealed from study personnel collecting outcomes. However, complete blinding may not be possible given the nature of this study.</masking_description>
