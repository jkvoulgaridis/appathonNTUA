  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atherosclerosis is a disease of the arteries and is the result of various factors such as
      high blood cholesterol or diabetes, which lead to accumulations of fats, cells, and calcium
      deposits (i.e. plaques). It has been shown that people with a rapid increase in the amount of
      calcium deposits have a higher risk for stroke and heart attack than people with a decreased
      amount.

      Previous scientific research has shown that a protein called Matrix Gla Protein plays an
      important role in the prevention of calcification. This protein works well only if there is
      enough Vitamin K in the blood vessels. In a large human studies, it has been shown that
      especially Menaquinone-7 (a form of Vitamin K2) is best absorbed by blood vessels.

      Over the last years, fluorine-18 sodium fluoride (18F-NaF) positron emission tomography (PET)
      emerged as a reliable clinical imaging tool able to detect micro-calcification in the blood
      vessels. Therefore, the present study will use 18F-NaF PET in combination with magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the influence of vitamin K supplementation in the
      development of arterial micro-calcification in the context of atherosclerosis.

      The present study would like to confirm that vitamin K2 supplementation induces a significant
      reduction in the degree of micro-calcification from carotid artery disease patients, when
      comparing to a placebo, after 3 months.

      This will be a prospective double blind randomised controlled feasibility study, in which one
      group will receive a vitamin K2 supplementation compared to a control group receiving a
      placebo.

The Agatston coronary artery calcification score isis a semi-automated tool to calculate a score based on the extent of coronary artery calcification detected by an non-contrast low-dose CT scan. The score ranges from 0 arbitrary units to &gt; 400. The higher the value of the score, the higher the degree of calcification is in the coronary arteries; hence, lower values usually represent a better outcome.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Asymptomatic carotid artery disease on at least one side with a degree of stenosis &gt;
             25% (according to on the ECST criteria). If the patient has a symptomatic carotid
             artery disease on the contra-lateral side, he/she will still be included in the study,
             if intensified medical treatment for this symptomatic stenosis (e.g. statins,
             antiplatelet medication) was started â‰¥ 6 month before inclusion of the patient. This
             protocol was chosen in order to widely assure a stable situation on the plaque(s),
             which avoids an overspill from this medication on the assumed effects of the vitamin K
             supplementation.
