  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study describes the caseload treated by the extended scope physiotherapists(ESP) working
      in the emergency department at Slagelse Hospital.

      Patients treated by the ESP during a 3 month period will be included in this study.

      Furthermore we aim to assess if ESPs treating patients with minor musculoskeletal injuries in
      the ED can predict the short-term prognosis of recovery. The prediction is made at hospital
      discharge using a (-7/+7) numerical rating scale (-7=poor prognosis; 7=best prognosis).

    <measure>Transition ratings of global perceived effect</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month after discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Using a transition questionnaire (TRANS-Q) the perceived effect of treatment will be measured by participants answering if their current health status is &quot;unchanged&quot;, &quot;worse&quot; or &quot;better&quot; compared to their pre-injury status. &quot;unchanged&quot; equals a transition score of 0. If the participant answers &quot;worse&quot;, he/she is asked to rate the degree of worsening on a 7 point Likert scale, with corresponding scores ranging from -1 to -7. If the participant answers &quot;better&quot;, he/she is asked to rate the degree of improvement on a 7 point Likert scale, with corresponding scores ranging from 1 to 7. Thus the GPE score range from -7 (worsening) to 7 (improvement), with the mid-point - 0 - representing no change.</description>

    <description>The VAS pain is a measure of pain intensity, which has been widely used in diverse adult populations. The scale is a unidimensional continuous scale comprised of a horizontal line, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors, one for each symptom extreme (0 no pain, 10 the worst imaginable pain).</description>

    <description>The participants self-reported use of analgesics will be collected at the 1 month follow-up. Participants will be asked to note their use of analgesic drugs, within the week before the follow-up, only related to the treated injury in the emergency room.</description>
