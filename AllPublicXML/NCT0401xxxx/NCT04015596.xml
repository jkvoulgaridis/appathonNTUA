  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to rigorously evaluate a potential treatment for inflammation-related
      Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) symptoms in children. To accomplish this goal, the
      investigators will conduct a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of Naproxen
      Sodium, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) in participants diagnosed with
      Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Streptococcal infections
      (PANDAS). This research fills a gap in the empirical evidence base for the treatment of
      PANDAS, and will add to a growing literature of empirically-derived practices for PANDAS.

      The investigators propose to systematically evaluate the effects of naproxen sodium on
      anti-obsessional and behavioral improvement and conduct the first randomized controlled trial
      of naproxen sodium in the treatment of children with PANDAS. The study will involve an
      8-week, double-blinded randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of naproxen
      sodium (10mg/kg, by mouth, twice a day) versus placebo to treat OCD symptoms in children with
      PANDAS. The investigators will acquire completed data on 44 children with PANDAS for this
      pilot study (i.e., 22 randomized to active treatment; 22 randomized to placebo). Outcome will
      be assessed comparing pre- and post-treatment OCD symptom severity using a standardized,
      clinician-administered interview assessing OCD symptoms by an independent rater blind to
      treatment assignment.

    <measure>Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, 2nd Edition (CY-BOCS-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre- to Post-8 week treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The CY-BOCS-II is a clinician-rated measure to assess obsessive-compulsive symptom severity. This results in two subscale total scores, Obsessions and Compulsion, each ranging from 0-25, with a higher score indicating more symptom severity. These subscale scores are summed to provide a total score, ranging from 0 to 50, that is used to measure overall OCD symptom severity.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. significantly interfering Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) symptoms

          2. ages 6- to 15-years-old

          3. new-onset of OCD symptoms within the previous 18 months

          4. sufficient fluency of English to understand study staff, procedures and
             questionnaires,

          5. able to take medication in pill form

          6. parent/legal guardian who can provide informed consent.

        Patients must also meet all criteria for PANDAS, which are:

          1. prepubertal symptom onset

          2. acute onset of symptoms (from no/minimal symptoms to maximum severity within 24-48
             hours) and/or an episodic (relapsing-remitting) course

          3. temporal association between symptomatic periods and infections with Group A
             Streptococcus (GAS) infection

          4. presence of neurological abnormalities (e.g. handwriting deterioration, choreiform
             movements).

        The onset/exacerbation of OCD symptoms must also be accompanied by at least three of the
        following clinical signs and symptoms, including:

          1. Markedly increased level of anxiety, particularly new onset of separation anxiety

          2. Emotional lability, irritability, aggressive behavior and/or personality change

          3. Sudden difficulties with concentration or learning

          4. Developmental regression (&quot;baby-talk&quot;, temper tantrums).

          5. Sleep disorder (insomnia, night terrors, refusal to sleep alone)

          6. Handwriting deterioration or other sign of motoric dysfunction (including new onset of
             motor hyperactivity, presence of choreiform finger movements, pronator drift or
             truncal instability)

          7. Urinary frequency or increased urge to urinate; daytime or night-time secondary
             enuresis

        These co-occurring symptoms must be &quot;severe&quot; or &quot;dramatic&quot; and proceed from no/minimal
        symptoms to maximum severity within the same 24-48 hour interval during which the OCD
        symptoms arose. In addition to these inclusion criteria, PANDAS subjects will be required
        to provide documentation of a positive GAS infection via medical records. As the time
        between a documented GAS infection and the onset of PANDAS symptoms has not been defined in
        the PANDAS diagnostic criteria, the investigators will use a guideline of approximately six
        weeks or less between a documented GAS infection and the onset of OCD symptoms for
        inclusion into the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. child who is acutely psychotic or suicidal

          2. child has a serious neurological disorder or impairment (e.g. brain damage, blindness,
             deafness), an intellectual disability, or autism

          3. history of immune modulating therapies for OCD/PANDAS symptoms

          4. pre-existing liver, kidney, GI bleeding or clotting disorders (GFR &lt;75 mL/min/1.73m2)

          5. history of ulcers in the digestive system

          6. history of restricted fluid intake, as this could exacerbate side effects

          7. concurrent antibiotic treatment or antibiotic treatment within one-week of baseline

          8. pregnant or becomes pregnant

          9. currently engaged in an intensive outpatient cognitive behavioral treatment program
             (more than weekly)

         10. concurrent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or other psychoactive
             medication treatment except and unless the dose has been stable for at least 6 weeks
             (i.e. no recent titration, initiation, or change in dosage)

         11. concurrent medications that do not meet the above criteria (e.g., other psychotropic
             medications or anti-inflammatory agents)

         12. history of severe asthma or currently uncontrolled asthma
