  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test if a study drug (CS-3150) will affect the heart rate in healthy males
      and females. Two doses of the study drug will be tested. Heart rate is not expected to be
      different between the study groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effect of therapeutic and supratherapeutic plasma exposures of
      CS-3150 on the corrected QT (QTc) interval duration after administration of single oral 10-mg
      and 40-mg doses of CS-3150 in healthy male and female participants. This study will also
      determine the safety and tolerability of CS-3150 administration, assess the effect on
      electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, detect QT interval (QT)/QTc prolongation with a positive
      control (moxifloxacin), characterize pharmacokinetics (PK) of CS-3150, and assess
      exposure-response relationship of CS-3150 on QTc.
