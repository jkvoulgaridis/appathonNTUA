  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compartment syndrome can result from extremity trauma. It can also be caused by procedural
      cases that involve lower or upper extremity surgery. This condition results in muscle death,
      chronic pain, infection, and possible amputation. Early diagnosis is essential to institute
      interventions that can avoid complications. Subjective pain of the patient remains the
      mainstay for diagnosis. A method or device is needed that would improve our accuracy in
      diagnosing compartment syndrome. Ideally, this would be suited for single and/or continuous
      pressure read-outs. The aim is to reduce the incidence of missed compartment syndrome and
      diminish delays that would lead to significant disability.

      Despite awareness, delayed diagnosis and treatment occurs in modern orthopaedic practice. As
      noted in many studies, once a diagnosis has been made, immediate fasciotomy is necessary to
      provide the best chance for a favourable clinical result. Therefore, there is a need for
      improved devices in order to obtain an early and reliable diagnosis.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical ease with which the new compartment pressure monitor was inserted into compartment.</measure>
    <time_frame>24-48 hours following device insertion</time_frame>
    <description>At device insertion, the physician will complete a feedback questionnaire, and routine assessment will be performed in compliance with the standard of care. As part of the feedback questionnaire, the physician will be asked to indicate on a sliding scale &quot;How certain are you the device functioned adequately?&quot; [0 = not confident] - [10 = very confident].
The scale, administered part of a Clinical Report Form (CRF) titled 'Physician Survey', measures the physicians subjective level of certainty that the device sensor was inserted correctly within a patients muscle compartment. A record of 10 should be considered a very positive scenario, whereas a record of 0 should indicate a very negative scenario.</description>

    <measure>Ability to monitor in real-time the continuous pressure read-out from the compartment in remote locations such as an I-phone.</measure>

    <description>At device insertion, the physician will complete a feedback questionnaire, and routine assessment will be performed in compliance with the standard of care. As part of the feedback questionnaire, the physician will be asked to indicate in a Yes or No question &quot;Did the MY01 Application remote data display work properly?&quot; [Yes] or [No].</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The correlation of continuous pressure read-outs (high, normal or low) with clinical indications for compartment syndrome in each patient.</measure>
    <time_frame>24-48 hours following device insertion, and again during the final follow-up of the participant approximately two weeks after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Routine assessments will be completed by healthcare personnel as per standard of care (the 6P's [Pain, Paraesthesia, Pallor, Paralysis, Pulselessness, Poikilothermia]), and compared against the pressure readout [mmHG] indicated by MY01's MicroElectroMechanical (MEMS) pressure sensor inserted at the afflicted location.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation of clinical compartment syndrome release with data from the continuous pressure monitor read-out.</measure>
    <time_frame>24-48 hours following device insertion, and again during the final follow-up of the participant approximately two weeks after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Should surgical fasciotomy be deemed necessary to release pent up pressure in the patients muscle compartment, the continuous pressure read-outs [mmHG] derived from the device will be compared against the timeframe when the decision to conduct fasciotomy was made.</description>
