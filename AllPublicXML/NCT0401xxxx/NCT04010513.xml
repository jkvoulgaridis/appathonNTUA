  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomized control trial of 30 women with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain
      syndrome to determine the feasibility of delivering a hypnosis intervention or usual care on
      bladder pain (primary outcome) and cerebral blood flow (secondary outcome). Women in the
      hypnosis group will undergo treatment with three hypnotherapy sessions in addition to a
      mobile web-based hypnosis application. Neuroimagning (fMRI) will occur after the first follow
      up visit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Available treatments do not provide adequate relief for bladder pain syndrome/interstitial
      cystitis (BPS/IC), a chronic painful condition that affects 10 million women in the United
      States. The investigators plan to conduct a pilot randomized control study to determine the
      feasibility of conducting a combined CBT-hypnosis intervention vs. usual care in women with
      BPS/IC for a subgroup of women, we will determine the effect of specific hypnotic words on
      brain function using functional brain imaging. All women will have a pre-existing diagnosis
      of BPS/IC and their baseline pain prior to therapy and novel (arterial spin labeling) and
      more traditional (BOLD fMRI) neuroimaging techniques will be collected. Women in the hypnosis
      group will undergo treatment with three in-person hypnotherapy sessions in addition to a
      mobile web-based hypnosis application. Women in the usual care group will continue their
      usual care for BPS/IC. Subjects in both groups will complete a variety of questionnaires on
      bladder pain, urinary symptoms, sleep, mood, affect, disability, and sexual function before
      and after treatment. The first follow up visit will occur at the end of treatment (4 weeks
      after randomization). A select group of patients who are eligible to undergo neuroimaging
      will be invited to participate in neuroimaging after the first follow up visit. Data will
      also be collected at a second follow up visit at 2 months after randomization.
