  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the Lowlands Saves Lives trial is to compare the quality of cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation (CPR) between face-to-face versus Lifesaver Virtual Reality smartphone
      application trained participants using a randomized controlled trial.

    <textblock>
      In order to optimize survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, basic life support (BLS)
      training of lay-person volunteers is essential. Face-to-face training has long been
      considered the standard, but new training-methods have emerged, of which the Lifesaver VR
      (developed by the UK Resuscitation Council) app seems promising. It is unknown which training
      method results in the highest quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Therefore, we
      conduct this randomized controlled trial in which subjects will be randomized to either one
      of the two training methods. Following the training, all participants will undergo
      CPR-quality testing using certified manikins and blinded assessors.

      The present study will be conducted during Lowlands Science, a section of the Lowlands music
      festival exclusively dedicated to science. Lowlands will be held on August 16-18 of 2019 and
      over 50.000 attendees are expected.
