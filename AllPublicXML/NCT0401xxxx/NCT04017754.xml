  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is based on the hypothesis, that recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is
      associated with abnormal mannose binding lectin (MBL) plasma level. Secondarily, MBL plasma
      level may affect the perinatal outcome in the first pregnancy following RPL. Thus, the
      present study aim to examine whether MBL should be a biomarker for women at risk for RPL and,
      secondarily, perinatal complications, and consequently help identify fragile women who need
      intensified perinatal care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), defined as 3 or more consecutive pregnancy losses before 22
      weeks of gestation, is a multifactorial disorder, affecting 1-3% of all couples aiming to
      have a child. The cause of RPL remain unknown in up to 50% of cases. Some of these cases may
      be affected by an aberrant immune system. Low levels of mannose binding lectin (MBL) in
      plasma have been associated with RPL, chorioamnionitis, and low birth weight, while high MBL
      levels have been associated with pro-inflammatory properties resulting in preterm labor and
      preeclampsia.

      Previous studies of MBL have proposed that high and low plasma levels, both may possess a
      negative effect by priming or promoting an aggressive immune response resulting in
      autoimmunity and tissue damage.

      This study is a single center case-control study and historical cohort study, that aims to
      investigate wether high and/or low MBL plasma levels are associated with RPL (primary
      outcome) and whether it affects perinatal outcome in the first pregnancy following the RPL
      and pregnancy outcome from before RPL in women with secondary RPL (secondary outcome). Thus,
      if such association exists, MBL could become an biomarker for the early identification of
      women with need for intensified perinatal care.

      The study sample consists of Danish women admitted to the Centre for Recurrent Pregnancy Loss
      of Western Denmark and the control group consists of Danish female blood donors of fertile
      age with unknown reproductive history. The study sample and control group target about 350
      women, each.

      Female patients in the study sample will have a blood sample taken at their first meeting in
      the Recurrent Miscarriage Center before they become pregnant, and they will be followed until
      delivery of the first child after RPL, if pregnancy after RPL is achieved. Data of perinatal
      outcome will be collected from hospital records.
