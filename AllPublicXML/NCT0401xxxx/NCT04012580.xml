  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed study, the investigators will examine the efficacy of transdiagnostic,
      Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) in the treatment of postpartum anxiety
      and depression. Half of participants will receive the treatment immediately, and half of the
      participants will be assigned to a treatment-as-usual control condition. Participants
      assigned to the control condition will be offered the treatment after a 12-week waiting
      period, although data from this portion will not be included in the current study. All
      participants will complete questionnaires prior to the start of the treatment, following
      treatment (or corresponding 8-week waiting period), at 1-months follow-up (or corresponding
      12-week waiting period), and at 6-months follow-up (in those assigned to the treatment
      condition). Further, those who receive the treatment will complete questionnaires on a weekly
      basis. The primary outcome measures include anxiety and depression. As part of the battery of
      questionnaires administered after the completion of the program, participants will be asked
      to rate the program content, the overall service, and their satisfaction with the program.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in postpartum depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, weeks 1-9, 13, and 37</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). 10 items are summed into a total score ranging from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating more severe depression.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, weeks 1-9, 13, and 37</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale 7-Item (GAD-7). 7 items are summed into a total score ranging from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating more severe self-reported levels of anxiety.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, weeks 1-9, 13, and 37</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-Item (PHQ-9). 9 items are summed into a total score, with scores ranging from 0 to 27. Higher scores are associated with higher depression severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in depression, anxiety, stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks, 1 month, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Depression and Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21). 21 items are summed into a total score ranging from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms with respect to the depression, anxiety, and stress subscales.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mother-infant bonding</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, weeks 9, 13, and 37</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Postnatal Bonding Questionnaire (PBQ). 25 items are summed into a total score ranging from 0 to 125, with higher scores indicating more reported difficulties bonding with one's baby.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Relationship satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, weeks 9, 13, and 37</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Dyadic Adjustment Scale-7 item (DAS-7). 7 items are summed into a total score ranging from 0 to 32, with higher scores indicating greater perceived relationship quality.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment credibility</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 9</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ). 6 items are summed into a total score and two subscales (credibility and expectancy). Total scores can range from 3 to 27, with higher scores representing greater perceptions of ICBT credibility.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Therapeutic alliance</measure>
    <time_frame>9 weeks following baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-SR). Scores are summed into three sub-total scores, which respectively assess various domains of the therapeutic relationship (i.e., goal, task, and bond). Sub-total scores each range between 5 and 20, with higher scores representing better therapeutic relationship in each of the three domains assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>9 weeks following baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (TSQ). 6 items are scored using various scales. Descriptive statistics are produced for each item.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse effects</measure>
    <time_frame>9 weeks following baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by questions assessing whether participants encountered any adverse effects of treatment, developed any new psychological symptoms, or experienced any unexpected events over the course of treatment</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Service utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 9, 13, and 37</time_frame>
