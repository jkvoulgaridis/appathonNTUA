    <textblock>
      This study is to explore the driving genes and the molecular mechanism of malignant
      transformation of adenomyosis. This study acquired the formalin fixed paraffin-embedded
      (FFPE) tissue of patients pathologically conformed endometrial carcinoma arising in
      adenomyosis (EC-AIA) treated at Peking Union Medical College Hospital from July 15, 2017 to
      July 15, 2019. The formalin fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from patients pathologically
      diagnosed with adenomyosis during this time period were also included as control specimens.
      The eutopic endometrium, normal adenomyosis tissue, and EC-AIA tissue were harvested from the
      FFPE tissue from patients with EC-AIA. The normal eutopic endometrium and normal adenomyosis
      tissue were obtained by laser microdissection. The driving genes and potential molecular
      mechanism of EC-AIA will be found by the technology of whole exome sequencing and
      transcriptomics (RNA-sequencing).
