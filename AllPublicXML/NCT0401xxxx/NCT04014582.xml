  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Communal coping consists of the appraisal of a problem as shared and collaboration to manage
      the problem. Among individuals with type 2 diabetes, self-report, daily diary, and
      observational measures of communal coping have been linked to better relationship and health
      outcomes. While communal coping has been linked to positive adjustment outcomes, there are no
      interventions that incorporate both components of communal coping theory; interventions often
      focus on collaborative strategies but do not emphasize a shared appraisal. However, focusing
      on the shared appraisal component of communal coping may be the critical component to affect
      change. The primary goal of this study will be to design an intervention that fosters both a
      shared appraisal and collaboration in individuals with type 2 diabetes. The second goal is to
      explore two potential mechanisms that may drive the links of the intervention to
      outcomes—perceived emotional responsiveness and self-efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be 60 couples recruited from a previous research study in which one person
      has type 2 diabetes. We will recruit 60 couples based on power analyses of collaboration
      based interventions. The design will be a two-group pretest-posttest design in which couples
      will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: communal coping or diabetes education.
      All couples will engage in 1) an in-person session, 2) a 7-day daily diary protocol, and 3) a
      phone call follow-up 1 month later. All participants will come into the laboratory at
      Carnegie Mellon University to complete a baseline questionnaire and listen to a brief
      diabetes education from the American Association of Diabetes Educators. Couples in the
      intervention group will then participate in the communal coping intervention. This
      intervention aims to foster a shared appraisal and collaboration through: the discussion of
      past joint coping, education about communal coping (e.g. what it is and why it is
      beneficial), and discussions to foster the perception of diabetes as shared. Participants in
      the intervention group will also create collaborative action plans to increase
      collaboration—collaborative intentions have been shown to successfully impact health outcomes
      for patients with type 2 diabetes. Couples in the intervention group will also receive two
      daily text messages—one a general reminder to engage in communal coping and the other one of
      the collaborative intentions they created during the in-person session.

      There will be two follow-up periods after this in-person session. First, all couples will
      answer daily questionnaires over a 7-day period starting the day after the in-person session.
      The second follow-up will be one month after the daily diary period, when couples will
      receive a follow up phone call to assess how the primary outcomes of interest changed over a
      longer period of time.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Depressive symptoms will be measured at baseline and 1 month after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Depressive symptoms will be measured via the 10 item CESD scale which range from 1 none of the time to 4 most of the time. This self-report questionnaire will be assessed for both patient and spouse. Higher numbers represent more depressive symptoms.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in life satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Life satisfaction will be measured at baseline and 1 month after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Life satisfaction will be measured via the Satisfaction with Life scale which range from 1 strongly disagree to 7 strongly agree. Higher numbers represent more life satisfaction. Both patients and spouses will report on life satisfaction.</description>

    <measure>Change in perceived stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Perceived stress will be measured at baseline and 1 month after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived stress will be measured via the 4 item Perceived Stress Scale which ranges from 1 never to 5 very often. Both patients and spouses will complete this self-report questionnaire.</description>

    <time_frame>Diabetes self-care will be measured at baseline and 1 month after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Diabetes self-care will be measured via the summary of diabetes self care activities. Patients will report on their own self care and spouses will report on their perceptions of the patient's self-care. The items in the SDSCA have varying scales based on the question, but higher numbers reflect greater self-care.</description>

    <time_frame>Perceived emotional responsiveness will be measured at measured at baseline and 1 month after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived emotional responsiveness measures the extent to which a spouse feels appropriately supported and understood by the partner. The items used in this scale are modified versions used by Fekete et al. 2007. The scale ranges from 1 not at all to 4 very much. Negative items will be reversed scored so the total scale reflects greater perceived emotional responsiveness for both patients and spouses.</description>
