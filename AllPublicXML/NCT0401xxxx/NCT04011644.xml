    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the impact on risky drinking days and quality of life for patients with
      alcohol use disorder among patients who use a mobile health smart phone application. A third
      of the participants will receive access to the smart phone app without any monitoring; a
      third of the participants will receive access to the smart phone app monitored by and
      connected with a peer mentor; a third will receive access to the smart phone app monitored by
      and connected with a health coach who works within a healthcare system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients in the trial will be given versions of an evidence-based mobile-health (mHealth)
      system (re-design based on A-CHESS) that is delivered using different implementation
      strategies according to study group. A-CHESS has more than 18 services designed to improve
      social relatedness, coping competence, and intrinsic motivation. The following describes key
      A-CHESS services that will be tested in the current study:

        -  Welcome message - patients write why they are choosing to reduce their drinking.

        -  Coping with Cravings - the system automatically notifies nearby pre-approved friends,
           family, and peers, who can respond to a request for support. The patient can also be
           linked to positive activities, such as suggested games to download and play and
           audio/video-based relaxation recordings.

        -  Monitoring functionality- self-assessment measures, record of A-CHESS use, and
           prediction of the patient's likelihood of having a heavy drinking episode in the next
           week. A-CHESS sends patients with worrisome responses suggestions of coping skills,
           online peer support, healthy events, etc. With patient permission, a prediction of
           high-risk can be shared with others in a position to provide support.

        -  Triage and feedback functionality is designed to derail a setback in goal attainment,
           giving the patient 'just in time,' tailored support by linking patients to relevant
           A-CHESS resources or individuals (depending on group assignment).

        -  The Specialist Report, harvests clinically relevant data from A-CHESS and presents it to
           a peer mentor (in the peer-supported group) or a health coach (in the clinically
           integrated group), at which point they may intervene with patients (e.g., through
           texting in A-CHESS).

        -  Facilitated discussion groups (in the clinically integrated group.) Discussions are
           monitored daily by an A-CHESS coach.

        -  Library - information about healthy lifestyle choices, calendar of healthy events in the
           area, etc.

        -  Drink tracker and report feature - patients to self-monitor their drinking and each week
           see a summary of how they did the past week.

        -  Profiles about why patients want to reduce their drinking.

      All patients enrolled in the study will participate in a 3-month intervention period followed
      by a 9-month follow-up period, for a total of 12 months. All patient will undergo a 72-hour
      run-in period. After 72 hours, patients who remain in the study will be randomized to one of
      the following groups and receive the appropriate access to features. One group will operate
      independently; one group will have help from a peer-mentor; one group will be connected to a
      healthcare system by a health coach.

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Self monitored</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients of this group will continue receiving regular care from their physician with no interference from the two experimental groups. Patient subjects will download the app on their Android or Apple smart phone that will direct them to external information hosted on the internet that may help reduce their drinking (e.g., NIAAA resources). For the first 12 weeks, once a week patients can set a weekly goal related to their alcohol use or other health related behaviors (e.g., &quot;I will only drink on Friday this week.&quot;). At the end of the week subjects will be prompted to take a weekly survey, which will include questions such as a variation of the brief alcohol monitor (BAM) and timeline followback. Patients will then receive feedback on the amount of drinks they had compared to their goal. Then the patient will set a new goal for the following week. Patients will complete quarterly surveys on the A-CHESS app to assess study outcomes.</description>

    <description>Patients will be asked to take the same surveys and have the access to the same information as the self-monitoring group. Patient subjects in this group will have access to discussion boards where they can talk to one another and have the ability to share and see stories of other patients. The only involvement of someone other than patients themselves in the peer-supported group will be by a sponsor (i.e., a dedicated user from the area with a sustained history of successful alcohol reduction). The sponsor will participate in discussion groups and encourage use of the system. Patient-reported feedback will be presented directly to the patient.</description>
