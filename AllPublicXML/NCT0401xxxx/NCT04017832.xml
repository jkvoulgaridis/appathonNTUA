    <textblock>
      This study compares 2 medicines for type 2 diabetes: oral semaglutide (a new medicine) and
      sitagliptin (a medicine doctors can already prescribe). Participants will either get oral
      semaglutide or sitagliptin - which treatment is decided by chance. Participants will get 2
      tablets a day to take first thing in the morning on an empty stomach. Only 1 tablet has study
      medicine in it. The other tablet is a dummy medicine (placebo). After taking the semaglutide
      tablet, participants may not eat or drink anything for at least 30 minutes. After the 30
      minutes, participants must take the sitagliptin tablet. Then participants can have their
      first meal of the day and take any other medicines they may need, including their metformin.
      The study will last for about 7 months (33 weeks). Participants will have 8 clinic visits and
      1 phone call with the study doctor. At all 8 of the clinic visits, participants will have
      blood samples taken.
