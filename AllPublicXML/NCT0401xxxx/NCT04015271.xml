    <textblock>
      The objective of this pilot randomized controlled single blinded, parallel-group study is to
      detect change of the Action Observation (AO) and Repetitive Task Practice (RTP) combined
      practice schedule on upper limb motor impairment outcomes in chronic, moderately impaired
      stroke survivors.

      The current proposal aims to conduct a pilot randomized controlled single blinded,
      parallel-group study design to detect change of the Action Observation (AO) and Repetitive
      Task Practice (RTP) combined practice schedule on upper limb (UL) motor impairment outcomes
      in the chronic, moderately impaired stroke survivor. Individuals will be randomized to 1)
      experimental conditions of AO + RTP practice schedule, or 2) control condition of Placebo
      Video (PV) + RTP, and will receive an assigned regimen from a blinded intervention therapist
      for one hour, 3 times per week, for 8 weeks (total of 24 sessions), and a daily 30 minute
      HEP. A blinded assessor will complete assessments on each subject at three distinct time
      points of pretest, post intervention, and 1 month post intervention.

    <description>Action Observation (AO) therapy regimen will include watching a 6 minute video of another person completing a specified functional task (Putting on a shirt, pick up a sandwich and bring to mouth, eat food with a spoon, or cut meat with knife and fork). Subjects will be instructed to carefully watch the AO video and prepare to physically perform the task immediately after observing the video. The Repetitive Task Practice (RTP) therapy regimen emphasizes repeated physical performance with the hemiplegic upper limb for 24 minutes of a specified functional task that is matched to the AO recording. The AO + RTP regimens will be repeated for a total of 60 minutes. Each Subject will complete a Home Exercise Program (HEP) will include practicing components and movement patterns of the functional task that was difficult for the patient to perform during RTP intervention for 30 minutes each day outside of scheduled intervention sessions.</description>

    <description>The control placebo videos (PV) will be 6 minutes, and will include a series of changing static images without animals, human beings, or sound (i.e. pictures of buildings, trees, cruise ships, mountains, beach umbrellas, beds, and tables). A Repetitive Task Practice (RTP) therapy regimen will be completed immediately after observing the PV, which emphasizes repeated physical performance with the hemiplegic upper limb for 24 minutes of a specified functional task. These tasks include putting on a shirt, picking up a sandwich and bringing it to mouth, eating food with a spoon, or cutting meat with knife and fork. The PV + RTP regimens will be repeated for a total of 60 minutes. Each Subject will complete a Home Exercise Program (HEP) will include practicing components and movement patterns of the functional task that was difficult for the patient to perform during RTP intervention for 30 minutes each day outside of scheduled intervention sessions.</description>
