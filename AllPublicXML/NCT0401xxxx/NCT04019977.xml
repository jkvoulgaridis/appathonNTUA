  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the effects on early child development of
      early community services, including a brief nurse home visiting program. Investigators
      hypothesize that nurse home visiting program participants will be significantly different
      than non- nurse home visiting program participants on the following child and family
      outcomes: (a) (reduced) infant emergency room use and overnight hospital stays; (b)
      (increased) family use of community resources and (higher quality) child care; (c)
      (increased) maternal wellbeing; and (d) (increased) quality of the home environment,
      including home safety and supportive parenting by both parents. The study will also explore
      long-term differences between the nurse home visiting program recipients and non-recipients
      in (a) rates of official investigations for child maltreatment and (b) two indicators of
      early educational achievement: kindergarten readiness scores and rates of kindergarten
      attendance.

      The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the effects on child and family development
      of early community services, including a brief nurse home visiting program. The proposed
      study will be conducted in partnership with the brief nurse home visiting program and Sinai
      Hospital, both located in Baltimore, MD. For the purposes of this study, Sinai Hospital will
      serve as the community/catchment area. Nurse home visitors enroll new mothers into the nurse
      home visiting program while they are still in the hospital/maternity ward. When the current
      study officially begins, nurse home visitors will recruit new mothers into the nurse home
      visiting program every other day only (on odd dates). Research staff will recruit all
      Baltimore City residents who give birth at Sinai Hospital, regardless of odd/even birth date,
      while they are still in the hospital/maternity ward.

    <masking_description>As described above, the nurse home visiting program is being provided on a random-assignment basis according to child birthdate. Nurse home visitors will enroll new mothers into the nurse home visiting program every other day only (on odd dates). The new mothers who give birth on an even date will not be offered the nurse home visiting program. They will be considered the &quot;control&quot; group and are expected to access community services as they normally would.</masking_description>
