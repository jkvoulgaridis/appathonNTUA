  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To meet the unmet need of better and safer pain relief for acute pain in the post-operative
      setting, a Vital-signs-integrated Patient-assisted Intravenous opioid Analgesia (&quot;VPIA&quot;)
      Delivery System, with novel and intelligent software algorithms and specialised hardware was
      developed. In the previous project, the investigators have shown that this system has the
      potential to increase the safety and patient satisfaction with intravenous opioid analgesia.
      However, opportunities to develop more robust vital signs monitoring with the goal of
      ensuring continual and effective analgesia are identified.

      The primary aim of this proposal is to advance the development of technology (through new
      features and functionality) and perform clinical evaluation of the VPIA system with a larger
      sample size to show improvements in patient's satisfaction (pain relief) and robustness of
      system in terms of vital signs integration. Novel technology using adaptive vital signs
      controller, integrated with an infusion pump and single finger probe vital signs monitor
      system will be developed with the aim for commercialisation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a prospective cohort study in 150 adult female subjects that
      undergo major surgery that require postoperative patient controlled morphine analgesia so as
      to examine the monitoring performance of oxygen desaturation, respiratory depression and
      patient satisfaction and user feedback.

      Patients who are undergoing elective surgery with plan to use postoperative patient
      controlled analgesia with morphine will receive study information either at pre-operative
      assessment clinic or upon admission for surgery if they have not attended the pre-operative
      assessment clinic. They will be screened for eligibility using the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. If eligible for recruitment, the patients will be approached by the investigators
      for recruitment. Upon successful recruitment of the study, patients will be asked to complete
      two questionnaires and rate their pre-surgical pain on the numerical rating scale in the
      pre-anaesthetic evaluation clinic. The general anaesthesia technique and type of analgesia
      administered intra-operatively will be according to standard practice and is at the
      discretion of the attending anaesthesiologist. After surgery, patients will be reviewed daily
      (up to 3 days) in the post-operative wards. They will be asked on questionnaire scoring, pain
      score, and analgesia information and adverse event, if any.

    <measure>Changes in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Before surgery (1 day) and postoperative period (1-3 days)</time_frame>
    <description>HADS Anxiety and Depression score before and after surgery. HADS is commonly used by doctors to determine the levels of anxiety and depression that a patient is experiencing. Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression. The HADS uses a scale and therefore the data returned from the HADS is ordinal. For each subscore (anxiety/depression), 0-7 = Normal; 8-10 = Borderline abnormal (borderline case); and 11-21 = Abnormal (case).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EQ-5D-3L score</measure>
    <time_frame>Before surgery (1 day)</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D-3L score before surgery. EQ-5D-3L is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. It is made up for two components; health state description and evaluation. The health status is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression; each dimension ranging from 1-3. From these five dimensions, EQ-5D index is calculated, having a value between 0-1. The evaluation part involves an analogue scale, asking to mark health status on the day of the interview on a 20 cm vertical scale with end points of 0 and 100. Zero corresponds to &quot; the worst health you can imagine&quot;, and hundred corresponds to &quot;the best health you can imagine&quot;.</description>
