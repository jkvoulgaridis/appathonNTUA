  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is done with the aim of finding the association between the bilirubin and bile
      acids / DAMPS molecule with organ failures and sepsis in the patients with acute on chronic
      liver failure . in this study there are 2 parts in the first part people who satisfy the
      eligibility criteria will be recruited and blood samples will be taken and above mentioned
      molecules will be analyzed and association ,if any with occurrences of organ failures / new
      onset sepsis will be analyzed .

      In the second part of the study the patients who meet the criteria will be randomized to
      either receive standard medical therapy or with either haemoperfusion or therapeutic plasma
      exchange with standard medical therapy . blood samples will be taken and stored, bile acids
      (primary and secondary bile acids, bilirubin and damps molecules will be analysed .the
      patients are followed for 90 days , then statistical analysis will be done to find the
      association with organ failures and new onset sepsis .

    <description>Three sessions of Hemoperfusion, 1 plasma volume/session will be done to the selected patients.
Hemoperfusion will be done through bile acids and ammonia filters to adsorb bile acids and ammonia respectively.
Group specific fresh frozen plasma will be transfused to the patient through a peripheral vein catheter to prevent hypotension if required.</description>
