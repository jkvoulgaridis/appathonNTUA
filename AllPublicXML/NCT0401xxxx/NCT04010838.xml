  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disorders of consciousness(DOC) is the most serious complications and has been widely paid
      attention to by the government. DOC patients cause large social and economic burden to our
      society for there has no effective cure so far. Spinal cord stimulation(SCS) for
      wake-promoting therapy has aroused scholars' attention and become a hot area recently. There
      was much debate about the effectiveness of SCS therapy, but because of the limitation of our
      understanding of consciousness and the uncertainty of parameters of the stimulation, So, to
      figure out the indications and effectiveness of neuromodulation therapy should be the first
      step, and finding individual treatment and parameter may have important implications for DOC
      patients.

    <textblock>
      The spinal cord stimulation therapy is explorative at best at the moment. Attempts to improve
      the level of consciousness of patients in the different stages of DOC have shown some
      promise. Spinal cord stimulation(SCS) seem promising in some studies, suggesting that further
      research is needed. Current publications of DOC spinal cord stimulation therapy was not
      convincing because of the small number of patients and no randomized controlled trial.
      Therefore, there was much debate about the effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation therapy
      because of the limitation of our understanding of consciousness and the uncertainty of
      parameters of neuromodulation. The better understanding of brain function and large
      randomized trials are necessary. Future research should also focus on identifying specific
      neuro-biomarkers (i.e. neural network). So, to figure out the indications and effectiveness
      of neuromodulation therapy should be the first step, and finding individual treatment and
      parameter may have important implications for DOC patients.

      Scientific Issues Targeted:1) To figure out the effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation
      therapy using random controlled trial. 2) To explore individual parameters of SCS techniques.
