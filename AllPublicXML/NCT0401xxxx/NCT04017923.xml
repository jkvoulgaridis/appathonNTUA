  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      It is predicted that the nasal tip support will decrease with aging due to weakening of
      cartilage and connective tissues. However, there is no consensus on the age at which this
      change began. It is quite difficult to evaluate the nasal tip support, while the ideal nasal
      tip support pressure is also not known. The aim of this study is to determine the nasal tip
      support pressure alterations in various age groups, by measuring nasal tip support with a
      Newton meter, according to age and gender.

      Methods:

      This prospective clinical study was conducted between January 2019 and April 2019 at a
      tertiary health facility. Nasal tip resistances in 4 different age groups, as 20-29, 30-39,
      40-64 and 65 years and older, were measured with a digital Newton meter. A total number of
      159 patients with a minimum of 36 patients in each age group were included in the study.
      Nasal tip resistance measurements were compared among nasal tip displacement distances of
      2mm, 3mm and 4mm, according to age groups and gender.
