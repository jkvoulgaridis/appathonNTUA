  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess an online mindfulness intervention for pregnant women (6
      weeks) for the treatment of insomnia and prevention of depression relapse in pregnancy. This
      mindfulness intervention will also be compared with an online intervention (6 weeks)
      consisting only of education about insomnia in pregnancy. The principal hypothesis is that
      the mindfulness intervention will be more effective than the education-only intervention.

      The aim of this study is to assess an online mindfulness intervention for pregnant women (6
      weeks) for the treatment of insomnia and prevention of depression relapse in pregnancy.

      There will be two groups:

        1. An online mindfulness intervention for pregnant women (6 weeks) that focuses on
           behaviors to overcome sleep difficulties in pregnancy.

        2. An online control group that will receive information about sleep in pregnancy (6
           weeks).

      Each group will be composed of 25 participants with a total sample of 50. The principal
      hypothesis is that the mindfulness intervention will be more effective than sleep education
      in the improvement of sleep and depression symptoms during pregnancy.

      The differences between the intervention and control group will be analyzed. The
      acceptability and usability of online content will also be assessed.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep efficiency</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment to intervention completion (6 weeks)</time_frame>
