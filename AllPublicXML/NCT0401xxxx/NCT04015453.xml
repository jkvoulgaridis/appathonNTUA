  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective cohort study of early and late period postoperative scars using previously
      validated survey measures and clinical photographs. The target population consists of
      participants treated with Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) for a facial skin cancer by the
      division of dermatologic surgery. This study aims to determine if patient assessment of scar
      appearance correlates with physician ratings and/or third-person observer ratings. Secondary
      goals are to assess for correlations between early post-operative scar appearance and
      long-term scar appearance as well as identification of predictive factors for scar healing.

    <textblock>
      Scarring is an inevitable outcome of surgical manipulation of the skin. Previous studies have
      shown that postoperative scarring, especially in cosmetically sensitive areas, may negatively
      affect patient quality of life and social interactions. The impact of surgical scarring is
      magnified in Mohs micrographic surgery, for which the large proportion of treated lesions are
      in highly visible areas, such as the head, face, and neck. Clinicians often underestimate the
      significance of scarring in patients' daily activities. Patients desire quick healing
      surgical scars in order to reintegrate into their normal social routines. Anecdotal evidence
      suggests that scars that heal well early in the post-operative period will achieve better
      results in the late postoperative period. Determining a model of early and late surgical scar
      evolution, as rated by patients, physicians, and third-party observers may; 1. Identify gaps
      between physician and patient evaluations; 2. Assist clinicians in effectively evaluating and
      counseling patients regarding their post-operative scar appearance.

    <description>The Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) is a validated scoring instrument that takes into account patient, physician, and third-party observer input to evaluate postsurgical scar quality in clinical photos. The instrument has 6 patient and 6 observer specific questions. Scoring of each question is performed on a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 is synonymous with &quot;like normal skin&quot; and 10 to the &quot;worst scar imaginable&quot;. In addition, an overall total opinion score on a scale from 1 to 10 where 1 is akin to normal skin and 10 to the worst scar imaginable. Consequently, higher scores on either scale represent a worse scar appearance in the perception of the rater.</description>
