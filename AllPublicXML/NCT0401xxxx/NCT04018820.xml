  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eleven men with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) underwent a 12-week lower-limb strength
      training program. The training program consisted of 3 series of 6 to 8 maximal repetitions of
      5 different exercises: Leg extension, leg press, hip abduction, squat and plantar flexion.
      Training sessions were closely supervised and took place twice a week. It is hypothesised
      that the training program will induce muscular hypertrophy despite the genetic defect. The
      training program should also have positive effects on function. The participants were
      evaluated at baseline, week 6, week 12, month 6 and month 9 to see the effects of the
      training program and if these effects are maintained over time.
