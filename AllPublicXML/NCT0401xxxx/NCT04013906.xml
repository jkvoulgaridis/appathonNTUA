      Preliminary experiences show that IVL is promising for achieving an effective plaque
      modification at time of PCI.

      However, uncertainty about the optimal tool to select in case of calcification of coronary
      lesions exists, as no randomized comparisons between rotational atherectomy and intravascular
      lithotripsy have been carried out so far.

      The aim of this pilot randomized trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intensive
      plaque modification with rotational atherectomy vs. intravascular lithotripsy before
      placement of a drug-eluting stent.

    <textblock>
      Calcification of the coronary lesion is challenging during percutaneous coronary intervention
      (PCI) since it can cause the balloon dilation to fail with subsequent incomplete and
      asymmetrical stent expansion. Also, calcified coronary lesions are associated with increased
      risk of adverse events after PCI, such as stent restenosis and thrombosis.

      Several devices and techniques have been proposed to treat severely calcified coronary
      lesions. For many years, modification of these lesions with rotational atherectomy has been
      considered the gold standard to ease the process of angioplasty and PCI. Recently,
      intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) has been proposed as an alternative to rotational atherectomy
      for the treatment of calcified de-novo coronary lesions. The Shockwave Medical Coronary Rx
      Intravascular Lithotripsy (IVL) System (Shockwave Medical Inc., Fremont, California, USA) is
      a novel balloon catheter-based device able to disrupt calcified lesions using technology like
      lithotripsy for kidney stones. Preliminary experiences show that IVL is promising for
      achieving an effective plaque modification at time of PCI.

      However, uncertainty about the optimal tool to select in case of calcification of coronary
      lesions exists, as no randomized comparisons between rotational atherectomy and intravascular
      lithotripsy have been carried out so far.

      The aim of this pilot randomized trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intensive
      plaque modification with rotational atherectomy vs. intravascular lithotripsy before
      placement of a drug-eluting stent.
