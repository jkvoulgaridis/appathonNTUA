  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The REVIAN study is designed as a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind, parallel
      study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the REVIAN System in male participants with
      androgenic alopecia. An Active modulated light therapy REVIAN System will be compared to a
      Placebo Comparator non-active REVIAN System in participants using the device for a daily
      10-minute treatment over the course of 26-weeks. At each follow-up visit, participants will
      be interviewed to determine if any adverse events (AEs) were experienced since the previous
      follow-up visit. All participants will be required to complete self-administering scalp hair
      growth and life quality questionnaires at each follow-up visit. Investigators will be
      required to complete global assessments of scalp hair growth for each enrolled participant at
      each follow-up visit. Macrophotography evaluations will be performed at baseline, 8-, 16-,
      and 26 weeks for all participants using standard Canfield blinded reviewer. Global
      photographs of superior and vertex scalp will be taken by participants and by PI to be
      assessed by a blinded reviewer once all photos have been captured for each participant per
      visit.
