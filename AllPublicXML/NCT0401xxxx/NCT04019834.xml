  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if pre-operative regional nerve blocks compared to a
      placebo nerve block can decrease chronic post mastectomy pain, immediate postoperative pain
      and postoperative narcotic consumption.

    <textblock>
      Surgical intervention of breast cancer is vital to breast cancer treatment or prevention and
      patient outcomes. However, surgical therapy can lead to chronic pain that may affect quality
      of life for breast cancer survivors including the potential for long-term disability. Chronic
      pain after breast cancer surgery is common, occurring in about 25-50% of patients. This
      chronic pain commonly affects women following a mastectomy and is referred to as Post
      Mastectomy Pain Syndrome (PMPS). Regional anesthesia utilizing single dose nerve blocks is
      frequently utilized in the preoperative period for many surgical procedures and decreases
      postoperative pain. Regional anesthesia also frequently results in decreased narcotic use in
      the post-operative period. The use of regional fascial plane blocks or Pectoralis (PECs)
      blocks has increased in the setting of mastectomy. The regional block utilizes ultrasound
      guidance to inject local anesthesia into the fascial planes of muscles thereby infiltrate the
      surrounding nerves. One example is the pectoral I block which deposits local anesthetic
      between the pectoralis major and minor muscles and pectoral II above the serratus anterior
      muscle with an intended blockade for intercostals III, IV, V, VI and long thoracic nerves.
      These techniques have shown a decrease in postoperative pain and postoperative narcotic
      consumption. The investigators seek to evaluate if preoperative regional nerve blocks
      decrease post mastectomy chronic pain, improving the quality of life of breast cancer
      survivors. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine whether regional nerve blocks
      affect chronic post-mastectomy pain and whether the regional block is associated with
      perioperative pain and postoperative narcotic consumption.

The study team will evaluate patient reported levels of pain at 8 hours. This series of questions will be administered in person during the inpatient stay and by telephone or in the clinic setting after discharge.</description>
