  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A glycyrrhizin-containing product, Stronger Neo-Minophagen C TM (SNMC; Minophagen
      Pharmaceutical Co.Ltd.,Tokyo,Japan),is widely used in Japan for suppression of hepatitis
      activity and for prevention of disease progression in patients with hepatitis B virus- and
      HCV-induced chronic hepatitis. In Taiwan, SNMC has been licensed by Taiwan Food and Drug
      Administration for the indication of maintain hepatic function. Glycyrrhizin has been
      reported to mitigate hepatic inflammation by suppressing elevated alanine
      aminotransferase(ALT) levels and preventing disease progression. The effect of SNMC on acute
      deterioration of hepatic function following transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) was still
      unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of SNMC on acute deterioration of hepatic
      function following TACE.

    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer in the world and the most
      common primary liver cancer. There are a variety of therapies for treatment of HCC; among
      them, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is one of the most commonly used treatment
      modalities. TACE induces ischemic tumor necrosis by obstruction of hepatic artery blood flow
      and exerts an anticancer effect via chemotherapeutic agents such as adriamycin or cisplatin
      mixed with Lipiodol. In the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)
      guidelines for the management of HCC, TACE is recommended for patients with
      intermediate-stage HCC according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system,
      because TACE was found to improve survival compared with the best supportive care in patients
      with unresectable HCC. Although TACE is the established standard of care only for
      intermediate-stage HCC, in recent years, TACE has been used widely even in treatment of
      advanced-stage HCC. The most frequent side effects of TACE are fever, nausea, and abdominal
      pain, and these side effects are self-limiting in the majority of patients. However, acute
      deterioration of hepatic function following TACE is a potentially life-threatening
      complication that occasionally interferes with continuation of TACE in patients with HCC.
      Although TACE has marked direct antitumor effects, it can also result in more complications
      than conservative management, because the ischemic damage caused by TACE can influence not
      only tumor tissue but non-tumorous liver tissue.This study aimed to evaluate the effect of
      SNMC on acute deterioration of hepatic function following TACE.
