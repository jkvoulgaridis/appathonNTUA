  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer, which has a low 5-year overall survival rate for all stages (&lt;20%) , is
      increasing in incidence. Previous studies have shown that the Hedgehog (Hh) and AKT signaling
      pathways are activated in a significant proportion of esophageal cancers. Itraconazole, a
      widely used anti-fungal medication, has been shown to inhibit various pathways involved in
      esophageal cancer tumorigenesis including Hh and AKT. In this phase II clinical trial, the
      investigators aim to evaluate the effect of itraconazole as a neoadjuvant therapy following
      standard of care chemoradiation in the treatment of locoregional esophageal and
      gastroesophageal junction carcinomas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer has a high incidence rate in the United States, and novel approaches to its
      treatment are being studied. Itraconazole, an antifungal agent, has been shown to inhibit the
      Hedgehog (Hh) and AKT signaling pathways, which are upregulated in esophageal cancer and
      promote tumor cell growth. This study will evaluate whether the use of itraconazole leads to
      increased rates of pathological complete response (pathCR) by at least 15% from the
      historical pathCR rate of 25% in patients with esophageal cancer or gastroesophageal junction
      (GEJ) adenocarcinoma. The investigators will enroll approximately 78 patients with esophageal
      cancer or GEJ adenocarcinoma who will then undergo standard of care staging work-up with a
      PET/CT and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). In a subset of patients, biopsies will be obtained to
      assess the status of the Hh and AKT signaling pathways by PCR, Western blot, and
      immunohistochemistry in the primary tumor before treatment. If no distant metastases are
      found, all patients will undergo 5-6 weeks of standard of care neoadjuvant chemoradiation.
      Following this, all patients will be given itraconazole 300 mg twice daily for 6-8 weeks.
      Adverse effects to itraconazole will be monitored in oncology clinic. If standard restaging
      PET/CT following neoadjuvant chemoradiation does not reveal new metastases, the patient will
      undergo an esophagectomy. Samples from normal esophageal tissue will be analyzed for presence
      of itraconazole and its metabolites to determine if the patients were taking the study drug.
      Tumor tissue will be evaluated for status of Hh pathway activation, AKT and VEGFR2
      phosphorylation, Ki67 immunostaining, and other molecular pathways with comparisons made to
      pre-treatment biopsies if available. The final pathology report will indicate whether the
      patient has achieved pathCR. Because the Hh signaling pathway is a resistance pathway that
      can be upregulated in response to chemoradiation, the investigators believe that
      administering itraconazole following neoadjuvant chemoradiation will lead to a higher pathCR
      rate. This in turn should be able to improve treatment outcomes in patients with esophageal
      cancer and GEJ adenocarcinoma.

    <description>Generally for esophageal cancer the pathological complete response rate at time of esophagectomy is 25%, and we have designed our study with the projected number of patients assuming we observe an improvement of 15% or more in this rate following treatment with itraconazole. This is the study's primary endpoint. By inhibiting the Hh signaling pathway with the use of itraconazole, we anticipate improved pathological complete response rates.</description>

    <description>As part of clinical staging, patients will undergo endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) following a PET/CT that does not show metastases. During EUS, some patients will undergo eight research biopsies obtained with large forceps for research purposes at the level of the visualized esophageal mass or abnormality (3 for RNA isolation, 3 for protein isolation, and 2 for formalin fixation). Three research biopsies for RNA isolation will also be obtained from normal appearing esophagus, at least 5 cm away from any mass lesions. The research biopsies will be submitted to qPCR analysis for mRNA expression levels of SHH, IHH, PTCH, GLI1, GLI2, and GLI3 (Hedgehog pathway components). Comparisons will be made between mass biopsies and normal esophageal tissues. Following esophagectomy, tissues will be analyzed for the aforementioned hedgehog pathway markers to determine response to therapy.</description>
