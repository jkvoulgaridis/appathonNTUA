  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common form of chronic idiopathic diffuse
      interstitial lung disease (DILD) in adults. It is a fibroproliferative, irreversible disease
      of unknown cause, usually progressive, occurring mainly from the age of 60 and limited to the
      lungs. IPF is a serious disease with a median survival rate at diagnosis of 3 years.

      The aim of the study is to set up a biocollection of serum from patients in a context of
      idiopathic DILD and a possible or confirmed diagnosis of common interstitial lung disease by
      chest CT.

      Patients will be recruited at the consultations of the Rennes Rare Lung Disease Competence
      Centre. These will be patients in stable condition or in acute exacerbation of IPF.

      This study will initially focus on circulating serum CD163 markers, but a broader proteomics
      approach could be considered in a second phase to look for other markers of lung diseases.

    <description>Three additional blood tubes (3 x 8mL) will be collected for this study. They will be added to the traditional diagnostic assessment carried out for their IPF, during their consultation at the competence centre for rare lung diseases. These samples will be taken by a registered nurse in the presence and under the responsibility of the investigator.</description>
