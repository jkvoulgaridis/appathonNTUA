  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Twelve patients with relapsed malignant pleural mesothelioma will be treated with
      intratumoral injections of MTG201, a replication incompetent adenovirus, modified by the
      insertion of the reduced expression in immortalized cells (REIC)/Dikkopf (Dkk)-3 gene, on
      Days 1, 8, 22, and 50. Patients will also receive every 4 weekly intravenous infusions of
      nivolumab, 480 mg, starting on Day 2. Safety and anti-tumor activity will be monitored at
      regular intervals throughout the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of the efficacy and safety of MTG201 given by intratumoral injection to
      patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma who have failed front line chemotherapy.
      Patients will also receive IV infusions of nivolumab every 4 weeks. MTG201 is a replication
      incompetent adenovirus into which the gene for REIC/Dkk-3 has been inserted. The insertion of
      this gene has been shown to endow the adenovirus with anti-tumor activity and to result in
      enhanced anti-tumor immunity.

      MTG201, 3 x 10E12 vp, will be given by intratumoral injection on days 1, 8, 22 and 50.
      Nivolumab, 480 mg, will be given by IV infusion every 4 weeks until progression. Efficacy
      will be assessed by CT scans at 4 and 12 weeks, then every 3 months. Safety will be assessed
      by reported adverse events, periodic laboratory assessments, physical exams, vital signs. The
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of MTG201 will be assessed periodically. Tumor biopsy
      will be obtained on Days 1, 8 and 50 prior to MTG201 administration.
