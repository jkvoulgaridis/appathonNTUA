  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dolutegravir (DTG) is a well-tolerated 2nd generation integrase strand transfer inhibitor
      (INSTI); rilpivirine (RPV) is a well-tolerated non- nucleoside reverse transcriptase
      inhibitors (NNRTI) and lamivudine (3TC) is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
      (NRTIs). This study aims to gather the real-world evidence to evaluate effectiveness of the
      two-drug regimen (2DR). This is a multi-site observational study in subjects who have started
      and/or who plan to initiate 2DR with an integrase inhibitor plus a reverse transcriptase
      inhibitor. The study does not require any changes to the routine standard of care that
      subjects receive. Approximately 500 eligible subjects will be included from potential
      investigational sites across Europe and data from them will be collected either
      retrospectively or prospectively.
