      The purpose of this study is to assess the strategy in treatment selection using ctDNA
      fraction as a predictive biomarker (ctDNA fraction ≤10% receives enzalutamide, and ctDNA
      fraction &gt;10% receives docetaxel) versus clinician's choice of enzalutamide or docetaxel, in
      subjects with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer post abiraterone.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, phase II trial with 1:1 randomization to either Arm A
      biomarker directed therapy (patients with ctDNA fraction ≤10% receive enzalutamide, and ctDNA
      fraction &gt;10% receive docetaxel), versus Arm B clinician's choice of enzalutamide or
      docetaxel, in subjects with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer post abiraterone.
      At time of progression patients will cross-over to the other therapy i.e. enzalutamide to
      docetaxel, and docetaxel to enzalutmide

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Willing and able to provide informed consent

          2. Adult males ≥ 18 years age

          3. History of histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate without evidence of
             neuroendocrine or small cell differentiation. If histology is not available, patients
             must have metastatic disease typical of prostate cancer (i.e., involving bone or
             pelvic lymph nodes or para-aortic lymph nodes) AND a serum concentration of PSA that
             is rising and &gt;20ng/mL at the time prostate cancer was diagnosed clinically

          4. Consent to analysis of archival tissue collected at diagnosis is mandatory

          5. Prior surgical orchiectomy or if on LHRH agonist/antagonist then testosterone &lt; 1.7

             of the following three criteria as per PCWG3:

               1. PSA progression: minimum of two rising PSA values from a baseline measurement of

               2. Soft tissue or visceral disease progression: an increase ≥20% in the sum of the
                  diameter (short axis for nodal lesions and long axis for non-nodal lesions) from
                  the smallest sum of the diameter since treatment started, or appearance of any
                  new lesions as per RECIST 1.1

               3. Bone progression: ≥ 2 new lesions on bone scan confirmed on subsequent bone scan

                  hemoglobin ≥ 90 g/L

               2. Creatinine clearance ≥ 30 ml/min (calculated by Cockcroft-Gault formula)

               3. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) except for patients with
                  known Gilbert's syndrome (direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN)
