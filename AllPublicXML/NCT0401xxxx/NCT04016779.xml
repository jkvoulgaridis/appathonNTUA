             of major depression disorder (MDD), nicotine dependence, social anxiety disorder,
             generalized anxiety disorder, or phobias, and subject is not receiving pharmacological

             disorder (excluding nicotine and caffeine) (per DSM-5 criteria) within the 12 months
             prior to screening; or is assessed by the Investigator as having regularly consumed
             alcohol exceeding 21 units for males and 14 units for females per week (1 unit equals
             340 mL of beer, 115 mL of wine, or 43 mL of spirits) within the 12 months prior to
             screening.

         13. Is currently using, or has a positive result on the drug screening at the Screening
             Visit for drugs of abuse (alcohol, opiates, methadone, cocaine, methamphetamine
             [including ecstasy], phencyclidine, propoxyphene, methylphenidate, barbiturates, and
             benzodiazepines). If subject's serum drug screen for ethanol is positive at Screening
             (V1) and the investigator determines subject does not have alcohol use disorder, then
             the subject may have a repeat serum drug screen for ethanol performed before baseline
             within the allotted screening period (results must be received prior to V2 baseline).
             If second serum drug screen for ethanol is positive, subject is excluded from
             participating in the study, however, if second serum drug screen for ethanol is
             negative, subject may proceed to V2.

         14. Is a (known or self-identified) current habitual/chronic cannabis user (medicinal or
             recreational); or

               -  Has a positive urine drug screen for cannabis at the Screening Visit and is
                  considered, per the Investigator's judgement, to be a habitual/chronic cannabis
                  user; or

               -  Has a positive urine drug screen for cannabis at both the screening and follow-up
                  drug screen at the Baseline Visit, even though the subject is not considered, per
                  the Investigator's judgement, to be a habitual/chronic cannabis user.

             Note: Subjects who have a positive urine drug screen for cannabis at the Screening
             Visit but who are not considered to be a habitual/chronic cannabis user per the
             Investigator's judgement may, with Sponsor approval, undergo an additional urine drug
             screen at least 4 weeks after the original urine drug screen at Baseline Visit, prior
             to randomization. Subjects must agree to refrain from cannabis use throughout study.

         15. Has treatment-resistant ADHD based on a history of receipt of &gt;2 approved ADHD
             medications that failed to adequately improve the subject's symptoms. A subject who is
             naïve to ADHD treatment is not excluded from study participation.

         16. Has any other disorder for which its treatment takes priority over treatment of ADHD
             or is likely to interfere with study treatment, impair treatment compliance, or
             interfere with interpretation of study results.

         17. Has history of cancer, other than basal cell or Stage 1 squamous cell carcinoma of the

         18. Has or has had one or more of the following conditions considered clinically
             significant/relevant by the Investigator in the context of the study:
