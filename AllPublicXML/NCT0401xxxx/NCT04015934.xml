    <textblock>
      The cornerstone treatment for multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN), a rare and disabling
      dysimmune neuropathy, is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). The aim of this study is to
      identify prognostic factors of poor outcome.

      Data were retrospectively collected from MNN patients in three French centers. Patients were
      divided into two groups: a good outcome group and a poor outcome group. Demographic,
      clinical, biological and nerve conduction study features of MMN patients were analyzed.
      Identification of prognostic factors in MMN could help develop personalized treatment.

      The cornerstone treatment for multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN), a rare and disabling
      dysimmune neuropathy, is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). However, 10% of patients progress
      despite treatment. The aim of this study is to identify prognostic factors of poor outcome.

      Data were retrospectively collected from MNN patients in three French centers. Patients were
      divided into two groups: a good outcome group (patients in remission without IVIg or with
      spaced IVIg courses), and a poor outcome group (patients dependent on continuous IVIg
      treatment or deteriorating despite IVIg). Investigators searched predictive factors of
      long-term outcome in MMN. They studied demographic, clinical, biological and nerve conduction
      study features of MMN patients.Identification of prognostic factors in MMN could help develop
      personalized treatment by selecting patients eligible for immunosuppressive drugs before IVIg
      dependence or progression.
