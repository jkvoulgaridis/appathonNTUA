    <textblock>
      In this study, we aim to improve respiratory function and balance of decreased muscle
      strength, decrease fatigue values, improve quality of life, improve inflammation findings and
      GFR ( Glomerular filtration rate) values in pediatric chronic kidney patients with virtual
      reality exercise applications.

      1.Group - Working group: Virtual reality technology (Nintendo Wii Fit Plus) exercise group
      2.Group-Control group: home-based video games will be divided into groups that exercise.

      Measurements of functional capacity, muscle strength, quality of life, depression, fatigue
      and physical activity levels, medical values (pulmonary function test values, inflammation
      level values, glomerular filtration rate level values) of both groups will be recorded before
      and after treatment.

      In the study group treatment protocol; patients will complete 12 sessions of virtual reality
      exercise application-Nintendo Wii Fit Plus 30-minute training sessions with strengthening
      exercises for the lower extremities and upper extremities, aerobic and balance exercises.
      They will do 5 minutes warm-up exercises before the session and 5 minutes cool-down exercises
      as well as breathing exercises at the end of the session and will participate in a 50-minute
      treatment session in total.

      In the control group treatment protocol, patients will follow the 30-minute video exercise
      practices for the lower and upper extremities that are similar to Nintendo Wii Fit exercises
      for the control group at home two days a week. exercises will complete the 50-minute training
      session. Apart from exercise sessions, patients will record their activities (walking,
      cycling, swimming…) in daily life forms with their own pedometers. Thus, changes in physical
      activity levels will be monitored.

    <description>Lung Parameters are measured after 3 repetitive treatments performed by using a digital spirometer.Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume 1 second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow (PEF) and FEV1 / FVC ratio is measured by using a digital spirometer.</description>

    <measure>Inflammation value</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The inflammation level of the patients is evaluated at the beginning and at the end of 6 weeks by looking at the patient's routine blood test results (c reactive protein or sedimentation).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The fatigue parameter is evaluated with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Version 4.0 General Scales (PedsQL), a tool developed specifically to assess the physical, school, emotional, and social domains of health-related quality of life in children previously confirmed in healthy and patient populations. From the physical area of PedsQL individual elements of low energy level will be extracted from both child and parent questionnaires to assess the prevalence of fatigue. The frequency of low energy over the past month is classified as one of four categories: &quot;never&quot;; &quot;hardly&quot;; &quot;sometimes&quot;; &quot;Often / almost always&quot;. Overall PedsQL scores, from 0 to 100, higher scores mean better quality of life. PedsQL is scored from the &quot;low energy&quot; item from both parents and child surveys.</description>

    <time_frame>6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PedsQLTM 4.0 Quality of Life Scale for Children is used to assess the quality of life of children. PedsQLTM 4.0, with a child / adolescent report and primary caregiver report, is a modular approach to measuring health-related quality of life in healthy children and adolescents in confirmed acute and chronic health conditions in Brazil. The questionnaire evaluates four scales (physical, emotional, social and school functioning) in 23 questions using age-specific forms. Self-report forms are available for children / adolescents aged 5-7, 8-12 or 13-18. Parental reports are available for children aged 2-4, 5-7, 8-12 or 13-18. The questionnaire score ranges from zero to 100 on each scale, and higher values are interpreted to indicate a better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Participation</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participation in the activity is assessed by Scope questionnaire.The Short Child Roller activities and tasks profile (SCOPE) test is a children-specific assessment test. SCOPE is a test that can be used in the age range from birth to 21 years, which evaluates activity participation as person-centered. SCOPE allows the assessment of participation with comparable objective data within the physical, mental and social disabilities of the child. This questionnaire consists of 25 questions and includes 4 questions from the areas of will, habits, interaction and communication skills, processing skills and motor skill activity performance, and 5 questions for the latest environment. High scores indicate good results.
Children's participation in the activity and their level of entertainment depending on the activity; Short Child Roles Activities and Tasks Profile SCOPE Will and Habits are evaluated by comparing the scores of performance titles before and after treatment.</description>
