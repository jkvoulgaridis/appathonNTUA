  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vestibular disorders are disabling conditions that can have a major effect on functioning
      especially on daily activities and social participation. Latest epidemiological studies
      estimate that as many as 35% of adults aged 40 years or older had experienced some form of
      vestibular dysfunction. Non invasive brain stimulation techniques such as repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) have been investigated as therapeutic interventions
      for various neurological disorders like motor deficits and balance disorders after various
      neurological deficits. The purpose of this study is to compare between rTMs stimulation and
      galvanic vestibular stimulation in patients with unilateral peripheral vestibular disorders.

      A pilot study has been recruited to calculate sample size and determine rTMs protocol that
      will be utilized during the study were two protocols has been compared and according to pilot
      study results collaborated with literature review a established protocol has been utilized.
      The subjects of both genders with age 30 to 60 will be allocated randomly into three equal
      groups A, B and C. Group A Outcomes measure will include : VNG (videonystagmography),
      Dizziness handicapped inventory, Berg balance scale, Vestibular disorders activities of daily
      living scale(VADL). Assessment will be done before and after treatment sessions.
