  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will look at how two different forms of semaglutide reach and stay in the blood
      after injection. None of the two forms of semaglutide have been approved by the authorities
      to treat obesity. Participants will get 1 of the 2 forms of semaglutide - which one is
      decided by chance. Participants will get the medicine as an injection under the skin of the
      stomach with the use of a pen-injector. The type of pen-injector is different for the two
      forms of semaglutide. The study staff will teach participants how to inject themselves with
      the medicine. As part of this training participants will self inject placebo (dummy
      medication) 3 times. Participants will take an injection once a week and will get 21
      injections in total of study medication. The study will last for about 27-30 weeks.
      Participants will have 25 study visits with the study doctor. For 2 of the visits,
      participants will stay in the clinic for 3 days and 2 nights. Participants may have to stop
      the study if the study doctor thinks that there are risks for their health. Women cannot take
      part if they are pregnant, breast-feeding or planning to become pregnant during the study
      period.
