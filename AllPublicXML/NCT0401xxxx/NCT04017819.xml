      Primary Objectives

        -  Determine the biodistribution of [18F]-C-SNAT4 in 5 healthy volunteers. Secondary
           Objectives

        -  Determine the dosimetry of [18F]-C-SNAT4 PET in healthy volunteers and patients with
           lung cancer.

        -  Determine the acute toxicity of [18F]-C-SNAT4 PET in healthy volunteers and patients
           with lung cancer.

        -  Determine whether uptake in [18F]-C-SNAT4 PET imaging is significantly different in
           tumor and corresponding contralateral noncancer tissue in patients with lung cancer
           (tested by Wilcoxon test) before the therapy.

        -  Determine/verify the safety profile of the [18F]-C-SNAT4 radiotracer, as an imaging
           agent in patients with lung cancer.

        -  Determine the time of maximal [18F]-C-SNAT4 radiotracer uptake post injection.

    <measure>Dosimetry of [18F]-C-SNAT4</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Radiation dosimetry of the [18F]-C-SNAT4 radiotracer will be measured through careful monitoring of each participant's vital signs in Group 1 and group 2. Time-Activity curves will be graphed by measuring activity in various organs using multiple PET/CT scans (1 hour dynamic scan, 1 hour and 2 hours) after tracer injection. Absorbed radiation will be calculated.</description>

    <measure>Toxicity of [18F]-C-SNAT4</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The acute [18F]-C-SNAT4 toxicity will be assessed as related adverse events, including laboratory abnormalities, that occur within 7 days of the infusion of [18F]-C-SNAT4.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>18F]-C-SNAT4 Uptake</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The tumor uptake of [18F]-C-SNAT4 PET will be compared with the corresponding contralateral non-cancer tissue in patients with lung cancer before the therapy in Group 2 and 3. SUVmax measurements will be taken from the pre-treatment scan.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Maximal [18F]-C-SNAT4 Uptake as PET Radiotracer</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The time of maximal [18F]-C-SNAT4 radiotracer uptake post-injection will be assessed in Group 2 and 3. Time-Activity Curves (TAC) will be graphed by measuring activity in tumor after tracer injection. The maximal of [18F]-C-SNAT4 radiotracer uptake post-injection in lung cancer patients will be determined from these time activity curves.</description>

    <measure>[18F]-C-SNAT4 PET Imaging Signal in Responders and Non-responders</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The [18F]-C-SNAT4 PET scan signal from pre-therapy to one week after initiation of therapy in Group 3 will be compared both in treatment responders vs. non-responders. SUVmax will be measured in both the pre-treatment and one-week post-initiation of treatment scans.</description>
