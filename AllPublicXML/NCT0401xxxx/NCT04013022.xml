    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases represent the first mortality cause in the world. Ageing is
      considered as the most prominent risk factor for this kind of diseases. Also, hypertension
      represents one of the modifiable risk factors. Blood pressure response to exercise is
      governed by three systems: central command, baroreflex, and a feedback mechanism originating
      in the skeletal muscle. An abnormal cardiovascular response to exercise facilitates the
      occurrence of cardiovascular events. The goal of the study is to characterize the
      cardiovascular response in lifelong trained individuals and explore the potential benefits of
      endurance and strength training on cardiovascular regulation to exercise onset.

    <textblock>
      Population ageing represents a problem both for health outcomes and for social dynamics in
      the social welfare states. Currently, the over 60 represents the fastest growing segment of
      the population. Despite a downward trend in the incidence of cardiovascular diseases, they
      remain the main culprits for what concern mortality rates in the world. Increasing age is
      considered the major risk factor for cardiovascular mortality.

      One of the main components of the cardiovascular response to exercise is dictated by the
      exercise pressor reflex originating in the exercising muscle and responding to metabolic and
      mechanical stimuli. Research indicates that at least 20% of the regulation of blood pressure
      could be ascribed to these cardiovascular reflexes. A dysfunctional reflex-mediated response
      increases the chances of cardiovascular events that may end up in severe consequences.

      Chronic exercise training is recognized to be an important tool to control blood pressure.
      The mechanisms through which exercise exerts its effect are multiple. Among these, an
      improvement of the neural control of the reflex originating in the muscle seems a likely
      contributor. However, at present, the effect of chronic exercise training on the EPR response
      in the elderly has not been elucidated. The aim of the study is to characterize the central
      and peripheral cardiovascular response in the lifelong endurance and strength trained elders
      population.
