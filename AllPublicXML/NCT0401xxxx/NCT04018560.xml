  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is examining the effectiveness of Al-Anon Intensive Referral (AIR) with Concerned
      Others (COs) of individuals in treatment for alcohol use disorders (&quot;drinkers&quot;). AIR's goal
      is to facilitate Al-Anon participation and positive outcomes among COs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a randomized controlled trial, this 4-year project is evaluating AIR's effectiveness for
      COs. COs and their drinkers are assessed at baseline and 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year
      follow-ups. Hypotheses are that, compared to usual care, AIR will increase Al-Anon
      participation and improve CO outcomes. We will examine hypotheses using generalized
      mixed-effects regression models (GLMM). This project is built on the foundation that it is
      essential to help COs because of their own suffering.
