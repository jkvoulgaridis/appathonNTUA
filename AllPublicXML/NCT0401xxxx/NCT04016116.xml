  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pembrolizumab will have significant clinical activity in patients with Intermediate and high
      risk MF, advanced PV who have been resistant, failed or are intolerant to JAK2 inhibitor
      therapy and the activity may be enhanced in combination with JAK2 inhibition by Ruxolitinib;
      similarly MDS/MPN and CMML patients for who no standard therapies are available will exhibit
      responses to PD-1 or dual JAK2 and PD-1 treatment.

      Adding JAK2 inhibitor Ruxolitinib to Pembrolizumab will have significant activity in patients
      with advanced, progressive HL who failed single agent PD-1 inhibition.
