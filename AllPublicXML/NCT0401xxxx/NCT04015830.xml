  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite longer life expectancies due to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the
      prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) persists thus affecting 52% of
      the HIV population. Poor sleep quality is commonly reported in older adults and has been
      related to neurocognitive impairments. This is concerning given studies have shown that up to
      75% of adults with HIV experience poor sleep, and by 2020, 70% of adults with HIV will be age
      50 and older. It is important to examine sleep quality as it relates to neurocognitive
      function and HAND in older adults with HIV given its negative impact on cART adherence.
      Compared to Whites with HIV, African Americans (AA) are disproportionately affected by HIV
      and are more likely to experience poor sleep quality. This primary goal of this 1-year
      cross-sectional study is to examine racial differences in sleep quality and neurocognitive
      function among 60 African Americans and Whites with HIV (age 50+).

      This study is designed with two aims: Aim 1a: To explore differences in sleep health between
      older HIV+ AA and Whites. 1b: To explore differences in domain-specific neurocognitive
      impairments between older HIV+ AA and Whites. Aim 2a: To explore the relationship between
      sleep health and neurocognitive function. 2b: To explore the relationship between sleep
      health and cART adherence. 2c: To explore mediation effects of cART adherence between sleep
      health and neurocognitive function. This is the first study to explore racial disparities in
      sleep health and neurocognitive function, using EEG/ERP metrics, among older HIV+ adults.
      There are two phases in this study: Phase I which consists of neurocognitive testing and
      sleep assessments with actigraphy, and Phase II which consist of a 20-30 min EEG.
      Measurements of electrical brain activity will be captured while participants engage in an
      Attention Network Test which measures executive function, attention, and speed of processing.
