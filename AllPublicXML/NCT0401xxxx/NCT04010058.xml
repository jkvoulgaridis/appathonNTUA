  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The patient's clinical care will not be altered apart from an the use of a non-invasive
      monitor for a short time, without any biological sample acquisition, or follow-up. This is
      low risk.

      The device works through a complex pressure measurement in the fingers and by slightly
      squashing the fingers it can cause minor impairments to circulation. This represents a very
      small risk. To mitigate this risk the investigators will exclude patients with impaired
      circulation to the fingers and fingers will be monitored.

      The approach is necessarily on the day of surgery and for many people this is an anxious
      time. The investigators have a lot of experience of approaching patients on the day of
      surgery for providing consent for observational studies - the investigators use caution and
      sensitivity. The investigators do not approach patients who the clinical team consider
      anxious or where there is significant pressure on time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled patients will have the CNAP sited in the post-anaesthetic care unit (PACU) and it
      will stay on their arm until at least 12 hours have passed. The device will collect
      continuous heart rate, blood pressure, and nominal cardiac output; it also derives a range of
      values from these measurements. There is minimal risk attributable to the use of the CNAP
      device. These devices are already in routine clinical use in the UK in intensive care units,
      high-dependency units and operating theatres.

      To reduce burden on the patient, no additional HR/BP monitor is required and whenever the
      usual care team would like to know the HR or BP these values will be displayed. The
      additional parameters (related to measurement of cardiac output) will not be shared with the
      clinical team - they will remain blinded to these data because otherwise there is the risk
      that they would use this additional information to alter clinical management.

      Medical notes will be examined to provide information about demographics, physical
      characteristics (height, weight), and previous medical history - please see case report form
      (CRF, appendix 1) for more details.

      There are no blood tests, or other acquisition of biological samples.

    <description>The LiDCO CNAP device (referred to as CNAP in this document) provides continuous cardiac output non-invasively, without the requirement for an arterial catheter. It uses a dual finger cuff in addition to a standard arm cuff (familiar to everyone who's had their blood pressure checked) and it transforms infrared plethysmographic signals into continuous blood pressure information. It uses an algorithm to derive cardiac output-related parameters. In recognition of the potential difference between the derived values and any measured values, it refers to some of its values as 'nominal' values. It has been evaluated in a range of surgical populations8-11 a post-operative cohort12, and a haemodynamically unstable critical care population13. In a population of patients undergoing endoscopy there was increased detection of episodes of hypotension compared with standard measures.</description>
