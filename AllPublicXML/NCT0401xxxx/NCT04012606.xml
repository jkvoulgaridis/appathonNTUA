  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III, multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of
      platinum（Cisplatin or Carboplatin） plus etoposide with or without toripalimab as first Line
      therapy in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of toriplimab in combination
      with platinum（Cisplatin or Carboplatin） plus etoposide in treatment naive extensive stage
      small cell lung cancer.

      Participants will receive asigned study treatment until progressive disease (PD) as assessed
      by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST
      v1.1).
