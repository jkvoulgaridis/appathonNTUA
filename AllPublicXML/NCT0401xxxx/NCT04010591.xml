      Purpose To measure the impedance of the bladder during the urodynamic study to see if changes
      in the impedance value occur as the bladder volume changes in pediatric patients aged 5-12
      years along with its leg time.

      In addition, during the urodynamics test, the heart rate is measured at the same time to
      confirm the pulse change due to the filling of the bladder.

      -Background of the study (Method of identifying urinary bladder using impedance) In order to
      overcome the limitation of the method of checking the urinary volume in the bladder using
      ultrasound, the measurement of the impedance in the bladder is proposed as an alternative.
      Impedance measurement is non-invasive, very low cost, easy to measure and has a great
      advantage that it can be continuously measured in everyday life. In fact, early studies
      suggest that impedance measurement in the bladder is helpful in identifying urinary bladder
      capacity.

      On the other hand, there are two disadvantages to the urinary bladder identification method
      using impedance. One is the relative aspect that the impedance value changes according to the
      patient, and the other is the time lag time from the measurement point to the point when the
      impedance change appears.

        -  In order to overcome this problem of impedance-based urinary bladder identification
           method, we measured impedance change according to real-time change of urinary volume in
           bladder during urodynamic study.

        -  Background of the Invention (Pulse changes due to changes in urinary volume in bladder)
           It is known that when the urine enters the urinary bladder, the autonomic nervous system
           detects and regulates the heart rhythm, and the change of heart rate has not been
           reported in pediatric patients.

    <description>Impedance information is measured through the belt in the abdomen of the subject. The urodynamic test is performed from the state in which the urine of the bladder is completely emptied to the state of the bladder until the state becomes full, so the impedance measurement is measured from the state where the urine of the bladder is completely emptied to the state of the bladder until the state becomes full.</description>
