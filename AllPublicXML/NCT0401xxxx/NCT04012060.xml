      The LIAR-Trial is a single-center, single blind randomized controlled clinical trial
      comparing patients undergoing isolated AVR via J-shaped upper hemi-sternotomy (UHS) and
      conventional AVR through a full median sternotomy (FMS). Primary outcome is cardiac-specific
      quality of life, measured by two domains of the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire
      (KCCQ), up to one year after surgery.

      The LIAR-Trial is a single-center, single blind randomized controlled clinical trial
      comparing patients undergoing isolated AVR via J-shaped upper hemi-sternotomy (UHS) and
      conventional AVR through a full median sternotomy (FMS). To reduce potential confounding by
      differences in implanted valve prostheses, in both arms of the trail, the diseased native
      aortic valve is planned to be replaced with a rapid deployment stented aortic bioprosthesis
      (Edwards Intuity Elite Valve System®, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation), the preferred type
      of valve prosthesis for a limited access approach. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to both
      arms with 80 patients per arm. Patients who are unwilling or unable to participate in the
      randomized study will be treated via conventional median sternotomy with a sutured aortic
      valve prosthesis and participate in a prospective registry.

      Primary outcome is cardiac-specific quality of life, measured by two domains of the Kansas
      City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), up to one year after surgery. Secondary outcomes
      include, but are not limited to: generic quality of life measured with the Short Form-36
      (SF-36), postoperative pain, perioperative outcome (i.e. technical success rate, operating
      time) and postoperative outcome (i.e. 30 day and one-year mortality, complication rate,
      hospital length of stay, reoperation rate and readmission rate). Questionnaires are
      administered face to face or by telephone prior to surgery and at one, three, six and twelve
      months after surgery. In the prospective registry the quality of life questionnaires and all
      clinical data from the patients will be collected and analyzed the exact same way as the data
      from patients included and randomized in the trial.
