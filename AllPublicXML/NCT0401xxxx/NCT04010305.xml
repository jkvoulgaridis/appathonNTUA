  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-stage adaptive Phase Ib trial design, that will identify two doses (lowest dose
      with clinical benefit and highest safe dose) in a first stage and better evaluate safety,
      tolerability and variability of effect in the second stage.

      This is a two-stage adaptive Phase Ib trial design. It is a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose study assessing efficacy, pharmacokinetics,
      safety and tolerability of BXCL501 dosing in adult (18-65 years old) males and females with
      acute agitation associated with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform
      disorder.

      The first stage will characterize a safe and tolerable dose range that results in a calming
      effect as measured using the PEC total score. The lowest dose with clear clinical benefit,
      and the highest safe and well-tolerated dose that demonstrates efficacy in a large proportion
      of subjects will be selected over the course of testing multiple escalating dose cohorts. The
      second stage will comprise a total of 40 subjects per dose group in a three-arm
      placebo-controlled design in order to better characterize the broader range of safety and
      tolerability as well as better estimate variability (effect size) which may be observed in
      later phase placebo-controlled trials.

             excitement) comprising the PANSS Excited Component (PEC).

             surgical sterilization and progestin implant or injection. Prohibited methods include:
             the rhythm method, withdrawal, condoms alone, or diaphragm alone.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with agitation caused by acute intoxication, including positive
             identification of alcohol by breathalyzer or non-prescription drugs (with the
             exception of THC) during urine screening.

          2. Patients treated within 4 hours prior to study drug administration with
             benzodiazepines, other hypnotics or oral or short-acting intramuscular antipsychotics.

             would have clinical implications for the patient's participation in the study.

          9. Patients with serious or unstable medical illnesses. These include current hepatic
             (moderate-severe hepatic impairment), renal, gastroenterologic, respiratory,
