  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) could be associated with increase in positive
      end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) level. Data are however disparate and interactions between
      ventilation with high PEEP and intracranial circulation are still debated. Individual
      patient's chest wall elastance could have a key role in determining the effects of PEEP on
      ICP, since it dictates which proportion of the applied PEEP is transmitted to the pleural
      space, thus increasing central venous pressure (CVP) and reducing cerebral venous return.
      Measurement of esophageal pressure with a dedicated probe allows partitioning of respiratory
      system elastance into its lung and chest wall components, thus permitting to study this
      phenomenon. Multimodal intracranial monitoring permits to study the effects of PEEP on more
      advanced brain-specific indices such as brain tissue oxygen (PtiO2), cerebral microdialysis
      data, transcranial doppler ultrasound-derived flow measurements and automated pupillometry,
      besides ICP.

      This study aims to test the association between the ratio of chest wall to respiratory system
      elastance and PEEP-induced variations in ICP and brain-specific multimodal monitoring
      indices. This study will evaluate the relative role of other selected measures of respiratory
      mechanics, hemodynamic variables and intracranial compliance, in order to establish the role
      of individual respiratory mechanics in the interplay of physiological factors affecting the
      effects of positive pressure ventilation on the brain.

      Patients will undergo two periods of ventilation at two different levels of PEEP (5 and 15
      cmH2O) in a randomized cross-over order. At the end of each period, cardiorespiratory
      clinical data, ICP and other advanced multimodal neuromonitoring data (brain tissue oxygen
      tension, cerebral microdyalisis analytes, transcranial doppler ultrasound and automated
      infrared pupillometry data) will be collected. Systematic respiratory mechanics assessment
      (including calculation of chest wall and lung elastances and estimation of the amount of
      recruitment versus overdistension due to PEEP by means of a single-breath derecruitment
      trial), echocardiography and arterial blood gas analysis will be performed.
