  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data from 2007 regarding iodine status among Portuguese pregnant women indicate this is an
      iodine deficient population group, with only 16.8% presenting adequate urinary iodine values.
      This may have serious implications for normal cognitive development of the offspring and a
      concerning socioeconomic impact. In 2013, concerns by the Portuguese Directorate-General of
      Health lead to the implementation of a public health policy (nº 011/2013) recommending iodine
      supplementation during pregnancy. IoMum emerges from this context to monitor and update
      iodine status in Portuguese pregnant women and to evaluate the effectiveness of the above
      policy by assessing clinical compliance to iodine supplementation and the impact of iodine
      supplementation in this vulnerable group. IoMum will update data on iodine nutrition in
      Portuguese pregnant women, promoting political actions towards the elimination of iodine
      deficiency and thus to the reduction of nutritional, social and economic inequalities.
