    <textblock>
      Changes in voice performance in the postoperative period due to trauma suffered during
      endotracheal intubation or edema occurring in the postoperative period are often observed.
      The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of different types of intubation tube
      applications on voice performance in the early postoperative period using objective and
      subjective voice analysis methods.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 88 patients who underwent endotracheal intubation either using a cuffed
      endotracheal (n = 44) or spiral-embedded cuffed endotracheal (n = 44) tube were included in
      this study. An endotracheal tube of 7.5 mm was used for female patients and that of 8 mm was
      used for male patients. A preoperative acoustic voice analysis was performed, and fundamental
      frequency (F0), jitter%, and shimmer% values were recorded. In addition, voice handicap
      index-30 (VHI-30) questionnaire was completed by the patients for subjective evaluation. The
      same procedure was repeated in the first 48 hours postoperatively. The preoperative and
      postoperative data were statistically compared. In addition, the effect of the type of
      endotracheal intubation tube on acoustic voice analysis parameters and VHI-30 scores was
      statistically evaluated.
