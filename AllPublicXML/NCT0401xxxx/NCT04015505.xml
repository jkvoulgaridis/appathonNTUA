    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate a specific psychological technique to help older adults with
      depression improve their mood and develop or utilise their 'wisdom' for managing their
      current difficulties. The United Kingdom (UK) population is ageing and effective
      psychological therapies for older adults need to be well evaluated and developed. This study
      aims to develop evidence for this technique, and links between gerontological theories of
      wisdom and clinical psychology.

      The 'timeline' technique (Laidlaw, 2010, 2015) is recommended within Cognitive Behavioural
      Therapy (CBT) for older adults. CBT is the most evidenced based psychological treatment for a
      range of psychiatric disorders including depression. Outcome studies have found that older
      people are just as likely to respond to CBT as younger people.

      This technique draws on theories of 'wisdom', where one's wisdom can develop from how they
      reflect on their life experiences. Depressed individuals may view their lives in
      overgeneralised negative ways, making this process harder. The timeline technique asks people
      to create a timeline of their lives. Through reflection and discussion of past events, they
      are helped to recognise personal resilience, develop self-compassion, and utilise their
      wisdom for managing current difficulties. This technique requires specific evaluation to
      determine its validity and effectiveness.

      This study uses a single-case experimental research design to allow conclusions to be drawn
      from a small number of participants. Six individuals from primary and secondary care mental
      health waiting lists, as well as third sector providers, aged over 60 and experiencing
      depression or low mood, will be invited to take part in a short testing of this technique.
      Individuals will be asked to measure their mood and complete relevant questionnaires
      throughout their involvement in the study and will do this for up to 4 weeks on their own.
      They will then meet with a trainee clinical psychologist for five weekly sessions of a
      structured therapy using the timeline technique.

      BACKGROUND

      The United Kingdom (UK) population is getting older, with those over 65 predicted to reach
      24% by 2037 (Office for National Statistics, 2017). With improved quality of life and
      advances in healthcare, there is increased pressure on services to cater for the wellbeing of
      older adults. UK government states that depression affects one in five older people living in
      the community (UK Government, 2017). Depression is therefore a significant mental health
      condition for older adults and for which effective treatments and approaches are required. As
      such, there is a growing need to tailor psychological therapies to the older adult population
      and for new techniques to be well evaluated.

      'Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for older adults' augments traditional evidence-based
      CBT for the older adult population with 'age-appropriate' techniques, developed from lifespan
      developmental models and gerontological theory to help enhance treatment outcomes for older
      adults (Knight &amp; Laidlaw, 2009; Laidlaw, 2010). One technique is the 'wisdom enhancement'
      timeline technique (Laidlaw, 2010, 2015; Laidlaw &amp; Kishita, 2015), which builds on a
      psychological model of wisdom applied to clinical psychology. The technique has roots in
      classical cognitive behavioural techniques but is distinctive in how it uses one's life
      narrative as a resource. The timeline technique can be regarded as an innovative and
      structured way of using peoples' life narratives and experiences in a cognitive-behavioural
      framework to evolve the psychological resource of wisdom and increase mood and coping in the
      present. It is time-limited and present problem focused. The timeline technique is
      recommended in Increased Access to Psychological Therapies Services (IAPT) guidelines for CBT
      for older adults, meaning that it will be routinely used in National Health Service (NHS)
      settings in England. The timeline technique is theorised to improve mood by increasing
      self-acceptance and wisdom. However, the technique has not been specifically tested in
      detail.

      PURPOSE OF THE STUDY

      This study will investigate in detail the 'wisdom enhancement' timeline technique for helping
      older adults with depression develop 'wisdom', self-compassion and improve mood. The study
      will use a single-case experimental design to evaluate the technique's effectiveness and
      mechanisms of change. It will provide a valuable examination of a specific recommended CBT
      technique, where there is a general need for more testing of individual components of
      therapy. The results from this investigation will help inform further developments of wisdom
      enhancement models in clinical psychology and efficacy of CBT for older adults.

      RESEARCH AIM

      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the 'timeline technique' (Laidlaw, 2015) with
      older adults experiencing mild-moderate depression. This will be achieved by delivering a
      short psychological intervention to older adults using the timeline technique, based on
      appropriate guidelines. Principle research questions:

        1. Does the timeline intervention reduce negative affect?

        2. Does the timeline intervention increase self-compassion?

        3. Does the timeline intervention increase wisdom for managing current difficulties?

      STUDY DESIGN

      This study uses a single case experimental design (SCED) to measure the effects that the
      'timeline' intervention has on mood, self-compassion and wisdom, as measured by structured
      self-report questionnaires and idiographic measures. Older adults experiencing depression/low
      mood will be recruited from NHS primary and secondary care or third sector psychological
      treatment waiting lists.

      SCEDs have long been used in psychology intervention research and are a useful method for
      examining the effectiveness of an intervention on individuals with only a few participants
      (Morgan &amp; Morgan, 2001; Kazdin, 2011). Unlike randomised controlled trials, each participant
      acts as their own control by measuring their baseline state for a period of time before the
      intervention is introduced. Each participant will take part in three phases:

        1. Baseline phase: participants will complete weekly standardised measures of mood and
           daily idiographic measures of mood, self-compassion and wisdom.

        2. Intervention phase: participants will receive a 5 week psychological intervention,
           whilst continuing to complete the baseline measures. This will allow for any observable
           change in mood during the onset of the intervention to be determined.

        3. Participants will complete a single set of follow up measures 1 month after the
           intervention phase ends.

      Participants will also complete standardised measures of mood, self-compassion and wisdom at
      pre-baseline, pre-intervention and post-intervention time points, to allow for further
      between phase testing. Measurement during the intervention phase and at follow up will
      account for effects of the intervention that accrue slowly over time and test if any effects
      are sustained.

      The study adopts an across-participant multiple baseline component which means that each
      participant will be randomly assigned to one of three pre-determined baseline phases of
      differing lengths:

      Group A: 2 weeks Group B: 3 weeks Group C: 4 weeks The multiple baseline design is the most
      frequent design used in psychology single case studies (Smith, 2012) and allows for greater
      control for determining when changes in the target variable are attributed to a specific
      study phase.

      Participants will take part once they are recruited and it is convenient for them to take
      part, rather than needing to all start simultaneously. This is therefore considered a
      non-concurrent multiple baseline design and allows greater flexibility for both researchers
      and participants.

    <intervention_model_description>Single case experimental design, with non-concurrent across-participants multiple baselines. All participants will receive the intervention, with a period of measured baseline stability acting as the control for each participant. Participants will not need to take part in the study simultaneously.
Participants will be randomly allocated to one of three baseline conditions:
Group A = 2 weeks baseline Group B = 3 weeks baseline Group C = 4 weeks baseline
Following their baseline, each participant will complete a 5 week intervention period where they receive 5 sessions of the therapy. Throughout their baseline and intervention period, each participant will complete weekly measures of mood and a daily visual analogue scale. Each participant will also complete measures of self-compassion and wisdom at the start of baseline, end of baseline and end of intervention. Each participant will complete all measures again at one time point 1 month following the end of their intervention.</intervention_model_description>

Idiographic measures are often used as well as standardized measures in single case design. They allow for specific target constructs to be measured in a way that is repeatable and efficient. The visual analogue scale consists of a ten-centimeter line anchored at either end with maximal and minimal extremes of the dimension being measured. Participants put a mark on the line, with the mark closer to the right side indicating stronger agreement of that statement. A numerical measurement of the line gives a score for each statement based on length (between 0 and 10.)</description>

    <description>26-item self-report measure of self-compassion (SCS; Neff, 2003)
26-item self-report measure of self-compassion measures overall self-compassion as well as six subscales, representing components of self-compassion: self-kindness versus self-judgment, sense of common humanity versus isolation, and mindfulness versus over-identification. Responses to each question are given on a 5-point Likert scale, from 'almost never' to 'almost always'. Subscale scores are computed by calculating the mean of subscale item responses, and therefore range from 0-5 with higher scores indicating higher levels of that construct. Total self-compassion score is calculated by reverse scoring the negative subscale items before calculating subscale means - self-judgment, isolation, and over-identification, then calculating a grand mean of all six subscale means. The total score ranges from 0-5 with higher scores indicating higher levels overall self-compassion.</description>

They are then asked to use 'the wisdom of their years' to develop strategies to manage difficulties they are currently facing. Participants will also be asked to complete worksheets and try out new strategies between sessions.</description>
