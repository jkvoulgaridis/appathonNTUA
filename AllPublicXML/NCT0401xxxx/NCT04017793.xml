  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study to measure brain functioning before and after stress-reduction
      classes to better understand how symptom improvements relate to brain functioning in adults
      with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder). Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two
      stress reduction classes that will meet once a week for 8 weeks. One group will complete a
      structured training program called Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) that involves
      teaching about increased mindfulness strategies and gentle stretching. The other group will
      review relaxation techniques and other stress reduction strategies and will include social
      support. Structural and functional MRI, EEG, and behavioral self-report data will be
      collected to understand more about how the brain changes in subtle ways when people feel
      better and are more aware of their emotional state.

    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory - II</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Pre-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory for measuring depression severity. Items are rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3 based on severity of each item. The maximum total score is 63. Raw scores ranging from 0-13 indicate minimal depression. Raw scores ranging from 14-19 indicate mild depression. Raw scores of 20-28 indicate moderate depression and scores of 29-63 indicate severe depression.</description>

    <measure>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Pre-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report inventory measuring two types of anxiety. 20 items assess the temporary condition of state anxiety, or anxiety about an event, and an additional 20 items assess the more general trait anxiety, or anxiety level as a personal characteristic. Items are rated on a 4-point frequency scale. Scores range from 20 to 80, with higher scores correlating with greater anxiety.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 to 89 years old, with a special focus on adults with ASD who are going to
             college given the additional stress of this phase in life. We are recruiting
             participants across a broad age range in order to maximize our ability to inform
             interventions for adults with ASD. The upper age limit of 89 years was selected so a
             de-identified dataset can be created with all participant ages included.

          -  ASD diagnosis via gold-standard diagnostic assessments (Autism Diagnostic Observation
             Schedule-2).

          -  Must be able to attend at least 7 of the 8 weekly intervention classes.

          -  English speaking: Participants must be English-speaking because the screening and
             behavioral measures are in English (including the intelligence estimate).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores &lt;70 will be excluded to minimize
             variability due to general cognitive functioning.

          -  Report of any major medical illnesses, histories of seizures, or head trauma with loss
             of consciousness. These health factors can cause brain changes that would confound
             findings.

          -  Concerns that the participant may not be able to complete the MRI neuroimaging
             requirements for the study, including claustrophobia or metal objects within the
             participant's body or eyes. Implanted metal objects may create a safety hazard in the
             powerful magnetic field during MRI imaging.

          -  Pregnant women. MRI has no known effects on pregnancy or fertility. However, since we
             are not 100% certain MRI has no effects on a developing fetus, women who are pregnant
             may not participate in this study.
