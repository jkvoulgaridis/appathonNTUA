  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to examine the impacts of a 12-week resistance band exercise
      program on insulin resistance, blood lipid profiles, body composition, and blood pressure in
      postmenopausal women with obesity.

      Thirty-six postmenopausal women participated in this study. Participants were randomly
      allocated into the resistance band training group (EX, n = 18) or the control group (CON, n =
      18). The EX group performed a resistance band exercise training program 60 minutes per day, 3
      times per week, for 12 weeks. The CON group did not participate in any exercise, dietary, or
      behavioral intervention. Blood glucose, insulin, homeostatic model of insulin resistance
      (HOMA-IR), blood lipids, blood pressure, and body composition were measured before and after
      12 weeks of EX or CON.
