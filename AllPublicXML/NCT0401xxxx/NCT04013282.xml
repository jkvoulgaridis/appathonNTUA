      1. Patients seen who had autonomic and enteric profiling (Adrenergic Cholinergic Enteric
           Measures/Mapping=ACEM) from 2012-2019 at the U of Louisville.

        2. Results of the physiologic measures of ACEM had the results recorded.

        3. ACEM is compared to standardized gastric emptying values as the primary measure.

        4. ACEM is also compared to metabolic measures of weight, height and thus BMI as a
           secondary measure.

        5. ACEM is aloes compared with standardized gastrointestinal symptoms by a traditional
           patient recorded outcome as another secondary measure.
