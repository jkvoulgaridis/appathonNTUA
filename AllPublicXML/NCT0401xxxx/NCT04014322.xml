      This study will investigate the impact of e-cigarette use on combustible smoking behaviors
      and motivation/readiness to quit among adult current smokers with psychiatric disorders who
      are not yet ready to quit smoking. All participants will be instructed to start using
      e-cigarettes (provided by the study) as much as they like for the first 2 weeks, and then, to
      switch completely from combustible cigarettes to e-cigarettes for the next 4 weeks. They will
      be assessed at baseline, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 10 weeks. Qualitative data will also be
      collected at 6- and 10-week follow-up visits about their experiences with e-cigarettes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, the prevalence of e-cigarette use has rapidly increased, especially among
      those with psychiatric conditions, and the risks and potential benefits of e-cigarette use
      have been the topic of much debate. More research is needed to understand the impact of
      e-cigarette use on smoking behavior and smoking-related cognitions among individuals with
      psychiatric conditions.

      This study will investigate the effects of e-cigarette use on cigarette smoking and
      motivation/readiness to quit among smokers with psychiatric disorders who are not yet ready
      to quit smoking. A total of 50 adult daily cigarette smokers who are receiving outpatient
      psychiatric treatment and not yet ready to quit smoking will be recruited. All participants
      will be instructed to use e-cigarettes as much as they like (no instruction on how much they
      smoke combustible cigarettes) for the first 2 weeks. Then, they will be instructed to switch
      completely from combustible cigarettes to e-cigarettes for the next 4 weeks. E-cigarettes
      will be provided to participants at no cost. Participants will also be asked to complete 4
      in-person assessment visits (i.e., baseline, 2-week, 6-week and 10-week follow-up visits).
