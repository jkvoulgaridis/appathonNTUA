    <textblock>
      This Phase II open label study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of repeat doses of
      RGI-2001 in combination with standard of care treatment for the prevention of acute
      graft-vs-host-disease (aGvHD) in subjects following Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell
      Transplantation (alloHSCT). These subjects will be compared to contemporary controls.

      This is an open-label, multi-center, single-arm study to evaluate six weekly doses of
      RGI-2001 in combination with standard of care treatment for the prevention of aGvHD in
      subjects following alloHSCT. The study will include a Safety Run-in Phase to assess the
      safety and tolerability of 6 weekly doses of RGI-2001 followed by an Expansion Phase in which
      the potential efficacy of 6 weekly doses of RGI-2001 in addition to standard of care for GvHD
      prophylaxis will be assessed. Comparison will be made to a contemporaneous control group.
