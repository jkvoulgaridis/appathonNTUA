      Background: Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile Infection (CDI) is a persistent
      healthcare issue. In the US, CDI is the most common infectious cause of hospital-onset (HO)
      diarrhea.

      Objective: Assess the impact of admission testing for toxigenic C. difficile colonization on
      the incidence of clinical disease.

      Design: Pragmatic stepped-wedge Infection Control initiative. Setting: NorthShore University
      HealthSystem (NorthShore) is a four-hospital system near Chicago, Illinois.

      Patients: All patients admitted to the four hospitals during the initiative. Interventions:
      From September 2017 through August 2018 the investigators conducted a quality improvement
      program where admitted patients had a peri-rectal swab tested for toxigenic C. difficile. All
      colonized patients were placed in contact precautions.

      Measurements: The investigators tested admissions who: i) had been hospitalized within two
      months, ii) had a past C. difficile positive test, and/or iii) were in a long-term care
      facility within six months. The investigators measured compliance with all other measures to
      reduce the incidence of HO-CDI.

      Limitations: This was not a randomized controlled trial, and multiple prevention
      interventions were in place at the time of the admission surveillance initiative.

      Background:

      Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) remains a constant, even increasing, clinical infection
      threat in the United States and Europe. New preventive strategies are urgently needed.
      Current control measures do not target asymptomatic carriers, despite evidence that they can
      contaminate the hospital environment and health care workers' hands; a risk to potentially
      transmit C. difficile to other patients. Of special importance is that not only is disease
      prevalence increasing, but severity of illness and mortality also is on the rise. The
      investigators have implemented many interventions at our healthcare system including bleach
      cleaning of rooms with CDI patients, monitoring of environmental services' room cleaning,
      hand hygiene education and even UV light disinfection of rooms harboring CDI patients, and
      none have been consistently effective. The investigators believe that CDI is much like
      methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), in that many more patients are colonized
      than infected, and one (perhaps the optimal) way to curtail disease is to interrupt
      transmission by identifying carriers and placing them into contact (glove and gown)
      precautions.

      The investigators propose to test this hypothesis with a quality improvement program study at
      NorthShore. The primary goal is to demonstrate that surveillance testing for C. difficile
      colonization at the time of admission and contact precaution isolation of those positive will
      reduce spread of the organism as well as lower clinical CDI. The investigators secondary
      goals are to demonstrate a reduction in C. difficile infection incidence after implementation
      of this program and demonstrate that such a program is cost effective.

      Study Methods:

      We have collected CDI disease rates for 10 years. One of our hospitals admits a high number
      of patients from long term care facilities (LTCFs) and currently has a rate of infection at
      11 cases/10,000 patient days, and this facility served as a pilot site in the program
      initiative. The nosocomial CDI rate at this facility had been rising during the first quarter
      of 2016. The investigators plan to introduce peri-rectal (intra-anal) swab testing for C.
      difficile on all admissions accompanied by isolation of positive patients, which the
      investigators hypothesize will lower the rate to 3 cases/10,000 patient days. In absolute
      numbers, the goal is to reduce the rate from 4 nosocomial cases per month down to 1
      nosocomial case per month. This is intended to provide a sample size that can demonstrate a
      level of significance at p&lt;.05 for disease reduction with the intervention when compared to
      the same time frame prior to the admission testing intervention.

      If the proposed pilot admission screening program is successful, the investigators will show
      disease is reduced by implementing the admission screening program. At that point, if a
      successful outcome is achieved, the program will be extended to all 4 hospitals in the
      NorthShore system.

      Additionally, the investigators will be collecting a double headed swab (Culturette) on all
      patients, so those testing positive will have the second swab cultured for C. difficile. The
      purpose of this is to validate the Roche C. Diff Cobas test as a valid screen testing
      platform.

      Study Period:

      All admissions giving verbal consent to the target pilot hospital will be tested, and the
      program will continue until at least 2,000 patients have taken part. The admitting nurses or
      patient care technicians (PCTs) will collect the peri-rectal swab sample specimen. This
      initial program began on July 1, 2016. The expected primary completion date for the pilot
      program was December 31, 2016. The complete observation period for the full 4-hospital
      initiative ended December 31, 2018.

      Testing Plan:

      Patients admitted to the target hospital will have a peri-rectal swab collected at the time
      of admission. This will be tested by the Roche cobas C. Diff assay. The investigators will be
      testing 6 days per week at the central hospital (Evanston Hospital).

      Potential Benefit:

      A report from Canada (using the BD assay) indicates the concept should work (reference 10
      below) - the investigators believe the outcome will be better than or equal to the result of
      this publication since isolation will include gowns as well as gloves. The investigators will
      be the first US study to show admission testing works to provide a significant reduction in
      healthcare-onset C. difficile infection (HO-CDI) and save patient lives.
