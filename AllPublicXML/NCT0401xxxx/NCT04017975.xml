  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that fiberoptic confocal microscopy (FCM)
      imaging during repair of common congenital heart defects is a useful adjunct for avoidance of
      conduction abnormalities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional randomized controlled study to investigate the use of fiberoptic
      confocal microscopy (FCM) imaging for avoidance of conduction abnormalities during repair of
      common congenital heart defects. Study results will be compared to a cohort of similar
      surgical patients following standard surgical procedures where FCM was not used. We will
      analyze pre-and postoperative ECGs to identify conduction abnormalities.
