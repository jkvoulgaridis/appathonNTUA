  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A hybrid effectiveness-efficacy trial to evaluate a stepped care task shifted intervention to
      treat depression and HIV medication nonadherence in low resource settings in rural Zimbabwe.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is commonly co-morbid with HIV infection in Zimbabwe and is consistently
      associated with worse adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). A task-shifted intervention
      for depression and ART adherence, suitable for delivery by non-specialists, could make a
      critical difference to the health and survival of people managing the challenges of HIV
      treatment in Zimbabwe. The TENDAI trial is a two-arm randomized controlled trial of an
      intervention for people on ART with viral non-suppression and clinically significant
      depression. It will be delivered at an HIV clinic in Marondera. TENDAI is a collaboration
      between the Department of Psychiatry, University of Zimbabwe College of Health Sciences,
      King's College London Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (London UK), and
      the Department of Psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital / Harvard Medical School.
