    <textblock>
      The objective of the project is to analyze the clinical effectiveness of a gamifield mHealth
      application (iGAME) and developed in the context of lifestyle modification, but with the
      approach of the Behaviour Change Technique, through a randomized clinical trial that affects
      both primary prevention of health (reduce sedentary lifestyle and promote physical activity),
      such as secondary prevention in three clinical subtypes of noncommunicable diseases, where
      lifestyle modification is the center of its best practice.

    <textblock>
      Despite digital exposure, gamification of health has been widely understood and often applied
      ad hoc in health products. Attempts to incorporate game concepts into digital health
      applications have not led to demonstrated success. Recent studies have shown that only 4% of
      the best rated health apps in Apple stores and Google Play (based on revenue and download)
      have gamification elements, but less than 5% of these health apps have been included in the
      application library of National Health Service, (Edwards et al., 2016). In addition, very
      little of 5% was developed for industry and health professionals.

      If the power of digital technologies, such as games for clear clinical benefits, is not
      released, opportunities for social and economic burial will be lost for all stakeholders in
      the digital health and digital economy ecosystem.

      A number of factors in this barrier:

        -  The best techniques for the design of activities. The majority of health gamification
           has little consistent support of health or clinical theories (Michie et al., 2013).

        -  The high cost and complexity of the digital game development process. The majority of
           gaming functions are based on best practices in the development of digital games
           (Hoeppner et al., 2016).

        -  Little participation of researchers in health, professionals and participation of the
           end user in the process of gamification development (Wolf et al., 2013). Very little
           health gamification is formally evaluated clinically.

      The initial hypothesis is that after 12 weeks of participation in the original iGAME
      application, participants will increase the quantity and distribution of energy consumption,
      through the estimation of results, data based on acceleration and questionnaires. automatic
      information In addition, it will also improve satisfaction and lifestyle, as well as the
      consumption of health services.

    <description>The assigned participants will receive an intervention based on gamification and the use of behavior change techniques to reduce sedentary lifestyle. Thus, a new mobile application will be used for 12 weeks that proposes to the user the realization of activities with the aim of reducing their sedentary behavior. The development of the application is based on previous analyzes that propose 6 clusters that encompass 33 factors that influence sedentary behavior. In this way, the application is designed to act on the two accessible: social support and behavior. On the social support, he proposes to the user to share his achievements in social networks or in an internal network of game users. In terms of habit modification, behavior modification strategies proposed in the Michie et al. (2013) taxonomy are applied, such as the following: establishment of personalized goals, rewards and reminders, awareness of achievements achieved, among others</description>
