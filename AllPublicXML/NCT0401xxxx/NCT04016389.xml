  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will include patients with invasive cervical cancer that wish to keep their
      fertility as much as possible in the future after treatment.

      Patients who receive surgery alone may experience long-term side effects including
      infertility. The purpose of this research study is to determine whether giving neo-adjuvant
      chemotherapy prior to surgery can maintain fertility in patients with invasive cervical
      cancer.

      The neo-adjuvant chemotherapy will consist of a platinum-based chemotherapy drug cisplatin or
      carboplatin, with a chemotherapy drug called paclitaxel. These are common chemotherapy drugs
      used in the treatment of women with cervical cancers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will first receive neo-adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy. Once the
      neo-adjuvant chemotherapy has been completed, participants will be assessed by imaging scans
      to see whether they have a response to the treatment.

      If participants are responding to treatment, they will then have a trachelectomy. After
      surgery, participants will be assessed and the study doctor will determine whether adjuvant
      treatment is needed. Adjuvant treatment may include chemotherapy and radiotherapy, or have a
      hysterectomy done.

      If participants do not respond to or their disease worsens after neo-adjuvant treatment,
      participants will receive adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy or have a
      hysterectomy done.
