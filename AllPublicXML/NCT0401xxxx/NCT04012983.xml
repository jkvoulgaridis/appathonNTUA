  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study aims to spot the light on the possible role of gingival crevicular fluid
      (GCF) level of Chemerin and FGF21 to study their potential role as biomarkers of periodontal
      disease and to understand their role in the link between periodontitis and diabetes .

      The study will be conducted on three groups; group (A) include fifteen controlled T2 DM
      patients suffering from periodontitis, group (B) include fifteen patients suffering from
      periodontitis alone, and group C) include fifteen periodontally and medically healthy
      individuals. GCF samples will be collected from all participants for assessment of Chemerin
      and FGF 21. Samples will be analysed using ELISA technique.

        forty five individuals (ranging in age from 35-60 years) recruited from the outpatient
        clinic of Oral Medicine, and Periodontology Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo

        disease.

        Group (2): 15 systemically healthy individuals having periodontitis. Group (3): 15
        periodontally and systemically healthy individuals.
