  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we investigated the effect of low-frequency repetitive trans cranial magnetic
      stimulation, one of the noninvasive brain stimuli, on the functional changes of the bilateral
      motor cortical activity in normal subjects using functional near infrared spectroscopy
      (fNIRS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In normal subjects,

        1. the effect of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on cerebral
           cortex are measured in real time using fNIRS.

        2. Changes in cerebral cortical activity before and after stimulation are measured using
           the motor function test and the motor-induced potential test

    <description>Application of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation with sham mode(no stimulation) to the primary motor area of the dominant hemisphere using a navigation system.
Using the BrainSight instrument, a navigation system, the TMS coil position can be fixed on the point precise target area based on the subject's MRI image.
Sham stimulation is stimulated by the same frequency, intensity and time as the actual stimulus in such a way that the 8-shaped coil is placed at a 90 degree angle to the scalp in the same manner as rTMS and sounds are heard but the magnetic stimulus is not transmitted to the cerebrum</description>
