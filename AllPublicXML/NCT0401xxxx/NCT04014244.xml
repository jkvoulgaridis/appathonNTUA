  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present study is to compare the effectiveness of 5% dextrose, local
      corticosteroids injections and surgical release in patients with electrodiagnostically (EDx)
      mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The investigators hypothesize that in patients
      with mild to moderate CTS (1) local 5% dextrose injections is non-inferior to local
      corticosteroid injections at 12 months after treatment, and that (2) local 5% dextrose
      injections are of non-inferior effectiveness compared to surgical release at 6 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical release of the carpal ligament is a standard treatment of the median nerve
      entrapment at the wrist. Local corticosteroid injections are also an established alternative,
      particularly for EDx mild or moderate CTS, although majority of patients still needs surgical
      decompression within 1 year. Majority of studies concluded that after more than 6 months of
      treatment surgical decompression is better than local corticosteroids injections.
      Furthermore, corticosteroids also have a number of side effects, including crystal induced
      synovitis, tendon rupture, axon and myelin degeneration, soft tissue atrophy, skin thinning,
      steroid flare and hot flushes. Therefore, it would be very useful to have an effective
      alternative substance for injections, without these problems. Perineural injection of
      dextrose also seems to be a promising treatment for entrapment neuropathies. To date only two
      studies investigated the effectiveness of 5% dextrose injections in patients with CTS.
      Authors concluded that this is an effective treatment, that is for patients with mild or
      moderate CTS even more beneficial than corticosteroid injections at 6 months follow-up. It
      was suggested that perineural injection of 5% dextrose decreases neurogenic inflammation. As
      5% dextrose has osmolarity similar to normal saline, this formulation seems particularly
      promising. These expectations were supported in studies including animals and humans
      reporting no harmful effects.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients with bilateral CTS symptoms and EDx mild to moderate CTS will be included. In the first part of the study examiner will randomize substance for left hand infiltration using a dice (odd number - corticosteroids; even number - 5% glucose). Right hand will be infiltrated with the remaining substance. In the second part of the study examiner will randomize treatment procedure for left hand using a dice (odd number - corticosteroids or 5% glucose; even number - surgery). Substance for injection will be determined according to the results of the first part of the study - more effective one, or in case of non-inferiority 5% glucose will be used. In all patients included in the second part of the study surgical release will be performed by the same plastic surgeon. Both treatments will be performed maximally 2 months after diagnosis, with maximum period between them of 1 week.</intervention_model_description>
