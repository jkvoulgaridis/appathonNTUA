      This is a multi-center prospective randomized controlled study. In this study, the
      investigators will use confocal laser endomicroscopy to make real-time in vivo optical biopsy
      of distal margin in rectal cancer surgery and help surgeons to make surgical decision.The
      investigators also assess the accuracy of CLE optical biopsy, compared with intra-operative
      frozen section.

    <textblock>
      In low rectal cancer surgery, how to select the precise dissection plane and optimal surgical
      procedure is an important challenge for surgeons. In current clinic, surgeons select
      dissection plane by a comprehensive judgment of pre-operative pelvis MRI, colonoscopy and
      digital rectal examination, then through submitting the &quot;doughnut&quot; after cutting and
      anastomosis to intra-operative frozen section (IFS) to definite whether there is residual
      tumor in distal margin (DM). However, IFS can only make diagnosis using the tissue specimen
      in vitro and time-consuming. Once the IFS confirm positive margin, it always means anal
      resection should be implemented to ensure radical treatment. Therefore, if there is a
      real-time in situ examination method to evaluate DM in vivo, it will bring great benefits to
      both surgeons and patients.

      Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) had been widely used in medical field to diagnose
      colorectal disease, but it is seldom applied in surgical filed especially in rectal cancer to
      make optical biopsy and help surgical decision-making. Therefore, the investigators
      hypothesize that CLE can real-time in situ evaluate DM during surgery in rectal cancer and
      its accuracy is non-inferior to intra-operative frozen section.

      In this study, the investigators will randomly assign patients to the experimental group (CLE
      optical biopsy) and control group (IFS). Using H-E staining pathological diagnosis as golden
      standard, the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of both CLE optical biopsy and IFS will
      be evaluated and compared. And the investigators will also evaluate patients' postoperative
      urinary function, defection function and quality of life through a year follow-up.
