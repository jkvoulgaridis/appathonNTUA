  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective cohort study that collects only diagnostic and
      therapeutic data in subjects but does not interfere with treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to assess blood pressure and lipid levels, the use of lipid-lowering and
      antihypertensive drugs, and treatment compliance and adverse events in hypertensive
      outpatients of 30 hospitals of different levels, following them up for 1 and 3 months after
      treatment, respectively. The study would reveal the compliance of blood pressure and lipid
      levels in hypertensive patients under management of hospitals at different levels, and
      analyze factors affecting blood pressure or lipid levels associated with treatment
      compliance. Therefore, the study would provide clinical data from the real world for future
      prevention and control of CVD in China.

    <measure>The primary endpoint will be compliance of blood pressure in hypertensive patients after 3 months of treatment in hospitals at different levels.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure measurement:
Blood pressure in both upper arms will be measured with a sphygmomanometer, with the patient in the sitting position. The mean value of three tests will be used for statistics. When left and right upper arms show different blood pressures, the higher value will be used for statistics.</description>
