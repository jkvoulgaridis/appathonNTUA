  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is not a treatment study.

      In this study, the researchers are primarily interested in examining whether functional MRI
      (fMRI)-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) may be more effective than traditional
      TMS methods at temporarily influencing neural circuit communication. The investigators test
      this by combining TMS and fMRI technologies to probe and modulate brain activity.

      If the novel fMRI-guided TMS stimulation used in this study is more effective than
      traditional methods, future studies may utilize similar personalized TMS targeting methods to
      yield even better clinical outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is now FDA-approved for the treatment of
      major depressive disorder (MDD). However, there is growing evidence that the targeting
      strategy for delivering TMS treatment may yield superior clinical outcomes if it is tailored
      to individual neuroanatomy. In this observational study, the investigators plan to examine
      this theory by using individualized TMS targets created from participants' own fMRI scans.

      This is not a treatment study, and stimulation is not designed to provide treatment in this
      study. Instead, the TMS delivery is meant to temporarily modify brain circuit communication
      between the lateral prefrontal cortex and subcortical structures. The research team
      administers TMS inside of the MRI scanner to prove that this pathway can be influenced
      non-invasively with TMS.

      These subcortical structures are important to affective disorder, and may contribute to the
      symptoms that patients suffering from depression are experiencing. The researchers hope that
      this innovative TMS research will confirm neural networks important to affective disorders,
      and guide future treatment options.

    <description>The study uses a modified repetitive TMS stimulation protocol. Participants receive active TMS on five separate days: a baseline TMS/ fMRI scan, three &quot;mini TMS&quot; sessions, and a final TMS/ fMRI scan.
Again, this level of stimulation is considered to be sub-threshold for that of a TMS treatment protocol.</description>
