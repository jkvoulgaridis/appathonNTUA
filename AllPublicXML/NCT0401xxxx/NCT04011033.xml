  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common disease with high mortality. More than 80%
      patients are first diagnosed with late-stage and unresectable, their effective drugs and
      treatments are very limited. invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) cell exhibit antitumor
      activity against malignant tumors through producing high levels of cytokines. iNKT cells are
      abundant in the liver, but defect in liver cancer development. iNKT cells can express homing
      receptors licensing them specifically to migrate liver, then play key antitumor immunity. We
      already did a phase I study of autologous infusion of iNKT cells in the treatment of patients
      with advanced HCC. Safety and feasibility of iNKT infusion was proved. The purpose of this
      study is to verify the effectiveness of iNKT cells infusion combined with transcatheter
      arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in treatment of advanced HCC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced HCC will be enrolled and divided into two groups. Patients in
      experimental group will be treated with TACE combined with iNKT cells infusion. TACE will be
      performed at 0th and 4th week. iNKT cells will be infused at 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 8th and 12th
      week. Patients in control group will be treated with TACE at 0th and 4th week. Adverse
      events（AEs）, overall survival (OS) time and recurrence-free survival (RFS) time, change of
      immune cells will be monitored.
