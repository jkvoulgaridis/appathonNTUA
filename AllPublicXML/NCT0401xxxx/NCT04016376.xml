  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the injection site or sites used for
      administering pain medication (nerve blocks) before a double mastectomy with immediate
      reconstruction with tissue expanders reduce the need for pain medication after surgery.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be randomized to 1 of 3 groups (n=500 patients per group) of standard of care preoperative nerve blocks consisting of either: i) PVB, ii) serratus+PECS-1, or iii) PVB+PECS-1. Each group will receive ropivacaine or bupivacaine +/- clonidine (0.5 - 1 mcg/kg not to exceed a total of 100 mcg) +/- dexamethasone (up to 4 mg) in one of three routine nerve block approaches prior to surgical procedure as is current standard of care.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Patient will be placed in the prone, lateral, or sitting position. With an ultrasound probe placed in the parasagittal or transverse position, the paravertebral space will be identified. Injections will be done in an in-plane manner relative to the ultrasound probe. Local anesthesia will be injected to cover T1-T6 dermatomes.</description>

Local anesthesia will be injected to cover T1-T6 dermatomes.
For PECS-1, the patient will be placed in the supine position with an ultrasound probe placed inferolaterally starting at the mid-clavicular level the pectoralis major and minor will be identified. Injection of local anesthesia will be performed between the pectoralis major and minor.</description>

Injection of local anesthesia will be performed between the pectoralis major and minor.
For the serratus block, the patient will be placed in the supine or lateral decubitus position and with an ultrasound probe, in the parasagittal plane, the serratus muscles will be identified. Injections will be done in-plane below the serratus anterior.</description>
