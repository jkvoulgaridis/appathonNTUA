  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite biologic drugs and improvements of inflammatory arthritis (IA) treatment, many
      patients with inflammatory arthritis still face increased absenteeism, reduced at-work
      productivity and report difficulties working and having to give up their jobs. Such
      professional limitation generates psychological stress and it felt generally as a premature
      social ageing.

      &quot;Making-it-Work&quot; is an intervention developed in English speaking Canada, which aims at
      enabling both patients and employers to intervene early during the course of inflammatory
      arthritis to reduce possible problems at work, and to prevent sick leave and future work
      disability in the long term and improve well-being at work.

      As part of the EVADE (Evaluation of the effectiVeness of an ADaptation of the Making it-Work
      intervention in a French Environment) project which aims at evaluating the effectiveness of
      an adaptation of the &quot;Making-it-Work&quot; intervention, to the French environment, the
      investigators propose :

        1. to identify the problems faced at work due to IA, patients needs, motivations to
           continue working and strategies helpful for maintaining employment.

        2. to develop a questionnaire to assess difficulties at work, needs for adaptations and
           support and motivations to work of patients with inflammatory arthritis.

      The development of the patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure will comprise:

      Step 1: Identifying themes and generating items by

        -  Conducting focus groups and/or individual semi-structured interviews with patients with
           IA to identify the problems faced at work due to the disease and identify strategies
           helpful for maintaining employment. Work characteristics, work environment, and social,
           economic factors and role of family members will receive specific attention.

        -  Conducting focus groups including patients with IA who stay at work despite the disease
           to identify their motivations and needs to stay at work.

        -  Conducting individual semi-structured interviews with health care professionals and
           professionals of the prevention and security at work

        -  Conducting the thematic analysis, following a general inductive approach

      Step 2: Selecting items using a Delphi method using a panel of patients and health care
      professionals

      Step 3: Items reconciliation and selection by an expert panel

      Step 4: Cognitive debriefing of selected items (pre-test).

      Step 5: Evaluate psychometric properties will follow the standards for assessing validity of
      a complex measurement scale, checking for truth, discrimination and feasibility ((Outcome
      Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) filter 2.0) according to the COnsensus-based Standards for
      the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) check-list. Scale measurement
      properties will be assessed using Rasch measurement methods.
