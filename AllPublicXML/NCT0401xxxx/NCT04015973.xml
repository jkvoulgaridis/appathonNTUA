  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PRE-OP ENERGY Trial proposes to test the overarching hypothesis that a pre-surgery high
      energy diet will protect patients against organ damage during cardiac surgery with
      cardiopulmonary bypass.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PRE-OP ENERGY is a single centre, unblinded, parallel group, randomised controlled trial of a
      pre-operative high energy diet, versus a control group receiving standard care.

      The trial will test a number of specific hypotheses:

        1. A pre-surgery high energy diet will protect against post-cardiac surgery organ failure
           by altering the pre-surgery cardiometabolic state, a process referred to as 'metabolic
           preconditioning'.

        2. The effects of the trial intervention will not be attributable to changes in frailty,
           activity or baseline organ dysfunction.

        3. The trial intervention will not result in long-term adverse changes in cardiometabolic
           status.

        4. Metabolic preconditioning will confer protection against post-cardiac surgery kidney
           injury by increasing the expression of genes that promote renal tubular homeostasis.

        5. Metabolic preconditioning will confer protection against post-cardiac surgery myocardial
           injury by increasing the expression of genes that promote myocardial mitochondrial
           homeostasis via effects on chromatin histone deacetylation.

        6. Metabolic preconditioning will confer protection against post-cardiac surgery
           endothelial dysfunction by increasing the expression of genes that promote endothelial
           homeostasis.

    <time_frame>Baseline, pre-assessment and 3 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Pre-existing inflammation, renal impairment and heart failure will be assessed using highly sensitive CRP assay, NT-proBNP (both Abcam), and estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (from serum creatinine). Formula for GFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 175 × (Scr)-1.154 × (Age)-0.203 × (0.742 if female) × (1.212 if African American) The equation does not require weight or height variables because the results are reported normalized to 1.73 m2 body surface area, which is an accepted average adult surface area.</description>

    <measure>Endothelial function: Blood samples</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-12 and 48 hours post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Markers of endothelial activation will be measured in blood samples using flow cytometry.</description>

    <measure>Endothelial function: Reactive Hyperaemia Peripheral Arterial Tonometry (RH-PAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day before surgery and 24 hours post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Regional endothelial dysfunction will be measured as the reactive hyperaemia peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT) index using the Endo-PAT 2000 (Itamar Medical Ltd., Caesarea, Israel)</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Endothelial function: Global endothelial dysfunction</measure>
    <time_frame>End of surgery, 0-6, 6-12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post-operatively (until the timepoint serum arterial lactate falls below 2.5 mmol/L)</time_frame>
    <description>Global endothelial dysfunction will also be measured indirectly as the measured time to resolution of oxygen debt defined as the period of time from the end of surgery until the measured serum arterial lactate level falls below 2.5 mmol/L.</description>
