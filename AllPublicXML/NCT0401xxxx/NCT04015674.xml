  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is considered the gold standard for safe and effective vascular
      access during hemodialytic treatment. It is known that systemic aerobic exercise is capable
      of promoting peripheral vasodilation, however, its effects on AVF are unknown. For this
      reason, we will evaluate the effects of aerobic exercise on a stationary bicycle over the AVF
      caliber.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemodialysis is a method responsible for filtering blood and helping to control excess blood
      fluid and impurities in patients with end-stage chronic kidney disease. The vascular accesses
      commonly used in this procedure is atribute catheter, which is placed in a large caliber
      vein, usually jugular or femoral vein, and arteriovenous fistula (AVF). In order to use the
      AVF in the hemodialysis procedure, a maturation process of the AVF is necessary,
      characterized by the increase of its caliber, which is accelerated by force exercises located
      in the AVF region, whose purpose is to promote the vasodilation of the AVF. Systemically
      performed aerobic exercises are also capable of promoting peripheral vasodilation and their
      effects on AVF are still unknown. Therefore, this study proposes to evaluate the behavior of
      the AVF through ultrasound before, during and after performing aerobic exercise on a
      stationary bicycle. For this, all patient will sign the informed consent form, respond to the
      International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and questionnaire Kidney Disease Quality
      of Life (KDQOL-SFTM), and use a pedometer for 7 days to measure the number of steps per day
      to characterize the sample. Patients will remain in supine position for 5 minutes to measure
      their vascular caliber of the AVF by echography. After, will be instructed to perform 30
      minutes on stationary bike (Model Monark). The AVF vascular caliber will be measured during
      aerobic exercise. Because it is a cross-over trial, participants will perform the other arm
      after 7 days.
