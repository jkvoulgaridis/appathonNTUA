    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to iteratively develop and test a TOGETHER pilot mobile app
      product in preparation for commercialization. TOGETHER is a mobile application on a smart
      software system that informal caregivers can use to develop and implement home-based care for
      cancer patients/survivors.

      The Technical Objectives are to:

        1. Establish the project team and obtain stakeholder feedback on what to include in the
           product.

        2. Evaluate IT customization requirements and HIPAA compliance security, and privacy
           protocols.

        3. Develop a prototype to show NCI and then a pilot version for beta and usability testing
           among stakeholders.

        4. Enhance interoperability and test integration into health system(s) - if feasible.

        5. Develop user support documentation for stakeholders.
