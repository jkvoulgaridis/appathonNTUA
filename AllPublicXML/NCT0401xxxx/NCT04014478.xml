    <textblock>
      A prospective, multicenter, self-control clinical trial aim to enroll 110 patients suffered
      from upper abdominal (liver, pancreas, stomach, etc.) cancers . Patients who have taken at
      least one opioid drug for pain for two weeks and still have a VAS pain scale greater than 6
      will receive endovascular denervation (EDN). They will be followed up for 3 months. The VAS
      scales, quantity of analgesics as represented by morphine equivalent and quality of life
      scores will be compared before and after EDN. Safety parameters such as arterial deformation,
      embolism, infection, liver and kidney functions will also be monitored.
