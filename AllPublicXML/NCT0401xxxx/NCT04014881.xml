    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      anti-CD123 CAR-T cells in patients with refractory/relapsed CD123+ Acute Myeloid Leukemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CD123 is a transmembrane subunit of the IL-3 receptor expressed on AML blasts. The
      investigators have conducted a third generationCD123-targeted CAR containing CD137 and CD28
      costimulatory domains.This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of anti-CD123 CAR-T
      cells in patients with relapsed/refractory CD123+ Acute Myeloid Leukemia.
