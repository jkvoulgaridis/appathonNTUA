      The purpose of this clinical trial is to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of
      multiple CAR T-cell therapy which combines CAR T cells against CLL-1 with CAR T cells
      targeting CD123 or CD33 in patients with relapsed and refractory AML. The study also aims to
      learn more about the function of CAR T cells and their persistency in AML patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a malignant disease characterized by the rapid growth of
      myeloblasts that grow in the bone marrow and interfere with the generation of normal blood
      cells.

      Over the past few years, several groups have demonstrated that CD33 and CD123 CAR T cells can
      eradicate AML in both preclinical and clinical trials. Nevertheless, relapse after CAR T
      therapy remains a critical problem in treating AML. Disease relapse can be caused by antigen
      escape and by the outgrowth of residual leukemia stem cells (LSCs) that are not effectively
      eliminated by CAR T cells. CLL-1 (C-type lectin-like molecule-1) is a transmembrane
      glycoprotein, which is overexpressed in LSCs but absent in HSCs (hematopoietic stem cells),
      suggesting that CLL-1 might be a promising target for novel AML therapy. In this study, we
      use CLL-1 CAR-T in combination with CD123 and/or CD33 CAR-T as a new strategy to address LSC
      issue and prevent relapse caused by antigen escape.

      The T cells from patients or transplantation donors will be genetically modified with
      lentiviral CAR vector to recognize specific molecules (CD33, CD123 or CLL-1) expressed on the
      surface of AML cells. The engineered T cells will be applied to patients through intravenous
      delivery.

      The purpose of this clinical trial is to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of
      multiple CAR-T cell therapy in AML. Another goal of the study is to learn more about the
      function of CAR T cells and their persistency in the patients.
