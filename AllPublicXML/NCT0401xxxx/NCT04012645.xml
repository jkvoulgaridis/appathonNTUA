  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a multicenter, prospective, and randomized controlled clinical study of patients with
      mid- or low- rectal cancer who received laparoscopic TME surgery aims to explore whether the
      application of near infrared-indocyanine green imaging system can evaluate the anastomotic
      blood perfusion accurately, and optimize the surgical procedures, or even reduce the
      incidence rates of postoperative anastomotic leakage in mid- or low- rectal cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In total mesorectal excision of rectal cancer, accurate assessment of rectal anastomotic
      blood supply is crucial: for insufficient anastomotic blood supply is an important cause of
      postoperative anastomotic leakage, and once anastomotic leakage occurs, the perioperative
      mortality rate of patients is reportedly 16%. In the past, the assessment of anastomotic
      blood supply mainly depended on the experience of the surgeon and lacked objective and
      accurate assessment methods. In recent years, the application of near-infrared fluorescence
      laparoscopic imaging technology has provided a new way to accurately evaluate anastomotic
      perfusion. At present, the technology has been applied to evaluate anastomotic blood supply
      in colorectal cancer surgery worldwide, and its safety and reliability have been confirmed.
      However, whether the application of this technology can reduce the incidence of anastomotic
      leakage after total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer and thus benefit patients still
      needs high-level evidence-based medical evidence support with multi-centers and large
      samples.Thus, a multicenter, prospective, and randomized controlled clinical study of
      patients with mid- or low- rectal cancer who received laparoscopic TME surgery was intend to
      conduct to explore whether the application of near infrared-indocyanine green imaging system
      can evaluate the anastomotic blood perfusion accurately, and optimize the surgical
      procedures, or even reduce the incidence rates of postoperative anastomotic leakage in mid-
      or low- rectal cancer patients.
