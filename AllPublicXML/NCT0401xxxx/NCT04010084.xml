  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is among the most common chronic respiratory
      diseases (CKD). Millions of people of all ages suffer from these diseases. COPD is between
      the fifth and sixth of the leading causes of death in Brazil. It generates an inflammatory
      pulmonary response that is softened by non-curative treatments and that present serious side
      effects. Low intensity laser (LBI) or laser therapy has been used for about 50 years to help
      the healing process, revealing efficient anti-inflammatory and analgesic responses, as well
      as experimental models of acute and chronic inflammation. However, little is known about its
      response in inflammatory lung diseases, especially COPD. Some reports indicate that laser
      therapy may interfere positively by relieving clinical signs, the onset, and the final
      symptoms of pulmonary inflammation. The present project aims to study the effects of LBI on
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease in patients with pulmonary processes, determine their
      mechanisms of action and evaluate its effect on patients' functional capacity.

    <description>Walk test: In a flat hallway, it will be delimited by two cones and the patient will be guided to walk from one side to the other. The walking speed will be controlled by a &quot;compact disc&quot; that emits beeps (simple BIP) at regular intervals. The test will be interrupted by exhaustion or when the patient is unable to maintain the proposed speed.</description>

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quantification of serum levels of interleukin will be performed using Human IL-10 and THF-alpha ELISA MAX (Biolegend) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the plates will be coated with anti-IL-10 or anti-TNF-alpha capture monoclonal antibody for 18 h at 8 ° C, washed and then incubated with the reagent provided by the kit to block non-specific binding and to reduce background. Samples will be added to each well at room temperature for 2 h and after washing, the detection antibody solution will be added. The reactions will be revealed with the Avidin-HRP solution and the absorbance will be read at 450nm. They will be evaluated immediately after the end of treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The spirometry test will be performed by a physiotherapist using a spirometer apparatus to perform spirometry before and after 20 minutes of bronchodilator administration. The technical procedures, the criteria of acceptability and reproducibility adopted will be those recommended by the Brazilian Consensus of Spirometry. All patients will perform the maneuvers after bronchodilator (salbutamol 400 μg inhalation). They will be evaluated immediately after the end of treatment.</description>

    <description>Saint George`s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ): We apply questions related to daily life activities related to the quality of life of patients with COPD. They will be evaluated immediately after the end of treatment.
The SGRQ addresses aspects related to three areas:
symptoms, activity and psychosocial impacts that respiratory disease inflicts on the patient. Each domain has a maximum possible score; the points of each answer are summed and the total is referred to as a percentage of this maximum.</description>

    <description>The irradiation will be applied transcutaneously in the sublingual region (3 points on the left side and 3 points on the right side), irradiated for 30 seconds and the total treatment time will be 3 minutes. The group will receive irradiation with a DMC-branded laser EC device, with combined wavelength (660 and 780 nm), 1J of energy per point and output power of 35 mW. A disposable plastic material covering the application pen will be used for hygiene reasons.
The treatment will be performed twice weekly for a total of 4 consecutive weeks of treatment, and after completion, the patients will be reassessed of all the complementary tests that have been requested.</description>

    <description>The irradiation will be applied transcutaneously in the sublingual region (3 points on the left side and 3 points on the right side), irradiated for 30 seconds and the total treatment time will be 3 minutes. The group will receive placebo (with switched-off) irradiation of the DMC-brand laser therapy EC model, with combined wavelength (660 and 780 nm), 1J of energy per point and output power of 35 mW. A disposable plastic material covering the application pen will be used for hygiene reasons.
The treatment will be performed twice weekly for a total of 4 consecutive weeks of treatment, and after completion, the patients will be reassessed of all the complementary tests that have been requested.</description>
