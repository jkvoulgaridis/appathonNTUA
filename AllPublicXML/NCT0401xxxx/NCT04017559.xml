  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adherence to treatment is a major challenge in cystic fibrosis (CF). Motivational
      Interviewing (MI) is increasingly used to address this, but its effectiveness is unknown. We
      investigated the clinical impact of an MI intervention, delivered by a specifically trained
      pharmacist, on adherence to inhaled antibiotics (IA).

      Adherence to treatment is a major challenge in cystic fibrosis (CF). Motivational
      Interviewing (MI) is increasingly used to address this, but its effectiveness is unknown. We
      investigated the clinical impact of an MI intervention, delivered by a specifically trained
      pharmacist, on adherence to inhaled antibiotics (IA).

      Adults with CF were recruited through the Regional CF Centre. A pharmacist trained in MI
      delivered three recorded MI sessions over 2 months, with follow up at 3, 4 and 6 months.
      Demographics, ppFEV1, BMI, adherence (IA collection rates) and additional antibiotic use were
      collected during the study and for 6 months prior. Treatment Quality and Satisfaction (TQSM),
      self-reported adherence (Moriskey Medication Adherence Scale-8 (MMAS-8)), Quality Of Life (CF
      Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R)) and sputum Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) density were assessed
      at each study visit. Statistical analysis compared outcomes pre and post-intervention and
      variation during the intervention period.
