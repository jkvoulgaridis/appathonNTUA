      The purpose of this study is to determine of letermovir (LTC) is effective at preventing
      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection from returning in people who have already had CMV infection
      after a bone marrow transplant.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have received allogenic HCT

          -  Have received preemptive therapy for clinically significant CMV infection post-HCT and
             have completed preemptive therapy no longer than 7 days prior to enrollment.
             Preemptive treatment includes ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet. Clinically
             significant CMV infection is defined as CMV viremia requiring preemptive therapy or
             CMV EOD. Patients who received LTV prophylaxis prior to onset of clinically
             significant CMV infection prior to enrollment.

          -  Have one or more risk factors for recurrent CMV infection:

               1. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatch

                    -  HLA-related (sibling) donor with at least one mismatch at the HLA-A, -B or
                       -DR gene loci

                    -  Haploidentical donor

                    -  Unrelated donor with at least one mismatch at the HLA-A, -B, -C or -DRC1gene
                       loci, or

                    -  Cord blood as stem cell source

               2. Acute or chronic GVHD requiring either topical steroids for gastrointestinal GVHD
                  and/or systemic steroid treatment (&gt;/= 1mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent
                  dose of another corticosteroid) within 14 days prior to enrollment

               3. T-cell-depleted allograft

          -  For adult patients, able to provide written consent and complete the informed consent.
             For patients under 18 years, the patient's parent(s) or legal guardian(s) must provide
             informed consent and the patient must provide written assent to participation in the
             study.

          -  Willing and able to comply with trial instructions and requirements

          -  Male and female patients of childbearing potential must be willing to use a highly
             effective method of contraception for the course of the study. Abstinence is
             acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the patient.

        Subject eligibility criteria for the observational cohort:

          -  Age 18 years or older

          -  First allogenic peripheral blood or marrow HCT

          -  LTV prophylaxis starting &lt;30 days post HCT and given for at least 6 weeks

          -  T-cell count &gt;/=100 at day +100

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant CMV infection present at enrollment

          -  Breakthrough CMV infection while on primary LTV prophylaxis (unless patient
             non-adherent to prophylaxis) or presence of documented resistance to LTV.

          -  Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;/= mL/min/1.73m^2(equivalent to creatinine clearance
             &lt;/=10 mL/min)

          -  Severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C)

          -  Routine use of high-dose acyclovir (doses of &gt; 800 mg twice daily), valacyclovir
             (doses of &gt; 500mg twice daily), or famciclovir (doses &gt; 500mg/day) for varicella
             zoster virus (VZV)/herpes simplex virus prophylaxis; limited treatment courses at
             higher doses for VZV infections are permissible if treatment duration dose not exceed
             14 days total. Short courses of IV cidofovir for adeno virus (ADV) are permissible

          -  Suspected or known hypersensitivity to active or inactive ingredients of LTV
             formulations

          -  Patients treated with a medication whose administration with LTV is ontraindicated and
             whose discontinuation is not possible. Contraindicated medications include pimozide,
             ergot alkaloids and pitavastatin or simvastatin when co-administered with
             cyclosporine.

          -  Imminent demise (expected survival &lt;6 weeks)

          -  Documented positive result for human immunodeficiency virus antibody (HIV-Ab) or for
             hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV-Ab) with detectable HCV RNA, or hepatitis B surface
             antigen (HBsAg) at any time prior to HCT

          -  Need for mechanical ventilation and/or vasopressor support at the time of enrollment

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding

          -  Plans to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial

          -  History of current evidence of any condition, therapy, lab abnormality, or other
             circumstance that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the
             subject's participation for the full duration of the study, or would place the subject
             at undue risk as judged by the investigator, such that it is not in the best interest
             of the subject to participate in this study.

        Exclusion criteria for observational cohort:

          -  Clinically significant CMV infection during the 100 days following HCT. Clinically
             significant CMV infection defined as either CMV viremia requiring preemptive therapy
             with CMV antivirals or CMV end organ disease (EOD)

          -  Grade 3-4 GVHD

          -  Cord blood as cell source for HCT

          -  Treatment with systemic steroids (&gt;0.5mg/kg for 2 weeks or longer) prior to enrollment
