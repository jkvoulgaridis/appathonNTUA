  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity, unhealthy dietary habits, and food insecurity are major public health concerns,
      especially affecting individuals living in poverty. Food pantries, which provide free food to
      those in need, are increasingly interested in promoting healthy choices, but few rigorous
      studies have tested healthy eating interventions in food pantry settings. The overall
      objective of this proposal is to conduct a 1-year randomized-controlled trial among 500
      regular food pantry clients to compare the influence of a behavioral economic intervention to
      promote healthier food choices delivered via a web-based ordering platform to usual care
      (control group).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this proposal is to evaluate the influence of a web-based behavioral
      economic intervention compared to a control group on the following outcomes among food pantry
      clients: 1) Nutritional quality of food chosen at the pantry using food transaction data; 2)
      Fruit and vegetable intake measured by biomarkers and food frequency questionnaires; 3)
      Objectively measured biomarkers of health. The web-based behavioral economic intervention
      will include the following modifications to the online shopping platform: 1) Healthy food
      shopping cart defaults, 2) healthy placement choice architecture, 3) traffic light nutrition
      labels, 4) social norms messaging, and 5) healthy swaps. Food transaction data will be
      collected from the online system at baseline and then continuously for the remaining 12
      months of the study (participants typically shop monthly). Surveys and objective biomarkers
      will be collected at baseline, three-months, and twelve-months.

    <intervention_model_description>The researchers will recruit 500 regular food pantry clients to participate in a 1-year randomized-controlled trial that involves visiting the food pantry and selecting food using the web-based ordering system, having physical measurements collected by study staff, completing food frequency questionnaires, completing a health survey, and getting a blood draw to measure fruit and vegetable intake and health outcomes from biomarkers. Participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 conditions: 1) control group (usual care); or 2) behavioral economic intervention group.</intervention_model_description>
