  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-lable Phase I clinical trial. Eligible patients will have
      Histologically proven stage IB2-IVA cervical cancer. We hypothesize that Nab-paclitaxel in
      combination with cisplatin and radiotherapy may have anti-tumor activity in patients with
      cervical cancer. Nab-paclitaxel has not previously been combined with conventional RT-CT to
      treat cervical cancer.

  <detailed_description>

      During the phase I study, patients will receive radiation therapy to pelvis (50.4 Gy in
      28fractions), and followed by HDR intracavitary (30Gy in 5 fractions) brachytherapy.
      Concurrent chemotherapy was administered with weekly cisplatin (40 mg/m^2) and an escalating
      dose of weekly Nab-paclitaxel starting at 10 mg/m^2 up to 70 mg/m^2. Chemotherapy agents were
      administered in escalating doses to cohorts of three patients at each dose level.

    <description>Chemotherapy: Patients firstly receive an escalating dose of weekly Nab-paclitaxel starting at 10 mg/m^2 up to 70 mg/m^2, Patients secondly receive weekly cisplatin (40 mg/m^2). Treatment repeats every week until the disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity, death or begin a novel therapeutic. Concurrent chemotherapy is a weekly regimen during radiotherapy. Patients will complete at least 4 cycles of concurrent chemoradiotherapy, until the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) appeared.
Radiation therapy: Patients also receive pelvic radiation therapy once daily (Monday-Friday) for a total of 28 fractions and intracavitary brachytherapy twice a week for a total 5 fractions. Complete radiotherapy within 55 days.</description>
