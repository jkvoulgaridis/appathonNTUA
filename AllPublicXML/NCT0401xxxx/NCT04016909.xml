  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The benefits of weight-loss programs on mood state and cognitive and motor behavior remain
      unclear and are largely limited to those of calorie restriction (CR) or physical exercise
      alone. Our aim was to investigate the effect of a combined CR and aerobic exercise program on
      mood state, cognition-related brain activity, and cognitive and motor behavior in overweight
      and obese women. Twenty-six overweight or obese women were randomized to either a control
      group (no intervention) or an experimental group (aerobic exercise + 12.5% energy-intake
      reduction). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, mood, prefrontal cortex
      activity, cognitive performance, and learning of a speed-accuracy task were evaluated before
      and 6 months after the beginning of the program. Confusion and depression increased in the
      control group (P &lt; 0.05), whereas tension decreased in the experimental group (P &lt; 0.05).
      BDNF level and learning of a speed-accuracy task remained unchanged. Although PFC activity
      and executive functions were not affected, the reaction time of visual scanning and
      associative learning were improved in the experimental group (P &lt; 0.05). An improvement in
      reaction time during the speed-accuracy task was observed (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, a
      6-month combined CR and aerobic exercise intervention improved the psychosocial mental state
      of overweight and obese women. Although it improved motor planning during the speed-accuracy
      task, it had little impact on cognition and no effect on brain activity and learning of the
      speed-accuracy task.

    <description>During the speed-accuracy task, the participant was required to position the handle symbol (0.0035 m in diameter) in the start zone on the computer screen. The participant then had to react to the target (a green circle, 0.007 m in diameter) on the computer screen as fast as possible and to push the handle of the device so that the circle of the handle symbol reached the target as quickly and accurately as possible. The distance from the start zone to the target was 0.17 m. The endpoint of the movement was reached when the center of the handle symbol stopped in the circle and stayed there for at least 0.02 s.</description>

    <description>The experimental intervention: both exercise and calorie restriction, as described below:
Exercise intervention. 6 months, 72 supervised aerobic exercise training sessions on cycle ergometers, including 3 sessions of training per week. A warm-up procedure consisting of 5 min of low-intensity stretching was completed by all women before the aerobic training. Subsequently, a 50 min aerobic training at an intensity between 60% and 70% of the maximum heart rate (HR) was performed. Thereafter, a cool-down consisting of 5 min of low-intensity stretching and breathing exercises was completed. HR was recorded continuously throughout the training sessions using an HR monitor (S625X, Polar Electro, Kempele, Finland).
Calorie restriction intervention. The CR intervention was designed to create a 12.5% energy deficit, with the goal of reducing body weight by 5%-10% over 6 months.</description>
