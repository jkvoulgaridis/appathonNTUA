      This is a single arm, open-label, single-center study to determine the safety and efficacy of
      CNCT19 in adult patients with r/r B cell Malignancies. The study will have the following
      sequential phases: Screening, Pre-Treatment (Cell Product Preparation &amp; Lymphodepleting
      Chemotherapy), Treatment and Follow-up, and Survival Follow-up. The total duration of the
      study is 2 years from CNCT19 cell infusion.
