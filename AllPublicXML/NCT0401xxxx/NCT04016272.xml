    <measure>Change in clinical pain as assessed by the numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 3</time_frame>
    <description>The NRS total score ranges from 0 (no pain) to 100 (most intense pain imaginable).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain related cortical response using a continuous wave, multichannel Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) imaging system</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 3</time_frame>
    <description>Pain-related cortical response will be measured using a continuous-wave, multichannel fNIRS imaging system (LIGHTNIRS, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) with three semiconductor lasers at 780, 805, and 830 nm. Optical recordings will be collected during thermal pain stimulation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability as measured by the tDCs experience questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>week 3</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire is based on scale from 0-10, 0 being strongly disagree and 10 being strongly agree for a total maximum score of a 100, with higher scores indicating greater acceptibility.</description>
