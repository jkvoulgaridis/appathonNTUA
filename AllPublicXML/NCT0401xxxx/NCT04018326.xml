  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study determined the clinical impact and causes of loss to follow-up (LTFU) from the
      patients' perspective in individuals with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) who
      received panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) and/or intravitreal injections (IVIs) of
      anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

      This prospective cohort study included 467 patients with PDR who received PRP and/or IVIs of
      anti-VEGF between May 2013 and June 2018. LTFU was defined as missing any follow-up visit for
      any interval exceeding 6 months, provided that patients eventually resumed care. Main outcome
      measures include rates and causes of LTFU.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  included treatment-na√Øve patients who had developed PDR in one eye with a best
             corrected visual acuity (BCVA) ranging from 20/22 to 20/69, as determined by the
             Snellen equivalent. Patients were allocated to receive PRP, IVIs of anti-VEGF, or a
             combination of both procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. patients receiving follow-up ophthalmic care for their PDR with or without
             interventions at any other medical care provider during the observation period, as
             declared by the patients at any follow up visit.

          2. patients LTFU who did not resume follow-up until the end of the observation period.

          3. patients needing PPV at first presentation or having additional retinal pathology. 4)
             patients receiving their treatment procedure during December 2017 or having vitreous
             hemorrhage that failed to clear up by June 2018 but still ineligible candidates for
             PPV.
