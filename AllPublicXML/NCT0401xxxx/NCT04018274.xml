  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, 2 way crossover, open-label study of the effect of
      multiple-dose PF 06651600 on single-dose oral contraceptive (OC) pharmacokinetics (PK) in
      healthy female subjects. Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences. A total
      of 28 healthy female subjects (14 in each treatment sequence) will be enrolled in the study.
      Each treatment sequence will consist of 2 periods.
