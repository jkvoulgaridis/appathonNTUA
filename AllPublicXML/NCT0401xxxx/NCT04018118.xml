  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unexplained chronic hypereosinophilia (HE) and hypereosinophilic syndromes (HES) are
      heterogeneous regarding the organ involvements (heart, lungs, skin, .. or none), the
      evolutionary profiles, the response to treatments.

      Underlying mechanisms are largely unknown and may associate genetic predisposing factors
      (germinal ? somatic?), environmental factors (alimentation, tobacco use, hormones,
      infections, ..) The COHESion study aims to study all clinical and biological characteristics
      of HE/HES patients and their evolutionary profiles, with a focus on genetic factors and the
      mechanisms supporting transitory or persistant chronic HE/HES (in absence of any well
      identified extrinsic trigger like drugs, parasitosis, ..)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no data on the natural history of unexplained chronic hypereosinophilia
      (HE) and hypereosinophilic syndromes (HES). Clinical practice shows that HE/SHE patients can
      present 4 evolutionary profiles:

      A. a single flare-up of their disease, with favourable evolution spontaneously or under
      corticosteroid therapy, without further recurrence B. recurrent flare-ups with a variable
      free interval of several months to several years, with or without persistent eosinophilia
      between flare-ups C. a chronic disease requiring the continuation of a substantive treatment
      D. chronic asymptomatic HE for years: the mechanisms involved in the occurrence of possible
      organ damage are unknown

      The primary objective of the study is to describe the frequency of the different clinical
      manifestations during the diagnostic and follow-up of the hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES).
      The primary endpoint is the frequency of the different clinical manifestations and/or organs
      damage related to eosinophilia.
