  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study looks at NNC0247-0829 (a potential new medicine) for weight management in people
      with overweight or obesity. The study looks at how NNC0247-0829 works in the body.
      Participants will either get NNC0247-0829 or placebo (a 'dummy' medicine) - which treatment
      is decided by chance. NNC0247-0829 is an experimental medicine which has not been approved by
      the US FDA. Participants will get either 1 injection or a total of 4 injections (one week
      apart) by a study nurse at the clinic depending on what group they are in. The study will
      last for about 18 months, but participation will last from 11 to 23 weeks. This will depend
      on the group participants are in. Participants will attend 8 to 14 visits at the clinic with
      the study staff. Some participants will have one 16-day, 15-night visit and one 2-day,
      1-night visit. Others will have two 2-day, 1-night visits. At all visits except one,
      participants will have blood tests and other checks. They will be asked about their health,
      medical history and habits including mental health questionnaires.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female not of childbearing potential (CBP) or male, aged 18-60 years (both inclusive)
             at the time of signing informed consent.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 27.0 and 34.9 kg/m^2 (both inclusive) in SD cohorts and
             between 27.0 and 39.9 kg/m^2 (both inclusive) in MD cohorts at screening. Overweight
             or obesity should be due to excess adipose tissue, as judged by the investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Male subject who is not surgically sterilised (vasectomised) and is sexually active
             with female partner of childbearing potential in the absence of highly effective
             contraception.

          -  Any disorder, which in the investigator's opinion might jeopardise subject's safety,
             evaluation of results, or compliance with the protocol.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription products, including herbal products and
             non-routine vitamins, within 14 days prior to screening. Mild painkillers are
             permitted until 24h prior to screening.
