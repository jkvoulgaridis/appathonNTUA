      Single Center, open label, Phase I-II trial designed to test the safety and efficacy of the
      combination of Ataluren and Pembrolizumab for the treatment of metastatic mismatch repair
      deficient and proficient colorectal adenocarcinoma and metastatic mismatch repair deficient
      endometrial carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In controlling tumor outgrowth an intact immune surveillance is very important. PD-1
      receptor-ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress this immune
      control.

      Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody designed to
      directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands and is registered for the
      treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma of locally advanced or metastatic
      NSCLC in adults. In an earlier study it's effect has been shown in mismatch repair deficient
      tumors.

      Ataluren is designed to allow the protein making apparatus (the ribosome) in cells to skip
      over a premature stop codon (PTC), allowing the cells to translate the sequence downstream of
      a premature termination codon (PTC) in mRNA transcripts. This may result in the translation
      of additional out-of-frame code, which is available in abundance in dMMR tumors. We argue
      that this may result in new target peptides for the immune-system to recognize cancer cells.

      The investigators hypothesize that the formation of these peptides by Ataluren can enhance
      the effect of Pembrolizumab anti-PD1 therapy.

      Therefore the investigators designed a Single Center, open label, Phase I-II trial designed
      to test the safety and efficacy of the combination of Ataluren and Pembrolizumab for the
      treatment of metastatic mismatch repair deficient and proficient colorectal adenocarcinoma
      and metastatic mismatch repair deficient endometrial carcinoma.

    <intervention_model_description>In the phase-1 part of the study 2-4 groups of 3 patients each are treated with pembrolizumab 200mg i.v. q3w but with increasing ataluren doses (i.e. group1 25%, group2 50% and group3 100% of 10-10-20mg/kg). These can be either pMMR mCRC, dMMR mCRC or dMMR EC patients. The reported toxicity in phase-1 will be used to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination, that will determine the ataluren dose in phase-2.
In the phase-2 part of the study a dMMR group (cohort A, 20 patients either CRC of EC) and a pMMR group (cohort B, 15 CRC patients) will be treated with pembrolizumab 200mg i.v. q3w combined with ataluren t.i.d. at the MTD defined in phase-1.

             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
