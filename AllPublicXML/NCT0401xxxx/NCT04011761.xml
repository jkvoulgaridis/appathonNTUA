  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We have recently developed an artificial intelligence (AI) framework to diagnose common
      pediatric diseases. This randomized controlled clinical trial aims to investigate the effects
      of expert arbitration on clinical outcomes in the situation where the AI-based diagnosis
      differs from the diagnosis made by pediatricians.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on the historical clinical data of more than 1 million pediatric outpatients in the
      Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, an AI diagnostic framework has recently been
      developed for common pediatric diseases [Liang H et al. evaluation and accurate diagnosis of
      pediatric disease using artificial intelligence. Nat Med. 2019;25(3):433-8]. This AI
      framework utilizes predefined schema to extract informative clinical data from free text and
      reaches clinical diagnoses by hypothetico-deductive reasoning. In internal validation, the AI
      system showed accuracy rates ranging from 0.85 for gastrointestinal disease to 0.98 for
      neuropsychiatric disorders, suggesting that it might be a promising assisting diagnostic tool
      in clinical practice. However, there is a lack of evidence-based strategy on how to handle
      the scenarios where the AI-based diagnosis and the diagnosis made by pediatricians are
      discordant. It is legitimate to assume that diseases with discordant diagnoses present more
      similar clinical features; in this case it is necessary to introduce an extra arbitrator for
      differential and decisive diagnosis. Therefore, we conduct this randomized controlled trial
      to: 1) compare the accuracy of the two diagnostic modes in a real-world clinical setting
      where the AI-based diagnosis and the diagnosis made by pediatricians are discordant by
      introducing an expert arbitrator; and 2) look further into the change of clinical outcomes
      (hospital revisit and hospitalization in the next 3 months after initial visit; average total
      outpatient cost) due to introduction of the expert arbitrator. Please note that although the
      aforementioned AI framework was designed for diagnosis of a wide range of diseases, this
      clinical trial is limited to outpatients encountered in three specialty clinics, i.e.
      respirology, gastroenterology, and genito-urology. The reason for this selection is that the
      discordant diagnoses are assumed to be more common for these two specialties according to the
      internal validation result.
