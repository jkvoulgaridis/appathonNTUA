    <textblock>
      Introduction: The patellofemoral pain syndrome (SPF) is one of the most frequent pathologies
      generated by the knee joint. Conservative treatment with physiotherapy exercises reduces pain
      and improves functional capacity in the short and medium term. The purpose of this study was
      to evaluate the therapeutic effect of combining a program of muscle strengthening exercises
      for the core, hip and knee on anterior knee pain in non-athletic patients with SPF. Materials
      and methods: Randomized controlled trial clinical trial, designed to evaluate the effect of
      two muscle strengthening programs in people with SPF (Group A: exercises for core, hip and
      knee, Group B: exercises for hip and knee), during eight weeks of intervention in people
      between 15 and 40 years of age, with a clinical diagnosis of SPF, with a level of mild to
      moderate physical activity. The Kujala test was used to measure pain and quality of life.

      Experimental study: controlled clinical trial, designed to evaluate the effect of two muscle
      strengthening programs in people with patellofemoral pain syndrome.

      Young adults between 15 and 40 years old, with clinical diagnosis of patellofemoral pain
      syndrome (by means of Computerized Axial Tomography and medical concept of a specialist
      Orthopedist in knee), in the last three years, non-athletes with a level of physical activity
      between mild and moderate, affiliated to the health care institution CAFAM (Caja de
      Compensación Familiar is a compensation fund of Colombia that has pharmacies, hotels,
      Convention Center, Recreation Club, School, among others and offers Subsidy Services,
      Credits, Insurance, Tourism, Health, Education, Housing).

      All the procedures developed within the study had as a reference the standards of good
      clinical practice and ethical principles for medical research in humans. The participants
      signed the informed consent where they accepted their participation in the present study.

      The participants were randomized with the SNOSE (sequentially numbered, opaque sealed
      envelopes) method to two protocols of muscular strengthening (Group A: Exercises for core,
      hip and knee and Group B: Exercises for Hip and Knee).

    <masking_description>SNOSE: Sequentially Numbered, Opaque Sealed Envelopes. The forty subjects of the experimental procedure were assigned to the two intervention groups from three steps: 1. A paper / charcoal sheet was placed on an Assignation paper marked with Group A or Group B, 2. Then they were lined with aluminum foil, also rectangular and 3. They were finally inserted in a white envelope which was sealed with glue. Forty of these envelopes were made, twenty for Group A and the other half for Group B, after that, they were mixed in a cardboard box and then enumerated one by one at random until the 40 envelopes were completed. Each envelope was delivered in order of numbering to each of the patients who were entering the treatment. The investigator directed the strengthening program and another Physical Therapist addressed the tests.</masking_description>
