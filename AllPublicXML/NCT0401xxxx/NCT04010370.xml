  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, an index based on the oral insulin sensitivity index with glucose (OGIS) has been
      proposed in combination with anthropometric variables, called PREDIcted M (PREDIM), however,
      there is no evidence of the correlation of this with respect to the various indices (McAuley,
      Belfiore, Cederholm, Avignon, Matsuda, Gutt, Stumvoll) in healthy patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Analytical cross-sectional study with 25 healthy patients of both genders (male and female)
      from 30 to 60 years old, residents of the metropolitan area of Guadalajara.

      They will be operated on for a 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test. The insulin sensitivity
      will be calculated with the PREDIM, Matsuda, McAuley, Belfiore, Cederholm, Avignon, Stumvoll
      and Gutt indexes.

      This protocol is already approved by the local ethics committee and written informed consent
      it's going to be obtained from all volunteers.

      The statistical analysis will be presented with measures of central tendency and dispersion,
      mean and standard deviation. The nominal variables in numbers and percentages. The
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test will be performed to determine if the variables follow a normal
      distribution. To correlate the formulas used to evaluate the sensitivity of fasting insulin
      with the PREDIcted M (PREDIM) technique, the Pearson or Spearman correlation will be used
      according to the distribution.

    <description>The patient will be cited at 8:00 AM with a minimum of 8 hours of fasting. The weight, height, waist circumference and blood pressure will be taken. Afterwards, a catheter will be placed for the venous blood sample and the biochemical determination of fasting glucose, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, VLDL, triglycerides and assessment of A1C will be carried out. You will be tested for oral glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, for which you will be given a 75-g dose of glucose in water by orally. After the ingestion of the glucose solution, the venous blood sample will be at times 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes.</description>
