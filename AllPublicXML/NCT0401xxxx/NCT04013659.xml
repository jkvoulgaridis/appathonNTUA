  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Considering the lack of studies related to the violet LED light (405-410nm), applied to tooth
      whitening, as well as the lack of protocols for its use, this study aims to evaluate if
      bleaching gel renewal during dental office whitening associated with Violet LED light
      interferes with final color result and postoperative sensitivity in a randomized, blinded,
      split-mouth study. Thirty-three volunteers will be selected to participate in the study (n =
      33), and the study groups will be: G1 (Permanence of the Whitening Gel on the tooth enamel
      for 15 minutes) and G2 (3 Whitening Gel renewal every 5 minutes - Total of 15 minutes). In
      both G1 and G2, teeth will be illuminated with the Violet LED (405-410nm). In the same
      patient the two treatments (G1 and G2) will be performed, with a split-mouth protocol. The
      primary outcome will be immediate and mediated color change, quantitatively assessed by
      colorimetric (color scale) and spectrophotometry tests. Dental sensitivity will also be
      evaluated during and after tooth whitening using the VAS pain scale. There will be 3
      whitening sessions with a 7-day interval between them. The alteration of color and presence
      of sensitivity will also be evaluated at the times of 14 days and 2 months after the
      whitening ends. A gel containing 35% hydrogen peroxide will be used. The final color
      evaluator and responsible for interviewing the patient about the sensitivity will be blind as
      to which treatment was applied on each side of the patient's arcade.
