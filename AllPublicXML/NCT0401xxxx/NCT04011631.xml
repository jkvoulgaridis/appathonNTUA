  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the iD-System™, One-handed Disposable
      Internal Defibrillation System The device is made for manual defibrillation during
      intra-thoracic procedure, by transferring a shock from a defibrillation device to the
      patient's heart, in combination with the iD-Electrode. The device will be used when the
      patient reaches a stage of ventricular fibrillation or rapid ventricular tachycardia during
      cardiac surgery.

      The main aim is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the iD-System™, One-handed Disposable
      Internal Defibrillation System The device is made for manual defibrillation during
      intra-thoracic procedure, by transferring a shock from a defibrillation device to the
      patient's heart, in combination with the iD-Electrode. The device will be used when the
      patient reaches a stage of ventricular fibrillation or rapid ventricular tachycardia during
      cardiac surgery.

      In case ventricular fibrillation occurs and the iD-system is not effective to restore the
      sinus trythm, the conventional approach with use of the two paddels spoons will be performed
      immediately.

      the following will be assessed:

        -  Ease of use of the device

        -  Safety of the device

        -  Efficacy of the device

    <measure>Safety of the iD-System as assessed by skin symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>During intra-thoracic procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Safety of the iD-system will be evaluated to assess if there are skin symptoms to the electrode by confirming if irritation is visible on the back of the patient after removal of the iD elektrode or not. For the more subjects the irritation will be visible, the worse will be the safety of the iD-elektrode.</description>

    <measure>Safety of the iD-System as assessed by troponin measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>During intra-thoracic procedure till 36 hours post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Safety of the iD-system will be evaluated via troponine measurement to assess myocardial injury. Troponine will be measured at 4, 8, 16, 24 and 36 hours post-surgery and will be reported in ng/L. A significant increase of the troponine value during these different time points indicates myocardial injury. The investigator will evaluate every case to assess if it is an Adverse Event or not.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of the iD-System as assessed via investigator questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>During intra-thoracic procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy of the the iD-System will be evaluated to assess a successful restoration of the sinus rythm by counting the number of failed attempts to defibrillate which were attributable to device malfunction. This will be captured by a questionnaire, to be completed by the investigator after the surgery. A maximum of 4 shocks can be applied. If the normal arterial hearth rhythm cannot be restored after 4 shocks with the iD-System, conversion to the conventional system occurs.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ease of use of the iD-System as assessed via investigator questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>During intra-thoracic procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Ease of use of the iD-System will be evaluated by a questionnaire, to be completed after the procedure. The following items will be assessed:
adherence of the iD-Electrode to the patient's back
positioning of the iD-Padde for maximal contact with the heart
working length of the following cables: iD-Electrode,iD-Paddle and the iD-SMART Cable
The questionnaire will consist of 16 questions, each addressing a specific topic of the ease of use, to be scored by the investigator from 1 to 5.
1= very poor, 2= poor, 3= neutral, 4= sufficient, 5= excellent
The higher the total score, the better the outcome of the 'ease of use' evaluation.</description>

    <description>When ventricular fibrillation of ventricular tachycardia occurs during surgery, the iD-Paddle will be applied directly to the heart. A maximum of 4 shocks are delivered to the heart to restore normal sinus rhythm. If 4 shocks are not successful standard operating procedure will be enable conform hospital protocol.</description>
