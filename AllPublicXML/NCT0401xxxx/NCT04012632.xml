  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There was a worldwide early trend in girls'age for puberty onset. The timing of puberty onset
      varies greatly among individuals, and much of this variation is modulated by genetic factors.
      This study was designed to explored the association of polymorphisms in KISS1/GPR54 pathway
      genes and the risk of early puberty in Chinese Han girls.
