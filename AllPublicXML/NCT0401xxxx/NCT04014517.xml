  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional randomized ope-label two-arm trial on the peri-operative use of
      immunonutrition in Crohn's Disease (CD) patients undergoing colorectal elective surgery.The
      aim of the trial is to assess the effectiveness of immunonutrition therapy in decreasing the
      rate of post-operative infective complications and 6 months endoscopic disease recurrence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's Disease (CD) patients undergoing abdominal surgery are at high risk to develop
      post-operative surgical and medical infective complications. Infective complications affect
      almost 24% of patients. Post-surgical disease recurrence afflicts 35-85% of CD patients in
      the first year after surgery. Immunonutrition has been successfully applied to surgical
      patients in several randomized trials, demonstrating a decreased rate of post-operative
      infective complications. The aim of the study is to compare the incidence of surgical and
      medical post-operative infective complications and six months endoscopic and clinical disease
      recurrence (DR) in CD patients receiving immunonutrition in the peri-operative setting
      compared to patients treated as for standard of care.

    <time_frame>6 months post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Endoscopic recurrence will be evaluated through colonoscopy with or without biopsies and Rutgeert score. Rutgeert score is an endoscopic risk score intended to predict disease recurrence: it is calculated depending on the number and type of intestinal lesions and consists of five level of disease recurrence risk, from 0 (endoscopic remission) to 4 (advanced disease recurrence).</description>

    <measure>6 months nutritional status</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Nutritional status will be evaluated through the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST). MUST consists of three different levels, generating a risk predictor ranging from 0 (low risk) to 2 (high risk), considering the calculated Body Mass Index (BMI), the unintentional weight loss and the pathological conditions of the patient.</description>
