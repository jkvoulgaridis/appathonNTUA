  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-extubation dysphagia (PED) recently became a growing concern as a major risk factor for
      extubation failure and significant contributor to poor patient outcomes with prevalence rates
      ranging from 12% to 69%, being highest in neurological patients (93%).

      Pharyngeal electrical stimulation (PES) has been shown to improve airway safety and
      swallowing function tracheostomized stroke patients, thereby enhancing decannulation in this
      patient cohort.

      In the present study the investigators evaluate whether PES is safe, feasible and effective
      in orotracheal intubated stroke patients at high risk of extubation failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are common procedures for critically ill
      stroke patients. Although necessary and life-saving, timely extubation after ventilator
      weaning is desirable, because patients with delayed extubation experience higher pneumonia
      rate, increased need for tracheostomy, longer length of stay on the intensive care unit and
      higher mortality. On the other hand, extubation failure (EF) and subsequent need for emergent
      re-intubation is associated with similar sequelae.

      Post-extubation dysphagia (PED) became a growing concern as a major risk factor for EF and
      significant contributor to poor patient outcomes with prevalence rates ranging from 12% to
      69%, being highest in neurological patients (93%). Damage to the central swallowing network
      itself is the primary cause of PED in cerebrovascular disease, which constitutes the leading
      diagnosis on neuro-ICUs. Further mechanisms include pharyngolaryngeal lesions caused by the
      tube, critical illness neuropathy and myopathy leading to muscle weakness and dyscoordination
      of breathing and swallowing, and an impaired sensation due to sedation, mucosal damage, or
      the underlying critical illness itself. As a consequence reintubation rates in neurological
      collectives are as high as 20 to 40%.

      Pharyngeal electrical stimulation (PES) has been shown to improve airway safety and
      swallowing function tracheostomized stroke patients, thereby enhancing decannulation in this
      patient cohort.

      In the present study the investigators evaluate whether PES is safe, feasible and effective
      in orotracheal intubated stroke patients at high risk of extubation failure.
