  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairments have severe impact on functional recovery and quality of life after
      stroke. Current evidence indicated that combining exercise and cognitive training may provide
      additional benefits on cognition in stroke. This study aims to investigate the effects and
      mechanisms of two combined methods of computer-based cognitive training with physical
      exercise in stroke patients with cognitive impairments.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment is not uncommon after stroke. Stroke patients with cognitive decline may
      experience difficulties in learning motor tasks, functional disability, and poor quality of
      life. Interventions for cognitive impairment remain under development and pharmaceutical
      intervention is not yet optimal at present. Targeted cognitive treatments or aerobic exercise
      training provided potential benefits to enhance cognitive function for stroke patients with
      cognitive decline. Recent studies demonstrate that combining exercise and cognitive training
      may provide additional benefits on cognition than single type of training. However, physical
      exercise training and cognitive-based intervention can be combined either sequentially or
      simultaneously. It remains unclear whether the two combination methods induce similar or
      differential effects in brain plasticity, physiological modulation, and behavioral outcomes
      for individuals with stroke. It is important to examine the potential effects, comparative
      effects and the neural mechanism of two combined interventions that can possibly maximize
      benefits for stroke survivors with cognitive impairments.

      The purposes of the present study are to: (1) examine and compare the effects of two combined
      interventions on brain plasticity, physiological biomarkers and behavioral outcomes,
      including cognitive, physical, and daily functions, and quality of life, from pre- to
      post-training; (2) understand the neural mechanisms of cognitive recovery following two
      combined interventions using the electroencephalography (EEG); (3) examine the long-term
      benefits following the two combined interventions; (4) to identify the correlations between
      brain activity, biomarkers and behavioral measures.

Two cognitive secondary tasks will be performed by the participants: (1) arithmetic task: participants will be asked to perform serial subtractions by 7 starting from 100 or random two-digit numbers (e.g., Baetens et al., 2013); (2) tone discrimination task: participants will be presented a number of low and high-pitched tones and they will respond to either the high or low-pitched tones during the trial. Both cognitive task performances will be recorded and the results will be compared to single cognitive task performance. In addition to the cognitive dual-task, participants will perform a motor task (e.g., holding a cup of water) while walking.</description>
