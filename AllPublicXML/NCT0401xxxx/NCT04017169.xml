    <textblock>
      Background No reflow phenomenon is described in up to 65% of patients undergoing primary
      percutaneous coronary intervention for ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). It is
      known to be associated with worse outcomes but predictors of no reflow are not clearly
      described.

      Objectives A single centre case-control observational study of patients presenting with acute
      myocardial infarction appropriate for PPCI comparing baseline clinical, biochemical and
      angiographic characteristics between patients with no reflow phenomenon and those without.
      Aiming to establish incidence for the UK population.

      Secondary outcomes will be to gain further insight into those presenting with STEMI for PPCI
      and develop a risk model to guide management and clinical outcomes of patients to 30days.

      Methods This study will prospectively recruit all consecutive patients attending a single
      centre for primary percutaneous coronary intervention for STEMI. Angiographic assessment of
      the recanalised epicardial vessel will be used to diagnose no reflow (reduced TIMI flow or
      blush grade). Baseline demographic, angiographic and biochemical characteristics and outcomes
      at 30days for reflow and no reflow cohorts will be statistically assessed and compared with
      logistic regression.

To define no reflow requires:
• Angiographic evidence of reopening of occluded coronary artery and successful stent placement with no evidence of flow-limiting residual stenosis (&lt;50%), dissection, vessel spasm, or thrombus burden
and
Angiographic documentation of a TIMI flow grade ≤II, or
A TIMI flow grade III with a myocardial perfusion grade 0 or I, at least 10 min after the end of PCI procedure.</description>

        The cohort is defined as all patients attending with ST elevation myocardial infarction
        undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Cases are those subjects who
        suffered no reflow phenomenon, with control comparators those that had TIMI III flow and
        grade III myocardial blush post procedure.
