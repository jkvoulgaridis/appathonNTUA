  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      That is a need for intervention to promote hearing aid use among adult patients with hearing
      aids. The aim of the present study was, for the first time, to evaluate the efficacy of the
      I-PLAN intervention to promote hearing aid use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The I-PLAN is a behaviour change theory-based intervention to promote hearing aid use. It
      consists of; 1. information on consequences of using and not using a hearing aid, 2. a
      physical prompt as a reminder to hearing aid use and 3. a behavioural plan to use a hearing
      aid. The aim of this study was to test efficacy of the I-PLAN intervention, delivered
      face-to-face by study audiologists. 160 first-time hearing aid users were recruited at the
      hearing aid fitting appointment. Adult patients were allocated either to the I-PLAN group or
      Standard Care group. Adult patients were allocated to the groups based on the clinic
      schedules of study audiologists.
