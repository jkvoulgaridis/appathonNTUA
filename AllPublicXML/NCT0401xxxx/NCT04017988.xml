  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was 8 weeks, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human trial. 120
      subjects were randomly divided into ethanol extracts of Porphyra tenera(PTE10) group or
      placebo group. The investigators measure Natural Killer cell activity, Cytokines(IL-2, IL-6,
      IL-12, IFN-γ, TNF-α), questionnaire scores of upper airway infection.

    <measure>Changes of Natural Killer cell activity</measure>
    <time_frame>0 week, 8 week</time_frame>
    <description>Natural Killer cell activity was measured in study baseline and 8 week. A ratio of effector cell and target cell was 50:1, 25:1, 12.5:1.

    <measure>Changes of Cytokines</measure>
    <time_frame>0 week, 8 week</time_frame>
    <description>For blood Cytokines analysis, collect 3 ml of blood in one SST tube for 5 ml, leave at room temperature for 30 minutes for clotting, after then centrifuge at 3000 rpm (or 2000 xg) for 10 minutes.
Inspection item were IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, IFN-γ, TNF-α.</description>

    <measure>Changes of Upper respiratory infection questionnaire score</measure>
    <time_frame>0 week, 4 week, 8 week</time_frame>
    <description>The upper respiratory infection questionnaire will investigate the occurrence of symptoms of upper respiratory infections (or symptoms), the score by symptom, the duration (days), and survey on the day of visit (1st, 2nd and 3rd visits).
The questionnaire items were classified into three groups according to whether or not the symptoms of upper respiratory infections (or symptoms) occurrence (yes or no), the types of symptoms (sore throat, rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, sneezing, hoarseness, myalgia, earache, fever, headache, cough, sputum, dyspnea, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting)and symptoms level (0 if no symptoms, 1 if slightly, 2 if normal, 3 severe).</description>
