  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Labour pain can be intensified for labour inductions and women undergoing inductions often
      have earlier and more frequent requests for analgesia. Current evidence suggests that
      epidural analgesia effectively manages pain in labour, but may give rise to adverse effects
      for both the mother and neonate. Opioids are often added to epidurals to improve the quality
      of analgesia. Despite reassuring findings regarding epidural opioids, other investigators
      have found an association between epidural opioids and neonatal respiratory distress, lower
      Neurological and Adaptive Capacity scores, and reduced rates of breastfeeding. Given the
      heightened implications for the mother and neonate in situations requiring induction of
      labour, the desire for a positive outcome whilst still providing adequate maternal analgesia
      is paramount.

      This study thus aims to investigate whether a preliminary epidural Fentanyl bolus at the
      initiation of the epidural may help to improve analgesia for women undergoing labour
      inductions for post-term pregnancy in a safe manner. Importantly, the main rationale of this
      proposed practice being that by achieving adequate epidural analgesia earlier in the labour
      induction, this may lead to better pain control overall and less overall requirements for
      epidural PCEA boluses and epidural &quot;top-ups&quot; as the induction progresses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pain felt during labour is influenced by many physiological and psychosocial factors and
      often requires some form of relief. Pain can be intensified for labour inductions as the
      body's natural pain-relieving endorphins are not readily released in response to the
      increasingly strong and painful uterine contractions- leading to earlier and more frequent
      requests for analgesia. Induced labour has also been reported as being significantly longer
      than spontaneous labour. Current evidence suggests that epidural, combined spinal epidural
      and inhaled analgesia effectively manage pain in labour, but may give rise to adverse effects
      for both the mother and neonate. Despite this, epidural analgesia is considered the gold
      standard in the treatment of labor pain and has a role in labour inductions. Opioids are
      often added to epidurals to improve the quality of analgesia because of their faster onset
      and superior pain relief. When combined with opioids, lower concentrations of local
      anesthetic are needed. Such combinations provide adequate analgesic effect while allowing the
      parturient to maintain maximal motor function.

      In studies assessing the safety and efficacy of labour analgesia, neonatal outcome is a
      primary concern and the use of opioids for labour analgesia is controversial because of the
      potentially negative effects on neonates. Common indicators of poor neonatal outcomes include
      a lower Apgar score, a lower Neurological and Adaptive Capacity Score (NACS), and a lower
      umbilical artery or vein pH value.

      Fentanyl is the most widely investigated adjuncts to epidural local anesthetics. Various RCTs
      comparing epidural local anesthetics with and without fentanyl have found no significant
      differences in neonatal Apgar scores at one and five minutes between the groups. A recent
      meta-analysis of twenty-one RCTs involving epidural Fentanyl and Sufentanil concluded that
      there was no difference in the incidence of Apgar scores &lt; 7 at one and five minutes, no
      significant differences in the NACS at two hours and at 24 hours, and no significant
      differences were found in umbilical cord artery pH between the epidural opioid and control
      groups. This meta-analysis concluded that the common doses of Fentanyl (total dose of 100-500
      mcg) and Sufentanil (total dose of 7.5-30 mcg) used with an epidural/spinal technique are
      safe for neonates up to 24 hours after delivery. Despite reassuring findings regarding
      epidural opioids, other investigators have found an association between epidural opioids and
      neonatal respiratory distress and the use of epidural fentanyl has been associated with a
      NACS that failed to improve by 24 hours in one study. Furthermore, the use of epidural
      opioids was associated with reduced rates of breastfeeding in some observational studies, but
      evidence is unclear and debated.

      Given the heightened implications for the mother and neonate in situations requiring
      induction of labour, the desire for a positive outcome whilst still providing adequate
      maternal analgesia is paramount. This study thus aims to investigate whether a preliminary
      epidural Fentanyl bolus at the initiation of the epidural may help to improve analgesia for
      women undergoing labour inductions for post-term pregnancy in a safe manner. Importantly, the
      main rationale of this proposed practice being that by achieving adequate epidural analgesia
      earlier in the labour induction, this may lead to better pain control overall and less
      overall requirements for epidural PCEA boluses and epidural &quot;top-ups&quot; as the induction
      progresses.

    <measure>Neonatal well-being: Presence or Absence of Fetal Heart Tracing Abnormalities</measure>
    <time_frame>Fetal Heart Tracing abnormalities will be assessed and summed following fetal delivery and once chart documents/fetal heart tracing strips are all available. The aim will be to collect this data within 24 hours of fetal delivery via chart review.</time_frame>
    <description>Neonatal well-being will be assessed by monitoring for concerns charted about Fetal Heart Tracings. Specifically, patient charts will be reviewed to assess for concerns regarding early decelerations, late decelerations, and variable decelerations. The amount of decelerations will also be documented (if applicable).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neonatal well-being: Apgar scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Apgar scores will be recorded at 1 minute following fetal delivery and at 5 minutes following fetal delivery. The aim will be to collect this data within 24 hours of fetal delivery via chart review.</time_frame>
    <description>Neonatal well-being will be assessed by recording Apgar scores at 1 minute following fetal delivery, and at 5 minutes following fetal delivery. The maximum and most reassuring Apgar score is 10 which indicates a neonate that is active, has a heart rate over 100 beats per minute, has a prompt response to stimulation, appears pink/well oxygenated and has a vigorous cry. In general, Apgar scores of 7 or higher are typically considered normal for a neonate and neonates with scores above 7 are unlikely to require resuscitative intervention.
Any Apgar score below 7 is abnormal and should alert the care team of the possible need for resuscitative intervention. A score of 4-6 is below normal and means the neonate will likely need medical intervention or resuscitation. Apgar scores of 1-3 are critically low and indicative of a need for resuscitative intervention and intensive care.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neonatal well-being: Umbilical artery pH value</measure>
    <time_frame>Neonatal well-being will be assessed by recording the umbilical artery pH lab value at the time of fetal delivery/birth. The aim will be to collect this data within 24 hours of fetal delivery via chart review.</time_frame>
    <description>Neonatal well-being will be assessed by recording and documenting the umbilical artery vein pH lab value drawn at the time of fetal delivery/birth. A umbilical artery pH value &lt; 7.0 will be considered as abnormal and indicative of pathologic fetal acidemia.</description>
