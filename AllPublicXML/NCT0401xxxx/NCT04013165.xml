      Investigators aimed to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of a village-based
      multilevel intervention for late-life depression. Two small rural villages in rural South
      Korea were selected as the intervention group and active control. All older adults living in
      the two villages were included in the intervention program or received standard CMHS care,
      and the effectiveness of the program was examined using representative samples from both
      groups.

      OBJECTIVES: To examine the feasibility and effectiveness of a village-based multilevel
      intervention for late-life depression, focusing on strengthening the autonomy of
      village-dwellers with help from the community mental health service (CMHS).

      DESIGN: A community-based randomized trial with participants (all village-dwellers) assigned
      to two parallel programs: intervention program or the CMHS's usual care.

      SETTING: Two small villages in a rural area of South Korea

      PARTICIPANTS: All older adults (aged â‰¥65 years) living in the two villages were included in
      the intervention or the CMHS's usual care, and the effectiveness of the program was examined
      using representative samples who were age- and sex-stratified randomly selected from both
      groups.

      INTERVENTION: A 12-week intervention was comprised of individual-based risk-stratified case
      management and group-based activities.

      MEASUREMENTS: The Korean version of Geriatric Depression Scale-Short form (SGDS-K) was used
      as the primary outcome while depressive episodes, suicidal ideation/plans/attempts, social
      network, functional status, and global cognitive function were measured as secondary
      outcomes.

    <description>Individual-based case management was conducted both by healthy community dwellers (local committee) and Community Mental Health Service (CMHS) team based on risk-stratification for depression in older adults. Local committee-guided care was performed after matching a healthy dweller with 4-5 older neighbors included in risk groups. They visited the matched older individuals as often as possible at least once a week using a mood sticker. The CMHS team also conducted a separate case management for older adults with risk-stratified protocols; the higher the risk of suicide, the more intensive was the management, which could include frequent face-to-face visits. High-risk individuals were also referred to the psychiatric service, if deemed necessary.
Group-based program was comprised of weekly eight sessions, which were mainly consisted of programs enhancing interpersonal network and group cohesion, and were open to all community-dwelling older adults.</description>
