  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Few studies evaluate the outcomes beyond 1 year follow up for gingival recessions treatments
      using the tunnel technique in combination with connective tissue graft. The aim of this
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to compare the 4-year outcomes of the CAF versus the
      pouch/tunnel (TUN) technique both associated with CTG.

    <measure>Plaque Index Change</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months and 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>The plaque accumulation is assessed at baseline, 6 months and 4 years follow-up visits using a 0-1 scoring system, 0 being the the highest value, 1 being the lowest result (0 =No detectible plaque ; 1 = Plaque can be seen by the naked eye)</description>

    <measure>Bleeding on probing score change</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months and 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>The bleeding tendency is assessed at baseline, 6 months and 4 years follow-up visits as : 0 No bleeding when a periodontal probe is passed along the gingival margin adjacent to the implant; 1 Isolated bleeding spots visible ; 2 Blood forms a confluent red line on the margin; 3 Heavy or profuse bleeding.</description>

    <measure>PES Assessment change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months and 4 years</time_frame>

    <measure>Patient-related esthetic outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>(Fürhauser et al., 2005). Patient-related esthetic outcomes were also recorded in a questionnaire using a 0-14 graduated scale (0 being the worst and 14 the best value).</description>

    <description>The patient received 600 mg of ibuprofen (paracetamol 1 g in case of allergy) prior to surgery, and chlorhexidine mouthwash 0.2% was provided for 2 min. Patients received local anaesthesia at the donor and recession sites (articaine hydrochloride 7200 mg/1.8 ml, adrenalin 1800 mcg/1.8 ml). CTG harvesting was performed prior to the preparation of the reception site to avoid any bias. The graft dimension was calculated according to the recession dimensions; a minimum of 3 mm of the graft was submerged mesially, distally and apically. The CTG was harvested from the palate with single edge incision and sutured with 4.0 silk. The patient was subsequently assigned randomly to the control (CAF+CTG) or the test group (TUN+CTG).</description>
