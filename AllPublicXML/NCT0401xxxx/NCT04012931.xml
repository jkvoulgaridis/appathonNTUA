  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the steady state pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      rilpivirine (RPV) and determine the appropriate dose of RPV in combination with other
      antiretrovirals (ARVs) in participants aged greater than or equal to 2 to less than 12 years
      and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of RPV in combination with other ARVs in
      participants of same age group over a 48-week treatment period with primary endpoint at Week
      24.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are routinely treated
      with combinations of multiple drugs which reduces HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) to
      undetectable levels in a substantial proportion of participants and counteracts the risk of
      viral resistance development. RPV is a potent non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor
      (NNRTI) with in vitro activity against wild type (WT) HIV-1 and against NNRTI-resistant HIV-1
      mutants. A medical need still exists for the development of age/weight appropriate
      formulations in children less than (&lt;) 12 years of age. In this study, participants will
      switch to RPV plus other ARVs. The primary analysis will be performed at Week 24. A
      participant will be considered to have completed the study if he or she has completed
      assessments at Week 48 of the study intervention phase. The total study duration for each
      participant, including screening and study intervention phases, will be approximately 54
      weeks. Key efficacy assessments include determination of plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load and
      measurement of CD4+ cell count. Key safety assessments will include the monitoring of
      (serious) adverse events ([S]AEs) and HIV-related events, clinical laboratory tests,
      cardiovascular safety monitoring (vital signs and 12 lead electrocardiogram [ECGs]), and
      physical examination (including growth).
