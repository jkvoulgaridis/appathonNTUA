      The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of partial pulpotomy treatment using MTA
      and Er,Cr:YSGG + MTA in permanent immature molar teeth with deep dentin caries. The study was
      performed in children aged between 6-15 who had at least one deep dentine caries in permanent
      immature molar tooth. The patients' therapies were completed in Kırıkkale University, Faculty
      of Dentistry, Department of Pediatric Dentisry. A total of 90 teeth (caries exposed) were
      included in the study. According to the treatment, the teeth were randomly divided into two
      groups: 1. MTA group (n=45), 2. Laser+MTA group (n=45). In the MTA group, after removing
      caries, MTA was applied to the exposed area on the pulp following bleeding control with 5.25%
      NaOCl. In the same session, the tooth was restored with resin modified glass ionomer cement
      and composite resin. In the laser+MTA group, the treatment procedures were the same as the
      MTA group, and before the MTA condensation, Er, Cr: YSGG laser was applied to the exposure
      area after bleeding control to provide biostimulation. Patients were called for followup
      appointments at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment and control radiographs were taken.
