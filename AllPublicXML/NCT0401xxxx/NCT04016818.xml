  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study of a novel, &quot;breast-dedicated&quot; positron emission tomography (PET)
      camera with 1 millimeter spatial resolution. The main goal of the study is for the personnel
      to understand practical and logistical issues with using the camera in the clinic

      Primary Objective To obtain initial experience using the novel, breast-dedicated PET camera
      design in the breast imaging clinic.

      Secondary Objectives To understand, given the 10-fold higher sensitivity of this novel
      camera, how low we can go with administered tracer dose, and, given the &gt;100-fold better
      volumetric spatial resolution, understand the achievable image quality.

    <description>Feasibility of the pilot breast-dedicated PET camera will be assessed on the basis of whether acceptable images are obtained. Images will be assessed and graded as 1 of 3 quality ratings: excellent, good, and poor. The outcome will be reported as the number of images that are excellent, good, and poor, a number without dispersion.</description>
