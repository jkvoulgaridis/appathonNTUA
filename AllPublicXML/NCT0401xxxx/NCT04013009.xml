    <textblock>
      Incisional hernias after laparotomy are associated with significant morbidity and increased
      costs. Research is focused on development of new techniques to prevent incisional hernia.
      Little is known about application of this evidence in daily practice. Therefore, a survey was
      performed among Dutch surgeons.

      Incisional hernias after laparotomy are associated with significant morbidity and increased
      costs. Research is focused on development of new techniques to prevent incisional hernia.
      Little is known about application of this evidence in daily practice. Therefore, a survey was
      performed among Dutch surgeons.

      All members of the Dutch Surgical Society were invited to participate in a 24-question online
      survey on techniques and materials used for abdominal wall closure after midline laparotomy.
      Subgroup analysis based on surgical subspecialty, hospital and experience was performed.
