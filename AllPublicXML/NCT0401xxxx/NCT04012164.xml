      This study will evaluate the overlap between the intestinal microbiome and virome of wild and
      domesticated animals and human beings living in close proximity in three sites along an
      ecotone (ecological gradient) in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

    <textblock>
      The MICROTONE study sheds light on zoonotic disease emergence by examining social and
      ecological pathways facilitating microbial and viral flows between people and selected wild
      and domesticated animals along a gradient of ecological change in a forest-savanna mosaic in
      the Democratic Republic of Congo, an epicenter of zoonotic disease emergence. The
      investigators analyze potential viral and bacterial overlap among humans and animals and
      explain this overlap (or not) through social sciences and ecological analyses of human and
      animal mobilities, practices and contacts. This multi-disciplinary, multi-species
      investigation in an ecotone (a transitional ecological zone linked to zoonotic disease
      emergence) offers a &quot;pre-history&quot; of spillover and emergence, tracing an ecological zeb of
      virome and microbial sharing among humans and animals. It will elucidate why such microbial
      and viral flows occur.

      To conduct this investigation,there are two human sub-studies: the social sciences
      participatory study; and the clinical study. The clinical study will involve 30 human
      subjects from whom blood and stool samples will be collected. The social sciences
      participatory study will involve self-collected activity and animal contact data and oral
      interviews among 60 human subjects.

    <description>30 adult participants will be recruited to self-report daily activities and contacts with domesticated and wild animals for a five month period. Following the five months of data collection, we will collect 5ml blood and 2g stool from each participant.
From the fifth month of investigation, an additional 30 adult participants will participate in oral anthropological, historical interviews to develop the socio-historical context of their changing activities and relations with selected domesticated and wild animals. No other intervention will be performed.</description>
