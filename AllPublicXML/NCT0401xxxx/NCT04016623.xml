    <textblock>
      An evaluation of the clinical performance of the 1-day toric test contact lens compared to
      the 1-day toric control contact lens over one hour of lens wear.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A non-dispensing, double-masked, randomized, contralateral study comparing the 1-day toric
      test contact lens against the 1-day toric control contact lens to evaluate the clinical
      performance over one hour of lens wear. Each subject will be randomized to wear the test lens
      in one eye and the control lens in the other eye for each pair of lenses.

      Each subject will be asked to wear four pairs of contact lenses in the study
