    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Met All Effectiveness Criteria up to 12 Months From the Index Date</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months from index date (Index date: date of first claim for tofacitinib by participants to insurance provider during identification period of 2.6 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Effectiveness criteria: 1) High adherence with proportion of days covered greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 0.8; 2) No increase in index medication dose; 3) No use of an advanced therapy other than index therapy 4) No addition/claims of conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug; 5) If no oral glucocorticoid prescriptions in the 6 months prior to index date, then no more than 30 total days supply of oral glucocorticoids between 3-12 months post index or if at least 1 claim for oral glucocorticoids during 6 months pre-index, then oral glucocorticoid not increased by &gt;=20% between 6-12 months post-index compared to 6 months before index date (6) Participants have one or fewer glucocorticoid injections during 3-12 months after index date. Adherence was defined as percentage of time with medication on hand. Participants who met all 6 effectiveness criteria considered as treated effectively.</description>

    <description>Treatment persistence with tofacitinib was defined as participants who did not switch to another advanced therapy or discontinued tofacitinib. Discontinuation of tofacitinib was defined as at least 60 days gap between the run out of prior tofacitinib prescription and subsequent treatment.
