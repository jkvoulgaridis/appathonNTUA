  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to compare the outcomes of robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy
      (RARP) and laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) for prostate cancer treatment in terms of
      perioperative surgical, functional and oncological outcomes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will either have robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RARP) or
      laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) as determined by the treating surgeon. All
      participants will undergo tests and questionnaires to determine urinary and erectile
      function, biopsies to determine perioperative surgical, functional and oncological outcomes.
      These assessments will be conducted pre-operatively, post-operatively and at certain
      follow-up time points up to 12 months.

    <description>The NPRS is a segmented numeric version of the visual analog scale (VAS) in which a respondent selects a whole number (0-10 integers) that best reflects the intensity of pain, in a total of 10 points, higher score means worse, with 0 means no pain and 10 is the worst pain. The mean score will be calculated to reflect the post-operative pain.</description>

    <time_frame>Preoperative</time_frame>
    <description>The 15-question International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Questionnaire is a validated, multi-dimensional, self-administered investigation that has been found useful in the clinical assessment of erectile dysfunction and treatment outcomes in clinical trials. A score of 0-5 is awarded to each of the 15 questions that examine the 4 main domains of male sexual function: erectile function, orgasmic function, sexual desire and intercourse satisfaction. The score ranges from 22 - 25 for Normal erectile function (no ED), 17 - 21 for Mild ED, 12 - 16 for Mild to moderate ED, 8 - 11 for Moderate ED, and from 1 - 7 for Severe ED (5 - 7, if a man had no opportunity to engage in sexual activity). The mean score will be calculated.</description>

    <time_frame>Preoperative</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability. The mean score will be calculated.</description>
