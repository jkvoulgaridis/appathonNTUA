  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to find out whether mindful drinking/eating activities can
      improve quality of life and help make it easier for people on dialysis to follow their fluid
      restrictions. The pilot study is a randomized controlled trial with an intervention group and
      a wait list control group, randomized by cohort days. The intervention occurs during dialysis
      sessions once a week for 4 weeks. During each intervention session, participants are guided
      through a mindful eating exercise focused on foods recommended for controlling thirst (e.g.,
      hard candy, frozen grapes) and a mindful drinking exercise. Participants are asked to
      practice mindful drinking/eating at least once daily at home.

    <description>Participants will be individually guided during their dialysis session through: 1) a mindful drinking exercise, a meditation focused on the sensory experience of 3 sips of fluid, along with a discussion of the experience; and 2) a mindful eating exercise with select foods that are recommended for controlling thirst (i.e., hard candy, frozen fruits). Participants will be given directions for mindful drinking/eating and asked to practice mindful drinking/eating as often as possible but least once each day.</description>
