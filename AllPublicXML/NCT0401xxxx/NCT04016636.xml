      The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of Ibrutinib monotherapy in the QoL of
      subjects with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) based in European Quality of Life 5
      Dimensions (EQ-5D) and FACIT- fatigue questionnaires assessment from baseline to 1 year of
      treatment in Argentinian routine clinical practice.

    <description>The FACIT (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy) fatigue scale is a self-assessment questionnaire with a 7-day recall period and 13 items evaluating fatigue and its impact on daily life activities. Fatigue is scored 0-52. 0= severe fatigue; 52= no fatigue.
Number of patients with an improvement of at least 3 points in FACIT score (Minimally Important Difference).
This study is assessing a Change from Baseline Fatigue at 6 months.</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D questionnaire is a brief, generic health-related quality of life assessment (HRQOL) that can also be used to incorporate participant preferences into health economic evaluations. The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression and as overall health using a &quot;thermometer&quot; visual analog scale with response options ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (best imaginable health).
Number of patients with improvements in the EQ5D domains by analyzing the variation in each domain and index during follow-up at different time points.</description>

    <description>In this study the investigator does not assign specific interventions to the study participants. Participants will receive interventions as part of routine medical care, and the investigator will observe the effect of the intervention.
This study will collect prospective real-world data to describe the quality of life (QOL) in patients with CLL receiving ibrutinib in routine Argentinian clinical practice over a 12-month follow-up period.
The primary data source for this observational study will be the medical records of each enrolled patient, as well as questionnaires concerning quality of life. Data will be collected at baseline and on months 1,3,6 and 12 during a prospective period.</description>
