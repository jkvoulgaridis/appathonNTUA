      The objective of this study is to determine whether cell-free DNA (cf-DNA) measurement can be
      used as a biomarker for successful treatment of an acute rejection (AR) episode after kidney
      transplantation.

      A fall in donor cf-DNA level may be a biomarker for successful AR treatment. Our goal is to
      do an exploratory study to determine, in recipients with biopsy-proven AR, whether
      persistence or elevated levels of donor cf-DNA are associated with ongoing inflammation at
      the time of exit biopsy; and whether fall in donor cf-DNA level is associated with successful
      AR treatment.

      Measurement of cf-DNA has recently been started for kidney transplant recipients. There will
      be two groups of patients eligible for this study:

        1. those who have had sequential measurement of cf-DNA prior to graft dysfunction leading
           to a biopsy, and

        2. those who have not had previous measurement of cf-DNA

      Significance of Research Question/Purpose:

      A kidney transplant biopsy is the gold standard for making a diagnosis at the time of graft
      dysfunction. However, there are risks associated with a transplant biopsy (e.g., hematuria,
      clots within the collecting system, bleeding, hematoma within the kidney, urine leak, and
      rarely AKI and/or graft loss). Recently, a blood test has been developed which distinguishes
      donor and recipient circulating cf-DNA. Using this methodology, circulating cf-DNA is
      amplified, then using a panel of markers, 2 DNA peaks can be observed - a high peak for the
      recipient DNA and a very low peak for the donor (importantly, this is not genetic testing;
      only high and low peaks are identified). When cf-DNA is measured at the time of a kidney
      biopsy for graft dysfunction, an elevated donor cf-DNA level - compared to that seen in a
      cohort without inflammation - can be seen in recipients with an acute rejection (AR) episode.
      Data, to date, suggests that if &gt;1% of cf-DNA is donor derived, there is likely graft
      inflammation.

      Currently, there are ongoing studies to determine if sequential measurement of cf-DNA in the
      same recipient will show elevated donor cf-DNA levels earlier than a serum creatinine rise,
      thus potentially allowing earlier detection and treatment of AR episodes.

      Serum creatinine level is used as a marker for successful treatment of an acute rejection
      episode. However, creatinine level is an insensitive marker of response to treatment of both
      cellular and antibody mediated rejection. Studies in which biopsies are done at the end of
      &quot;presumed&quot; successful rejection treatment show that some patients whose creatinine level
      returned to baseline have ongoing inflammation. Unless additional anti-rejection treatment is
      given, this incomplete treatment leads to increased risk for donor-specific antibody
      formation and graft failure.

      As a consequence, we (the U of MN Kidney Transplant Program) are now doing routine &quot;exit&quot;
      biopsies for patients treated for acute rejection episodes and whose serum creatinine level
      returns to baseline. We have always done biopsies in patients whose creatinine level did not
      return to baseline. The &quot;exit&quot; biopsy is done at ~6 weeks after completion of rejection
      treatment. If the exit biopsy shows ongoing inflammation, additional rejection treatment is
      considered.

      It would be ideal to have a noninvasive marker for successful rejection treatment. The
      objective of this study is to determine whether cell-free DNA (cf-DNA) measurement can be
      used as a biomarker for successful treatment of an acute rejection (AR) episode after kidney
      transplantation.

      The addition of cf-DNA testing would have two potential benefits:

        1. Serum creatinine may return to baseline (pre-rejection level), but ongoing allograft
           injury may be occurring as creatinine is an insensitive marker of subtle allograft
           dysfunction. This inflammation is known to create antigenic presentation that results in
           DSA production which is major cause of long-term allograft loss

        2. Serum creatinine may not return to baseline as there is irreparable allograft loss or
           intensification of CNI dosing. This would result in a biopsy that does not change
           management, but would put the patient through an unnecessary and potentially harmful
           procedure. If a non-invasive marker decreases with treatment and correlates with
           complete resolution of rejection episode, this would be useful for monitoring purposes.

      Preliminary Data:

        1. The University of MN Transplant Program participated in the original studies showing an
           association between cf-DNA and acute rejection. We have experience with the methodology
           and with working with the company that does the cf-DNA assay

        2. Since starting to do exit biopsies we, like others, have found that some patients with
           presumed successful rejection treatment have evidence of ongoing inflammation seen in
           the biopsy.

    <description>All patients undergoing kidney allograft biopsy for suspicion of an acute rejection episode will be approached for consent into the study. Patients who consent to the study will have the cf-DNA test drawn at time of biopsy to determine levels of cf-DNA. All consented patients will be followed for biopsy outcomes. Those whose biopsy shows acute rejection leading to treatment will have cf-DNA determination at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks post biopsy. Recipients with persistent high cf-DNA levels will undergo repeat biopsy at ~6 weeks after end of treatment per standard of care (this is not performed for purpose of the study, but for clinical care).</description>

    <description>For all consenting recipients undergoing kidney biopsy between 1 and 12 months post-transplant, a single tube of blood will be drawn (at the time of other blood draws so that there is no additional needle stick) to measure cf-DNA. The tube will be shipped to the California lab for determination of donor cf-DNA. For recipients whose biopsy shows AR, a tube of blood will be drawn at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after initiation of anti-rejection treatment and similarly will be shipped to the California lab for determination of cf-DNA.
Recipients whose exit biopsy shows ongoing inflammation and receiving additional anti-rejection therapy will have an additional exit biopsy additional cf-DNA determinations.</description>
