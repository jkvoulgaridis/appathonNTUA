    <description>Detection rate of bleeding lesions is defined as proportion of patients in whom a potential bleeding lesion is identified. Visualization of gross blood (fresh/coffee grounds) without any lesion will not be considered as a positive diagnosis. The panel will provide a diagnosis based upon the lesion presenting the highest potential for bleeding if there are many lesions detected.</description>
