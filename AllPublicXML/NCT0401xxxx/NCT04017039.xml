  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that chronic insufficient sleep is associated with diminished
      endothelium-dependent nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation and endothelial tissue-type
      plasminogen activator release in adults with elevated blood pressure. Furthermore, the
      investigators hypothesize that the postulated diminishment in endothelial vasodilator and
      fibrinolytic function with insufficient sleep will be due, at least in part, to increased
      oxidative stress. Furthermore, increasing sleep duration and improving sleep quality will
      increase both endothelium-dependent nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation and endothelial
      tissue-type plasminogen activator release in adults with elevated blood pressure. Increases
      in endothelial vasodilator and fibrinolytic function will be due, at least in part, to
      reduced oxidative stress.
