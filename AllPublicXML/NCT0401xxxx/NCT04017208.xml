    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a study drug, and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. Adverse event (AE) is considered &quot;serious&quot; if the investigator or sponsor view any of the following outcomes: Death, life-threatening, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly or birth defect, hospitalization, or medically important event. Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) is defined as any AE which starts, or worsens, after the first dose of study drug through 30 days after the last dose of study drug.</description>
