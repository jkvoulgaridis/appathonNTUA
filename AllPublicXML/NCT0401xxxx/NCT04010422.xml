      This study will investigate the visual function in individuals with ASD, with a particular
      focus on the ocular surface condition and visual function assessment.

    <textblock>
      Anomalies in visual information processing can have a major effect on the life quality of
      individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), including eye gaze abnormality, higher
      frequency of refractive errors (e.g., astigmatism, hypermetropia, and anisometropia),
      strabismus, abnormal blinking rate, disturbed eye movements that may be associated with or
      aggravated social communication deficits of ASD. However, little is known about the ocular
      surface conditions. This study will investigate the visual function in individuals with ASD,
      with a particular focus on the ocular surface condition. We plan to recruit 50 adults with
      ASD and 50 age-/sex-matched typically developing controls in this project, and perform visual
      function assessment.

        This is an observation study. We will recruit 50 adults with autism spectrum disorder aging
        over 20 years old from the Psychiatry Department, National Taiwan University Hospital. We
        will also recruit 50 adults without autism spectrum disorder aging over 20 years old from
        the Ophthalmology Department, National Taiwan University Hospital.
