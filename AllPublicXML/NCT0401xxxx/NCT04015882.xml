  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, the survival of patients has increased with the success of leukemia
      treatment in children. However, according to the treatment modalities applied, complications
      such as changes in body composition such as obesity, osteoporosis and impaired bone health
      such as increased fragility are more frequent after treatment in patients.In this study,
      virtual reality exercise practices in remission of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases will
      prevent negative effects on bone health and body composition and increase the quality of life
      of patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment and intervention options are being tried to avoid such complications that affect
      the quality of life of patients and there is still no standard treatment to convert bone
      health to healthy bone structure before the disease. There is a positive effect of improving
      the bone health of the activity and exercise programs. In this study, it was planned to
      demonstrate the positive effects of these changes on bone health through changes of
      adipokines and myokins released from fat and muscle tissue by virtual reality exercise
      method. Thus, the quality of life can be increased and cancer complications can be reduced in
      cancer cases.

    <description>Weight status among children and adolescents aged 2 through 19 years is defined based on BMI. In children and adolescents, overweight is defined as at or above the sex-specific 85th percentile on the CDC's 2000 BMI-for-age growth charts but less than the 95th percentile; obesity is defined as a BMI at or above the sex-specific 95th percentile.</description>

    <measure>total body fat ratios</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The methods have not been extensively studied in children. The method which provides the most useful measure of fat distribution remains to be determined. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) has been shown to be a reliable and accurate method of measuring fat mass</description>

    <measure>subcutaneous thickness</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Anthropometric measures such as waist circumference provide simple means of estimating fat distribution that supplement measures of excess adiposity such as BMI, but ultimately cannot definitively differentiate between visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>bone mineral densities</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Complications such as growth hormone deficiency and musculoskeletal deformity have negative effects on bone metabolism. Low bone mineral density is associated with fractures, skeletal deformity, pain, and substantial financial burden not only for childhood cancer survivors but also for public health care systems.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>markers of bone metabolism</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Normal pediatric reference ranges for serum markers of bone formation and resorption are a prerequisite for the assessment of metabolic bone disorders and for the monitoring of antiresorptive therapy or disease progression.</description>
