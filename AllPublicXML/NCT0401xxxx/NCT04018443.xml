  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, bedside ultrasound has become an important tool for the simple and non-invasive
      hemodynamic assessment of critically ill patients. This applies not only to echocardiography
      but also to ultrasound of large extra-thoracic veins. The sonography can provide real time
      assessment of the vascular system and hemodynamic status at the bedside.

      To our knowledge, there is one report about the association between sonographically assessed
      carotid artery diameter and intravascular volume, which raised recommendation for further
      studies including the interplay between carotid geometry and intravascular fluid status.

      Aim of the study:

      The aim of this work is to evaluate the accuracy of noninvasive techniques for assessment of
      intravascular volume status by Sonographic assessment of both the common carotid artery
      diameter (CCA) and the central venous pressure (CVP) in response to a bolus of crystalloid
      solution infusion and to find the correlation between CCA diameter and CVP as the primary
      outcome in adults patients after major surgeries who needs close assessment and maintenance
      of the intravascular volume status.

    <description>measurement of common carotid artery diameter will be carried out two times: the initial measurement (pre-infusion) which is followed by infusion of crystalloid solution (Ringer lactate) 30 ml/min till reaching a total infusion volume of 7 ml/kg body weight then another ultrasound measurement will be taken (prost-infusion). Between these sequential measurements, the patient position will not be changed. The percentage increase in CCA diameter will be calculated using the formula: [(dia-mpost/dia-mpre) × 100] − 100 [11].</description>
