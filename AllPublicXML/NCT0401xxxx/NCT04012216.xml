  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general aim of this study is to demonstrate that the measurement of respiratory effort
      assessed by mandibular movements during sleep is a useful measure for the screening of sleep
      disordered breathing (SDB) in patients with moderate to severe persistent rhinitis (R). The
      primary objective is therefore to determine a mandibular movement respiratory disturbance
      index (MM-RDI) threshold associated with a polysomnography respiratory disturbance index
      (PSG-RDI) â‰¥ 15 / h in a population of patients with moderate-to-severe persistent R.

      The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the concordance and correlation
      between:

        -  MM-RDI,

        -  the respiratory effort evaluated by MM,

        -  polysomnography (PSG) results,

        -  quality of life questionnaires,

        -  clinical data,

        -  treatments.

    <measure>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) measures the quality of sleep. It contains 19 self-rated questions and 5 questions by the bed partner or roommate (if one is available). Only self -rated questions are included in the scoring. The 19 self-rated items are combined in seven component scores each of which has a range of 0-3 points. In all the cases, a score of &quot;0&quot; indicates no difficulty, while a score of &quot;3&quot; indicates severe difficulty. The seven component scores are then added to yield one &quot;global&quot; score with a range of 0-21 points, &quot;0&quot; indicating no difficulty and &quot;21&quot; indicating severe difficulties in all areas. The 7 components are subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication and daytime dysfunction.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The Euro Quality Of Life-5 dimensions - 3 levels (EQ-5D-3L) scale is a descriptive system comprising the following five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The responses record three levels of severity (no problems/some or moderate problems/extreme problems) within a particular EQ-5D dimension. This results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state. In addition, there is a visual analogue scale (VAS) to indicate the general health status with &quot;0&quot; indicating the worse health and &quot;100&quot; indicating the best health.</description>

    <description>The NOSE questionnaire is composed of five subscales, namely: 1) nasal congestion or stuffiness; 2) nasal blockage or obstruction; 3) trouble breathing through my nose; 4) trouble sleeping; 5) unable to get enough air through my nose during exercise or exertion.
All subscales are scored using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 4 (0=not a problem, 1=very mild problem, 2=moderate problem, 3=fairly bad problem, 4=severe problem). Each definitive subscale score is obtained after multiplying the Likert score by five. All subscales are added to give a total score (total score range from 0 (no nasal obstruction) to 100 (the most severe nasal obstruction).</description>

    <description>The Allergic Rhinitis Control Test (ARCT is a self-completion questionnaire assessing the control of chronic rhinitis. It is made up of five questions scored from 1 to 5, and these individual scores are then added up to obtain a score ranging from 5 (worse score) to 25 (best score). The five questions are: during the last 2 weeks, has your allergic rhinitis had an effect on your professional/personal activities ; during the last 2 weeks, has your allergic rhinitis made you irritable ; during the last 2 weeks, has your allergic rhinitis disturbed your sleep (going to sleep, waking at night) ; during the last 2 weeks, have you needed to use an additional treatment not prescribed by your doctor to treat your allergic rhinitis ; during the last 2 weeks, how would you assess your allergic rhinitis.</description>

    <ipd_description>The general goal is to make the study data available to interested researchers as well as to provide proof of transparency for the study. Data (and an accompanying data dictionary) will be de-identified and potentially further cleaned or aggregated as the investigators deem necessary to protect participant anonymity.
Data will be made available to the public on a not-for-profit, free platform that allows access control (zenodo.org). Links on osf.io/clinicaltrials.gov will point towards the upload.</ipd_description>
