  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to explore deeply the representations and emotional impact of MS on
      caregivers (doctors and nurses) and relatives of cancer patients. It also aims to describe
      their collaboration modalities, roles and responsibilities during the decision-making
      process, implementation and &quot;control&quot; of MS. The project is a multi-center psychosocial study
      (home, hospitals and palliative care unit) that will take the form of a comprehensive
      qualitative study, both prospective (participant observation) and retrospective (interview),
      of patients with and without cancer, for which MS has been administered.

      Scientific Background: Physicians have an ethical obligation to relieve the refractory
      symptoms of patients with advanced cancer. In some situations, in the face of physical
      symptoms and psycho-existential distress, usual treatment is not effective and palliative
      sedation (PS) is one of the only acceptable options. The carers, but also the relatives of
      the patient, are particularly involved in the process of decision-making, information and
      management of sedation. Despite the interest of MS practice and its impact on different
      levels (relational, emotional, professional, ethical), and contrary to the important
      development of international studies in this field, there is a lack of research in France.

      Objectives of the project and a brief description of the methods: This study aims to explore
      in depth the representations and emotional impact of MS on carers (doctors and nurses) and
      relatives of cancer patients. It also aims to describe their collaboration modalities, roles
      and responsibilities during the decision-making process, implementation and &quot;control&quot; of MS.
      The project is a multi-center psychosocial study (home, hospitals and palliative care unit)
      that will take the form of a comprehensive qualitative study, both prospective (participant
      observation) and retrospective (interview), of patients with and without cancer, for which MS
      has been administered.

      Expected Outcomes: The expected results are the production of original knowledge about the
      practice of MS in different clinical settings (hospital, home), a better understanding of the
      psychosocial determinants of palliative sedation decision-making, an update of knowledge
      transferable to develop palliative care programs that integrate the experiential, emotional,
      and contextual dimensions of palliative sedation, a better understanding of the communication
      skills needed to cope with this practice, and an awareness of health care teams and
      advocates. public health on this subject.

        In the framework of the QualiPaS_OBS study, the observations will be made by a psychologist
        integrated into each care team during the observations observation period - no professional
        activity other than observations. The population studied in the QualiPaS_OBS phase
        corresponds to the members of the health care team practicing within the eight teams of the
        services participating in the study, as well as secondarily the patients and relatives of
        the patients concerned by the activity of the team in question. during the observation
