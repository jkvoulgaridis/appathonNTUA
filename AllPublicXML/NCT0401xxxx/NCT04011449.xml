      Primary objectives.

      The ability of the RC+S to record Local Field Potentials (LFP's) is novel in Deep Brain
      Stimulation (DBS) technology. The primary goals of this project are to use this function of
      the RC+S to characterize:

        1. The state- and target-dependency of neuronal oscillations in the subthalamic nucleus
           (STN), internal globus pallidus (GPi) or external globus pallidus (GPe) of patients with
           PD,

        2. How these oscillations are altered by levodopa,

        3. The effects of unilateral standard clinical isochronal (e.g. 140 Hz) GPi-, GPe-, and
           STN-DBS on oscillatory activity and its relationship to the presence and severity of
           parkinsonian motor signs.

      These experiments will leverage the capacity to record LFPs from macroelectrodes implanted in
      either the GPi/GPe or STN using the Medtronic RC+S DBS system. The long-term goal for this
      project is to develop closed-loop methods for DBS that are state (resting vs. movement) and
      movement-phase appropriate.

      Secondary objectives.

      In addition to establishing the relationship between neural oscillations in the STN, GPi and
      GPe to clinical and quantitative measures of akinesia, bradykinesia, tremor and rigidity,
      this project will also examine the relationship of neural oscillations to:

        1. Levodopa-resistant motor features such as postural instability and gait (including
           freezing of gait),

        2. Response inhibition and impulse control.

      The Olympus Research System (RC+S) is an implantable pulse generator (IPG) designed to
      deliver deep brain stimulation (DBS) like a standard clinical neurostimulator, but which
      allows recordings of local field potential (LFP) activity from the implanted DBS lead.

      LFPs are composite electrical signals generated by the brain. They are conventionally divided
      into frequency bands, as follows: 0-3 Hz (delta), 4-7 Hz (theta), 8-12 Hz (alpha), 13-30 Hz
      (beta), 31-200 Hz (gamma), and &gt;200 Hz (high frequency). The instantaneous amplitude and
      power of the LFP recordings are believed to represent the degree of synchronization among
      neurons surrounding the electrode. A transient increase in power in a particular band, in
      response to a behavioral event, is called an event-related synchronization (ERS), while a
      transient decrease in power is called event-related desynchronization (ERD). ERD and ERS are
      typically calculated by averaging the power across time segments and comparing this average
      to a reference epoch.

      Research staff at the University of Minnesota will follow FDA guidelines for software
      development for the RC+S.
