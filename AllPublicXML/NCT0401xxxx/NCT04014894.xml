  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, open-label, 3+3 dose escalation, phase 1 study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of ET019003-T cells therapy for patients with
      relapsed/refractory CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma.

    <textblock>
      ET019003-T cells is a human anti-CD19 CAR-T cells by fusing the anti-CD19 antibody Fab domain
      with the transmembrane and intracellular domains from the γδTCR, which can avoid mispairing
      with the T cell's endogenous αβTCR chains. Meanwhile, an independent ET190L1-CSR (Chimeric
      Signaling Receptor) is added to ET019003-T cells in trans, which can bind CD19 to activate a
      novel costimulatory domain to further promote T cell proliferation and persistence.

      The trial was conducted to explore the safety and efficacy of ET019003-T cells inCD19+
      Leukemia and Lymphoma.
