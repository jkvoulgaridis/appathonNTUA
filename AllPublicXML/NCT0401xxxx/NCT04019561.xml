      A Phase 2 study with 4 treatment groups of two differing doses and matched placebos designed
      to evaluate the safety (including hepatic safety), tolerability and pharmacodynamic effects
      of two dose levels of MEDI0382 in obese subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
      (NAFLD)/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The subjects will have biopsy-confirmed
      NAFLD/NASH with liver fibrosis stage F1, F2 or F3. Approximately 72 subjects will be

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provision of informed consent (with the exception of consent for future genetic and
             non genetic research) prior to performing any study-specific procedures, including
             screening evaluations.

          2. Subjects aged ≥ 18 years at the time of consent.

          3. Body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2 at screening.

          4. HbA1c ≤ 9.5% (inclusive) at screening if T2DM present, managed by either diet and/or a
             stable dose of metformin, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors,
             sulphonylureas or acarbose (ie, no major dose adjustments in prior 3 months to
             screening).

          5. Definitive NAFLD / NASH with NASH activity score (NAS) ≥ 4 with ≥ 1 in each component
             (i.e. steatosis, lobular inflammation and ballooning), as diagnosed by liver biopsy
             within 6 months of screening with liver fibrosis stage F1, F2 or F3. The number of
             subjects with F1 will be capped at 25% in the study.

          6. Evidence of hepatic steatosis or liver fat (≥ 10%) by MRI.

          7. Women of childbearing potential:

               1. Who are sexually active with a non-sterilized male partner must have used at
                  least one highly effective method of contraception from screening, and must agree
                  to continue using such precautions through to the end of the study. It is
                  strongly recommended for the male partner of a female subject to also use male
                  condom plus spermicide throughout this period. Cessation of contraception after
                  this point should be discussed with a responsible physician. Periodic abstinence,
                  the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception.

               2. Must have a negative urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to the first dose
                  of investigational product; and not be breastfeeding.

             results of the study.

          2. Liver disease of other etiologies (eg, alcoholic steatohepatitis; drug-induced, viral,

             (anti-HCV).

          3. History of cirrhosis and/or hepatic decompensation, including ascites, hepatic
             encephalopathy or variceal bleeding.

          4. Prior or planned liver transplantation.

          5. Alcohol consumption &gt; 21 units of alcohol per week for men and &gt; 14 units per week for
             women on average over a two-year time frame prior to baseline biopsy.

          9. Physician-diagnosed diabetic subjects with clinically significant gastroparesis (as
             judged by the investigator) or those treated for gastroparesis within 6 months prior
             to screening

         10. History of &gt; 5 kg weight loss in the last 6 months prior to screening or recent
             (within 3 months of screening) use of drugs approved for weight loss (eg, orlistat,
             bupropion / naltrexone, phentermine-topiramate, phentermine, lorcaserin), as well as
             those drugs used off-label.

         14. History of substance dependence or a positive screen for drugs of abuse, likely to
             impact subject safety or compliance with study procedures, at the discretion of the
             investigator.

         15. History of psychosis or bipolar disorder. History of major depressive disorder within
             the past year with the subject being clinically unstable, or any history of suicide
             attempt or history of suicidal ideation within the past year.

         16. Recent (within 3 months of baseline biopsy) use of therapies associated with
             development of NAFLD (eg, systemic corticosteroids, methotrexate, tamoxifen,

         17. Recent (within 3 months of baseline biopsy) use of obeticholic acid or other therapy
             under investigation for NASH.

             history of extreme claustrophobia or subject cannot fit inside the MR scanner cavity.

         24. History of acute pancreatitis or current chronic pancreatitis. Subjects with serum
             triglyceride concentrations above 1000 mg/dL (11 mmol/L) at screening, as this can
