    <textblock>
      Patients will receive oral SKLB1028 for 28 days as a course of treatment, and then to
      evaluate the side effects,tolerability and best dose for treating relapsed or refractory
      acute myeloid leukemia With FLT3 Mutations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is an open,multicenter,queue extension study designed to characterize the efficacy and
      safety of different administration regimens of SKLB1028 capsules in patients with
      recurrent/refractory acute myeloid leukemia with FLT3 mutation. Divided into three dose
      groups,150mg BID,200mg BID,300mg QD. The main end point is total remission rate (ORR), total
      survival time (OS), progress-free survival time (PFS), remission duration, FLT3 suppression
      rate, competitive parameters, safety (incidence of adverse events).
