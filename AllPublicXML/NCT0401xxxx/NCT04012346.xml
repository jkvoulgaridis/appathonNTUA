  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a detrimental impact on cognitive functions. Based on pilot
      studies results in patients with neurodegenerative brain diseases the investigators aim for
      promoting the brain plasticity and improving cognition by noninvasive brain stimulation
      (NIBS) in healthy young, healthy aged and subjects with mild cognitive impairment due to AD.
      Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate stage between the expected cognitive
      decline of normal aging and the more-serious decline of dementia. Different new brain
      targets, cognitive tasks and stimulation protocols will be tested and optimized for specific
      subject groups. Design of a functional MRI (fMRI) - repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS) - fMRI study will enable us to explore and identify effect of age,
      presence of the disease and genetic risk factor (APOE4) on repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS)-induced changes in cognition and related brain connectivity/activations.
      The study results will improve our understanding of healthy and pathological brain aging and
      will provide novel information about the usefulness of NIBS in specific subject groups. These
      results will have an important impact on future non-pharmacological treatment strategies.

      Intensified intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) protocol will be applied in the MCI
      study group. A two-parallel-group, randomized, placebo controlled design will be used. Ten
      MCI subjects will be stimulated in a week-long therapeutical sessions. Other ten MCI subjects
      will be stimulated with the same protocol using sham stimulation. The investigators will
      study the change in subjects immediately after and again at a two-weeks follow-up visit after
      the end of the last stimulation session.
