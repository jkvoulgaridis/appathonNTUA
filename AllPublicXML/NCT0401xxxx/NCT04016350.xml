  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence to suggest that responsiveness to exercise training programmes can be
      expected to be influenced by changes in resting fat oxidation, an important factor in the
      aetiology of obesity. Our previous work has shown that oral supplementation with inulin
      propionate ester (IPE) reduces intra-abdominal fat and prevents weight gain and that oral
      propionate intake enhances resting fat oxidation. The effects of IPE combined with exercise
      training on resting fat oxidation and body fatness are unknown. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the impact of 4-weeks IPE supplementation, in combination with a moderate
      intensity exercise training programme, on whole body fat oxidation and on plasma GLP-1 and
      PYY.

      Participants: Healthy overweight females with BMI &gt;25 kg/m2 and 25-45 years of age were
      recruited through advertisements and word of mouth on the campus of the University of Glasgow
      or from other public places. Participants were required to be sedentary, non-smokers, with
      stable body weight for two months prior to the study enrollment, not pregnant, free of
      medication, nutritional supplementation or following any specific diet and with no antibiotic
      use for the past three months. Participants with chronic illness, eating disorders and
      history of gastrointestinal operations were excluded.

      Study Design: This is a randomized study with a parallel design. Study participants underwent
      4 week supervised moderate intensity exercise training combined either with IPE (EX/IPE) or
      cellulose as placebo (EX/Placebo) supplementation at doses of 10g / day. Supplements were
      provided as sachets containing white powder and participants were asked to consume one sachet
      per day with breakfast in a way convenient for each participant. Before the start of the
      study and at the end of the 4-week intervention, participants were asked to conduct a
      submaximal exercise test. Prior to the first and after the second submaximal exercise test,
      participants of both groups conducted a 7-hour experimental trial which involved collection
      of expired air and blood samples in fasted and postprandial states. Body weight and body
      composition were measured in the fasted state. Prior to the first 7-hour experimental trial,
      participants were asked to record their diet for 3 days and replicate this intake prior to
      the second 7-hour experimental trial.
