  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TAK-169, establish
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and to provide a
      preliminary evaluation of the clinical activity of TAK-169 monotherapy in participants with
      RRMM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-169. The study will evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, preliminary efficacy, PK, pharmacodynamic, and immunogenicity of TAK-169
      monotherapy in participants with RRMM.

      The study will be conducted in 2 phases: Dose Escalation Phase (Part 1) and an Expansion
      Phase (Part 2). The study will enroll approximately 81 to 102 participants (39 to 60
      participants in Part 1 and approximately 54 participants in Part 2).

      In the Dose Escalation Phase (Part 1), the starting dose level will be 50 microgram/kilogram
      (mcg/kg), once weekly. On the basis of investigator and sponsor review of available safety,
      PK, pharmacodynamic, and efficacy data from Cohort 1, the dose will be escalated in the
      subsequent cohorts to 100, 200, 335, 500, and 665 mcg/kg, once weekly. A separate dose
      escalation may also occur in which TAK-169 will be administered once every 2 weeks.

      In the Expansion Phase (Part 2), the study will evaluate two types of RRMM cohorts:
      Daratumumab-relapsed or Refractory (RR) Cohorts (once weekly and once every 2 weeks TAK-169
      administration) and an Anti-CD38 Therapy Naive Cohort (once weekly TAK-169 administration).
      The starting dose for each expansion cohort will be the MTD/RP2D (once weekly and once every
      2 weeks) determined in Part 1 after review of the available safety, efficacy, PK, and
      pharmacodynamic data from the dose escalation phase of the study.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall duration of the
      study is 34 months. Participants will be followed up for 30 days after the last dose of study
      drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
