  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CHF 6333 is a medicinal product on development for the treatment of cystic fibrosis and
      non-CF bronchiectasis and undergoing clinical testing. It has not yet been approved by the
      authorities for the treatment of these diseases.

      CHF6333 is an inhaled anti-inflammatory which mechanism of action is based on the inhibition
      of Human Neutrofil Elastase.

      The safety and tolerability of single and repeated ascending doses of inhaled CHF 6333 was
      previously investigated in healthy subjects: information was gathered on the uptake,
      distribution and excretion of the medicinal product being tested (pharmacokinetics). In this
      current clinical trial CHF 6333 will be tested in patients(CF and NCFB) for the first time.

      Three dose level will be tested during the first part of the study, as single administration.
      One repeated dose will be administered in the second part of the study.
