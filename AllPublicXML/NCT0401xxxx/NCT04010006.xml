      The purpose of this study is to explore the feasibility of 4K Laparoscopic Surgery for
      Gastric Cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized comparison of HD and 4K laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer will
      be performed, to evaluate the clinical value and provide theoretical basis and clinical
      experience for the extensive application of the 4K laparoscopic technique. The evaluation
      parameters are perioperative clinical efficacy, postoperative life quality, immune function
      and 3-year survival and recurrence rates.

    <description>The number of all patients treated with surgery as the denominator and the number of the patients with any intraoperative and postoperative morbidity and mortality as the numerator are used to calculate the proportions.
Postoperative morbidities are divided into short-term and long-term complications after surgery.
Short-term is defined as within 30 days of surgery or the first discharge if the hospital stay is &gt; 30 days.
Long-term is defined as the period from 30 days or more after the operation or the period between first discharge (the hospital days after surgery &gt;30 days) and 3 years after the operation.
Postoperative mortality: patients whose death was identified according to documented intraoperative observation items, including patients who die within 30 days after surgery (including the 30th day) regardless of the causality between death and surgery, and patients who die more than 30 days after surgery.</description>
