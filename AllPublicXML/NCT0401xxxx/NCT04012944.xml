  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, single-arm CE-Mark trial to assess device
      safety and efficacy of the Cordella PA Sensor System in 60 New York Heart Association (NYHA)
      Class III Heart Failure patients who will receive the Cordella PA Sensor Implant.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study objectives are:

        1. To establish that the Cordella PA Sensor can be safely delivered, deployed, and remain
           stable within the target pulmonary artery (PA) segment through 30 days post-implant.

        2. To compare Cordella PA Sensor System pressure measurements with fluid-filled catheter PA
           pressure measurements obtained by standard right heart catheterization (RHC) at 90 days
           post implant.
