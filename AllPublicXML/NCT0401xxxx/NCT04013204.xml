  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to systematically evaluate the clinical application value of
      vascular endothelial function examination in patients with non-obstructive coronary artery
      disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be carried out in two stages. Phase I is mainly intended to evaluate the
      effects of vascular EFT on the prescription of doctors and the application rate of mid and
      long-term secondary prevention medication in patients. If the results are positive, the
      sample size and observation time will be further expanded in Phase II to evaluate its impact
      on the cardiovascular events of patients, as well as its cost-effectiveness.

    <intervention_model_description>Multicenter, randomized, patient and assessor blinded, parallel control, two-stage, clinical trial.
Phase I: a feasibility study to collect data on key process outcomes including physician's prescription behaviors, patients' cardiovascular risk, and trend of reduction in cardiovascular events, To create an initial and to inform for the Phase II larger multicenter trial on choosing clinical endpoints and sample size.
Phase II: will extend all patients from Phase I to a longer period of follow up and recruit more new patients to enlarge the sample size, in order to have a full study on the effect of introducing EFT as a routine test in reducing clinical endpoint (major adverse cardiovascular events) among patients with NOCAD.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>This study is patient and assessor blinded; that is, both groups of patients are unaware of the endothelial function results. This study will use blind methods for endpoint data collectors; that is, the data collectors will collect secondary prevention medication and cardiovascular event data for coronary artery disease without an awareness of patient grouping.</masking_description>
