    <measure>Asia Pacific Colorectal Screening (APCS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-colonoscopy, approximately 1 day before colonoscopy</time_frame>
    <description>Asia Pacific Colorectal Screening (APCS) is a validated tool to predict the risk of colorectal cancer in asymptomatic Asian population. The scoring system comprises of three categories: low risk (score 0-1), moderate risk (score 2-3) and high risk (score 4-7). Patients with moderate and high risk will undergo further examinations</description>

    <measure>Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) serum level</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-colonoscopy, approximately 1 day before colonoscopy</time_frame>
    <description>Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a well-known marker for colorectal cancer. A pre-treatment serum CEA level of ≥ 5 ng/mL is associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer patients.</description>

    <measure>Presence of NF-ҡB</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-colonoscopy, approximately 1 day before colonoscopy</time_frame>
    <description>NF-ҡB is a chronic inflammation marker found in colorectal cancer patients. Presence of NF-ҡB is assessed with immunohistochemical method. The result is considered positive if accumulated score ≥ 3.</description>

        Patients suspected with colorectal cancer who come to our hospital to conduct colonoscopy
        procedure will be recruited for this study and will undergo a series of examinations. Since
        this is a pilot study to obtain gut microbiome pattern on colorectal cancer patients, the
        number of samples is determined by the researchers: 100 subjects for neoplasm and 50
        subjects for non-neoplasm (according to histopathology report)
