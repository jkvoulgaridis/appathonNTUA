  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Auditory mismatch negativity deficit is a robust neurophysiological biomarker of
      schizophrenia. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a neuromodulation
      method and can be used to modulate excitability of specific brain cortical region. We
      hypothesize that MMN deficit of schizophrenia is related to inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)
      hypofunction, and this deficit can be improved by using rTMS to enhance IFG function.

      It is a randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled clinical trial. Forty-eight schizophrenia
      patients with MMN deficits (mean amplitude at FCz &gt; -0.7 ㎶) will be recruited and then
      randomized at a 1:1 ratio to rTMS group and sham-stimulation group. Subjects in rTMS group
      will receive high frequency rTMS over IFG, while in the other group subjects will receive
      sham stimulation at IFG. Frameless stereotaxy navigation will be used to guide the rTMS coil
      to IFG. The primary outcome is the change of MMN mean amplitude at FCz after stimulation. We
      hypothesize that the change of MMN mean amplitude is significantly larger in rTMS group than
      in sham-stimulation group. Their cognitive function and clinical condition will be evaluated
      carefully before and after experiments.
