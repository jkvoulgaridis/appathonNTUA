  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized control Trial, conducted with two group of patients, one has received
      Balance and stability training on Biodex stability system along with conservative protocol of
      traditional exercises. the other group has received only conservative protocol of traditional
      exercises

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Symptomatic Knee Osteoarthritis have balance and stability deficits. In routine
      such patients are not evaluated and treated on balance and stability parameters. So this
      study was conducted with objectives to determine the effects of Balance training using Biodex
      stability system in patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis.

      Experimental group has received Balance and stability training on Biodex stability system
      along with conservative protocol of traditional exercises.

      Control group has received only conservative protocol of traditional exercises.

    <description>Patients were asked to perform test at usual walking speed. Initial testing standardized verbal instructions given to the participant regarding procedure. For performing TUG participants were instructed to walk three meter and then, walk back to sit down. Note time on stopwatch. The average of tests trail was measured as the mean of TUG.</description>

    <measure>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>It is widely used in the evaluation of Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis. It is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 24 items divided into 3 subscales: Pain (5 items):Stiffness (2 items): Physical Function (17 items). The test questions are scored on a scale of 0-4, which correspond to: None (0), Mild (1), Moderate (2), Severe (3), and Extreme (4).The scores for each subscale are summed up, with a possible score range of 0-20 for Pain, 0-8 for Stiffness, and 0-68 for Physical Function. Usually a sum of the scores for all three subscales gives a total WOMAC score.Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations.</description>

    <description>Experimental group received balance training on Biodex stability System along with traditional exercise program. During balance training on Biodex, patients were instructed to stand on the platform with bare feet with open eyes and both legs supported. Patients were looking forward to screen having hands hang by the sides. The patients were instructed not to change their feet position and balance the body. The handles were accessible for safety point. But touching the handles cancelled the trail. Total time of training was 10 minutes each set is of 3 minutes with 20 sec rest intervals.</description>
