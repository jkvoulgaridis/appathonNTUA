  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of this clinical study is to compare the clinical success of two lining materials
      regarding the maintenance of pulp vitality in the treatment of deep caries lesions over 4-
      years.

      A hundred permanent premolar and molars with deep caries lesions without pulp involvement
      (aged between 18 and 30 years) in 73 patients were randomly divided into the following
      groups: calcium hydroxide cement (Ca(OH)2) (Dycal, Dentsply/Caulk, Dentsply International
      Inc, Milford, DE, USA) group and mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) (Dentsplay, Tulsa Dental,
      Johnson city, USA) group. Final restoration with a resin-based composite (Gradia Direct
      Posterior, GC, Tokyo, Japan) in a single session was performed. The following-up period was
      6-, 12-, 24-, 36- and 48-months. Two calibrated examiners performed the clinical examination
      of the pulpal symptoms

      Aim of this clinical study is to compare the clinical outcomes of mineral trioxide aggregate
      (MTA) cavity lining with calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) regarding the maintenance of pulp
      vitality in the treatment of deep caries lesions over 4- years.

      Materials and Methods: A hundred permanent premolar and molars with deep caries lesions
      without pulp involvement (aged between 18 and 30 years) in 73 patients were randomly divided
      into the following groups: calcium hydroxide cement (Ca(OH)2) (Dycal, Dentsply/Caulk,
      Dentsply International Inc, Milford, DE, USA) group and mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA)
      (Dentsplay, Tulsa Dental, Johnson city, USA) group. Final restoration with a resin-based
      composite (Gradia Direct Posterior, GC, Tokyo, Japan) in a single session was performed. The
      following-up period was 6-, 12-, 24-, 36- and 48-months. Two calibrated examiners performed
      the clinical examination of the pulpal symptoms. The data will be analyzed with Pearson
      chi-square, Fisher exact and logrank statistics tests (p &lt; 0.05). The Kaplan-Meier survival
      analysis will be conducted to reveal the survival rate.

    <description>The treatment consequence was judged as &quot;clinically successful&quot; when the following criteria were met: positive response to electric pulp testing, negative response to cold stimuli by air-water shrinkage, no general pain, normal response to tactile tests or triggered pain not lingering, no evidence of abscess, sinus tract and no abnormal tooth mobility. These teeth were considered to be &quot;clinically healthy&quot; and the treatment was successful.</description>
