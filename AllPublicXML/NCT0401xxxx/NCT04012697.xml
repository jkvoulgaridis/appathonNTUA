  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peer support workers with lived experience of homelessness will provide advocacy, supportive
      counselling, assistance with navigating the system, and role-modeling for people experiencing
      homelessness in emergency departments in the Niagara region of Ontario, Canada. Previous
      research has demonstrated that people experiencing homelessness experience barriers to care
      and poor health outcomes, including increased risk of dying, and are frequent users of the
      emergency department for physical and mental health needs. The benefits of peer support have
      been studied in hospital psychiatric units and with people experiencing homelessness, but no
      studies have yet explored the potential impact of peer support workers on homelessness in the
      emergency department. The investigators plan to do a 12-month randomized study of peer
      support workers compared to usual care in the emergency department, and evaluate outcomes
      such as physical health, mental health, addictions, and behaviours, as well as
      cost-effectiveness and changes in how people experiencing homelessness seek health care. The
      investigators hope that the findings of this study will provide additional knowledge and
      evidence for future efforts to improve care for people experiencing homelessness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Homelessness is strongly associated with an increased prevalence of chronic physical and
      mental health morbidity, leading to lower health-related quality of life and increased
      hospital readmissions compared to the general population. People experiencing homelessness
      have reported experience of discrimination and unwelcome treatment, neglect and rejection,
      lack of compassion from their health care providers and feeling as though their perceptions
      are disregarded. Alongside many daily barriers such as substance use, lack of housing, and
      food insecurity, these issues also negatively influence the desire to seek health care among
      people experiencing homelessness.

      A national strategy to determine the extent and nature of homelessness, 'Point-in-Time
      Counts' were conducted in over 60 communities across Canada in 2018 to provide a snapshot of
      the experiences and needs of people experiencing homelessness. The Niagara 'Point-in-Time'
      Count collected 408 surveys from people experiencing homelessness, with 57 percent of
      participants reporting a mental health issue, 36.2 percent reporting an addiction, and 33.9
      percent reporting a medical condition. Respondents also reported an ongoing need for mental
      health services (54.3 percent), addiction services (29.2 percent), and medical services (26.9
      percent). Of note, 219 participants reporting a collective 663 visits to the emergency
      department in the preceding 12 months. People experiencing homelessness are much more likely
      than housed people to access emergency departments for concerns with mental health, although
      this may not be an ideal environment to provide recovery-based mental health care.

      The placement of peer support workers in the emergency department may help overcome barriers
      to health care for people experiencing homelessness. Peer support is defined as a supportive
      relationship between a worker and a peer who share the commonality of a lived experience,
      with the peer support worker able to model recovery and use a recovery-oriented,
      person-centered approach with their peer. Increasing positive interactions in a clinical care
      setting could address the lack of trust perceived by people experiencing homelessness towards
      health care providers, helping to counteract negative perceptions of health care and
      increasing the likelihood that people experiencing homelessness will seek care in the future.

      The benefits of a peer support worker include feelings of empowerment and hope, increased
      sense of acceptance and empathy, improved satisfaction, and reduced feelings of stigma. Peer
      support workers in mental health services lead to reduced admissions, as well as earlier
      discharge when utilized following admission to hospital. Two recent reviews investigated the
      effectiveness of peer support services in individuals with severe mental illness.
      Consistently, they found that peers are at least as effective in providing services as
      non-peers in the same roles. Additionally, there are certain unique elements that can only be
      provided by peer support workers. Three randomized controlled trials reported better
      treatment engagement, fewer hospitalizations and hospital days, and lower rates of
      non-attendance compared to treatment as usual when peer support workers were added to a care
      team. When peer support workers served as patient advocates and community connectors for
      people with multiple psychiatric hospitalizations, the number of hospitalizations and days
      spent in hospital decreased. Furthermore, participants reported a decrease in depressive
      symptoms and increase in hope, self-care, and sense of well-being. The researchers noted that
      the active ingredient in these interventions seemed to be the instillation of hope through
      self-disclosure, role modeling, and empathy paired with conditional regard. Upon comparing
      and contrasting the core competencies of case managers and peer support workers, it was noted
      that the unique duties of peer support workers seemed to center around empowering clients via
      normalization, participating in personal development as a role model, and encouraging
      clients' educational growth.

      However, despite promising findings in a diversity of clinical care settings, there has been
      relatively limited research and few high quality studies of the effectiveness of peer support
      workers and their outcomes with people experiencing homelessness. People experiencing
      homelessness typically have complex comorbid mental illnesses, and they should theoretically
      benefit from peer support services via the sharing of lived experiences. An exploratory
      review of the literature on peer support and homelessness found 10 studies totaling 1341
      participants that collectively reported improved overall quality of life, significant
      increases in social support, reduced rates of substance use, decreased homelessness, and
      better physical and mental health for the recipients of peer support. Although promising, six
      of the included studies were longitudinal, two were cross-sectional, and two were
      quasi-experimental. There was also significant heterogeneity in the delivery of peer services
      across studies, including peer support from mentors, peer support as part of a larger
      intervention, and peer support groups.

      Within the emergency department, there has been minimal research on peer support or similar
      interventions. Of 11 studies examined in a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of emergency
      department interventions for frequent users, case management was found to be the most
      frequently used. For people experiencing homelessness, case management demonstrated increased
      contact with health services, reduced lengths of admission, decreased emergency department
      visits for mental health problems, and reduced substance use, but only equivocal findings for
      physical and mental health. An example of an emergency department program that is similar to
      peer support can be found in a randomized trial of compassionate care for people experiencing
      homelessness. This study from 1995 found that compassionate contact from trained volunteers
      led to a 33% relative reduction in the overall frequency of visits per month and a
      significant reduction in the time until a first repeat visit; however, health outcomes were
      not evaluated.

      Although there are several types of emergency department interventions, there is overall a
      lack of evidence about program effectiveness. Very few studies are randomized controlled
      trials, most studies with high-risk individuals are of low quality, and stronger evidence on
      cost-effectiveness is necessary for all program types. Furthermore, the quality of care and
      health outcomes for people experiencing homelessness may be improved through peer support,
      but evidence in this area is underdeveloped and in need of studies with robust experimental
      measures. To fill this gap in knowledge, this study will evaluate a program of peer support
      for people experiencing homelessness who seek care in the emergency departments of a
      mid-sized Canadian regional municipality. The research questions for the study are as
      follows:

        1. What, if any, are the changes in health service use (e.g., emergency department visits,
           hospitalizations) following receipt of peer support in the emergency department?

        2. What, if any, are the changes to health status, health-related quality of life,
           substance use, or behaviours, following engagement with a peer support worker?

        3. Is peer support in the emergency department a cost-effective intervention?

        4. Does receiving peer support in the emergency department lengthen the interval of time
           before a clinically significant outcome such as a repeat visit to the emergency
           department or increased morbidity?

        5. What are the mechanisms of peer support in the emergency department that may contribute
           to differences observed in the outcomes between the intervention and usual care groups?

    <measure>Mean change from baseline in psychiatric symptoms on the Colorado Symptom Index (CSI) at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CSI is a 14-item self-report measure of psychiatric symptoms (Boothroyd &amp; Chen, 2008). Respondents report the frequency of various psychiatric symptoms as experienced over the past month on a 5-point Likert scale. Scores range from 0 to 56, with higher scores indicating report of more frequent psychiatric symptoms. The CSI has been psychometrically validated with a sample of people who were experiencing homelessness, living precariously, at risk for homelessness, or had prior history of homelessness (Conrad et al., 2001). The CSI was found to have excellent internal consistency with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.90 and a test/retest intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.79 with this population. The CSI is intended to evaluate change in persons with moderate and high severity psychological symptoms or emotional distress, and is sensitive to change in symptomatology over time. Administration of the questionnaire requires approximately 5 minutes.</description>

    <description>The GAIN-SS is a 24-item self-report measure which assesses psychopathology and crime/violence across various dimensions and screens for people who are likely to have diagnoses or require clinical services (Dennis, Chan, &amp; Funk, 2006). The total score contributes to a Total Disorder Screener (TDScr), with four, 5- to 7-item subset screeners including the Internalizing Disorder Screener (IDScr), Externalizing Disorder Screener (EDScr), Substance Disorder Screener (SDScr), and Crime/Violence Screener (CVScr). The GAIN-SS is internally consistent with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.89 and good discriminant validity for each of the sub-screeners. The Total Disorder Screener has over 90% sensitivity and specificity with a ROC of 0.97 with a cut point of 3 or more. For the sub-screeners, scores can be divided into three groupings of 0 (low), 1-2 (moderate), and 3-5 (high), with the lower cut point of 1+ featuring 90% sensitivity and the upper cut point of 3+ featuring 90% specificity.</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D is a 5-item generic measure of health status that provides a descriptive profile for respondents to provide a self-rating of their health and produce a utility score for cost-effectiveness analysis. Health is defined across five dimensions of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, which encompass a broad range of different disease areas, specialties, and types of care. Each dimension offers the following five levels: No problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and unable to/extreme problems. The EQ-5D-5L offers a total of 3125 health states with a value set for Canada demonstrating a range of health utilities from -0.148 for the worst health state (55555, that is, extreme problems with mobility, self-care, etc.) to 0.949 for the best health state (11111, that is, no problems with any of the dimensions).</description>

    <description>The SF-12 is a 12-item questionnaire that has been investigated and utilized for measuring health status among people experiencing homelessness (Larson, 2002). It features categorical questions that assess limitations in role functioning as a result of physical and emotional health, as well as numerous Likert scale responses including a 3-point scale to assess limitations in physical activity and physical role functioning, a 5-point scale for pain and another for overall health, and a 6-point scale to assess mental health, vitality, and social functioning. The SF-12 produces a summary score each for mental health and physical health, which are able to differentiate between diagnostic groups and levels of severity of illness. Internal consistency in a sample of people experiencing homelessness demonstrated a Cronbach's alpha of 0.82 for physical health and 0.79 for mental health.</description>

    <measure>Mean change from baseline in mental health and physical health on the 12-item Short Form Survey (SF-12) at 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 is a 12-item questionnaire that has been investigated and utilized for measuring health status among people experiencing homelessness (Larson, 2002). It features categorical questions that assess limitations in role functioning as a result of physical and emotional health, as well as numerous Likert scale responses including a 3-point scale to assess limitations in physical activity and physical role functioning, a 5-point scale for pain and another for overall health, and a 6-point scale to assess mental health, vitality, and social functioning. The SF-12 produces a summary score each for mental health and physical health, which are able to differentiate between diagnostic groups and levels of severity of illness. Internal consistency in a sample of people experiencing homelessness demonstrated a Cronbach's alpha of 0.82 for physical health and 0.79 for mental health.</description>

    <measure>Cost-effectiveness analysis of peer support worker intervention as compared to usual care at 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The total mean costs for the usual care group will be subtracted from the total mean costs for the intervention group to provide the incremental cost (IC). The mean quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with the intervention and usual care groups will be calculated using the health state and associated health utility score from the Time 12 administration of the EQ-5D-5L, multiplied against the value of '1' representing a 12-month treatment effect/duration of peer support (or usual care). The mean QALY of the usual care group will be subtracted from the mean QALY of the intervention group to provide the incremental effectiveness (IE). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), representing the average cost per additional QALY gained, will be calculated by dividing IC by IE (Neumann, Sanders, Russell, Siegel, &amp; Ganiats, 2017).</description>

    <measure>Survival analysis of health service use/outcomes using administrative health data</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of assignment until the date of first emergency department readmit, second emergency department readmit, and admission to an inpatient service, assessed up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will examine time to first emergency department readmit, time to second emergency department readmit, and time to admission to an inpatient service. A failure is considered to have occurred if the participant visits the emergency department after the enrollment presentation or is admitted to hospital through the emergency department.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Non-parametric survival analysis using administrative health and peer support questionnaire data to evaluate changes in health care provision between contacts with the peer support worker</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of assignment until the date of each subsequent visit, assessed up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will examine the amount of procedures, tests and time spent within an emergency department as a crude measurement of health needs. At first presentation, an increase in these values in the intervention group relative to the usual care group is suggestive that the peer support worker is providing information to the medical team that improves care. At subsequent visits though, if our intervention is effective at improving un-met health needs, the opposite relationship should occur. We will augment these administrative measures with aspects of an 11-item peer support worker survey which will further document interactions with the medical team.</description>

    <measure>Survival analysis of mental health and physical health on the SF-12</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of assignment until the date of scoring one standard deviation below mean and two standard deviations below mean for each of physical health score and mental health score, respectively, assessed up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Survival analysis will be also conducted on the SF-12 to evaluate how quickly mental and physical health degrades in our sample after the initial intervention. We will count an occurrence of one and two standard deviations below mean as a failure in our sample and will perform this analysis on both physical and mental well-being summary scores separately.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Non-parametric survival analysis using data on address of residence to evaluate changes in discharge planning between contacts with the peer support worker</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of assignment until the date of address change designating a stay at a shelter or address change from previous contact, assessed up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess discharge planning as a cause for improved health care system use. One reflection of improved discharge planning may be stability in the participant's address. Our strategy for data collection will include a question on the participant's address, and any other changes in their contact information. We will employ non-parametric survival analysis to see if our intervention is 1) Associated with reduced stays at shelters, and 2) Associated with the same address as previous contact. An outcome is considered a failure if the person is staying at a shelter or has changed addresses from previous contact.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the intervention group will be seen by the peer support worker during their stay in the emergency department. The goal of the peer support worker's practice is to address the participant's wellness from a holistic point of view that includes their relationships, connections to the community, general well-being, and sense of empowerment, with an overall focus on quality-of-life goals (Sunderland et al., 2013). The peer support worker will provide a multi-faceted intervention, which aims to foster a peer-to-peer relationship encompassing elements of empathic communication, brief supportive counseling, advocacy for non-medical needs in hospital, liaising and collaborating with medical and nursing staff, motivational interviewing, and connection with programs in the community.</description>
