  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation is a prospective, multi-center clinical investigation. It is anticipated
      that a total of 80 subjects will be enrolled. Neither subjects nor investigators are blinded
      to treatment and the clinical investigation includes a historical control which will be
      compared to the T2 Alpha Tibia Nailing System.

      Total duration of enrollment, 12 month follow-up and analysis is expected to take 31 months.
      The clinical investigation has been designed to follow the surgeon's standard of care for
      tibia fractured subjects, in addition to a 12 month follow-up visit.

      The primary endpoint of this clinical investigation is to confirm efficacy/performance at 12
      months, as measured by the SF-36 Physical Component Summary (PCS). Confirmation of
      efficacy/performance at 12 months will be based on an equal or higher (non-inferior) SF-36
      Physical Component Summary (PCS) result of the T2 Alpha Tibia Nailing System compared to the
      benchmark literature.

      The objective of this clinical investigation is to demonstrate the safety and
      efficacy/performance of the T2 Alpha Tibia Nailing System. Efficacy/performance of the
      procedure will be measured by an equal or higher (non-inferior) SF-36 Physical Component
      Summary (PCS) score result of the T2 Alpha Tibia Nailing System compared to the T2 Tibia
      benchmark literature at 12 months.

      In addition, demonstration of bone consolidation in correct alignment will be measured by
      Investigator assessment by 12 months. Safety of the T2 Alpha Tibia Nailing System will be
      demonstrated through reporting of device related intra-operative and post-operative Adverse
      Events/incidents by 12 months.

    <description>The primary endpoint of this clinical investigation is to confirm efficacy/performance at 12 months, as measured by the SF-36 PCS (36-Item Short Form Health Survey Physical Component Summary). The SF-36 PCS is a self-report measure of health status. SF-36 Physical Component Summary scores range from 0 to 100; higher SF-36 score results are linked to better subject results.
Confirmation of efficacy/performance at 12 months will be based on an equal or higher (non-inferior) SF-36 Physical Component Summary (PCS) result of the T2 Alpha Tibia Nailing System compared to the T2 Tibia benchmark literature.</description>

        Approximately 80 subjects are to be enrolled in this clinical investigation. Subjects
        participating in this clinical investigation will be recruited from the investigator's
        standard subject population, where all subjects presenting for treatment of tibial
        fractures will be evaluated for clinical investigation participation based on the
        eligibility criteria.

             requirements of this Clinical Investigation Plan;

          -  Subject is intended to be, treated with the Tibial Nail of the T2 Alpha Tibia Nailing
             System in accordance with the following legally cleared/ approved Indications for Use:
