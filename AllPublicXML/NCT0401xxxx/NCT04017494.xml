  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single ventricle defects make up the severe end of the congenital heart disease spectrum. The
      Fontan operation leads to a complete redirection of systemic venous blood outside of the
      heart and directly into the lungs. Patients with single ventricles suffer from multiple
      complications. Their survival has improved over the past decades, but is still severely
      compromised compared to the general population.

      Their evaluation includes echocardiography and functional status by history and/or exercise
      testing. In longer intervals or if echocardiography does not allow visualization of all
      cardiovascular structures, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is employed. Many patients also
      undergo more invasive cardiac catheterization.

      In single ventricle patients, cardiac imaging has to address the questions of the patency of
      the Fontan pathways, i.e. all systemic veins, the Fontan conduit, and the pulmonary arteries,
      and of the function of the single ventricle (including myocardial function and valve
      function).

      By using conventional imaging methods in Fontan patients, Ghelani et al. identified a
      CMR-based ventricular end-diastolic volume of &gt; 125 ml/m2 and an echocardiographic global
      circumferential strain (GCS) value of higher than -17% to be strong predictors for a combined
      adverse outcome of death or heart transplantation. While interobserver reproducibility of
      single ventricle ejection fraction is similarly high by echocardiography, CMR is better in
      reliably measuring ventricular mass and diastolic volume and can provide additional
      information by MR feature tracking (strain), T1 mapping, and 4D flow measurements. Several
      substances that can be measured in the peripheral blood are being increasingly investigated
      as biomarkers of heart failure.

      In conclusion, several advanced CMR sequences and new biomarkers have a potential role in the
      assessment and risk stratification of single ventricle patients. Every single published study
      has elucidated a particular use and aspect of these parameters, but broader correlations and
      prognostic values are still unclear.

      The investigators hypothesize that myocardial strain (by feature tracking), myocardial
      fibrosis (by T1 mapping), and intracardiac flow disturbances (by 4D flow) along with
      biomarkers are diagnostic for single ventricle dysfunction and correlate with known
      prognostic factors.

      This is a single center, prospective, observational cohort study. There will be no
      randomisation or blinding. Study setting: outpatients, cardiology clinic and radiology
      department, academic hospital. Every patient will be examined twice with a one-year interval
      (MR will only be repeated if clinically indicated).
