  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to use the new PET radioligand, 18F-MK-6240, to detect tau pathology in
      cognitive healthy and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) elders. The investigators will then
      examine the interactions between differential tau burden and performance on cognitive tasks,
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neural activation patterns, and other cognitive
      and behavioral measures. By investigating these relationships, the investigators hope to
      understand the cognitive and behavioral outcomes of tau deposition found in specific brain
      regions in cognitively normal/mildly cognitively impaired adults. Furthermore, the study aims
      to examine how the presence of tau may contribute to the risk of subsequent cognitive
      decline, neurodegeneration, and dementia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many cognitively healthy older adults have, upon post mortem evaluations, been found to have
      varying amounts of neurofibrillary tangles (tau) and beta-amyloid plaque deposits, which are
      the hallmark brain pathologies known to be associated with Alzheimer's disease and various
      other dementias. While some with these pathologies may not clinically express cognitive
      decline or dementia in their lifetime, human post-mortem studies suggest that increasing
      neurofibrillary tangle density correlates with neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment.

      Imaging tauopathy in-vivo provides an opportunity to examine neurocognitive correlates of
      differential levels of tauopathy in the brain, allowing to further qualify pre-clinical
      states of cognitive impairment. The investigators aim to investigate possible protective
      mechanisms, such as cognitive reserve, that may modulate the relationship between tauopathy
      and cognitive decline.
