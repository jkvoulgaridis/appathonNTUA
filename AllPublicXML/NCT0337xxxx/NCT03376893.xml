  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a rare disease occurring in an estimated 100,000 individuals,
      often poor and underserved, in the US. Silent and overt strokes contribute significantly to
      morbidity in adults with SCD, resulting in functional impairment, challenges with school and
      job performance, and premature death. Five NIH-funded randomized controlled trials have
      identified therapies to prevent silent and overt strokes in children with SCD, including
      monthly blood transfusion therapy (for preventing initial and recurrent strokes) and
      hydroxyurea (for preventing initial strokes). Despite the observation that at least 99% of
      children with SCD in high-income countries reach adulthood, and approximately 60% of adults
      will experience one or more strokes (~50% with silent strokes and ~10% with overt strokes),
      no stroke trials have established therapeutic approaches for adults with SCD. For adults with
      SCD, inadequate evidence-based guidelines exist for secondary stroke prevention strategies.
      Applying stroke prevention strategies in children may not be effective for stroke prevention
      in adults with SCD, particularly given the high rate of co-morbidities. Identifying subgroups
      of adults with SCD and higher incidence coupled with the contribution of established stroke
      risk factors in the general population (smoking, diabetes, obesity, renal disease) will
      provide the requisite data required for the first ever phase III clinical trials focused on
      secondary stroke prevention in adults. In three adult SCD centers, we will conduct a
      prospective cohort study to test the primary hypothesis that the incidence of infarct
      recurrence (stroke or silent stroke) or new strokes in adults with silent strokes treated
      with hydroxyurea will be greater than in those without strokes treated with hydroxyurea. We
      will test two secondary hypotheses: 1) adults with SCD and silent strokes have cognitive
      morbidity when compared to adults with SCD without silent strokes; and 2) adults with SCD and
      strokes receiving regular blood transfusion will have a higher incidence of infarct
      recurrence than those with SCD without strokes. The aims include Aim 1: Compare the incidence
      of new overt and silent strokes in adults with SCD and silent strokes to a comparison group
      of adults without silent strokes or overt strokes. Aim 2: Compare the cognitive morbidity of
      those with silent strokes and overt strokes to those without strokes. Aim 3: Compare the
      incidence of new overt and silent stroke in adults with SCD and overt strokes receiving
      transfusion to adults with SCD without silent or overt strokes treated with hydroxyurea. All
      clinical information and neuroimaging will be centrally adjudicated with masked and
      experienced neurology and neuroradiology committees. Data generated after completion of this
      proposal are critical for developing the first ever phase III trials for secondary stroke
      prevention therapies in adults with SCD.
