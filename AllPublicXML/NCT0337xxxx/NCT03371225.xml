  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims at understanding the mechanisms of optimized transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) (16 tDCS sessions combined with exercise)] on pain control. Optimized tDCS
      can lead to stronger engagement of the endogenous pain regulatory system that will ultimately
      lead to increased pain relief in patients with fibromyalgia (FM). Therefore, the
      investigators designed a 2x2 factorial mechanistic trial [tDCS (active and sham) and aerobic
      exercise (AE) (active and control)] to evaluate the effects of 4 weeks of tDCS coupled with
      exercise on the endogenous pain regulatory system assessed by conditioned pain modulation
      (CPM) and central sensitization as assessed by temporal slow pain summation (TSPS), and
      compared to either intervention alone and to no intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent evidence has suggested that FM pain can be related to deficits in pain endogenous
      regulatory control and that novel non-pharmacological interventions, such as tDCS can
      modulate this system and, consequently, reduce pain intensity. Widespread pain in FM is
      thought to represent enhanced pain sensitivity that is maintained by central mechanisms. This
      suggests changes in the descending pain control mechanisms and a possible relationship with
      the central sensitization phenomenon. Recent evidence has suggested that pain inhibitory
      pathways are affected in FM; thus, further understanding these pathways' role can
      significantly change how the treatment of this condition. In this study the investigators
      will test the effects of two interventions -tDCS and aerobic exercise - on the modulation of
      the endogenous inhibitory pain system in fibromyalgia.

    <measure>Conditioning Pain Modulation (CPM)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Involves two conditions, the test-stimulus and the conditioned-stimulus. We will first determine the pain-60 test temperature (which is the temperature that induces pain experience at a magnitude of 60 on a 60-100 NPS). Once determined the pain-60 temperature, we will administer the test stimulus, applied for 30 s at that temperature and subjects will be asked to rate their levels of pain intensity 3 times: at 10, 20 and 30s. Five minutes after delivering the test stimulus, for the conditioned-stimulus, the left hand of the subject will be immersed in a bath of water set at 10 to 12Â°C for 30 seconds. Then, the same pain-60 temperature will be applied on the right forearm of the subject (left hand will still be immersed), for 30s and subject will again be asked to rate their levels of pain intensity 3 times. CPM response will be calculated as the difference between the average of pain ratings from the test stimulus minus the average of pain ratings during the conditioned stimulus.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Temporal Slow Pain Summation (TSPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Heat pulses will be generated by a TSA-II Stimulator (Medoc Advanced Medical Systems, Ramat Yishai, Israel) delivered to the right dominant proximal volar forearm using an appropriate size embedded HP-thermode. The HP-thermode will deliver pulses rising/falling of 1-2-s, depending on subject's heat-evoked pain threshold, from adapting temperatures to peak temperatures, with a plateau of .7-s. Subjects will be trained to determine the temperature necessary to elicit pain-60 (see CPM protocol below) . Subsequently, they will receive 1 train of 15 repetitive heat stimuli at 0.4 Hz to the same area, in which by being suitable for eliciting TSPS in most subjects, allows the rating of individual pain stimuli and is unlikely to induce peripheral sensitization. TSPS will be calculated as the difference between heat pain rating after the 15th stimulus minus the 1st stimulus.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>TMS</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Single and Paired Pulse TMS will be used to measure cortical mapping and cortical excitability. We will investigate changes in cortical excitability evaluating the motor evoked potential (MEP) and the resting motor threshold (MT) as well as short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) using the paired-pulse technique.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EEG</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>EEG is a reliable tool to measure electrical activity in the brain. The use of EEG can identify features of cortical excitability and inhibitory activities, as well as thalamocortical rhythm's abnormalities. This is particularly important for understanding the processing of nociception, given that the power of different EEG bandwidths have been shown to be associated with the intensity of pain experience. EEG activity will be assessed in all participants using standardized procedures. The use of EEG in this protocol is exploratory and will be sampled using a 64 channel EGI system (EGI, Eugene, United States of America,). This is a portable, comfortable system that requires the placement of a cap with active electrodes. In total, this component of the visit is expected to take about 30 min typically. EEG will be collected with eyes open, eyes closed during rest and also with motor tasks (mental imagery, movement observation and actual movement).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Pain Intensity as Assessed by Modified Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) - short form</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI is a short self-assessment questionnaire that provides information on various dimensions of pain including how pain developed, the types of pain a patient experiences, time of day pain is experienced, as well as current ways of alleviating pain. The BPI also includes the VAS Pain scale, a simple 10- point scale (0 = ''no pain'', 10 = ''pain as bad as you can imagine'') measuring patients' worst pain and least pain, on average and at present time. The BPI provides information on the intensity of pain (the sensory dimension) as well as the degree to which pain interferes with function (the reactive dimension).</description>

    <measure>Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 21-item, multiple-choice questionnaire will be administered at the beginning of the study and at follow-up, in order to assess function, overall impact and symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 21-item, multiple-choice questionnaire will be administered at the beginning of the study and at follow-up to assess the presence and degree of depression in adults, as studies in chronic pain have found that depression can modulate pain perception.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication Use Questionnaire and Diary</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will obtain a medication use history at study entry using a standardized questionnaire similar to that used in our prior studies, and update this information at each subsequent visit. We will also monitor patient medication throughout the course of the study using a subject Medication Diary. Participants will be required to record medications daily in a pain medication diary. Participants will be instructed to keep the pain medication diary throughout the baseline, treatment, and follow-up period. This diary will be maintained until completion of the study.</description>

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 16-item, multi-purpose questionnaire that yields a profile of functional health and well-being scores. The aim is to compare the relative burden of the disease, and to differentiate health benefits produced by different treatments.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A self-report measure of patient-reported physical, mental, and social well-being. The aim is to assess what subjects are able to do and how they feel, and thus is an additional measure of the effectiveness of treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A self-report measure of the quality and patterns of sleep in adults. It assesses 7 components of sleep quality: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction over the last month. Scoring of the answers is based on a Likert scale from &quot;0&quot; (not during the past month) to &quot;3&quot; (3 or more times week). A total sum of &quot;5&quot; or greater indicates a &quot;poor&quot; sleeper. This instrument can be used to assess quality of sleep (i.e., poor or good sleep quality) in several time points of a given intervention (from baseline assessment to follow ups).</description>

    <measure>tDCS Adverse Effects Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>At the end of each stimulation session, subjects will complete a 5-point scale questionnaire that evaluates potential common adverse effects of tDCS (headache, neck pain, scalp pain, scalp burning sensation, tingling, skin redness, sleepiness, concentration, and acute mood change).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Exercise Adverse Effects</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>During each AE session, subjects will be monitored (HR variability). The session will be stopped if the HR is superior to 80% of HRmax, or if the patient presents any signs of discomfort. Also if the subject requests, the intensity can be reduced up to 50% of HR max or the duration can be reduced up to 15min. To evaluate the adverse effects of AE during the training, we will record any musculoskeletal symptoms, such as pain, fatigue, tingling or cardiovascular symptoms, such as shortness of breath. As recommended by the ACSM guidelines for AE in patients with FM, we will monitor the level of pain and fatigue continuously throughout the tests using the VAS. We will also follow the emergency procedure guidelines from the ACSM.</description>
