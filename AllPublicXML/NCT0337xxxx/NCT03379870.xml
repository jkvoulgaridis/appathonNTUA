      Purpose: Routine clinical care and pilot study data has shown evidence of postoperative
      hearing preservation in pediatric cochlear implant (CI) recipients. The primary aim of this
      study is to investigate speech perception performance in pediatric CI recipients with
      functional pre-operative hearing.

      Participants: Two cohorts of CI recipients aged 6 through 17 years who had pre-operative low
      frequency residual hearing. Subjects in Arm 1 will present with a post-operative low
      frequency pure tone average (125, 250, and 500 Hz) of ≤ 75 dB HL, and those in Arm 2 will
      present with a post-operative low frequency pure tone average (LFPTA) that exceeds 75 dB HL.

      Procedures (methods): Subjects will complete speech perception and quality of life testing
      during post-operative intervals. Subjects in Arm 1 will be evaluated with the hearing aid
      alone (HA-alone) and with combined electric-acoustic stimulation (EAS). Subjects in Arm 2
      will be evaluated with the CI-alone.

      As children with more residual hearing are receiving cochlear implants (CIs), there is an
      opportunity to preserve that hearing and provide combined electric and acoustic stimulation
      (EAS). The primary aim of this study is to investigate speech perception performance in
      pediatric CI recipients with functional pre-operative hearing. Specifically, the
      investigators intend to compare speech understanding using EAS and traditional full electric
      stimulation.

      While hearing preservation rates are good, they are not guaranteed. Children with progressive
      hearing loss may continue to lose hearing, even if they maintain some residual hearing
      immediately after surgery. As a secondary aim, the investigators intend to study outcomes in
      children who do not maintain residual hearing and are fit with traditional CI programming
      methods. Children with more residual hearing are being implanted, and this study design
      allows validation of outcomes in both populations.

      Subject enrollment will occur on the initial stimulation date. Those who have maintained a
      low frequency hearing average of 75 dB HL or better will be fit with a SONNET EAS device
      using combined acoustic and electric stimulation. Those who have not maintained low frequency
      hearing will be fit with a SONNET EAS device using electric stimulation only. Subjects will
      be followed at regular intervals throughout the year duration of the study and will be tested
      on measures of speech understanding in quiet, speech understanding in noise, quality of life,
      and discrimination of prosody or pitch changes.

    <measure>Mean CNC word scores, comparing EAS and CI-alone conditions at 12 months post stimulation (Arm 1 to Arm 2).</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>The CNC word list is established as a standard test of speech perception outcomes. Results for EAS and CI-alone conditions at 12 months post stimulation will be compared (Arm 1 to Arm 2). Lower scores indicate a poorer outcome and higher scores a better outcome.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean BKB-SIN SNR-50 scores, comparing EAS and CI-alone conditions at 12 months post stimulation (Arm 1 to Arm 2).</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post-stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>Sentences and babble will be presented from the same speaker. An average score known as the SNR-50 will be obtained in both conditions. The SNR-50 score is an estimate of the signal-to-noise ratio associated with 50% correct based on word-level scoring. Results for EAS and CI-alone conditions at 12 months post stimulation will be compared (Arm 1 to Arm 2). In this test, lower scores indicate a better outcome and higher scores a poorer outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Pediatric SSQ scores, comparing Pre-operative and 12 month post stimulation scores in both groups.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post-stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>The Speech, Spatial, and Qualities of Hearing (SSQ) Scale assesses performance in three domains, hearing speech in quiet and noise environments (9 items), spatial or directional hearing (5 items) and sound qualities (8 items), which address sound segregation and listening effort. Each item is rated on a 11-point scale, with 0 as the lowest possible performance and 10 as the highest.. Domain scores represent an average of item ratings. There is a version for children that will be used for this study. Lower scores indicate a poorer outcome, and higher scores a better outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months post-stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>Mean single word scores in quiet, comparing scores obtained pre-operatively and in the primary post-operative listening condition in both groups. Lower scores are a poorer outcome than higher scores.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in speech and language outcomes, comparing Pre- and post-stimulation scores in both groups.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post-stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>Mean articulation, expressive, and receptive language scores, comparing pre-operative scores to the 12 month test point for both groups. These tests are normed. Scaled scores will be compared. Low scores are indicative of a poorer outcome, and higher scores a better outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months post-stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>The Question/Answer Task identifies how well a child can perceive changes in pitch that change the meaning of a sentence. Percent correct scores will be obtained and compared. Lower scores indicate a poorer outcome, and higher scores a better outcome.</description>
