  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests two posters that teach people about contraception: one designed by the
      Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and one designed by the researchers. The investigators
      hypothesize that the new poster will have more increased (1) contraceptive knowledge, (2)
      willingness to use effective contraception, and (3) perceived pregnancy risk than the CDC
      poster. This study will expand useful knowledge because contraceptive knowledge, willingness
      to use effective contraception, and perceived pregnancy risk have been shown to affect
      women's likelihood of using contraception. If the investigators learn how to increase these
      factors, the investigators could theoretically reduce women's risk of unplanned pregnancy.

      The investigators will test this hypothesis by recruiting N=1000 women to complete an online
      survey using Amazon Mechanical Turk. These women will complete a survey that will first
      measure their initial contraceptive knowledge, willingness to use effective contraception,
      and perceived pregnancy risk. Then women will randomly be shown one of the two posters. Then,
      the investigators will measure their contraceptive knowledge, willingness to use effective
      contraception, and perceived pregnancy risk again. The investigators will use statistical
      tests (a t-test) to find out whether there are significant changes in these three outcomes
      for either of the posters, and whether one poster does a better job of changing these
      outcomes than the other.

      Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness of two posters' ability to improve contraceptive
      knowledge, willingness to use effective contraception, and pregnancy risk perceptions. One of
      these posters was developed by the CDC. The other was developed by the research team in a
      previous study using cognitive interviews with N=26 women. The new poster is designed to meet
      the informational needs of women with low numeracy (i.e. low facility with math) and women
      who do not use contraception.

      Participants: The investigators will recruit N=1020 women aged 18-44 who can speak and read
      English, have been sexually active in the last three months, and who are not pregnant or
      trying to get pregnant.

      Procedures (methods): The investigators will use Amazon Mechanical Turk to recruit
      participants. Participants will take one survey. The survey will first ask baseline questions
      to assess contraceptive knowledge, willingness to use effective contraception, and perceived
      pregnancy risk. Participants will then be randomly shown one of the two posters. Then
      post-exposure questions on the three outcomes will be asked.

      The investigators test the hypotheses that before compared to after exposure, the mean scores
      for (1) contraceptive knowledge, (2) willingness to use effective contraception, and (3)
      perceived pregnancy risk will increase more for the new fact sheet than for the CDC sheet.

      The investigators also collect the following covariates: age, race/ethnicity, education,
      income, insurance type, insurance coverage of contraception, numeracy (facility with math),
      health and safety contraindications to contraceptive use, sexual orientation, parenthood,
      years since first sex, relationship status, prior exposure to CDC sheet, and pregnancy
      avoidance intensity. The investigators will compare whether the covariates are balanced
      between the randomized groups and the US population using two-sample t-tests, chi-squared, or
      nonparametric tests as appropriate. If the unbalance is statistically significant, the
      investigators will include the covariate in the regression to compare the adjusted difference
      between treatments. The investigators use two-sample t-tests to test our hypotheses. The
      investigators will also test for subgroup differences in our outcomes based on our covariates
      using a Chow test.

      The investigators will first test survey mechanics (correct coding, correct links) on N=20
      women. The investigators will survey N=1000 women for data analysis.

    <description>The CKA is a 25-item tool covering knowledge gaps like long-acting reversible contraceptives, emergency contraception, common myths, and efficacy rates which will be used to determine contraception knowledge. One point is added for each correctly answered question for a total possible score of 25. Higher scores reflect greater contraceptive knowledge.</description>

    <measure>Change in Effective Contraception Preference Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 15-20 minutes after baseline (1 minute after exposure to a poster)</time_frame>
    <description>Women will be asked whether they are planning on switching contraceptive methods in the next year and which methods of contraception they would hypothetically consider using if they were to switch contraceptive methods within the next year. They are then asked to rank the methods in order of how likely they would be to use each method. A woman's &quot;contraceptive preference&quot; is the method that she says she would be most likely to use. Methods will be scored from 0-3: '0' for no method, '1' for ineffective methods like condoms, '2' for effective methods like the Pill, and '3' for highly effective methods like Intrauterine Devices (IUDs). Positive scores reflect improvements in the effectiveness of the contraceptive method that women say they are likely to use.</description>

    <measure>Change in Perceived Pregnancy Risk Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 15-20 minutes after baseline (2 minutes after exposure to a poster)</time_frame>
    <description>Women are asked what their chances of getting pregnant this year are (very high=4, high=3, moderate=2, low=1, very low=0). A good outcome in terms of reducing the risk of unprotected sex and unplanned pregnancy would be increased perceived pregnancy risk as reflected in a higher score.</description>

        <description>Women will be asked whether they are planning on switching contraceptive methods in the next year and which methods of contraception they would hypothetically consider using if they were to switch contraceptive methods within the next year. They are then asked to rank the methods in order of how likely they would be to use each method. A woman's &quot;contraceptive preference&quot; is the method that she says she would be most likely to use. Methods will be scored from 0-3: '0' for no method, '1' for ineffective methods like condoms, '2' for effective methods like the Pill, and '3' for highly effective methods like Intrauterine Devices (IUDs). Positive scores reflect improvements in the effectiveness of the contraceptive method that women say they are likely to use.</description>

        <title>Change in Mean Accuracy of Perceived Pregnancy Risk Score</title>
        <description>Women are asked what their chances of getting pregnant this year are (very high, high, moderate, low, very low). This response is compared to the most effective contraceptive method women reported using in the past three months using the same categories of effectiveness as in the &quot;change in effective contraception preference score&quot; outcome. Women received a score of 1 if their perceived pregnancy risk was accurate based on their current contraceptive method and a score of 0 if it was inaccurate. Women's perceived pregnancy risk was accurate if: they used a highly effective method and they said they were at very low risk; if they used an effective method and they said they were at low or moderate risk; if they used a less effective method and said they were at moderate or high risk; or if they used no method and said they were at very high risk. A good outcome would be increased accuracy of perceived pregnancy risk as reflected by a higher score.</description>
