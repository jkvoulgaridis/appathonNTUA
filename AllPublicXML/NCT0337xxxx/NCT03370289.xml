      The drug being tested in this study is called BLB-750 that is a vaccine for pandemic
      influenza infection. This study will evaluate immunogenicity and safety of two intramuscular
      vaccinations with BLB-750 at 3-week intervals in healthy Japanese adults. The study will
      enroll 55 participants. BLB-750 will be administered in opened manner:

      - Two intramuscular vaccinations of BLB-750 at 3-week intervals, 0.5 mL

      This trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this study will be
      43 days, starting on the day of first vaccination. Participants will make multiple visits to
      the clinic, including 21 days after the first vaccination and 21 days after the second
      vaccination.

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>
