  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well cabozantinib works in treating patients with adrenal
      cortex cancer that has spread to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or other places in the body, and
      cannot be removed by surgery. Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate progression free survival at 4 months.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Best overall response rate. II. Overall survival (OS). III. Toxicity assessment by the
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (V)4.0.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Pharmacokinetics and cabozantinib serum levels to assess correlation with response to
      therapy.

      II. Steroid hormone biomarkers as markers of disease response. III. Study the effect of
      cabozantinib on immune markers by obtaining optional biopsy and blood samples collections at
      baseline, during therapy and at time of progression.

      IV. Pharmacogenomics of drug disposition gene variants that potentially influence
      cabozantinib pharmacokinetics (PK).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cabozantinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30-37 days.
