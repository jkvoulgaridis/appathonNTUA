  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory arthritis with substantial variation in clinical
      features. We propose a multicenter collaborative approach to better understand the phenotypes
      and current management of PsA in the United States.The central goal of this proposal is to
      obtain the data necessary to design a pragmatic trial in PsA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory arthritis that can be associated with
      devastating outcomes including irreversible joint damage. The management of a patient with
      PsA is extremely challenging due to the high degree of phenotypic heterogeneity. The ultimate
      goal of this proposal is to prepare pragmatic trials in PsA trials that will encompass all
      relevant subgroups of patients. The aims of this study specifically focus on responses to
      biologic therapy among patients with PsA and determining the optimal set of outcome measures
      for PsA trials.

      Approximately 40 mL (4 tubes) of blood will be drawn at each of 2 visits. The blood and
      information collected throughout this study will be used to build a repository for future
      research projects. The de-identified information stored in the redcap will available only to
      the study teams at each of the sites involved in this study and to those PIs for future
      research. Blood samples will be processed and stored at individual sites. De-identified blood
      samples may be shipped to a central location for further testing on bio-markers of treatment
      response and disease progression.

      Participants may retract permission and ask that their samples be destroyed. Information from
      these samples is exploratory and will not be shared with participants or included in medical
      records

    <ipd_description>All four institutions use the Epic electronic medical record system and have existing REDCap databases. For the purpose of this study and use in future studies, we will build a PARC Core REDCap Database. All four institutions will have access to this Core REDCap Database with designated data use agreements. The PARC Core REDCap Database will then be populated from each of our existing institutional RedCap databases. Personal identifiers (name, medical record number) will not be stored as a part of this dataset. Instead, personal identifiers will remain within each individual institution and only de-identified data placed in the Core REDCap database. To ensure the protection of the subjects and data integrity, we will maintain the highest security settings for the Core REDCap Database.</ipd_description>
