  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large number of studies have shown that patients feel more satisfied with hydromorphone in
      the pain management. and a systematic review found that hydromorphone may be better suited
      than morphine for titration of acute analgesia. However, current researches on intraveneous
      opioid titration for cancer pain such as hydromorphone are relatively insufficient in China.
      Therefore, we conduct a prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled study to assess the
      efficacy and safety of comparing patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) versus non-PCA
      intravenous hydromorphone titration for severe cancer pain.

      The opioid dose for individual with cancer pain to provide adequate relief of pain with an
      acceptable degree of side effects is variable. Opioid titration is a process to obtain the
      tailored dose. Conventional titration is administered by a clinician or nurse. PCA is that
      patients control cancer pain by self-administration of intravenous opioids using programmable
      pump. The aim of our study is to evaluate the efficacy of PCA titration versus conventional
      titration intravenously for severe cancer pain (10-point numerical rating scale, NRS ≥ 7).
      Injectable Hydromorphone was selected as pharmaceutical analgesics, which works as well as
      morphine and oxycodone and had similar side effects.

The time needed to successful titration was extended to achieve satisfied pain control again if NRS pain score ≥ 7 after satisfied pain control within 24 hours. The failure of successful titration was defined that satisfied pain control does not achieve within 24 hours.</description>

    <description>The Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) is used to assess the severity of pain. The scale represents pain levels in 0-10 numbers, with 0 indicating no pain and 10 indicating the most severe pain. Ask the patient to choose the number that best represents his or her pain level, or ask the patient to ask: How severe is your pain? The health care provider selects the appropriate number based on the patient's description of the pain. 1-3 points indicate mild pain, 4-6 points indicate moderate pain, and 7-10 points indicate severe pain. &quot;The mean NRS pain score of 24 hrs&quot; is defined as the sum of the scores within 24 hours divided by the number of evaluations within 24 hours.</description>
