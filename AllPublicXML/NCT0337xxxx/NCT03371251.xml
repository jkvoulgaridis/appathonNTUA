  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of repeat
      doses of BOS161721 (20 milligrams [mg], 60 mg, and 120 mg) administered subcutaneously in
      adult participants with moderately to severely active Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) on
      limited background standard of care treatment, in order to estimate the optimal dose.

      BOS161721 at the chosen dose will be compared to placebo for response on the SLE Responder
      Index 4, with sustained reduction of oral corticosteroids, in the same participant
      population.

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence experienced by a study participant, whether or not considered drug related by the principal investigator. AEs are unfavorable changes in a general condition, subjective or objective signs or symptoms, worsening of pre-existing concomitant disease, and clinically significant abnormality in laboratory parameters observed in a participant in the course of a clinical study. Non-serious Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) manifestations or abnormal laboratory results related to SLE disease activity will not be recorded as AEs unless they meet the definition of serious AEs (SAEs).</description>

    <description>The SRI-4 is a composite index of SLE disease improvement that consists of scores derived from the SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) and the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) 2004 Index. Response based on the SRI-4 is defined by: 1) ≥ 4-point reduction in the SLEDAI-2K global score; 2) no new severe disease activity (BILAG A organ score) or more than 1 new moderate organ score (BILAG B); and 3) no deterioration from baseline in the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) by ≥ 30 millimeters. The SRI-4 response in participants with moderate to severe SLE is associated with broad improvements in clinical and participant-reported outcomes. SRI-5 and SRI-6 are composite indices of SLE disease improvement that consist of scores derived from the SLEDAI-2K and the BILAG 2004 Index. The SRI-5 and SRI-6 are computed with a minimal five-point or six-point improvement in SLEDAI-2K being required, respectively.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline; Day 210</time_frame>
    <description>The BILAG-2004 index is an organ-specific 97-question assessment based on the principle of the doctor's intent to treat. Only clinical features attributable to SLE disease activity are recorded and based on the participant's condition in the last 4 weeks compared with the previous 4 weeks. BILAG A is the score for severe arthritis manifested by observed active synovitis defined by both swelling and tenderness in ≥ 6 joints with marked loss of functional range (LOFR) of movements and significant impairment of basic activities of daily living that has been present on several days (≥ 4 days) cumulatively over the past 30 days, including at the time of the screening visit. BILAG B is the score for moderate arthritis, tendonitis or tenosynovitis, defined as tendonitis/tenosynovitis, or active synovitis defined by both swelling and tenderness in ≥ 3 joints, (observed or through patient history), with some LOFR of movements manifested by effects on instrumental activities of daily living.</description>

    <description>The CLASI is a comprehensive tool for the assessment of disease activity and damage in cutaneous lupus, shown to be valid, reliable, and sensitive to changes in disease activity. Response is defined as 50% improvement from baseline in &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; scores.
