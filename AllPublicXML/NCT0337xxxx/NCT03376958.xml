      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Apatinib for patients
      with Relapsed Refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with relapsed /refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma usually have a bad
      prognosis. These patients cannot be treated successfully with the conventional chemotherapy
      of CHOP. Apatinib is a new type of oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR-2.The
      investigators have been proceeding this trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Apatinib
      in the patients with relapsed refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma.

    <description>Apatinib, a novel small molecule vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, have shown remarkable efficacy in many solid cancers. The result of our study presented that apatinib might have a rapid, safe and high efficacy on lymphoma patients.</description>
