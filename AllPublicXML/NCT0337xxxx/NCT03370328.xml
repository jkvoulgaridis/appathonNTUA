  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if aromatherapy (essential oil) is effective at
      reducing up-set stomach and vomiting after surgery and in reducing the need for up-set
      stomach medications

      If participants decide to take part in this study, they will be asked to use choose a small
      nasal inhaler from a bag, open the sealed package, and inhale from the nasal inhaler 3 times,
      inhaling through the nose and exhaling through the mouth, just prior to entering the
      operating room. During recovery in the Post-operative acute care unit (PACU), nausea severity
      will be rated using a 0-3 scale where zero indicates no nausea.

      If your score is 1-3, participants will be instructed/assisted in using a nasal inhaler 3
      times, inhaling through the nose and exhaling through the mouth. After 5 minutes, nausea
      scores will be collected again and if the score is the same or higher, participants will be
      asked to use the nasal inhaler again in the same manner as before. If their nausea has not
      resolved after the second use, they will be give anti-nausea medication that a surgeon
      ordered. This process will be repeated again whenever you complain of nausea, until they are
      discharged from the hospital.

    <description>The study product is a commercial essential oil product and nasal inhaler. It is to be prepared by a trained, independent individual who will add 4 drops of one of the three oils/oil combinations. The subject will be instructed to twist off the cap and position inhaler in such a way as to allow the subject to inhale the vapors; it can be reused for multiple administrations. Essential oils have been the subject of other studies in treating nausea. If nausea is unrelieved, treatment will progress to the ordered antiemetic.</description>
