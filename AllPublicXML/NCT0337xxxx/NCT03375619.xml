    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed as a long-term follow-up study of participants who will receive
      genetically modified autologous CAR-T cells as part of clinical trial at the Medical College
      of Wisconsin/ Froedtert Hospital-- Phase 1 Study of CAR-20/19-T Cells in Patients with
      Relapsed Refractory B Cell Malignancies (NCT03019055).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to follow participants receiving cluster of differentiation (CD) 20 /
      cluster of differentiation (CD) 19 lentiviral modified CAR-T cells (CAR-20/19-T cells) from
      years 2 to 15 post-treatment for persistence of CAR-T cells, development of secondary
      malignancies, or other medical complications.
