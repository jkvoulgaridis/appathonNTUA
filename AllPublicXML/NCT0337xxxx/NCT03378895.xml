  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The state of health in France appears to be good with regard to major indicators such as life
      expectancy at birth.

      However, France is characterized by a high standardized rate of premature mortality (deaths
      occurring before the age of 65) in comparison with other European countries, with
      geographical disparities. Between 2006 and 2010, the standardized rate of premature mortality
      was higher in Auvergne than the national average.

      Chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancers and / or metabolic diseases
      (including diabetes and obesity) are the main causes of these premature deaths. These
      diseases have several causes: they depend on the genetic heritage, the way of life and the
      environment. Family history is a known risk factor for these chronic diseases. Eating habits,
      insufficient physical activity or physical inactivity, excessive drinking and smoking which
      promote the occurrence of these chronic diseases are the main risk factors that we can
      modify. Preventive measures are known and are regularly the subject of public health plans
      and awareness campaigns targeting lifestyles modification of the populations. These
      prevention campaigns affect entire population, while the risk factors for chronic diseases
      are different from one to another, this encourages personalization of preventive measures.
      The CEPPPIA pilot study falls within this framework and aims to evaluate the feasibility of
      setting up an individualized prevention program on the modification of health behaviors among
      people aged 35 to 55, who has a moderate risk of developing chronic diseases and residing in
      Auvergne territory.
