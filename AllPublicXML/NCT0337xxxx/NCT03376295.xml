    <description>The number of observed patients with first COPD exacerbation after cohort entry was reported. The event of time to first COPD exacerbation to occur after cohort entry was defined as a hospitalization for COPD (severe exacerbation) or the prescription of an oral corticosteroid, namely prednisolone (moderate exacerbation) to occur after cohort entry with one-year follow-up, from the as-treated analysis.</description>
