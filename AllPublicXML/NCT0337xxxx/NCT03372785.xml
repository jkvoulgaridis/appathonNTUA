  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of percutaneous coronary intervention
      (PCI) on cardiac function in multi-vessel disease patients with concurrent chronic total
      occlusion (CTO) lesion.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be prospectively recruited who meet the following criteria: (1)
      angiographically diagnosed with MVD concurrent with CTO; (2) previously diagnosed with
      myocardial infarction, or suffered myocardial necrosis of the CTO artery determined using
      cardiac magnetic imaging. Patients presenting with no necrosis of myocardial tissue in the
      territory of the CTO will be excluded. Recruited patients will be randomized into two groups:
      those undergoing PCI of only the non-CTO artery (non-CTO PCI group), and those undergoing PCI
      of the non-CTO artery concurrently with the CTO artery (CTO-PCI group). The primary outcome
      assessed will be the change in cardiac function evaluated via CMR at a 12-month of follow-up
      appointment, which will be compared to a baseline measurement. Secondary outcomes include
      occurrence of major cardiac events, CMR-assessed myocardial viability in the CTO-supplied
      territory, and quality of life assessed by Seattle angina questionnaire, Patient Health
      Questionnaire 9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 after 12-month follow-up.
