  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are proposing a small randomized clinical trial in which 100 substance users will complete
      the existing Psychotherapy Development Center (PDC) pretreatment assessment battery as well
      as a novel battery of assays to evaluate cognitive-affective functioning. After completing
      pretreatment assessments, participants will be randomized to either a (1) cognitive
      remediation program (training tasks) specifically designed to address cognitive-affective
      dysregulation or (2) control tasks (verbal fluency tasks). Tasks will be completed twice per
      week for 4 weeks, after which assessment batteries will be repeated. Finally, we will
      evaluate real-world behavior and the durability of the training via a one-month follow-up,
      which will include assessment of substance use as well as the cognitive-affective battery.

  <detailed_description>

      Participants will be 100 individuals (aged 18 to 50) enrolled in outpatient (non-
      methadone/buprenorphine) treatment for any substance use disorder (other than PCP) at the
      Substance Abuse Treatment Unit in New Haven. As the goal of this project is to develop
      interventions that address self-regulation across multiple disorders, we will recruit
      individuals who have a range of substance use disorders and levels of severity. Our primary
      Specific Aim will be to evaluate the efficacy of the cognitive-remediation program relative
      to the control condition control on the indicators of cognitive-affective functioning and
      substance use, testing the hypothesis that individuals randomized to the cognitive
      remediation program will demonstrate improved functioning on the cognitive-affective battery
      as well as reduced real-world substance abuse. We will also explore potential moderators of
      response to the training, including baseline measures of cognitive-affective function.
