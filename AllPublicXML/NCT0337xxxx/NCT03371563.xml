  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will focus on elderly patients with early Lyme borreliosis with the aim of
      assessing clinical course, serological response and treatment outcome of the disease as
      compared to younger adults. Furthermore, the investigators will compare the prevalence of
      nonspecific symptoms among patients and among age-matched controls without a history of Lyme
      borreliosis.

    <measure>Occurrence of objective clinical manifestations of Lyme borreliosis and post-Lyme symptoms at 14 days postenrollment in patients treated for erythema migrans</measure>
    <time_frame>Study point: at 14 days post-enrollment.</time_frame>
    <description>At follow-up at 14 days patients were examined physically and were asked an open question about health-related symptoms. Symptoms that had newly develop or worsened since the onset of the multiple erythema migrans and which will had no other known medical explanation were regarded as post-Lyme symptoms.
Complete response to treatment will be defined as a return to pre-Lyme health status. Partial response will be defined as the presence of post-Lyme symptoms, while occurrence of new objective signs of Lyme borreliosis was interpreted as failure.</description>

    <measure>Occurrence of objective clinical manifestations of Lyme borreliosis and post-Lyme symptoms at 2 months postenrollment in patients treated for erythema migrans with doxycycline for 7 or 14 days</measure>
    <time_frame>Study point: at 2 months post-enrollment.</time_frame>
    <description>At follow-up at 2 months patients were examined physically and were asked an open question about health-related symptoms. Symptoms that hed newly develop or worsened since the onset of the erythema migrans and which will had no other known medical explanation were regarded as post-Lyme symptoms.
Complete response to treatment was defined as a return to pre-Lyme health status. Partial response will be defined as the presence of post-Lyme symptoms, while occurrence of new objective signs of Lyme borreliosis, and/ or persistence of borreliae as detected by culture of skin re-biopsy sample, and/or persistence of erythema migrans at more than 2 months post-treatment was be interpreted as failure.</description>

    <description>At follow-up at 6 months patients were examined physically and were asked an open question about health-related symptoms. Symptoms that had newly develop or worsened since the onset of the erythema migrans and which had no other known medical explanation were regarded as post-Lyme symptoms. Complete response to treatment was defined as a return to pre-Lyme health status.

    <measure>Occurrence of objective clinical manifestations of Lyme borreliosis and post-Lyme symptoms at 12 months postenrollment in patients treated for erythema migrans</measure>
    <time_frame>Study point: at 12 months post-enrollment.</time_frame>
    <description>At 12 months patients were examined physically and were asked an open question about health-related symptoms.
Symptoms that had develop or worsened since the onset of the erythema migrans and which had no other known medical explanation were regarded as post-Lyme symptoms. Complete response to treatment was defined as a return to pre-Lyme health status. Partial response was defined as the presence of post-Lyme symptoms, while occurrence of new objective signs of Lyme borreliosis, and/ or persistence of borreliae as detected by culture of skin re-biopsy sample, and/or persistence of erythema migrans at more than 2 months post-treatment was interpreted as failure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in occurrence of nonspecific symptoms from baseline to 6 months and to 12 months post-enrollment in patients with erythema migrans and control subjects</measure>
    <time_frame>Study points will be: at enrollment, at 6, and at 12 months post-enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Patients completed a written questionnaire asking whether they had had any of 8 nonspecific symptoms (fatigue, arthralgias, headache, myalgias, paresthesias, memory difficulties, concentration difficulties, irritability) within the preceding week. Control subjects completed the same 8-symptom questionnaire as the patients within 14 days of the examination date of the corresponding patient at enrollment, and again at 6 and 12 months. Patients and controls graded the severity of each individual symptom on a 10-cm visual analogue scale (10 = most severe).</description>
