        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject with a diagnosis of definite idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) that is
             levodopa-responsive according to the United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Society Brain
             Bank Criteria.

          -  Subject must be taking an optimized and stable regimen of oral medications for PD,
             which has remained stable and unchanged for at least 30 days before enrollment in this
             study.

          -  Subject is judged inadequately controlled on current therapy in the opinion of the
             Investigator and must experience a minimum of 2.5 hours of &quot;off&quot; time per day prior to
             Enrollment.

          -  Subjects with a MMSE score greater than or equal to 24 and considered by the
             Investigator to not have dementia.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) values.

          -  History of significant skin conditions or disorders that in the Investigator's opinion
             would interfere with the infusion of the study drug or could interfere with study
             assessments.

          -  Receipt of an investigational product within at least 6 weeks prior to study drug
             administration.

          -  Subjects with moderate to severe kidney disease.

          -  Consideration by the investigator for any reason that the subject is an unsuitable
             candidate to receive ABBV-951.

          -  Patient/caregiver that cannot demonstrate proper use of the devices (drug pump and
             wearable device) will not be allowed to participate.
