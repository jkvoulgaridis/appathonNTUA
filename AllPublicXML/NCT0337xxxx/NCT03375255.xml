  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK)
      of 5 escalating doses of SRP-5051 administered as a single dose to patients with DMD amenable
      to exon 51 skipping treatment.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial participant, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the investigational drug. An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended symptom, sign, disease, condition, or test abnormality that occurs during or after administration of the study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug.</description>
