  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aim is to pilot test and compare the effectiveness of achieving weight loss between
      implementation of: 1) the Diabetes Prevention Program Lifestyle Intervention (DPP-LI) and 2)
      Healthy Bodies Healthy Souls (HBHS) intervention which includes the same DPP-LI with the
      additional enhancement of working with Marshallese churches to implement
      organizational/institutional level changes to support the individual behavioral intervention
      of the DPP-LI.

    <intervention_model_description>Our aim is to pilot test a weight-loss intervention referred to throughout the proposal as Healthy Bodies Healthy Souls (HBHS) in a single arm study. The intervention includes the Diabetes Prevention Program Lifestyle Intervention (DPP-LI) with the additional enhancement of working with Marshallese churches to implement organizational/institutional level changes to support the individual behavioral intervention of the DPP-LI.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mean percent body weight (pounds) loss</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in mean percent body weight (pounds) loss from baseline to 6 months post-intervention (12 months post-initiation of the intervention). Participant weight (without shoes) was measured in light clothing to the nearest 0.5 lb using a calibrated digital scale.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mean HbA1c (%)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in mean HbA1c (NGSP %) from baseline to 6 months post-intervention (12 months post-initiation of the intervention). A Siemens analyzer (point of care) was utilized to calculate HbA1c levels for each participant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mean blood pressure (mmHg)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in mean blood pressure (systolic and diastolic, mmHg) from baseline to 6 months post-intervention (12 months post-initiation of the intervention). Blood pressure was measured with a sphygmomanometer, with participants seated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in eating habits self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in eating habits self-efficacy from baseline to 6 months post-intervention (12 months post-initiation of the intervention). This self-report measure assessed participants' self-efficacy related to their ability to make healthy eating decisions in the face of real or perceived barriers (e.g. while at social events, while watching TV, etc.). This 7-item measure was adapted from items in the original Weight Efficacy Life-Style (WEL) Questionnaire (Clark MM, Abrams DB, Niaura RS, et al. Self-efficacy in weight management. J Consult Clin Psychol. 1991;59(5):739-744). Each of the 7 items are measured via 3 response options (&quot;Yes/Completely Sure&quot;=2; &quot;Maybe/Not Sure&quot;=1; and &quot;No/Not Sure at All&quot;=0), giving a possible range of scores of 0-14, with higher scores indicating higher self-efficacy for making healthy eating decisions in spite of barriers.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in physical activity self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in physical activity self-efficacy from baseline to 6 months post-intervention (12 months post-initiation of the intervention). This self-report measure assessed participants' self-efficacy for exercising in the face of real or perceived barriers (e.g., bad weather, exercising alone, etc.). This 9-item measure was adapted from the Self-Efficacy for Exercise (SEE) Scale (Resnick B, Jenkins LS. Testing the reliability and validity of the Self-Efficacy for Exercise scale. Nurs Res. 2000;49(3):154-159. &amp; Resnick B, Luisi D, Vogel A, Junaleepa P. Reliability and validity of the Self-Efficacy for Exercise and Outcome Expectations for Exercise Scales with minority older adults. J Nurs Measurement. 2004; 12(3):235-247.) Each of the 9 items are measured via 3 response options (&quot;Yes/Completely Sure&quot;=2; &quot;Maybe/Not Sure&quot;=1; and &quot;No/Not Sure at All&quot;=0), giving a possible range of scores of 0-18, with higher scores indicating higher self-efficacy for exercising despite barriers.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in percentage of participants engaging in recommended levels of physical activity over the past month</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in percentage of participants engaging in recommended levels of physical activity from baseline to 6 months post-intervention (12 months post-initiation of the intervention). This self-report measure assessed participants' frequency of engaging in moderate and vigorous levels of physical activity over the past month (more than 4 times a week, 2-4 times a week, about once a week, etc.), and compares physical activity of the past month to participants' &quot;usual phsyical activity level.&quot; This 3-question measure was slightly adapted to include relevant cultural examples of physical activity from the DASH 2 Brief Physical Activity Questionnaire (available here: https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/media/studies/dashsodium/Forms_Manual.pdf?link_time=2018-11-13_18:06:05.776099).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in participants' sugar-sweetened beverage consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in participants' sugar-sweetened beverage consumption from baseline to 6 months post-intervention (12 months post-initiation of the intervention). This self-report measure assessed participants' sugar-sweetened beverage consumption over the past 30 days using two questions from 'Module 14: Sugar Sweetened Beverages' of the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in participants' fruit and vegetable consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in participants' fruit and vegetable consumption from baseline to 6 months post-intervention (12 months post-initiation of the intervention). This self-report measure assessed participants' fruit and vegetable consumption over the past three months using three questions adapted from: Shannon J, Kristal AR, Curry SJ, Beresford SA. Application of a behavioral approach to measuring dietary change: the fat- and fiber-related diet behavior questionnaire. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 1997;6(5):355-361.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in perceived family support for exercise and dietary habits</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in perceived family support for exercise and dietary habits from baseline to 6 months post-intervention (12 months post-initiation of the intervention). This self-report measure was adapted to examine changes in perceived family support for engaging in healthy exercise and dietary habits. This measure consists of a 6-item scale adapted from: Gruber KJ. Social support for exercise and dietary habits among college students. Adolescence. 2008;43(171):557-575. Each of the 6 items are measured via 3 response options (&quot;Often&quot;=2; &quot;Sometimes&quot;=1; and &quot;Never&quot;=0), giving a possible range of scores of 0-12, with higher scores indicating higher perceived family support for exercising and eating healthier.</description>
