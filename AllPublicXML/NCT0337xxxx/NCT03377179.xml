  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ABC-108 is a single-arm Phase IIA clinical study of ABC294640 (Yeliva ®, opaganib) alone and
      in combination with hydroxychloroquine sulfate (HCQ) in the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma
      (CCA). In Part 1 of this clinical study, all participants will be receiving ABC294640 and in
      Part 2 all participants will be receiving ABC294640 and HCQ to explore the drugs activity
      signal in CCA. The study drug, ABC294640 is an orally available inhibitor of the enzyme
      sphingosine kinase-2 (SK2). SK2 is an innovative target for anti-cancer therapy because of
      its critical role in sphingolipid metabolism, which is known to regulate tumor cell death and
      proliferation. ABC294640 also inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of
      cholangiocarcinoma cell lines. Furthermore, in a recent Phase I trial, ABC294640 demonstrated
      clinical activity in CCA patients. HCQ, is an orally available, FDA approved therapy for the
      treatment of malaria as well as discoid and systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid
      arthritis. It is also known as an inhibitor of autophagy, a pro-survival mechanism utilized
      by many cancers. Evidence indicates that inhibition of autophagy can increase the therapeutic
      activity of ABC294640 in CCA. In Part 1 of this study, ABC294640 will be continuously
      administrated orally, twice a day, in 28 day cycles. In Part 2, ABC294640 and HCQ will be
      continuously administrated orally (the safe and tolerable will be determined in the study) in
      28 day cycles. Administration of drug/s in both parts of the study will continue until
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or voluntary withdrawal initiated by the
      participants or physician.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label clinical study to explore the activity signal of ABC294640 and of
      ABC294640 and HCQ in adult subjects who have been diagnosed with unresectable
      cholangiocarcinoma either intra- perhilar or extra-hepatic. The study will be conducted at 5
      sites in the USA.

      For Part 1, a maximum of 39 participants evaluable for efficacy will be enrolled in the
      study. Eligible participants will receive ABC294640, 500 mg twice a day, continuously
      administered in 28 day cycles.

      Part 2 will be a single-arm Phase IIA study identical to Part 1 but treatment will consist of
      both ABC294640 together with HCQ. Additionally, Part 2, will consist of two phases: Phase I:
      accelerate HCQ dose-escalation run-in starting with a HCQ dose of 200 mg QD (once a day).
      Based on safety results, patient cohorts will be expanded, and dosing will continue to 200 mg
      BID (twice a day), 400 mg BID and 600 BID. At the end of Part2, Phase I, it will be
      determined what is the safe and tolerable HCQ dose for Phase II.

      For Part 2, up to 15 patients evaluable for safety and tolerability will be enrolled in Phase
      I component of Part 2; and 20 patients evaluable for efficacy in the Phase II component of
      Part 2. All eligible participants will receive ABC294640, 500 mg BID in addition to the
      determined HCQ dose, continuously administered in 28 day cycles.

      In addition to physical, neurological and eye exams (eye exams only for participants
      receiving HCQ), blood and urine samples will be routinely collected for safety and to
      determine response to the study drugs. Participants will be radiographically assessed for
      disease status every 2 cycles of treatment.

      Tumor biopsies, when accessible, will be obtained within 21 days prior to the beginning of
      treatment and again on the beginning of the second treatment cycle.

      All participants will be followed every 2 months for progression and survival for a maximum
      of 24 months after the last patient has been entered to the study. Follow up procedures may
      include physical examination, laboratory work and radiographic tumor assessment.

Part 2- identical to Part 1 with the exceptions: co-treatment of both ABC294640 and HCQ and study will consist of two phases: Phase I, a hybrid accelerate dose escalation run-in starting at HCQ dose of 200 mg QD. Based on safety results, patient cohorts will be expanded and dosing will escalate up to 600 mg BID. Phase II, treatment with ABC294640 and HCQ at the Phase I determined dose. Up to 15 participants evaluable for safety and tolerability will be accrued in Phase I and 20 participants evaluable for efficacy in Phase II, Part 2.</intervention_model_description>
