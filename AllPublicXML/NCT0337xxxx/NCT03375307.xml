  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well olaparib works in treating patients with urothelial
      cancer with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-repair defects that has spread to other places in the
      body (advanced or metastatic) and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment.
      Olaparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of olaparib in two cohorts of patients with metastatic/advanced
      urothelial carcinoma (UC) pre-selected by DNA-repair defects as measured by overall response
      rate (ORR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the effect of therapy on progression free survival (PFS). II. To describe the
      effect of therapy on overall survival (OS). III. To describe the safety/tolerability and
      drug-related toxicities of olaparib.

      IV. To follow patients without the pre-selected DNA-repair defects for survival.

      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the proportion of patients with DNA-repair pathway-mutated genes in
      metastatic UC (patient cohort referred for screening).

      II. To correlate levels of baseline circulating tumor cells (CTCs) with survival in untreated
      patients.

      III. To explore tumor-mutational profiles in metastatic tumor biopsies, saliva &quot;normal&quot; DNA,
      changes in tumor or peripheral immune characteristics, or tumor associated somatic mutation
      load in blood DNA in response to treatment.

      IV. To explore changes in plasma cytokines and correlate with clinical response.

      V. To correlate levels of circulating endothelial cells with clinical outcome. VI. To
      correlate levels of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) with clinical outcome.

      VII. To correlate peripheral immune and DNA damage response transcriptional signatures with
      clinical outcomes.

      VIII. To determine the effectiveness of using next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify
      DNA-repair pathway gene defects in tumor samples and circulating DNA and identify patients
      with UC suitable for PARP inhibition.

      IX. To determine the expression of Schlafen 11 (SLFN11) in tumor versus (vs.) stroma cells,
      and the potential tumor heterogeneity based on SLFN11 expression.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT I: Patients that have cancer-associated DNA-repair gene mutations receive olaparib
      orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT II: Patients that do not have cancer-associated DNA-repair gene mutations undergo
      blood sample collection at baseline.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, every 2 months for
      1 year, then every 3 months thereafter.

             durvalumab) (2-week washout from chemotherapy and 4-weeks washout from monoclonal
             antibodies is required)

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 1 (or Karnofsky &gt;=
             70%)

          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/mcL

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/mcL

          -  Patients must be able to tolerate oral medications and not have gastrointestinal
             illnesses that would preclude absorption of olaparib

          -  Pre-clinical data indicate that olaparib adversely affects embryofetal survival and
             development; therefore, women of child-bearing potential and their partners should
             agree to use two (2) highly effective forms of contraception throughout study

             and for three (3) months after the last dose of olaparib

               -  Note: Olaparib is a PARP inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or
                  abortifacient effects; because there is a potential risk for adverse events in
                  nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with olaparib, breastfeeding
                  should be discontinued if the mother is treated with olaparib

          -  Patients must provide tumor sample for mutation analysis or be willing to undergo
             mandatory screening biopsy

          -  Postmenopausal or evidence of non-childbearing status for women of childbearing
             potential: negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 28 days of study treatment

               -  Amenorrheic for 1 year or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal
                  treatments

               -  Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in the

             clinical trials or treatment during screening to determine eligibility

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events;
             a scan to confirm the absence of brain metastases is not required; patients with
             spinal cord compression unless considered to have received definitive treatment for
             this and evidence of clinically stable disease for 28 days

             weeks for enzalutamide or phenobarbital and 3 weeks for other agents

               -  Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to
                  regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference texts such as the
                  Physicians' Desk Reference; as part of the enrollment/informed consent
                  procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other
                  agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient
                  is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because olaparib is a PARP inhibitor agent

               -  Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
                  requirements

          -  Other severe, acute, or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             drug administration or that may interfere with the interpretation of study results
             and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for the
             study

          -  Immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients who are known to be serologically positive
             for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
