  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2798745 is a potent and selective transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channel
      blocker being investigated for the treatment of chronic cough. This is a multi-center,
      randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-period crossover study with a purpose to
      evaluate efficacy and safety of GSK2798745. Each subject will have 2 treatment periods, and
      will be randomized to one of the following treatments in each period: A) Placebo matching to
      GSK2798745 once daily for 7 days. B) 4.8 milligrams (mg) GSK2798745 on Day 1, followed by 2.4
      mg GSK2798745 once daily for 6 days. There will be a washout period of 14 to 21 days between
      the treatment periods. A maximum of 48 subjects will be enrolled in the study and the total
      duration of participation in the study will be maximum of 10 and a half weeks including
      follow-up visit.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-period crossover study. Each subject will be screened (screening may be conducted across more than 1 visit); each subject will have 2 treatment periods (each 7 days) with a washout period of 14 to 21 days between the treatment periods; and each subject will have a follow-up visit (within 7 to 10 days after their last dose). Each subject will be involved in the study for a maximum of 10 and a half weeks.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Total Cough Counts During Day Time Hours Following 7-days of Dosing</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 hours post-dose on Day 7 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Coughs were monitored using the VitaloJAK cough monitor. The total cough counts during day-time (10 hours) was calculated from the time of the monitor being attached i.e. immediately after dosing on Day 7 to 10 hours past the time of monitoring. Total cough counts were log-transformed prior to analysis. A non-informative prior was used. Analysis was performed using a Bayesian mixed model adjusting for subject-level and period-adjusted baselines, treatment and period. Subject-level baseline is defined as the mean of the two period-specific baselines. Period-adjusted baseline is defined as the difference between the period-specific baseline and subject-level baseline for each period. Posterior median and 95% credible interval is reported. All Subjects Population included all randomized participants who took at least 1 dose of study treatment. Participants were analyzed according to the treatment they actually received.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Study was conducted at 4 centers in the United Kingdom. Participants who met eligibility criteria entered a 2-period crossover study. Participants were randomized to either placebo or GSK2798745 in each Treatment Period (each 7 days, with a 14-21 day washout). Total duration of participation was 10.5 weeks. Study terminated on grounds of futility</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 34 participants were screened of which 17 failed screening and 17 participants were included in the study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Total Cough Counts During Day Time Hours Following 7-days of Dosing</title>
        <description>Coughs were monitored using the VitaloJAK cough monitor. The total cough counts during day-time (10 hours) was calculated from the time of the monitor being attached i.e. immediately after dosing on Day 7 to 10 hours past the time of monitoring. Total cough counts were log-transformed prior to analysis. A non-informative prior was used. Analysis was performed using a Bayesian mixed model adjusting for subject-level and period-adjusted baselines, treatment and period. Subject-level baseline is defined as the mean of the two period-specific baselines. Period-adjusted baseline is defined as the difference between the period-specific baseline and subject-level baseline for each period. Posterior median and 95% credible interval is reported. All Subjects Population included all randomized participants who took at least 1 dose of study treatment. Participants were analyzed according to the treatment they actually received.</description>

          <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, associated with liver injury and impaired liver function or any other situations as per medical or scientific judgment.</description>
