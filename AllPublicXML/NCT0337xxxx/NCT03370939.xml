  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is effective and safe for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) caused
      by large vessel occlusion (LVO) in major clinical trials. Whether the benefit of EVT in
      randomized trials could be generalized to clinical practice, especially in developing
      countries, remains unknown. The prospective Chinese ANGEL-ACT Registry (Endovascular
      Treatment Key Technique and Emergency Work Flow Improvement of Acute Ischemic Stroke) was
      established to evaluate the utilization, and subsequent outcomes of EVT treated AIS patients.
      This study is a multi-center, prospective registry study initiated by researchers, funded by
      National Key R&amp;D Program of China. A total of 2,000 patients with acute ischemic stroke will
      undergo endovascular treatment. The hypothesis was that favorable outcomes from clinical
      trials could be achieved in clinical practice in China.

    <description>EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. Rated level can be coded as a number 1, 2, or 3, which indicates having no problems for 1, having some problems for 2, and having extreme problems for 3. As a result, a person's health status can be defined by a 5-digit number, ranging from 11111 (having no problems in all dimensions) to 33333 (having extreme problems in all dimensions).A higher score indicates a better outcome.</description>
