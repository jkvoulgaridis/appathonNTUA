    <textblock>
      Oncogeriatric frailty assessment is a multifactorial approach to determine the most
      appropriate treatment for the health status of elderly cancer patients and this assessment is
      recommended for patients over 75 years of age.

      Oncogeriatric frailty is based on the SIOG-2 (International Society of Geriatric Oncology-2)
      clinical scale (assessing comorbidities, autonomy, nutrition, cognitive and thymic domains)
      defining 3 levels of frailty: (1) harmonious aging, (2) vulnerability (reversible stage), (3)
      fragility (irreversible stage).

      So,the management of very old or very frailty patients with poor tolerance or compliance to
      treatment, often requires to defer standard treatment and monitoring procedures. That is
      detrimental to these patients prognosis. By contrast with elderly or very old patients
      without frailty criteria, could benefit from more efficient procedures.

      More generally, frailty is associated directly with a cerebral impact on a cognitive or
      thymic status or indirectly with the cognitive or thymic impacts related with other
      components (nutritional or autonomy or walking poor status, comorbidities)
      18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) Positron Emission Tomography (PET), is routinely performed
      in follow-up cancer patients in most cases, including older patients, to detect neoplastic
      localizations on the whole body. It also accurately quantifies cerebral glycolytic metabolism
      when early brain recording is performed. Brain metabolism reflects the neuronal synaptic
      activity. It is generally decreased in particular brain areas due of neurodegenerative damage
      with a little or no symptom, of thymic involvement particular in depression or during
      accelerated cerebral aging of vascular origin. The impairment of the brain function of the
      elderly, as evidenced by 18F-FDG PET, is most often multifactorial, as frailty. Above all,
      brain changes are visualized with 18F-FDG PET much earlier than using neuropsychological
      tests, especially for cognitive impairment.

      Our hypothesis is that with 18F-FDG PET, performed routinely in the initial assessment in
      elderly patients with cancer, it is also possible to obtain reliable and objective parameters
      of brain function and frailty. 18F-FDG PET is already used to identify cognitive and thymic
      impairment. This exam would help to assess the frailty and to adapt as best oncologic
      treatments some of which can also be neurotoxic. 18F-FDG PET is therefore related to brain
      function in frail patients
