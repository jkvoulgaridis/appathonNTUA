      This study consists of 3 cohorts. Participants will be assigned to 1 of 3 dose cohorts with a
      minimum of 24 hours between dosing of each participant. Initially, 2 participants will be
      dosed in a cohort, with up to a total of 5 participants if the cohort is expanded based on
      safety and FVIII expression data.

      Dose escalation: After dosing first 2 participants in cohort 1 the decision will be made on
      the following: If week 4 FVIII activity levels of both participants are less than (&lt;) 2
      percent (%), then dose escalation to cohort 2 will be triggered with no further dosing in
      cohort 1. If FVIII expression (greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 2%) is observed in at least 1
      participant among the 2 participants the decision to escalate dose or expand the cohort with
      dosing of additional participants will be based on all available data through Week 14.

      Dose expansion: After dose escalation and administration of BAX 888 to the first 2
      participants in 3 cohorts: If sustained Week 14 FVIII levels are &gt;= 30% are not achieved in
      both participants (first 2 participants in cohorts 1 and 2) then escalation to immediate next
      cohort will be triggered after Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) review of all available safety
      and FVIII expression data. For cohort 3 dosing of additional participants will be paused
      until further review of available data. If sustained Week 14 FVIII levels are &gt;= 30% in at
      least 1 of the 2 participants (first 2 participant in cohort 1, 2, 3) then expansion of
      cohorts 1, 2 (with up to 5 participants), 3 (with up to 3 additional participants) will be
      initiated with dosing or study could be completed with no further dosing.

      23 APRIL 2020: Enrollment of new patients into this study has been paused due to the COVID-19
      situation. The duration of this pause is dependent on the leveling and control of the
      COVID-19 pandemic.

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered an investigational product (IP) that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment.
