    <textblock>
      The investigator proposes to evaluate Risk Reduction through Family Therapy (RRFT), which
      integrates: 1) an ecologically-based intervention for treatment of substance abuse behaviors
      in high risk adolescents, 2) exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for sexually
      assaulted youth, and 3) psychoeducation strategies for prevention of risky sexual behaviors
      and revictimization. The principal purpose of this research proposal is to evaluate the
      efficacy of RRFT in reducing the risk of drug abuse and other risky behaviors, PTSD, and
      revictimization among adolescents who have been sexually assaulted. The Research Plan will be
      conducted based on Stage 1a and Stage 1b from NIDA's Behavioral Therapies Development Program
      as described in Rounsaville, Carroll, &amp; Onken (2001). The final phase of the research will
      involve conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial of RRFT in a sample of adolescents,
      comparing primary outcome measures of youth receiving RRFT to youth receiving usual care in
      the community. Participants will be adolescents (12-17 years) who have experienced a sexual
      assault. Assessment of substance use and other risk behaviors, trauma-related
      psychopathology, and incidents of revictimization will be collected at pre- and post-
      treatment, as well as 6-week and 3-month follow-ups. Hierarchical Linear Modeling will be the
      primary method used to test study hypotheses. Development and evaluation of the proposed
      intervention will have significant implications for addressing public health problems in
      adolescent substance abuse and related high risk behaviors.
