  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emotional states of depression in association with ischemic heart diseases, such as
      myocardial infarction or unstable angina, are risk factors for subsequent cardiac events and
      mortality. However, the only psychological intervention trial attempting to reduce cardiac
      risk in depressed ACS patients showed that changes in depression did not translate into
      improved survival. Such intervention did not address issues such as lifestyle modification
      and improvement in psychological well-being, which were found to affect individual
      vulnerability to medical disease. Our research group has developed a well-being enhancing
      psychotherapeutic strategy, well-being therapy (WBT), which has been validated in a number of
      clinical trials. The aim of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of cognitive behavioral
      treatment (CBT) together with lifestyle modification and WBT in reducing cardiac risk in
      depressed and/or demoralized ACS patients compared to a standard clinical procedure of
      patients' management, the clinical management (CM). The same protocol will be carried out in
      two centres (Bologna and Torino). 100 patients after a first episode of myocardial infarction
      or unstable angina, meeting DSM-IV criteria for depressive disorders and DCPR criteria for
      demoralization will be randomized to one of two treatment groups: 1) CBT supplemented by
      lifestyle modification and WBT; 2) CM. In both groups, treatment will consist of twelve,
      45-minute sessions once a week. A two-year follow-up will be performed. It is expected that
      psychological treatment may significantly decrease cardiac morbidity and mortality at
      follow-up compared to clinical management. The findings may entail considerable preventive
      implications and possible large reductions in health costs.

      The same protocol will be carried out in the two participating centres (Maggiore Hospital in
      Bologna and San Giovanni Battista Hospital in Torino).

      Participants will be patients recovering from a first episode of acute myocardial infarction
      or unstable angina. Myocardial infarction will be documented by cardiac symptoms (presence of
      acute chest, epigastric, neck, jaw, or arm pain or discomfort or pressure without apparent
      non- cardiac source) and signs (acute congestive heart failure or cardiogenic shock in the
      absence of non-CHD causes) associated with ECG findings (characteristic evolutionary ST-T
      changes or new Q waves) and/or cardiac biomarkers (blood measures of myocardial necrosis,
      specifically CK, CK-MB, CK-MBm, or troponin, cTn). Instable angina will be documented by
      cardiac symptoms (chest pain lasting less than 20 minutes) with likely ECG findings
      (ST-segment depression and abnormal T-wave) in absence of myocardial necrosis biomarkers.

      Medically eligible patients involved in the study have to meet, when screened 30 days after
      their index event, the inclusion criteria

    <description>Paykel's 20-item change version of the Clinical Interview for Depression (CID) allows a comprehensive assessment of affective symptomatology and contains 20 items rated on 7-point scales with specification of each anchor point based on severity, frequency and/or quality of symptoms. It adds a dimensional description of mental suffering to traditional psychiatric nosography (DSM). The total score is obtained by adding each of 20 items and it may range from 20 to 140. The higher the score, the worse the psychological condition.</description>

    <description>Anxious symptoms subscale of Kellner's Symptom Questionnaire (SQ). SQ is a 92-item self-report questionnaire, which yields 4 main scales including 23 items each: &quot;depression&quot;, &quot;anxiety&quot;, &quot;hostility-irritability&quot; and &quot;somatization&quot;. This instrument helps the identification of self-perceived subclinical psychological distress. Answers are dichotomous (YES/NO or TRUE/FALSE) and rated with 0 or 1, therefore each scale score may range from 0 to 23. The higher the total score, the higher the psychological distress.</description>

          <description>The Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk index is calculated during hospital admission and provides an estimate of the probability of cardiac mortality both during hospitalization and within 6 months from hospital discharge in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
In order to calculate the GRACE risk index, the following data are needed: age, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, creatinine level, Killip class, cardiac arrest at admission, ST-segment deviation and elevated enzymes/markers.</description>

          <title>Symptom Questionnaire</title>
          <description>Kellner’s Symptom Questionnaire (SQ) is a 92-item self-report questionnaire, which yields 4 main scales including 23 items each: “depression”, “anxiety”, “hostility-irritability” and “somatization”. This instrument helps the identification of self-perceived subclinical psychological distress. Answers are dichotomous (YES/NO or TRUE/FALSE) and rated with 0 or 1, therefore each scale score may range from 0 to 23. The higher the total score, the higher the psychological distress.</description>

          <title>Psychological Well-Being scales</title>
          <description>The Psychological Well-Being scales (PWB), an 84-item questionnaire with a multidimensional structure, has been used to evaluate the six psychological well-being dimensions conceptualized by Carol Ryff (autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relationships, purpose in life, self-acceptance), which include 14 items each. Every item is defined in terms of high or low agreement on a 6-point Likert scale (ranging from 1 to 6); therefore each scale score may range from 14 to 84, with higher scores corresponding to greater psychological well-being.</description>

CBT involves several essential features: identifying and correcting inaccurate thoughts associated with depressed feelings (cognitive restructuring); helping patients to engage more often in enjoyable activities (behavioral activation); enhancing problem-solving skills; providing instruction and guidance in specific strategies for solving problems. The techniques included in WBT may be used in overcoming impairments in environmental mastery, purpose in life, personal growth, autonomy, self-acceptance and positive relations with others.</description>

          <title>Depression and Well-being Improvements After Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy and Well-Being Therapy as Assessed by Changes in Clinical Interview for Depression, Compared to Clinical Management</title>
          <description>Paykel's 20-item change version of the Clinical Interview for Depression (CID) allows a comprehensive assessment of affective symptomatology and contains 20 items rated on 7-point scales with specification of each anchor point based on severity, frequency and/or quality of symptoms. It adds a dimensional description of mental suffering to traditional psychiatric nosography (DSM). The total score is obtained by adding each of 20 items and it may range from 20 to 140. The higher the score, the worse the psychological condition.</description>

        <description>Anxious symptoms subscale of Kellner's Symptom Questionnaire (SQ). SQ is a 92-item self-report questionnaire, which yields 4 main scales including 23 items each: &quot;depression&quot;, &quot;anxiety&quot;, &quot;hostility-irritability&quot; and &quot;somatization&quot;. This instrument helps the identification of self-perceived subclinical psychological distress. Answers are dichotomous (YES/NO or TRUE/FALSE) and rated with 0 or 1, therefore each scale score may range from 0 to 23. The higher the total score, the higher the psychological distress.</description>

        <title>Depression and Well-being Improvements After Cognitive-behavioral Therapy and Well-Being Therapy Assessed by Changes in Psychological Well-Being Scales (&quot;Autonomy&quot; Dimension), Compared to Clinical Management</title>
        <description>Autonomy dimension of the Psychological Well-Being scales (PWB). PWB, an 84-item questionnaire with a multidimensional structure, has been used to evaluate the six psychological well-being dimensions conceptualized by Carol Ryff (autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relationships, purpose in life, self-acceptance), which include 14 items each. Every item is defined in terms of high or low agreement on a 6-point Likert scale (ranging from 1 to 6); therefore each scale score may range from 14 to 84, with higher scores corresponding to greater psychological well-being.</description>

        <description>Depressive symptoms subscale of Kellner's Symptom Questionnaire (SQ). SQ is a 92-item self-report questionnaire, which yields 4 main scales including 23 items each: &quot;depression&quot;, &quot;anxiety&quot;, &quot;hostility-irritability&quot; and &quot;somatization&quot;. This instrument helps the identification of self-perceived subclinical psychological distress. Answers are dichotomous (YES/NO or TRUE/FALSE) and rated with 0 or 1, therefore each scale score may range from 0 to 23. The higher the total score, the higher the psychological distress.</description>

        <title>Depression and Well-being Improvements After Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy and Well-Being Therapy as Assessed by Changes in Symptom Questionnaire (&quot;Hostility&quot; Subscale), Compared to Clinical Management</title>
        <description>Hostility symptoms subscale of Kellner's Symptom Questionnaire (SQ). SQ is a 92-item self-report questionnaire, which yields 4 main scales including 23 items each: &quot;depression&quot;, &quot;anxiety&quot;, &quot;hostility-irritability&quot; and &quot;somatization&quot;. This instrument helps the identification of self-perceived subclinical psychological distress. Answers are dichotomous (YES/NO or TRUE/FALSE) and rated with 0 or 1, therefore each scale score may range from 0 to 23. The higher the total score, the higher the psychological distress.</description>

        <title>Depression and Well-being Improvements After Cognitive-behavioral Therapy and Well-Being Therapy Assessed by Changes in Psychological Well-Being Scales (&quot;Environmental Mastery&quot; Dimension), Compared to Clinical Management</title>
        <description>Environmental mastery dimension of the Psychological Well-Being scales (PWB). PWB, an 84-item questionnaire with a multidimensional structure, has been used to evaluate the six psychological well-being dimensions conceptualized by Carol Ryff (autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relationships, purpose in life, self-acceptance), which include 14 items each. Every item is defined in terms of high or low agreement on a 6-point Likert scale (ranging from 1 to 6); therefore each scale score may range from 14 to 84, with higher scores corresponding to greater psychological well-being.</description>

        <title>Depression and Well-being Improvements After Cognitive-behavioral Therapy and Well-Being Therapy Assessed by Changes in Psychological Well-Being Scales (&quot;Positive Relations&quot; Dimension), Compared to Clinical Management</title>
        <description>Positive relations dimension of the Psychological Well-Being scales (PWB). PWB, an 84-item questionnaire with a multidimensional structure, has been used to evaluate the six psychological well-being dimensions conceptualized by Carol Ryff (autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relationships, purpose in life, self-acceptance), which include 14 items each. Every item is defined in terms of high or low agreement on a 6-point Likert scale (ranging from 1 to 6); therefore each scale score may range from 14 to 84, with higher scores corresponding to greater psychological well-being.</description>

CBT in combination with WBT and life style modification: CBT involves several essential features: identifying and correcting inaccurate thoughts associated with depressed feelings (cognitive restructuring); helping patients to engage more often in enjoyable activities (behavioral activation); enhancing problem-solving skills; providing instruction and guidance in specific strategies for solving problems. The techniques included in WBT may be used in overcoming impairments in environmental mastery, purpose in life, personal growth, autonomy, self-acceptance and positive relations with others.</description>

        <title>Depression and Well-being Improvements After Cognitive-behavioral Therapy and Well-Being Therapy Assessed by Changes in Psychological Well-Being Scales (&quot;Self-acceptance&quot; Dimension), Compared to Clinical Management</title>
        <description>Self-acceptance dimension of the Psychological Well-Being scales (PWB). PWB, an 84-item questionnaire with a multidimensional structure, has been used to evaluate the six psychological well-being dimensions conceptualized by Carol Ryff (autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relationships, purpose in life, self-acceptance), which include 14 items each. Every item is defined in terms of high or low agreement on a 6-point Likert scale (ranging from 1 to 6); therefore each scale score may range from 14 to 84, with higher scores corresponding to greater psychological well-being.</description>

CBT in combination with WBT and life style modification: CBT involves several essential features: identifying and correcting inaccurate thoughts associated with depressed feelings (cognitive restructuring); helping patients to engage more often in enjoyable activities (behavioral activation); enhancing problem-solving skills; providing instruction and guidance in specific strategies for solving problems. The techniques included in WBT may be used in overcoming impairments in environmental mastery, purpose in life, personal growth, autonomy, self-acceptance and positive relations with others.</description>
