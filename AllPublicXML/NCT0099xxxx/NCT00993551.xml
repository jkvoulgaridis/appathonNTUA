      This trial is a randomised controlled trial with a parallel design taking place in centres
      across the UK, Scandinavia and Brazil.

      650 infants with a diagnosis of isolated cleft palate who are considered medically fit for
      operation at 6 months, and who meet the inclusion criteria, will be included in the trial and
      randomised to receive either:

        -  Surgery at age 6 months, OR

        -  Surgery at age 12 months.

      The main objective is to determine whether surgery for cleft palate, using a Sommerlad
      technique, at age 6 months, when compared to surgery using the same technique at age 12
      months, improves velopharyngeal function at age 5 years. All infants will be followed up at
      age 12 months, 3 years and five years for the assessment of the primary outcomes( at age 5
      years) and secondary outcomes.

      following will be assessed:

      Age 12 months

        -  Speech development (canonical babbling)

        -  Audiological assessments

        -  Growth

      Age 3 years

        -  Speech development

        -  Audiological assessments

      Age 5 Years

        -  Speech development

        -  Audiological assessments

        -  Dentofacial development (Soft Tissue ANB and Maxillary arch constriction score using
           modified Huddart Bodenham scoring)

             inappropriate;

          -  Submucous cleft palate (defined by the classical triad of signs, bifid, uvula, bony
             defect of the hard palate, muscular diastasis, as described by Jensen et al (1988).
