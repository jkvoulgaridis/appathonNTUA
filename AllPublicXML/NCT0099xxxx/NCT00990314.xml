  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study for patients who participated in the BPS-MR-PAH-203 study and
      have volunteered to continue treatment for PAH with Beraprost Sodium Modified Release
      (BPS-MR) tablets.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients who participated in BPS-MR-PAH-203 and who elect to continue receiving
      study drug in an open-label extension.Each patient will return to the clinic following
      enrollment in the study at 3, 6, and 12 months, and annually thereafter for assessment.
      Patients will be called by study personnel to assess adverse events and concomitant
      medications at Month 9, and at 3 month intervals following the annual visit.

      At the End of Study visit, patients discontinuing study drug will be down-titrated off of
      BPS-MR at the discretion of the Investigator, at a maximum decrement of one tablet (60µg)
      b.i.d. per day and a minimum decrement of one tablet (60µg) b.i.d. per week. Likewise,
      patients who withdraw early from the study will be down-titrated off of BPS-MR in the same
      manner. Upon completion of down-titration, patients will return to the clinic for a final
      Closeout visit.

      Currently enrolled patients may be invited to participate in an optional four times daily
      (QID) dosing substudy of BPS-MR with total daily dose of BPS-MR achieved previously in the
      main study. Patients will return to the clinic for baseline visit, week 12, and then will
      follow the visit schedule provided to them in BPS-MR-PAH-204 main study.

    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting at Least One Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 42 months</time_frame>
    <description>A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an event not present prior to the initiation of the treatment or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to the treatment. AEs occurring more than 3 days after the last day study drug was taken in the study was not included in the statistical analyses or summaries (except for subjects with adverse events leading to study drug withdrawn). Only TEAEs that occurred during the treatment period of the BPS-MR-PAH-204 study were summarized. Any adverse event starting prior to the first dose of study drug was excluded from the summary analyses and only presented in the data listings. All efficacy results are descriptive; no statistical analysis was conducted</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Six-Minute-Walk Distance (6MWD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 42 months</time_frame>
    <description>Area used for the Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT) was pre-measured at 30 meters in length. Rest periods were allowed if patient could no longer continue. If patient needed to rest, he/she could stand or sit and then begin again when rested but the clock continued to run. At the end of 6 minutes, the tester called &quot;stop&quot; while stopping the watch and then measured the distance walked. For purposes of the 6MWT, if patient was assessed at Baseline using oxygen therapy, all future 6MWT were conducted in the same manner. All efficacy results are descriptive; no statistical analysis was conducted.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Borg Dyspnea Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 42 months</time_frame>
    <description>The modified 0-10 category-ratio Borg scale consists of an 11-point scale rating the maximum level of dyspnea experienced during the 6MWT. Scores range from 0 (for the best condition) and 10 (for the worst condition) with nonlinear spacing of verbal descriptors of severity corresponding to specific numbers. The participant chose the number or the verbal descriptor to reflect presumed ratio properties of sensation or symptom intensity. Baseline was defined as the last non-missing evaluation preceding the first dose of study drug in study BPS-MR-PAH-203. Only participants with both a measurement at baseline and at the given visit are presented. All efficacy results are descriptive; no statistical analysis was conducted.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants That Experienced Clinical Worsening</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 42 months</time_frame>
    <description>Number of Participants that experienced Clinical Worsening in the opinion of the Investigator. Clinical Worsening was defined as any of these events following the Baseline visit: Death, Transplantation or atrial septostomy, Clinical deterioration as defined by: Hospitalization as a result of PAH symptoms or Initiation of any new PAH specific therapy (e.g. ERA, PDE-5 inhibitor, prostanoid). All efficacy results are descriptive; no statistical analysis was conducted.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With a Change in WHO Functional Class</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 42 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline in participant clinical status was recorded according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Functional Class. A change from lower to higher functional class (i.e. 'III to IV' or 'II to III') was considered as a deterioration. A change from higher to lower functional class (i.e. 'III to II' or 'II to I') was considered as an improvement. All efficacy results are descriptive; no statistical analysis was conducted.</description>

          <description>Area used for the Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT) was pre-measured at 30 meters in length. Rest periods were allowed if patient could no longer continue. If patient needed to rest, he/she could stand or sit and then begin again when rested but the clock continued to run. At the end of 6 minutes, the tester called “stop” while stopping the watch and then measured the distance walked. For purposes of the 6MWT, if patient was assessed at Baseline using oxygen therapy, all future 6MWT were conducted in the same manner.

          <description>Number of Participants that experienced Clinical Worsening in the opinion of the Investigator. Clinical Worsening was defined as any of these events following the Baseline visit: Death, Transplantation or atrial septostomy, Clinical deterioration as defined by: Hospitalization as a result of PAH symptoms or Initiation of any new PAH specific therapy (e.g. ERA, PDE-5 inhibitor, prostanoid). All efficacy results are descriptive; no statistical analysis was conducted.</description>
