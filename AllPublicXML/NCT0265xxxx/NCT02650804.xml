      This is a Phase 2 multicenter, open-label, non-randomized study to examine the safety and
      effectiveness of BPM31510 administered over 144-hours (two 72-hour 110mg/Kg doses) continuous
      intravenous (IV) infusion in combination with gemcitabine in advanced pancreatic cancer
      patients as 2nd / 3rd line therapy. The study will enroll up to 25 patients in the US and
      Europe.

      This is a Phase 2 multicenter, open-label, non-randomized study to examine the safety and
      effectiveness of BPM31510 administered over 144-hours (two 72-hour 110mg/Kg doses) continuous
      intravenous (IV) infusion in combination with gemcitabine in advanced pancreatic cancer
      patients as 2nd / 3rd line therapy.

      Cycle 1 of therapy is 6 weeks in duration with BPM31510 administered twice weekly on Tuesdays
      and Fridays for 6 weeks plus gemcitabine administered on Mondays, Days 21, 28 and 35.

      Cycles 2-12 are 4 weeks in duration with BPM31510 administered twice weekly on Tuesdays and
      Fridays for 4 weeks plus gemcitabine administered on Mondays, Days 7, 14 and 21. Response
      will be assessed after Cycle 2 (10 weeks) and patients who continue onto Cycles 2-12 will be
      assessed every 2 cycles (8 weeks).

      Patients will continue BPM31510 in combination with gemcitabine, for a maximum of 12 cycles
      in the absence of intolerable toxicity and progression. If gemcitabine is discontinued due to
      chemotherapy-related toxicity, patients may continue to receive BPM31510 as monotherapy.

      Patients who experience disease progression but are, in the opinion of the investigator,
      receiving clinical benefit may continue BPM31510 as a monotherapy or in combination with
      gemcitabine or as a monotherapy pending approval from the Sponsor.

    <description>BPM31510 Nanosuspension Injection (40 mg/mL) will be administered IV over 144 hours at the starting dose of 110 mg/kg. Each patient will receive 2 consecutive 72-hour infusions per week (Tuesday-Friday and Friday-Monday). The patient will be subsequently treated with gemcitabine IV once weekly at a starting dose of 1000 mg/m2.
Cycle 1 of combination therapy is 6 weeks in duration for patients with BPM31510 administered twice weekly on Tuesdays and Fridays for 6 weeks and gemcitabine administered on Mondays, Days 21, 28 and 35. Cycles 2-12 are 4 weeks in duration with BPM31510 administered twice weekly on Tuesdays and Fridays for 4 weeks and gemcitabine administered on Mondays, Days 7, 14 and 21.</description>
