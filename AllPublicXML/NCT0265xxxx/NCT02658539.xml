  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that body composition is a key component of health and future disease
      risk. Being overweight and obese is associated with a higher body fat composition, and a
      greater risk of developing type II diabetes and heart disease. The location where fat is
      stored in the body is becoming increasingly recognised an important predictor of risk, with
      extra fat around the abdomen and waist (referred to as the android pattern of fat
      distribution or 'apple' shape) thought to increase your disease risk than storing fat around
      the thighs and buttocks (gynoid pattern of fat distribution or 'pear' shape). As a result,
      there is significant interest in techniques to accurately monitor and detect changes in body
      composition, and also physiological and lifestyle factors which influence body fat, lean
      tissue mass and bone mineral density. This cross sectional human study will look at how
      physiological, behavioural and genetic factors relate to total body composition in 1,196
      healthy men and women aged between 18 and 70 years. Interested applicants will be invited to
      attend for a single visit at the Hugh Sinclair Unit of Human Nutrition at the University of
      Reading. This visit lasts around two hours and includes noninvasive measures of body
      composition (bio-electrical impedance and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry), arterial
      stiffness and fasting measures of metabolic health. Diet and physical activity will then be
      monitored over a four day period using diet and activity diaries, and an activity monitor.
      The findings from this study will contribute to the evidence base on how subject
      characteristics influence body composition and inform on the design of future human studies
      on body composition methodology.

      A fasting blood sample will be taken at the end of the study visit for the measurement of
      fasting lipids (total and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol, triacylglycerol and
      nonâˆ’esterified fatty acids), glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein and for vitamin D status.

      The buffy coat (consisting of white blood cells) will be isolated from the blood sample for
      genotyping analysis.
