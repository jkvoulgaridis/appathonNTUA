      Background:

      Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a cancer most often seen in people with HIV. It causes lesions. These
      are usually on the skin but sometimes in the lymph nodes, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract.
      Researchers think a combination of drugs may help treat KS.

      Objective:

      To test a combination of the anti-cancer drugs pomalidomide (CC-4047) and liposomal
      doxorubicin (Doxil) in people with KS.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and over with KS

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Questionnaires

      Physical exam

      Blood, urine, and heart tests

      Chest X-ray

      Biopsy: A small sample of tissue is taken from a KS lesion.

      Possible CT scan

      Possible exam of lungs or gastrointestinal tract with an endoscope: A flexible instrument
      examines

      inside the organ.

      Participants will take the drugs in 4-week cycles. They will take Doxil through an IV on Day
      1 of each cycle. They will take CC-4047 tablets by mouth each day for the first 3 weeks of
      each cycle.

      Participants will have many visits:

      Before starting treatment

      To start each cycle

      Day 15 of first 2 cycles

      Visits include repeats of screening tests and:

      Multiple blood draws

      Photographs of lesions

      Participants will keep a drug diary.

      Participants will take aspirin or other drugs to prevent blood clots.

      Participants with HIV will have combination antiretroviral therapy.

      Some participants will have a PET scan.

      Participants will continue treatment as long as they tolerate it and their KS improves. After
      treatment, they will have several follow-up visits for up to 5 years

      ...

      Background:

        -  Kaposi Sarcoma (KS) is a multicentric angioproliferative tumor that most frequently
           involves skin, but can also involve lymph nodes, lungs and gastrointestinal tract. It is
           most common in people with HIV or other forms of immune compromise. Patients with
           AIDS-associated KS have worse survival than HIV-infected patients without KS.

        -  Patients may present with advanced disease KS and/or concurrent KSHV-associated
           multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) or an IL-6 related KSHV-associated cytokine
           syndrome (KICS). Patients with the latter conditions have poor outcomes when treated
           with FDA-approved cytotoxic therapies used for KS, and novel approaches are needed.

        -  A Phase I/II Study demonstrated that pomalidomide 5 mg daily on days 1- 21 of a 28 Day
           Cycle was safe and tolerable in patients with KS with or without HIV. Increased CD4+ and
           CD8+ T-cell counts and KS regression were observed.

        -  Combination of pomalidomide with liposomal doxorubicin may offer a new approach for
           patients with advanced KS or KS and concurrent KSHV-associated MCD or KICS

      Objectives:

        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of various dose combinations of pomalidomide and
           liposomal doxorubicin in two groups of patients: Group I) KS requiring systemic therapy;
           Group II) KS with concurrent KSHV-associated MCD or KICS

        -  To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of pomalidomide in combination with liposomal
           doxorubicin; and for patients with HIV in combination with antiretroviral therapy

        -  To preliminarily evaluate the antitumor effect of pomalidomide in combination with
           liposomal doxorubicin against Kaposi sarcoma.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients with biopsy proven (confirmed in the Laboratory of Pathology, CCR) Kaposi
           sarcoma (KS)

        -  Group I: KS requiring systemic therapy (no prior therapy required)

             -  T1 KS, KS on skin sufficiently widespread that it is not amenable to local therapy,
                or KS affecting quality of life due to local symptoms or psychological distress

      OR

      --KS patients with an inadequate response to pomalidomide (either progressive disease or
      stable disease after 4 months)

      OR

        -  KS patients with an inadequate response to liposomal doxorubicin, paclitaxel, or other
           systemic chemotherapy (either progressive disease or stable disease after 6 cycles)

        -  Group I will exclude patients eligible for Group II (below).

        -  A wash out period off treatment of 3 weeks will be required, except in the case of
           patients with progressive, severe disease in which delay of treatment cannot be
           justified (i.e. symptomatic pulmonary KS)

           -Group II: KS in one of the following high-risk groups (no prior therapy required):

        -  Concurrent KSHV-associated multicentric Castleman disease (MCD)

        -  KSHV Inflammatory Cytokine Syndrome (KICS), including those also meeting clinical
           criteriafor KS immune reconstitution syndrome (KS IRIS)

             -  Patients with primary effusion lymphoma or a large cell lymphoma arising in
                KSHV-associated MCD are excluded.

                  -  At least five measurable cutaneous KS lesions with no previous local
                     radiation, surgical or intralesional cytotoxic therapy that would prevent
                     response assessment for that lesion; or other evaluable disease.

                  -  ECOG Performance Status (PS): Group I: less than or equal to 2, Group II: less
                     than or equal to 3, ECOG PS of 4 (with Karnofsky 20%) will be allowed in Group
                     II only if symptoms due to pulmonary KS.

                  -  Measurable disease by the criteria proposed by the AIDS Clinical Trials Group
                     Oncology Committee (for KS).

                  -  Patient or legal guardian must be willing to give informed consent.

                  -  Patients can be HIV positive or negative.

                  -  HAART for HIV+ patients.

      Design:

        -  This is a Phase I study evaluating 2 groups of patients with KS. Patients will receive
           pomalidomide once a day, days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle, at the various dose levels
           combined with liposomal doxorubicin IV day 1 of a 28-day cycle until optimal tumor
           response, unacceptable toxicity, or patient request to discontinue

             -  Patients with HIV will be prescribed HAART.

             -  All patients will receive thromboprophylaxis, generally with aspirin 81 mg tablet
                daily.

        -  The study will proceed to an antitumor activity phase to assess in a preliminary manner
           the response of Group I patients to a fixed dose of pomalidomide and liposomal
           doxorubicin. Up to 30 subjects (HIV positive or negative) evaluable for response will be
           treated at the highest tolerable combination of pomalidomide and liposomal doxorubicin
           (determined to be dose level 3: pomalidomide 4mg in combination with 20mg/m^2 liposomal
           doxorubicin) to gain preliminary information on antitumor activity in an expansion
           cohort. Based on the observation of positive results in the initial dose expansion of 14
           patients evaluated in the expansion cohort, a total of 30 patients will

      be allowed to be included in this cohort in order to gain additional safety information as
      well as to improve the precision of the estimate of the response rate in Group I patients.

      -The study will also include an antitumor activity phase to assess in a preliminary manner
      the response of Group II patients to a fixed dose of pomalidomide and liposomal doxorubicin.
      Up to 10 total patients (HIV positive or negative) evaluable for response

      will be treated at the highest tolerated dose of pomalidomide for this population (determined
      to be dose level, 2mg in combination with 20mg/m2 liposomal doxorubicin) to gain preliminary
      information on KS that occurs concurrently with KSHV-MCD or

      KICS.

      -This study will also evaluate the characteristics of 18fluoro-thymidine (FLT) positron
      emission tomography (PET) in patients with KS and concurrent KSHV-associated MCD or KICS, and
      correlate with markers of KSHV-lytic activation

                  remission was first documented

               -  Resected basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin

               -  In situ cervical or anal dysplasia

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, uncontrolled active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to thalidomide, lenalidomide, or other
             compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to pomalidomide or other agents
             used in study

          -  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with pomalidomide, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with pomalidomide. These potential risks may
             also

        apply to other agents used in this study.
