             of study drug

          -  Have received Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination in the 12 months prior to the
             date of screening. Subjects must agree not to receive BCG vaccination during the study
             and up to 12 months after the last administration of study drug

          -  Male patients who do not agree to minimize the risk of female partners becoming
             pregnant from at least 30 days before the first administration of trial medication and
