  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will investigate whether measurement of the change in thickness of the diaphragm during
      the respiratory cycle by ultrasound can predict extubation success in a 48 hour window. We
      will also asses whether this is only possible on low levels of pressure support as has been
      shown previously, or if this technique retains its predictive power at higher levels of
      pressure support.
