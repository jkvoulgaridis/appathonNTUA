      To investigate whether women with polycystic ovary syndrome who are post-partum excrete
      higher levels of sebum in comparison to healthy controls due to high levels of androgens.

    <textblock>
      First degree relatives of women with PCOS have a 3-4 fold increased prevalence of the
      syndrome compared with the general population, suggesting an inherited genetic
      predisposition. Many investigations into possible candidate genes for PCOS susceptibility
      have hypothesised the incomplete penetrance of a dominant gene, although no consensus has
      been achieved as to any exact genetic polymorphisms which may be culpable.

      Primate studies have offered credence to the theory that genomic imprinting is influenced by
      environmental hyperandrogenism and the hypothesis of intra-uterine exposure to excess
      androgens as a cause of PCOS is gaining momentum (Abbott et al, 2010). At birth, both mother
      and neonate are influenced by an identical hormone profile, and it is therefore expected that
      sebum excretion rates (a correlate of androgen excess) will be higher in those neonates born
      to mothers with PCOS when compared to those without. This would account for the observed
      familial transition of PCOS (Legro et al, 1998; Vink et al, 2006), and support the hypothesis
      that in-utero hyperandrogenism primes differentiating tissues for later expression of the
      PCOS phenotype in adolescence.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women (with and without a diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome) aged 18-40 with an
             uncomplicated singleton pregnancy, who deliver a female baby at term (37 weeks
             gestation or longer). Women in the PCOS cohort will be defined by all the ESHRE/ASRM
             Rotterdam criteria. Women in the control group, non-PCOS who deliver a female baby
             will be age matched to the PCOS group. Conception method (natural/assisted) and
             maternal parity does not affect inclusion but will be documented for subsequent
             analysis.
