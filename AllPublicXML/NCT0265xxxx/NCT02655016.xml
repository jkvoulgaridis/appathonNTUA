  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled (2:1 niraparib:placebo) study in
      patients with Stage III or IV ovarian cancer. Patients must have completed front-line
      platinum based regimen with a physician-assessed response of Complete Response (CR) or
      Partial Response (PR). Additionally, patients must have a normal or &gt;90% decrease in cancer
      antigen 125 (CA-125) following front-line platinum treatment. The study will assess the
      efficacy of niraparib as maintenance treatment, as measured by PFS.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Participant Reported Outcome (PRO): Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian Symptom Index (FOSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1, Pre-dose) and Up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>FOSI is a validated, 8-item measure of symptom response to treatment for ovarian cancer. Participants responded to their symptom experience over the past 7 days using a 5-point Likert scale scored from &quot;not at all&quot; (0) to &quot;very much&quot; (4). FOSI score was calculated as (sum of item scores)*8 divided by (number of items answered). The FOSI score ranged from 0 (severely symptomatic) to 32 (asymptomatic). A higher score indicated a better quality of life (QoL). Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the post-dose visit value. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1 pre-dose).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in PRO: European Quality of Life Scale, 5-dimensions, 5-levels of Severity (EQ-5D-5L) Utility Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1, Pre-dose) and Up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a well-validated general preference-based, health-related QoL instrument. The five-item measure has 1 question assessing each of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression and 5 levels for each dimension including 1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems and 5=extreme problems. The health state is defined by combining the levels of answers from each of the 5 questions. Each health state is referred to in terms of a 5 digit code. Health state 5 digit code is translated into utility score, which is valued up to 1 (perfect health) with lower values meaning worse state. EQ-5D-5L utility score ranges from -0.281 to 1. Higher scores indicate better health. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the post-dose visit value. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1 pre-dose).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Functional Scales of European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1, Pre-dose) and Up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC-QLQ-C30 incorporates 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea/vomiting), a global health status/QoL scale (global health status, QoL), and 6 single items (dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulty) assessing additional symptoms commonly reported by participants with cancer. Five functional scales had total 15 items (physical-5, role-2, cognitive-4, emotional-2, and social-2). Each functional scales score was calculated by averaging scores of all scale items and transforming average scores linearly (1 minus [average score minus 1] divided by 3*100). All of the functional scales range in score from 0 to 100. Higher score represents a higher (&quot;better&quot;) level of functioning. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the post-dose visit value. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1 pre-dose).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Global Health Status/QoL of EORTC-QLQ-C30</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1, Pre-dose) and Up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC-QLQ-C30 incorporates 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea/vomiting), a global health status/QoL scale (global health status, QoL), and 6 single items (dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulty) assessing additional symptoms commonly reported by participants with cancer. A global health status/QoL scale had total 2 items. Each global health status/QoL scales score was calculated by averaging scores of all scale items and transforming average scores linearly ([average score minus 1] divided by 6*100). The global health status/QoL scales range in score from 0 to 100. Higher score represents a higher (&quot;better&quot;) level of health status/QoL. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the post-dose visit value. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1 pre-dose).</description>

    <description>EORTC-QLQ-C30 incorporates 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea/vomiting), a global health status/QoL scale, and 6 single items (dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulty) assessing additional symptoms commonly reported by participants with cancer. Symptom scale had total 7 items (fatigue-3, pain-2, nausea/vomiting-2). Each symptoms scales and 6 single additional symptoms items score was calculated by averaging scores of all scale items and transforming average scores linearly ([average score minus 1] divided by 3*100). All of the symptoms scales and 6 single additional symptoms scales range in score from 0 to 100. Higher score represents a higher (&quot;worse&quot;) level of symptoms. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the post-dose visit value. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1 pre-dose).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1, Pre-dose) and Up to 34 months</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC-QLQ-OV28 is supplement to EORTC-QLQ-C30. It includes 3 functional scales (body image, sexuality, attitude to disease/treatment) and 5 symptom scales/items (abdominal/gastrointestinal [GI] symptoms, peripheral neuropathy, hormonal/menopausal symptoms, other chemotherapy side-effects, and hair loss). Functional scales score (body Image and attitude to disease/treatment) was calculated by averaging scores of all scale items and transforming average scores linearly (1 minus [average score minus 1] divided by 3*100). Functional scales score (sexuality) was calculated by averaging scores of all scale items and transforming average scores linearly ([average score minus 1] divided by 3*100).

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, participants with stage III or IV ovarian cancer were randomized to receive either niraparib or placebo in 2:1 ratio. The results presented are based on the primary analysis up to month 34. Data collection is still on-going and additional results will be provided after study completion.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 989 participants were screened, of which 256 participants did not meet eligibility criteria. A total of 733 participants were enrolled and randomized in the study, of which 728 participants received study treatment (4 participants were screen failures after randomization and 1 participant withdrew consent before first dose).</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Participant Reported Outcome (PRO): Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian Symptom Index (FOSI)</title>
        <description>FOSI is a validated, 8-item measure of symptom response to treatment for ovarian cancer. Participants responded to their symptom experience over the past 7 days using a 5-point Likert scale scored from &quot;not at all&quot; (0) to &quot;very much&quot; (4). FOSI score was calculated as (sum of item scores)*8 divided by (number of items answered). The FOSI score ranged from 0 (severely symptomatic) to 32 (asymptomatic). A higher score indicated a better quality of life (QoL). Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the post-dose visit value. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1 pre-dose).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in PRO: European Quality of Life Scale, 5-dimensions, 5-levels of Severity (EQ-5D-5L) Utility Score</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a well-validated general preference-based, health-related QoL instrument. The five-item measure has 1 question assessing each of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression and 5 levels for each dimension including 1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems and 5=extreme problems. The health state is defined by combining the levels of answers from each of the 5 questions. Each health state is referred to in terms of a 5 digit code. Health state 5 digit code is translated into utility score, which is valued up to 1 (perfect health) with lower values meaning worse state. EQ-5D-5L utility score ranges from -0.281 to 1. Higher scores indicate better health. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the post-dose visit value.

          <title>Change From Baseline in PRO: European Quality of Life Scale, 5-dimensions, 5-levels of Severity (EQ-5D-5L) Utility Score</title>
          <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a well-validated general preference-based, health-related QoL instrument. The five-item measure has 1 question assessing each of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression and 5 levels for each dimension including 1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems and 5=extreme problems. The health state is defined by combining the levels of answers from each of the 5 questions. Each health state is referred to in terms of a 5 digit code. Health state 5 digit code is translated into utility score, which is valued up to 1 (perfect health) with lower values meaning worse state. EQ-5D-5L utility score ranges from -0.281 to 1. Higher scores indicate better health. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the post-dose visit value. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1 pre-dose).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Functional Scales of European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30)</title>
        <description>EORTC-QLQ-C30 incorporates 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea/vomiting), a global health status/QoL scale (global health status, QoL), and 6 single items (dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulty) assessing additional symptoms commonly reported by participants with cancer. Five functional scales had total 15 items (physical-5, role-2, cognitive-4, emotional-2, and social-2). Each functional scales score was calculated by averaging scores of all scale items and transforming average scores linearly (1 minus [average score minus 1] divided by 3*100). All of the functional scales range in score from 0 to 100. Higher score represents a higher (&quot;better&quot;) level of functioning. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the post-dose visit value. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1 pre-dose).</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Symptoms Scales and Symptoms Items (Dyspnea, Appetite Loss, Insomnia, Constipation, Diarrhea and Financial Difficulty) of EORTC-QLQ-C30</title>
          <description>EORTC-QLQ-C30 incorporates 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea/vomiting), a global health status/QoL scale, and 6 single items (dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulty) assessing additional symptoms commonly reported by participants with cancer. Symptom scale had total 7 items (fatigue-3, pain-2, nausea/vomiting-2). Each symptoms scales and 6 single additional symptoms items score was calculated by averaging scores of all scale items and transforming average scores linearly ([average score minus 1] divided by 3*100). All of the symptoms scales and 6 single additional symptoms scales range in score from 0 to 100. Higher score represents a higher (&quot;worse&quot;) level of symptoms. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the post-dose visit value. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1 pre-dose).</description>

        <description>EORTC-QLQ-OV28 is supplement to EORTC-QLQ-C30. It includes 3 functional scales (body image, sexuality, attitude to disease/treatment) and 5 symptom scales/items (abdominal/gastrointestinal [GI] symptoms, peripheral neuropathy, hormonal/menopausal symptoms, other chemotherapy side-effects, and hair loss). Functional scales score (body Image and attitude to disease/treatment) was calculated by averaging scores of all scale items and transforming average scores linearly (1 minus [average score minus 1] divided by 3*100). Functional scales score (sexuality) was calculated by averaging scores of all scale items and transforming average scores linearly ([average score minus 1] divided by 3*100). All of the functional scales range in score from 0 to 100. Higher score represents a higher (&quot;better&quot;) level of functioning. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the post-dose visit value. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1 pre-dose).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Symptoms Scale of EORTC-QLQ-OV28</title>
        <description>EORTC-QLQ-OV28 is supplement to EORTC-QLQ-C30. It includes 3 functional scales (body image, sexuality, attitude to disease/treatment) and 5 symptom scales/items (abdominal/GI symptoms, peripheral neuropathy, hormonal/menopausal symptoms, other chemotherapy side-effects, and hair loss). Symptoms scales score was calculated by averaging scores of all scale items and transforming average scores linearly ([average score minus 1] divided by 3*100). All of the symptoms scales range in score from 0 to 100. Higher score represents a higher (&quot;worse&quot;) level of symptoms. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the post-dose visit value. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment (Day 1 pre-dose).</description>
