      The objective of this trial is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Edwards
      Pericardial Aortic Bioprosthesis Model 11000A, in the pulmonary position in pediatric and
      adult subjects five years or older requiring replacement of their native or prosthetic
      pulmonary valve.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, Non-Randomized, Single Arm, Multicenter study. Up to one hundred (100)
      pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) subjects at up to ten (10) clinical sites will be enrolled.
      Clinical data will be collected from at least 3 centers with data available on patients who
      have completed the 1 year follow-up visit. Subjects will be followed for and assessed after
      implant for up to 5 years.

Class I. No limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea (shortness of breath).
Class II. Slight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea (shortness of breath).
Class III. Marked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea.
Class IV. Unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of heart failure at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort increases.</description>
