    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1/2 multicenter dose escalation study in pediatric patients with
      relapsed or refractory extracranial solid tumors (Phase 1), with additional expansion cohorts
      (Phase 2) in patients with primary brain tumors harboring NTRK1/2/3 or ROS1 gene fusions, and
      extracranial solid tumors harboring NTRK1/2/3 or ROS1 gene fusions.
