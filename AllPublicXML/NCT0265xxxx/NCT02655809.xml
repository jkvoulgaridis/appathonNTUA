  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the in vivo kinematics and range of motion of a
      single-surgeon clinical series of TKA performed with a fixed-bearing cruciate retaining total
      knee arthroplasty that has a roll-back mechanism and compare it with the kinematic of the
      normal healthy knee.

      Patients would be evaluated by fluoroscopic examination during weight bearing activities
      (lounging, kneeling and stairs climbing).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients screened and enrolled in the Physica KR follow-up clinical study according to
             all inclusion criteria. (K-06- Study protocol 30/10/2013 v 1.0 approved by the Health
             Research Authority NRES Committee East of England - Cambridge East on February 13th
             2014 and by the R&amp;D Department of The Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospital NHS
             Foundation Trust on March 7th 2014);

          2. Patients achieving a ROM ≥ 100° at 6 week follow-up in the Physica KR clinical trial
             (K-06 Study protocol 30/10/2013 v 1.0);

          3. Patients affected by primary or secondary OA before surgery;

          4. Patients with an appropriate intial fixation and stability of the knee prosthesis;

          5. Patients with undamaged and functional collateral and posterior cruciate ligaments (no
             ligamentous imbalance or pain);

          6. Patients who understand the requirements of the study and are willing and able to
             comply with activities required for fluoroscopic examination;

          7. Patients who have signed the Ethics Committee approved study-specific Informed Consent
             Form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients excluded from the Physica KR follow-up clinical study, according to exclusion
             criteria (K-06- Study protocol 30/10/2013 v 1.0 approved by the Health Research
             Authority NRES Committee East of England - Cambridge East on February 13th 2014 and by
             the R&amp;D Department of The Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospital NHS Foundation
             Trust on March 7th 2014);

          2. Patients with a ROM &lt; 100° at 6-week follow-up in Physica KR clinical trial (K-06-
             Study protocol 30/10/2013 v 1.0);

          3. Patients affected by rheumatoid arthritis;

          4. Patients with malalignment or axial malrotation of the knee prosthesis;

          5. Patients who had or have planned a surgery on their uninvolved knee within a year;

          6. Muscular insufficiency or absence of muscoligamentous supporting structures required
             for adequate soft tissue balance;

          7. Patients who have significant neurological or musculoskeletal disorders or disease
             that may adversely affect gait and compromise functional recovery and evaluation;

          8. Patients who have neuromuscular or neurosensory deficit which would limit the ability
             to assess the performance of the device;

          9. Any psychiatric illness that would prevent comprehension of the details and nature of
             the study;

         10. Participation in any experimental drug/device study within the 6 months prior to the
             preoperative visit, excluding the Physica KR clinical trial (K-06 Study protocol
             30/10/2013 v 1.0);

         11. Female patients who are pregnant, nursing, or planning a pregnancy.
