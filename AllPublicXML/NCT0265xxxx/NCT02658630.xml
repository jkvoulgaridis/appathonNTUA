  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to design a predictive model of stroke recovery based on
      baseline measurements of arm movement and brain physiology. The expectation is the
      development of a formula to predict a person's response to an arm rehabilitation program
      provided in the chronic phase (6 months or greater post stroke) of recovery. The study will
      include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), genetic
      testing using blood and saliva, and an arm exercise program consisting of robot-assisted
      exercise combined with functional arm exercise called transition to task training (TTT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After informed consent, a baseline neurological exam, medical records review, MRI of the
      brain, TMS, questionnaires, cognitive testing, robot evaluations, and arm function testing
      will occur. Baseline testing will occur in the first 4-6 weeks of participation including two
      separate sessions approximately 1 week a part to examine arm strength, range of motion, and
      ability to perform functional tasks, with one additional session if needed to verify
      stability between results. Additionally, one robot evaluation, one MRI, and one TMS session
      will be completed. We will also collect genetic data using blood and saliva samples to
      examine potential RNA expression and genetic polymorphisms that might influence response to
      therapy.

      The intervention phase consists of 12 weeks of robot and transition to task arm exercise
      training (TTT). Interventions will occur approximately 3 times per week for 12 weeks for a
      total of 36 visits. Additional time and visits will be allowed with visits occurring 4 times
      per week or up to 6 additional weeks (not to exceed 18 weeks) if scheduling conflicts arise.
      The intervention sessions will be one hour in duration.

      During the hour-long intervention, 45 minutes of robotic intervention will be followed by 15
      minutes of TTT. Two separate robots targeting different movements will be used for the 3
      phases of the robot training. The training will be sequential with 12 sessions completed on
      the wrist robot, followed by 12 sessions on the shoulder-elbow robot and the final 12
      sessions alternating between the wrist and elbow-shoulder robot.

      After the final training session, subjects will return after a 12 week retention period. At
      various time points during and after the intervention phase there will be additional arm
      function testing, robot evaluations, questionnaires, blood draws, and TMS sessions to
      re-assess ability.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke Impact Scale: Hand</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after visits 12, 24, and 36, and 12 week retention</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) is one of the primary outcome measures assessing change in hand use from baseline testing to mid-training after visits 12 and 24, and post-training after visit 36 and the 12 week retention period. It is a self-report structured interview consisting of eight domains designed to assess physical, mental and emotional changes following stroke that contribute to quality of life. It has been tested and found to be reliable, valid, and sensitive to change in the stroke population. It has four physical domain subscales that can be analyzed separately. The SIS hand subscale will be the focus for our outcome measure. Higher scores indicate greater function and life satisfaction.</description>

    <measure>Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after visits 12, 24, and 36, and 12 week retention</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer is one of the primary outcome measures assessing change in arm use from baseline testing to mid-training after visits 12 and 24, and post-training after visit 36 and the 12 week retention period. It is a stroke-specific measure of impairment of the upper extremity that has been shown to be valid and reliable with high inter-rater and test-retest reliability. It provides a direct-observational assessment of volitional movement and motor impairment related to reflexes, sensation, and abnormal synergies. Each item on the FM is rated on a three-point ordinal scale (0 = cannot perform, 1 = performs partially, 2 = performs fully). The scale ranges from 0-66 with higher scores representing less motor impairment.</description>

    <measure>Action Research Arm Test (ARAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after visits 12, 24, and 36, and 12 week retention</time_frame>
    <description>The ARAT will be used to assess change from baseline testing to mid-training after visits 12 and 24, and post-training after visit 36 and the 12 week retention period. It is a stroke-specific measure of arm motor function and impairment of the upper extremity that has been shown to be valid and reliable with high inter-rater and test-retest reliability. It provides a direct-observational assessment of volitional movement. It includes 19 test activities and each test is given an ordinal score of 0, 1, 2, or 3, with higher values indicating better arm motor status. The total ARAT score is the sum of the 19 tests, and thus the maximum score is 57.</description>

    <measure>6-Item Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after visits 12, 24, and 36, and 12 week retention</time_frame>
    <description>The Streamlined 6-Item Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) will be used to assess change from baseline testing to mid-training after visits 12 and 24, and post-training after visit 36 and the 12 week retention period. It examines UE function based on task performance time, and quality of movement. Functional use and speed of movement are based on six timed activities. It has been examined in chronic stroke and has high inter-rater reliability, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability. Timed tasks that cannot be completed default to a time score of 120 seconds. Faster times or a lower score in seconds represent better function.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation of the motor cortex</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after visit 36, and 12 week retention</time_frame>
    <description>TMS stimulation of the motor cortex will be performed using MagStim 200 Magnetic Stimulators (MagStim Ltd., Wales, UK) at baseline and post training after visit 36 and the 12 week retention to assess change in the motor evoked potential (MEP) of the arm muscles. TMS testing is as follows: 1) Location of muscle hotspot (highest motor evoked potential), 2) Threshold (lowest stimulation strength that evokes an MEP at hotspot) 3) Ipsilateral silent period measured on both the affected and unaffected side.</description>
