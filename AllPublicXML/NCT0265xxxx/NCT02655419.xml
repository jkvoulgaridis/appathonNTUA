Failure: death related to intra-abdominal infection; received treatment with additional antibiotics for ongoing symptoms of cIAI; previously met criteria for failure; persisting or recurrent infection within the abdomen; post-surgical wound infections included an open wound with signs of local infection such as purulent exudates, erythema, or warmth that requires additional antibiotics and/or non-routine wound care. TOC visit occurred up to a maximum of 28 days after first dose.</description>
          <population>The mMITT population included all enrolled participants who had any amount of study drug and had a diagnosis of cIAI (that is,met inclusion criterion ) and an intraabdominal pathogen at baseline.
