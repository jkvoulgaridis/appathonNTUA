    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation and expansion Phase Ib clinical study of
      RO6958688 in combination with atezolizumab. Part I of the study is subdivided into parts IA
      and IB. Part IA is dose escalation with a starting dose of 5 mg of RO6958688 given QW (once a
      week) and a fixed, flat dose of 1200 mg given Q3W (every 3 weeks) of atezolizumab, to
      evaluate the safety and determine the MTD of RO6958688 in combination with atezolizumab. Part
      IB is a dose/schedule finding part that will explore different administration schedules of
      RO6958688 in combination with atezolizumab (1200 mg Q3W) to establish the appropriate
      dose/schedule of RO6958688 in combination with atezolizumab.
