      This study evaluates the changes of renal function after taking bowel cleansing agent
      polyethylene glycol for elective colonoscopy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is the most commonly used bowel cleansing agent for colonoscopy in
      the world.

      PEGs are non-absorbable isosmotic solutions that pass through the bowel without net
      absorption or secretion. Significant fluid and electrolyte shifts are therefore attenuated.

      However, several studies have shown that PEG may also impair renal function. One recent
      population-based study reported that the use of PEG was associated with an increased risk of
      acute kidney injury.

      The renal safety of PEG in Taiwanese patient has not been reported.

    <time_frame>The durations between visits 1-2 and visits 2-3 were within 28 days, respectively. Patients with a ≥30% increase above the baseline serum creatinine levels during visit 2 or 3 were followed every 2-4 weeks until a peak level of creatinine was detected.</time_frame>
    <description>The screening visit (visit 1) induced a blood specimen for serum chemistry analysis. Immediately before the colonoscopy, study staff collected blood specimens for chemistry analysis (visit 2). The patients returned within 28 days after the colonoscopy for a final renal test (visit 3). Patients with a ≥30% increase above baseline creatinine levels during visit 2 or 3 were followed every 2-4 weeks until a peak level was detected (visit 4 and beyond).The serum creatinine level on visit 1 was recorded as the baseline renal function. The presence of renal injuries was determined by the highest serum creatinine level noted during the study period and included acute renal dysfunction, defined as a 30-49% increase above the baseline creatinine level, and acute kidney injury, defined as a ≥50% increase above the baseline serum creatinine. Number of participants with acute renal injury which included acute renal dysfunction and acute kidney injury will be recorded.</description>

      <time_frame>Colonoscopy related complication was observed during and within one month after colonoscopy. Patient with acute renal injury were followed every 2-4 weeks until a peak level of creatinine was detected.Renal recovery was examined every month after the peak creatinine level was reached. Patients with electrolyte abnormalities during visit 2 or visit 3 were followed every 2-4 weeks until serum electrolyte values returned to normal.</time_frame>
