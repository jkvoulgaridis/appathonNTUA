      This study is being conducted to collect safety and immunogenicity data for the Eastern
      Equine Encephalitis (EEE) vaccine. To determine the frequency of adverse events in this
      Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) vaccine study for all intent-to-treat subjects will be
      evaluated. Also the frequency of clinically confirmed and documented cases of Eastern Equine
      Encephalitis (EEE) disease among vaccinated subjects compliant with titer schedule after
      working with Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) virus.

    <description>Eastern Equine Encephalitis Vaccine will be administered as primary doses of 0.5 mL given subcutaneously in the upper outer aspect of the triceps area and booster doses of 0.1 mL given intradermally in the volar aspect of the forearm. The primary series will be administered on Days 0 and 26-35 with a booster at 6 months. Titers will be collected 28-35 days after the second primary vaccine is &lt; 1:40, the subject will receive a booster dose 28- 90 days of obtaining the titer result.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be 18 to 65 years old at time of consent.

          2. Have EEE virus plaque reduction neutralization 80% titers (PRNT80) &lt; 1:20 for primary
             series.

          3. Have EEE virus PRNT80 &lt; 1:40 for booster series.

          4. If female of childbearing potential, must agree to have a urine pregnancy test on the
             same day before each vaccine. (Exception: documented hysterectomy or ≥ 3 years of
             menopause.) The results must be negative. Females must agree not to become pregnant
             for 3 months after receipt of the last study treatment (vaccination).

          5. Be considered at risk for exposure to EEE virus and who have submitted a Request for
             IND Vaccines for the EEE vaccine.

          6. Sign and date the approved informed consent document and HIPAA Authorization.

          7. Have in their charts:

               -  medical history (including concomitant medications) within 60 days of planned
                  first administration of vaccine

               -  physical examination and laboratory tests within 1 year

               -  previous chest radiograph results and electrocardiogram

          8. Be medically cleared for participation by an investigator. (Examinations and/or tests
             may be repeated at the discretion of the principal investigator [PI].)

          9. Be willing to return for all follow-up visits.

         10. Agree to report any adverse events (AEs) that may or may not be associated with
             administration of the vaccine for at least 28 days after administration and agree to
             report all serious adverse events (for example, resulting in hospitalization) for the
             duration of the subject's participation in the study. Subjects must agree to report
             any pregnancy that occurs within 3 months after a vaccination.

         11. Agree to defer blood, bone marrow, and organ donation for 1 year after receipt of the
             vaccine.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have completed previous EEE vaccine study as a nonresponder.

          2. Have clinically significant abnormal laboratory results (including evidence of
             hepatitis C, hepatitis B carrier state) or elevated liver function tests (two times
             the normal range or at the discretion of the PI).

          3. Have a personal history of an immunodeficiency or received treatment with an
             immunosuppressive medication, such as systemically administered glucocorticoids (eg,
             prednisone) within 1 month before planned administration of the vaccine or with other
             immunosuppressive therapies within 6 months of planned administration of the vaccine.
             Other immunosuppressive therapies include all cancer chemotherapeutic agents, drugs to
             prevent transplant rejection, interferons, monoclonal antibodies, protein kinase
             inhibitors, methotrexate, TNF (tumor necrosis factor) inhibitors, and any other drug
             determined to be immunosuppressive by the PI. Current administration of topical,
             inhalational, or intranasal glucocorticoids is not excluded.

          4. Have confirmed HIV infection (antibody positivity).

          5. Have positive pregnancy test or be a breastfeeding female.

          6. Have any known allergies to components of the vaccine:

               -  Neomycin sulfate

               -  Formaldehyde

               -  Egg

               -  Human serum albumin

               -  Sodium bisulfite

          7. Have administration of another vaccine or investigational product within 28 days of
             EEE vaccination.

          8. Have any unresolved AE resulting from a previous immunization.

          9. Have a medical condition that, in the judgment of the PI, would impact subject safety.
