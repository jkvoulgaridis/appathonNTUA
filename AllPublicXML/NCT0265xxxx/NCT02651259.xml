    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), tolerability, and safety
      of once-weekly doses of rifapentine (RPT) and isoniazid (INH) in HIV-1-infected and
      HIV-1-uninfected pregnant and postpartum women with latent tuberculosis (TB).

    <textblock>
      TB is a major cause of illness and death in women of reproductive age. Pregnant and
      postpartum women with latent TB are at higher risk of developing active TB. This study
      evaluated the pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and safety of 12 once-weekly doses of RPT and
      INH in HIV-1-infected and HIV-1-uninfected pregnant and postpartum women with latent TB.

      This study enrolled HIV-1-infected and HIV-1-uninfected pregnant women with latent TB and
      their infants into two cohorts based on gestation. Cohort 1 participants were enrolled in
      their second trimester (greater than or equal to 14 to less than 28 weeks), and Cohort 2
      participants were enrolled in their third trimester (greater than or equal to 28 to less than
      or equal to 34 weeks). All participants received 12 directly observed once-weekly doses of
      RPT, INH, and pyridoxine (vitamin B6) at study entry and at 11 weekly follow-up visits. Study
      researchers would perform an interim analysis to assess the PK of RPT during the study, and a
      dose adjustment could have been recommended based on this analysis.

      Study visits occurred at days 0-3, once a week through week 11, and once a month until 24
      weeks after delivery. Visits would include physical examinations, obstetrical exams, and
      blood collection. Infants were followed monthly until 24 weeks after birth.
