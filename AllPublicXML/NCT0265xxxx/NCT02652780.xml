    <measure>Change From Baseline in ETDRS Visual Acuity (Quantitative Score) at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Visual acuity was derived from the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart. The visual acuity logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution (LogMAR) score was derived from the number of letters participants could read on the ETDRS chart.
1 ETDRS line = 5 letters
1 ETDRS line = 0.1 LogMAR
A lower LogMAR score denotes better visual acuity and a negative change from baseline indicates an improvement in visual acuity.
Change = (Week 48 score - Baseline score).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Foveal Threshold Sensitivities Obtained With HVF Analyzer II at Week 48 and Week 96</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 48; Baseline and Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment of standardized automated visual fields was measured using the Humphrey Visual Field (HVF) Analyzer II. Automated visual fields included the assessment of foveal threshold sensitivities. Foveal threshold sensitivity is measured in decibels (dB), which ranges from 0 dB to 50 dB. A sensitivity threshold of 0 dB indicates not being able to see the most intense perimetric stimulus, while higher dB indicates better/normal foveal vision. A positive change from baseline indicates an improvement of symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Visual Field Mean Deviation in Decibels of Sensitivity Obtained With HVF Analyzer II at Week 48 and Week 96</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 48 and Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment of standardized automated visual fields was measured using the Humphrey Visual Field (HVF) Analyzer II. Automated visual fields included the assessment of the mean deviation (MD) in decibels (dB) of sensitivity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Contrast Sensitivity at Week 48 and Week 96</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 48; Baseline and Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment of contrast sensitivity was measured using the Pelli-Robson chart. The chart uses letters arranged in groups whose contrast varies from high to low. Participants read the letters, starting with the highest contrast, until they are unable to read 2 or 3 letters in a single group. Each eye is assigned a score based on the contrast of the last group in which 2 or 3 letters were correctly read, ranging from 0 to 2.2 &quot;log of contrast sensitivity&quot; (LogCS) units. A score of 2.0 LogCS, represents a normal sensitivity contrast, and indicates the eye was able to detect 2 of the 3 letters with a contrast of 1 percent (contrast sensitivity = 100 percent or log 2). Scores less than 2.0 signify poorer contrast sensitivity. Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity score of less than 1.5 is consistent with visual impairment and a score of less than 1.0 represents in visual disability. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement in symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Color Vision</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 48; Baseline and Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment of color vision was measured using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue Color Test. Each of the 4 trays consisted of 21 caps. Participants were asked to sort the randomly arranged caps following the hue order from the first to the last fixed caps. The total error score (TES) was derived by the frequency the caps were misplaced and the severity, or distance of the misplacement.
Errors were made whenever caps were misplaced from the correct order. Error scores were calculated according to the distance between any two caps. The error score for each individual cap was the sum of the difference between the number of that cap and the numbers of the cap adjacent to it, minus 2. TES was the total sum of the error scores of the entire set of caps.
The best possible score was 0 and there is no defined upper limit to the total error score range. A lower score indicates improved color discrimination ability. A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement in symptoms.</description>

          <description>All participants who were enrolled and received both study treatments, GS010 and Sham. All participants in the study received both GS010 and the sham procedure simultaneously. Participants were randomly assigned to receive GS010 in either the right or left eye. The same participants also received the sham procedure in the eye not assigned to GS010, at the same study visit.
GS010: Either the right or left eye received one single dose of GS010 (9E10 vg/eye) via an intravitreal (IVT) injection. The volume of the injected formula was 90 µL. The injection was performed in the vitreous humor under local anesthesia.
Sham procedure: Either the right or left eye (the eye not randomly assigned to GS010) received the sham procedure. One single sham IVT injection was performed by applying pressure to the eye at the location of a typical IVT injection procedure, using the blunt end of a syringe without a needle.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in ETDRS Visual Acuity (Quantitative Score) at Week 48</title>
        <description>Visual acuity was derived from the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart. The visual acuity logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution (LogMAR) score was derived from the number of letters participants could read on the ETDRS chart.
1 ETDRS line = 5 letters
1 ETDRS line = 0.1 LogMAR
A lower LogMAR score denotes better visual acuity and a negative change from baseline indicates an improvement in visual acuity.
Change = (Week 48 score - Baseline score).</description>

          <description>Visual acuity was derived from the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart. The visual acuity logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution (LogMAR) score was derived from the number of letters participants could read on the ETDRS chart.

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Foveal Threshold Sensitivities Obtained With HVF Analyzer II at Week 48 and Week 96</title>
        <description>The assessment of standardized automated visual fields was measured using the Humphrey Visual Field (HVF) Analyzer II. Automated visual fields included the assessment of foveal threshold sensitivities. Foveal threshold sensitivity is measured in decibels (dB), which ranges from 0 dB to 50 dB. A sensitivity threshold of 0 dB indicates not being able to see the most intense perimetric stimulus, while higher dB indicates better/normal foveal vision. A positive change from baseline indicates an improvement of symptoms.</description>

The eye assigned to GS010 received one single dose of GS010 (9E10 vg/eye) via an intravitreal (IVT) injection. The volume of the injected formula was 90 μL. The injection was performed in the vitreous humor under local anesthesia.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Contrast Sensitivity at Week 48 and Week 96</title>
        <description>The assessment of contrast sensitivity was measured using the Pelli-Robson chart. The chart uses letters arranged in groups whose contrast varies from high to low. Participants read the letters, starting with the highest contrast, until they are unable to read 2 or 3 letters in a single group. Each eye is assigned a score based on the contrast of the last group in which 2 or 3 letters were correctly read, ranging from 0 to 2.2 &quot;log of contrast sensitivity&quot; (LogCS) units. A score of 2.0 LogCS, represents a normal sensitivity contrast, and indicates the eye was able to detect 2 of the 3 letters with a contrast of 1 percent (contrast sensitivity = 100 percent or log 2). Scores less than 2.0 signify poorer contrast sensitivity. Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity score of less than 1.5 is consistent with visual impairment and a score of less than 1.0 represents in visual disability. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement in symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Color Vision</title>
        <description>The assessment of color vision was measured using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue Color Test. Each of the 4 trays consisted of 21 caps. Participants were asked to sort the randomly arranged caps following the hue order from the first to the last fixed caps. The total error score (TES) was derived by the frequency the caps were misplaced and the severity, or distance of the misplacement.
Errors were made whenever caps were misplaced from the correct order. Error scores were calculated according to the distance between any two caps. The error score for each individual cap was the sum of the difference between the number of that cap and the numbers of the cap adjacent to it, minus 2. TES was the total sum of the error scores of the entire set of caps.
The best possible score was 0 and there is no defined upper limit to the total error score range. A lower score indicates improved color discrimination ability. A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement in symptoms.</description>

The eye assigned to GS010 received one single dose of GS010 (9E10 vg/eye) via an intravitreal (IVT) injection. The volume of the injected formula was 90 μL. The injection was performed in the vitreous humor under local anesthesia.
The same participants also received the sham procedure in the right or left eye, which was not assigned to receive GS010, at the same study visit.</description>

            <description>All eyes that received the Sham. Each participant was randomly assigned GS010 in either the right or left eye, the eye not assigned GS010 received the sham procedure. The eye assigned to the Sham received one single sham intravitreal (IVT) injection, which was performed by applying pressure to the eye at the location of a typical IVT injection procedure, using the blunt end of a syringe without a needle.
The same participants also received GS010 in the right or left eye, which did not receive the sham procedure, at the same study visit.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Color Vision</title>
          <description>The assessment of color vision was measured using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue Color Test. Each of the 4 trays consisted of 21 caps. Participants were asked to sort the randomly arranged caps following the hue order from the first to the last fixed caps. The total error score (TES) was derived by the frequency the caps were misplaced and the severity, or distance of the misplacement.
Errors were made whenever caps were misplaced from the correct order. Error scores were calculated according to the distance between any two caps. The error score for each individual cap was the sum of the difference between the number of that cap and the numbers of the cap adjacent to it, minus 2. TES was the total sum of the error scores of the entire set of caps.
The best possible score was 0 and there is no defined upper limit to the total error score range. A lower score indicates improved color discrimination ability. A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement in symptoms.</description>
          <population>All participants and all eyes that received study treatments, with data at both Baseline and the applicable post-dose visit (Week 48 or Week 96). All participants received both GS010 and Sham simultaneously.</population>
