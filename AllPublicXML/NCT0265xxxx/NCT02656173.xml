    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Male participants with overactive bladder (OAB) under treatment with the α-blocker tamsulosin for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) were enrolled in Japan (53 sites) and Korea (5 sites).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Eligible participants received tamsulosin 0.2 mg and placebo orally once a day after breakfast for 4 weeks. Subsequently, participants who met the eligibility criteria at the end of this 4 week screening period were randomized 1:1 to mirabegron 50 mg group or placebo group with tamsulosin 0.2 mg orally once a day after breakfast for 12 weeks.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>IPSS subscale scores was calculated by following each formula. Storage subscale was derived as sum of scores for questions 2, 4, and 7 (range: 1-15). Voiding subscale-1 was derived as sum of scores for questions 3, 5, and 6 (range: 1-15). Voiding subscale-2 was derived as sum of voiding subscale-1 and the score for question 1 (range: 1-20). Individual scores and IPSS Quality of Life (QoL) score was the score of each item (range: 1-6) (Questions 1-7 and QoL item). A higher score is indicative of worse condition and a negative change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

A drug-related TEAE was a TEAE with at least a possible relationship to the study drug as assessed by the investigator. Serious TEAE was an AE considered serious.</description>
