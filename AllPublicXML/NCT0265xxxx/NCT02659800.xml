      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and select optimal
      biological doses (OBD) of the study drug NT-I7 in High Grade Glioma patients with severe
      lymphopenia, as well as to test the effect of NT-I7 on the CD4 counts of patients in
      comparison to control participants. This study has both a Phase I and Pilot component.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      Phase I: To determine the MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose) and select optimal biological doses
      (OBD) of NT-I7 in HGG patients with severe lymphopenia

      Pilot Study: To test the effect of NT-I7 on CD4 counts compared to control

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To evaluate the optimal biological dose of NT-I7

        2. To evaluate the effect of concurrent dexamethasone

        3. To evaluate the duration of effect on CD4 counts (up to 6 months)

        4. To evaluate the total lymphocyte counts over time and serial T cell lymphocyte subtypes
           and the effect on T cell repertoire (up to 6 months)

        5. To evaluate the serial cytokine levels (up to 6 months)

        6. To evaluate the impact of adjuvant temozolomide on NT-I7 effects on CD4 counts

        7. To evaluate anti-drug antibodies

        8. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of NT-I7 after intramuscular administration in
           this patient population

        9. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of NT-I7 in patients with high grade glioma

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups depending on their use of dexamethasone.

      GROUP A: Patients not on dexamethasone (or equivalent of an alternative corticosteroid), or
      on a dose lower than a physiologic dose (=&lt; 0.75 mg daily)

      GROUP B: patients who require dexamethasone (or equivalent of an alternative corticosteroid)
      =&gt; 4 mg daily

      Patients must have been on the group assignment dose of corticosteroids for at least 5 days
      prior to the dose of NT-I7. Corticosteroid dose changes prior to the start of treatment are
      allowed as long as they do not alter patient's group assignment.

      PHASE I TREATMENT PLAN

      All patients (both Groups A and B) will be given a single dose of NT-I7 by intramuscular
      injection starting at 60 Î¼g/kg, within one week after completing concurrent RT+TMZ and before
      starting adjuvant TMZ treatment, during the standard post-radiation break. Following this
      period, as per standard treatment, patients will go on to receive adjuvant temozolomide on
      Days 1-5 of 28-day cycles for 6 cycles. There should be about six weeks between the study
      injection and the start of adjuvant temozolomide; thus the start of adjuvant TMZ will be
      approximately two weeks later than the usual start, which is 4 weeks post-end of radiation.
      Patients who are delayed from receiving or are not able to receive adjuvant TMZ treatment may
      continue on study; adjuvant TMZ treatment is not a requirement for participation.

      PILOT STUDY TREATMENT PLAN

      GROUP A: participants will be given either a placebo (NT-I7 diluent) or one dose of NT-I7 at
      the Phase I Group A OBD by intramuscular injection within one week after completing
      concurrent RT+TMZ and before starting adjuvant TMZ treatment, during the standard
      post-radiation break.

      GROUP B: participants will be given one dose of NT-I7 at the Phase I Group B OBD by
      intramuscular injection within one week after completing concurrent RT+TMZ and before
      starting adjuvant TMZ treatment, during the standard post-radiation break.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months thereafter.

    <description>The optimal dose will be selected based on the highest absolute increase of CD4 counts compared to the control if toxicity profiles are similar between the two dose levels. Otherwise, safety will be the first consideration for dose selection. The results of the two concurrent dexamethasone groups will be summarized with standard descriptive statistics. The dose selection criteria will be similar to the non-dexamethasone groups with priority on safety rather than the highest absolute increase of CD4 counts.</description>
