  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called relugolix (TAK-385). Relugolix is being tested
      to treat people who have uterine fibroids.

      The study enrolled 65 patients. Participants received relugolix placebo in run in period for
      3 to 6 weeks. After run-in period, participants were randomly assigned to one of the two
      treatment groups in 1:1 ratio:

        1. Relugolix 40 mg

        2. Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient

      All participants were asked to take one tablet at the same time each day throughout the
      study.

      This multi-center trial was conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this study
      was 20 to 28 weeks, including run-in period of 3 to 6 weeks and a treatment period of 12
      weeks. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic, and 4 weeks after last dose of study
      drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

          <description>UFS-QOL was a 37-item self-reporting tool for evaluating QOL in participants with uterine fibroid. It includes eight symptom-related questions and 29 HRQL questions across six subscales (concern, activities, energy/mood, control, self-consciousness, sexual function). The total symptom severity score is ranging from 0 to 100. The higher scores indicate greater severity.</description>

          <title>UFS-QOL Score: Health Relate Quality of Life (HRQL) Total</title>
          <description>UFS-QOL was a 37-item self-reporting tool for evaluating QOL in participants with uterine fibroid. It includes eight symptom-related questions and 29 HRQL questions across six subscales (concern, activities, energy/mood, control, self-consciousness, sexual function). The total HRQL score is ranging from 0 to 100. The higher scores indicate better QOL.</description>

        <description>Percentage of day without pain symptoms (NRS = 0) was reported. Number of days without pain symptoms is determined by a zero score on the NRS. Pain symptoms were evaluated using the NRS score. NRS score is a self-reported instrument assessing pain from 0 to 10. Higher scores reflect greater level of pain. Percentage of days without pain symptoms (NRS=0) (%) = [(number of days without pain symptoms (NRS=0) during the last 28 days of the treatment)/(number of days with available data during the last 28 days of the treatment)]*100.</description>

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>
