  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomised, double-blind, pilot study, the investigators aim to assess whether a
      telerehabilitation strategy could improve outcomes among patients with recent heart surgery.
      Included participants will receive a comprehensive rehabilitation programme comprised of
      physical therapy, nutritional counselling, psychological assistance in addition to standard
      medical care. After 12 sessions of physical therapy, patients will be randomised to receive
      telerehabilitation with a portable EKG device and a smartphone application or usual care. The
      primary endpoint for this study is the exercise capacity of included participants, which will
      be assessed using an ergospirometer at 4 and 8 weeks after randomisation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As in other Latin-american countries, access to rehabilitation programmes is limited, even
      though their effectiveness has been proved among patients with heart surgery and endorsed in
      current practice guidelines. In this randomised trial, the investigators aim to assess
      whether an integrative technological platform might improve the exercise capacity of patients
      that have undergone heart surgery.

      Eligible patients include adult (&gt;18 years old) patients who have undergone any kind of heart
      surgery in the Hospital Gustavo Fricke between January and December 2016. Patients will be
      enrolled within 3 weeks of their cardiac surgery into the trial. Patients with any
      contraindication to physical exercise (see below), Parkinson's disease, severe dementia or
      psychiatric comorbidities that preclude the initiation of the programme will be excluded. All
      patients will receive physical training delivered by a group of physical therapists divided
      in twelve 90-minute sessions. The overall goal of these sessions will be to obtain a workload
      of 80% - 90% of maximum oxygen consumption (VO2) as established by ergospirometric
      assessments (Cardiovit CS-200). In addition to exercise, patients will also receive
      nutritional support, education, risk factor modification and psychological assessments using
      the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale that has been validated in Spanish-speaking
      countries.

      Randomisation will be performed by a statistician and study personnel will be kept unaware of
      the specific method used. Patients in the intervention arm will receive a telerehabilitation
      strategy comprised by a portable EKG device that will be aimed at establishing heart rate,
      stress responses and recovery times after physical activities. This sensor will be used to
      monitor compliance with a prescribed physical therapy programme. In addition, a second sensor
      will be deployed in the form of a smartphone application that will provide alerts for
      patients and healthcare providers whenever an adverse event is recorded. The application will
      also provide motivational messages for participants to optimize adherence to the exercise
      programme, as well as information regarding individual improvements in physical activities.

      All patients will undergo an ergospirometry at baseline, 4 weeks and 8 weeks after completion
      of the initial physical therapy sessions. Clinicians, outcome assessors and analysts well be
      kept unaware of treatment allocations. All analyses will be undertaken under the intention to
      treat principle. No prespecified subgroup analyses have been programmed.

Telerehabilitation Monitors: After completing a 12-session physical therapy programme and the aforementioned co-interventions, patients will receive a telerehabilitation strategy comprised by electrocardiographic monitoring and a smartphone application aimed at detecting adverse events during exercise activities. These devices will also inform patients and healthcare providers regarding the adequacy of their physical activities in terms of cardiovascular outcomes and the observed changes during treatment.</description>

Physical Therapy: Physical therapy will be provided in form of twelve 90-minute sessions. Exercises will be tailored to patient needs, but a common goal of reaching an oxygen consumption of 80-90% will be used for every participant.
Nutritional Counseling: Nutritional counseling will be provided in 60-minute group sessions for included participants. A nutritionist will provide education in terms of healthy eating and risk factor modification.
Depression Screening: Participants will be screened for depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale, which has been validated for Spanish-speaking countries. If depression is confirmed, pharmacologic treatment and/or psychotherapy will be prescribed at the discretion of the attending physician.</description>

Telerehabilitation Monitors: After completing a 12-session physical therapy programme and the aforementioned co-interventions, patients will receive a telerehabilitation strategy comprised by electrocardiographic monitoring and a smartphone application aimed at detecting adverse events during exercise activities. These devices will also inform patients and healthcare providers regarding the adequacy of their physical activities in terms of cardiovascular outcomes and the observed changes during treatment.</description>
