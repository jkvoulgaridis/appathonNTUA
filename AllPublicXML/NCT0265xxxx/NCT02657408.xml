The adjusted geometric means (gMeans) are obtained by exponentiating the Least Square (LS) means obtained by fitting an Analysis of variance (ANOVA) model on the natural log transformed endpoint values, adjusted for treatment effect. Standard errors are derived using the delta method.</description>

        <description>Differential cell count of macrophage+monocyte in BAL fluid 24 h after segmental LPS challenge.
The adjusted geometric means (gMeans) are obtained by exponentiating the LS means obtained by fitting an ANOVA model on the natural log transformed endpoint values, adjusted for treatment effect. Standard errors are derived using the delta method.
Cytospin microscopy method cannot clearly differentiate between macrophages and monocytes, the total and differential cell count of macrophages and monocytes are presented together.</description>
