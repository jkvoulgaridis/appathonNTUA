    <textblock>
      This is an open label, proof of concept (PoC) study of Cenicriviroc (CVC) in adult
      participants with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC). The main objective of this PoC study
      is to assess changes in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) both individually and as a group, over 24
      weeks of treatment with CVC.

    <measure>Percentage Change From Baseline Through Week 24 in Serum Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>ALP was used as a primary surrogate marker for measuring Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis disease. The percent change from Baseline was defined as 100*(value at each visit - Baseline value)/Baseline value. The Baseline value was defined as the last non-missing value on or before the Baseline visit (Day 1). A negative percentage change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Normalized ALP at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>ALP was used as a primary surrogate marker for measuring Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis disease. Normalization was defined as ALP values outside of the central laboratory reference range at baseline, but within the central laboratory reference range at Week 24.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Serum ALP of Less Than 1.5 Times Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) in Serum ALP at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>ALP was used as a primary surrogate marker for measuring Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis disease. The upper limit of normal ALP was defined according to the central laboratory reference ranges.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Treatment-emergent Adverse Event (TEAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, regardless of whether related to the medicinal (investigational) product. A TEAE was defined as an AE with an onset that occurred after receiving treatment.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with chronic cholestatic liver disease for at least 6 months

          -  Clinical diagnosis of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) as evident by chronic
             cholestasis of more than six months duration with either a consistent magnetic
             resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)/endoscopic retrograde
             cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) showing sclerosing cholangitis, or a liver biopsy
             taken at any time consistent with PSC in the absence of a documented alternative
             etiology for sclerosing cholangitis. If diagnosis of PSC was made by histology alone,
             it must require the presence of fibro-obliterative lesions (i.e., onion skin lesions)

          -  Participants with or without Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) are allowed. If
             participant has IBD, documented evidence of IBD either by prior endoscopy or in
             previous medical records, for ≥ 6 months. In addition, participants will be required
             to enter the study with a Partial Mayo Risk score of 0-3, inclusively

          -  In participants receiving treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), therapy must be
             stable for at least 3 months, and at a dose not greater than 20 mg/kg/day

          -  Serum ALP greater than 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form (ICF)

          -  Participants receiving allowed concomitant medications need to be on stable therapy
             for 28 days prior to the Baseline Visit with the exception of UDCA in which
             participants need to be on stable therapy for ≥ 3 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of documented secondary sclerosing cholangitis (such as ischemic cholangitis,
             recurrent pancreatitis, intraductal stone disease, severe bacterial cholangitis,
             surgical or blunt abdominal trauma, recurrent pyogenic cholangitis,
             choledocholithiasis, toxic sclerosing cholangitis due to chemical agents, or any other
             cause of secondary sclerosing cholangitis) on prior clinical investigations

          -  Small duct PSC

             of wine [125 mL])

          -  Prior or planned liver transplantation

          -  Presence of alternative causes of chronic liver disease, including alcoholic liver
             disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, autoimmune
             hepatitis

          -  History of cirrhosis and/or hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A, B and C) and/or
             hepatic decompensation including ascites, encephalopathy or variceal bleeding.
             Participants who show evidence of significant worsening of hepatic function will be
             excluded

          -  Participants with fibrosis evidence of cirrhosis, as determined by local transient
             elastography (TE, e.g., Fibroscan) values of ≥ 13.0 kPa, taken within the last 6
             months. If TE has not been conducted within the 6 months prior to screening, then one

          -  Moderate to Severe active IBD or flare in colitis activity within the last 90 days

             stable for 3 months with 5-amino salicylic acid drugs or Azathioprine (allowed dose of
             azathioprine is 50-200 mg/day)

          -  Use of oral prednisolone &gt; 10 mg/day, biologics and/or hospitalization for colitis
             within 90 days are disallowed

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT); above the allowed

               -  Direct Bilirubin &gt; 0.8 mg/dL
