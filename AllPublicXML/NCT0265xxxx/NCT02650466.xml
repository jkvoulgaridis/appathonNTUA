      The purpose of this study is to determine if the Nanopulse System can be used to clear common
      wart lesions on the skin. The Nanopulse System uses a series of low energy, high voltage
      pulses, each one several billionths of a second in duration, to effectively kill the target
      tissue contained within the applicator tip electrodes with minimal damage to surrounding
      tissue. Efficacy and patient outcomes are expected to equal or surpass current treatment
      modalities in terms of increased ease of use, faster patient healing and minimal scarring
      with fewer complications resulting from treatment.

      The device emits significantly less energy than existing electro-surgery or electro-cautery
      equipment and is believed to be similar to laser therapy treatment of warts. Trained
      clinicians can usually diagnose warts based by their appearance and location . Non-genital
      warts are subcategorized into common, periungual, flat, filiform, and plantar types. Common
      warts are benign, often skin-colored, or brown-grey, rough, bumpy growths on the hands and
      feet (caused by Human Papilloma Virus type 2) . Common warts in individuals without any
      immune deficiencies are low risk and are the focus of this study.Based upon the preclinical
      profile of the Nanopulse device, particularly its safety profile and its effect on
      transformed cells, it is hypothesized that application of pulses from the Nanopulse System ,
      will result in complete clinical clearance of Common Wart lesions with minimal scarring.

      Study Objective: The objective of this study is to indicate whether the Nanopulse System is
      efficacious for use in clearing common warts.

      The primary objective of this study is to gather lesion clearance data on common warts after
      application of pulses from the Nanopulse System and determine the optimal number of
      treatments necessary. Clearance will be measured by clinical observation.

      Other objectives of the study include gathering efficacy data on the use of the Nanopulse
      System for treating common warts in terms of:

      1.) Safety in a clinical setting in terms of minimal adverse events over the course of the
      trial; 2.) Cosmetic results during the healing process and cosmetic outcome; 3.)Effects of 1,
      2, 3 or 4 treatments in terms of clearance and cosmetic outcome for each treated wart;
      4.)Subject impressions immediately following application of pulses; 5.)Subject satisfaction
      with the treatment and cosmetic outcome during and following the healing process; 6) Device
      performance and clinical feedback under actual clinical conditions and to gather information
      on design features that may be modified to optimize the device.

    <description>The study will be a single center, open label, non-randomized clinical trial that will provide efficacy data for the treatment of common warts by the Nanopulse system in terms of efficacy and cosmetic outcome with 1 - 4 application (treatment) sessions. All subjects will receive a minimum number of applications per discrete skin wart lesion. Up to 4 warts per subject will be treated with the Nanopulse device. The wart will be debulked to the point of pinpoint bleeding prior to the initial application. The subject will return after 1 week for an evaluation visit and at 4 weeks for a second treatment and 2 additional monthly treatments if warranted. If the subject is declared clinically clear at any of the application visits, they will be placed into follow up. The minimum number of treatments per wart is one and the maximum is 4. They will return at the 12 week point post last visit for final assessment and evaluation.</description>

    <intervention_type>Device</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Nanopulse System</intervention_name>
    <description>The Nanopulse System consists of an electrical pulse generator, a handpiece, and a detachable applicator tip at the end of the handpiece that interfaces with the treatment area on the skin. The detachable applicator tip delivers the pulses to the skin through five 3 mm long needle electrodes (27 gauge). The applied electric field, is limited to the space enclosed by the 4 outer electrodes in the applicator tip. An inert, water based gel is applied to the skin and the applicator tip before making contact between subject and applicator tip to ensure that there are no air gaps present between the electrodes through which electrical arcing could occur while pulses are being delivered to the subject. The Applicator Tips are designed for single patient use, and are sterilized prior to first use and between treatment sessions using a standard steam autoclave.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Only Common Warts will be included as study lesions.

          -  Only discrete common warts in a single 5cm x 5cm anatomical area can be included as
             study lesions. Up to 4 discrete common warts that meet this criteria can be treated
             per subject. The 5cm x 5cm area must not have more than 2 warts present at the time of
             screening and warts outside each area must be at least 2cm away from warts included as
             study lesions. Please Note: A single digit (e.g. finger) can represent a 5cm x 5cm
             area, and a lesion within the area can be included as a study lesion UNLESS it is on
             the inside surface of a digit where there are wart lesions present on the surface of
             an adjacent digit that would be within 1 cm of touching the potential study lesion

          -  Subjects not meeting all inclusion criteria should be excluded.

          -  Subjects who have lesions within the 5cm x 5cm anatomical area under study which are
             painful or have been noticeably changing just prior to the time of screening.

          -  Periungual warts are excluded from the study as study lesions. Subject is to be
             informed that these warts will not be treated during the duration of the study.

          -  Lesions on the face are excluded from the study as study lesions.

          -  Lesions which are diagnosed as flat warts, filiform warts, plantar warts, and genital
             warts are excluded from the study as study lesions. Subject is to be informed that
             these warts will not be treated during the duration of the study.

          -  Subjects who are using or intend to use any other warts therapy concomitantly during
             the study period or within 4 weeks of their screening visit.

          -  Subjects who are not capable of undergoing surgical standard of care treatment for
             common warts due to mental or physical limitations.

          -  Subjects in whom a minor surgical procedure is contraindicated (e.g. under advice of
             their own caring clinician).
