      This phase I/IIa trial studies the side effects and best dose of gene-modified T cells when
      given with or without decitabine, and to see how well they work in treating patients with
      malignancies expressing cancer-testis antigens 1 (NY-ESO-1) gene that have spread to other
      places in the body (advanced). A T cell is a type of immune cell that can recognize and kill
      abnormal cells of the body. Placing a modified gene for NY-ESO-1 into the patients' T cells
      in the laboratory and then giving them back to the patient may help the body build an immune
      response to kill tumor cells that express NY-ESO-1. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      decitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet
      known whether giving gene-modified T cells with or without decitabine works better in
      treating patients with malignancies expressing NY-ESO-1.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the safety and feasibility of adoptive transfer of TGFbDNRII-transduced
      autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (autologous NY-ESO-1 TCR/dnTGFbetaRII transgenic T
      cells).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. NY-ESO-1 TCR/ dnTGFbetaRII transgenic T cell persistence by analyzing serial peripheral
      blood samples for the presence of T cells with the NY-ESO-1 TCR by tetramer analysis.

      II. To study T cell differentiation that correlates with higher anti-tumor responses.

      III. To test the hypothesis that NY-ESO-1 TCR/dnTGFbetaRII will constitute in cells more
      efficient in inducing tumor regression.

      IV. Determine objective tumor responses by immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors (irRECIST) 1.1.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the role of microbiota on the therapeutic efficacy of the proposed therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of NY-ESO-1 TCR/TGFbDNRII-transduced TILs
      followed by a phase IIa study. Participants are assigned 1 to 2 cohorts.

      COHORT I: Patients undergo leukapheresis on day -6, and receive cyclophosphamide
      intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days -5 and -4. Patients then receive TGFbDNRII-transduced
      autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes IV over 15 minutes on day 0. Eligible patients may
      receive a second TGFbDNRII-transduced autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes infusion at
      progression after the initial response/disease control.

      COHORT II: Patients undergo leukapheresis on day -6 and receive decitabine IV over 1 hour on
      days -6 to -4 and cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -3 and -2. Patients then receive
      TGFbDNRII-transduced autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes IV over 15 minutes on day 0.
      Eligible patients may receive a second TGFbDNRII-transduced autologous tumor infiltrating
      lymphocytes infusion at progression after the initial response/disease control.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at weeks 1-4, 6, 8, and 12, at
      6 and 9 months, every 6 months for 5 years, and then yearly for 10 years.
