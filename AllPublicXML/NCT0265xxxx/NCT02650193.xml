  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of how one or more injections of HSP-130 under the skin effect the white
      blood cell counts and drug levels in women with breast cancer that has not spread to distant
      sites in the body (non-metastatic). This will be studied in women before breast surgery or
      while receiving chemotherapy. Safety will also be studied.

      Additionally, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects and safety of single and
      multiple doses of HSP-130 in subjects with non-metastatic breast cancer. This study will
      determine the dose to move forward for future clinical trials.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, sequential enrollment study characterizing the pharmacodynamic (PD),
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety of HSP-130 in subjects with non-metastatic breast cancer who
      have not previously received chemotherapy at any point prior to enrollment in this study
      (ZIN-130-1504).

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects and safety of single and multiple doses
      of HSP-130 in subjects with non-metastatic breast cancer. This study will determine the dose
      to move forward for future clinical trials.

      There are two aspects of the study. In the initial part of the study, 6 subjects will be
      sequentially enrolled to receive HSP-130 treatment (3 mg , or 6 mg by subcutaneous injection)
      during the period between biopsy and definitive surgery. This will determine whether 3 mg and
      6 mg have similar or different effects on the PD variables (absolute neutrophil counts and
      CD34+ cell counts). This part of the study is referred to as Cycle 0 since study subjects
      will receive no chemotherapy while receiving HSP-130 until the effect of HSP-130 on the PD
      variables is known. A total of 12 subjects may be enrolled in Cycle 0.

      The objective of Cycle 1-4 is to determine the dose to be taken forward to Phase 3 clinical
      trials. Cycles 1-4 subjects will receive HSP-130 after their definitive breast surgery at the
      time they receive TAC chemotherapy (docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide). Subjects
      will receive up to 4 cycles of every 3 week TAC chemotherapy with HSP-130 given on Day 2 of
      the chemotherapy regimen.

        -  If the 3 mg dose is found to be inferior (potentially subtherapeutic) to the 6 mg dose
           in Cycle 0, only the 6 mg dose will be studied in Cycles 1-4 (n=12), when subjects
           receive concomitant chemotherapy.

        -  If the 3 mg dose is found to be comparable to the PD results obtained in Cycle 0 with 6
           mg, the 3 mg dose (n=12) will also be studied in women receiving TAC chemotherapy.

      Data from the HSP-130 6 mg regimen (plus 3 mg, as appropriate) will be analysed, discussed
      with the FDA and determination if a dose greater than 6 mg is appropriate to study (e.g., 12
      mg). If all three doses are studied, a total enrollment of up to 36 subjects is projected for
      Cycles 1-4.

Regimen A: HSP 130, 3 mg, single SC injection in the deltoid region (n = 6) Regimen B: HSP 130, 6 mg, single SC injection in the deltoid region (n = 6)
Cycles 1-4:
Regimen B (n = 12): HSP 130, 6 mg, single SC injection in the deltoid region, at least 24 hours after administration of chemotherapy in Cycle 1, Cycle 2, Cycle 3, and Cycle 4.
Potential Regimen A (n = 12): 3 mg with background chemotherapy: Inclusion of this cohort will be based on assessment of comparability between Regimens A and B in Cycle 0 for ANC and CD34+ as defined above. If performed, this regimen will be HSP 130, 3 mg, single SC injection in the deltoid region, at least 24 hours after administration of chemotherapy in Cycle 1, Cycle 2, Cycle 3, and Cycle 4, as appropriate.
Conditional Regimen C (12 mg):This cohort will not be initiated until data from cycle 0 for 3 mg and 6 mg and Cycles 1-4 for 6 mg has been reviewed and analyzed.</description>
