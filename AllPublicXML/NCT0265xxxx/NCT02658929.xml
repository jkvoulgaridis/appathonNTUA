      Study CRB-401 is a 2-part, non-randomized, open label, multi-site Phase 1 study of bb2121 in
      adults with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part, non-randomized, open label, multi-site Phase 1 study. the study design
      consists of 2 parts: Part A (Dose Escalation), in which the RP2D is determined, and Part B
      (Expansion Cohorts), in which subjects are treated with the determined RP2D.

      Following consent, enrolled subjects will undergo a leukapheresis procedure to collect
      autologous mononuclear cells for manufacture of investigational drug product (bb2121).
      Following manufacture of the drug product, subjects will receive lymphodepleting therapy with
      fludarabine and cyclophosphamide prior to bb2121 infusion. All subjects who have received
      bb2121 infusion will be followed for up to 60 months on CRB-401.

      All subjects who complete the study, as well as those who withdraw from the study after
      receiving bb2121 for reasons other than death or meeting the early termination criteria, will
      be asked to continue to undergo long-term follow-up in a companion study for up to 15 years
      after their last bb2121 infusion, with a focus on long-term safety and efficacy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years of age at the time of signing informed consent

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1

          -  Subjects must have measurable disease including at least one of the criteria below:

        Serum M-protein greater or equal to 0.5 g/dL Urine M-protein greater or equal to 200 mg/24
        h Serum free light chain (FLC) assay: involved FLC level greater or equal to 10 mg/dL (100
        mg/L) provided serum FLC ratio is abnormal -Women of child-bearing potential (WCBP) must
        have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to treatment and refrain from tissue donation
        including egg donation or any other tissue/blood/organ donations, for at least 1 year
        following bb2121 infusion. All sexually active WCBP and all sexually active male subjects
        must agree to use effective methods of birth control throughout the study. All sexually
        active males subjects must refrain from tissue donation including egg donation or any other
        tissue/blood/organ donations, for at least 1 year following bb2121 infusion.

        Part A:

        Diagnosis of MM with relapsed or refractory disease and have had at least 3 different prior
        lines of therapy including proteasome inhibitor (e.g., bortezomib or carfilzomib) and
        immunomodulatory therapy (IMiD; e.g., lenalidomide or pomalidomide), or have &quot;double
        refractory&quot; disease to a proteasome inhibitor and IMiD, defined as progression on or within
        60 days of treatment with these agents

        - Part B: Diagnosis of MM with relapsed or refractory disease with previous exposure to PI
        (e.g., bortezomib or carfilzomib), IMiDs (e.g., lenalidomide or pomalidomide), and
