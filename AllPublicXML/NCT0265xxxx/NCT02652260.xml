  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate a switch from fixed dose combination (FDC) treatment with
      ATRIPLA^TM for 12 weeks prior to screening to FDC treatment with MK-1439A in
      virologically-suppressed, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected participants.
      The primary hypothesis is that switching from ATRIPLA^TM to MK-1439A results in a lower
      proportion of participants with at least one CNS toxicity of at least Grade 2 intensity at
      Week 12 than continuation of ATRIPLA^TM treatment.

    <description>A questionnaire was used to solicit for CNS toxicity based on the following 10 events: dizziness; depression/low mood; insomnia/sleeplessness; anxiety/nervousness; confusion; impaired concentration/attention; headache; somnolence/daytime sleepiness; aggressive mood/behavior; and abnormal dreams. Participants were asked to rate the intensity for each of the 10 events as none (Grade 0), mild (Grade 1), moderate (Grade 2), or severe (Grade 3). Mild = symptom is noticeable but does not interfere with normal activities; moderate = symptom has some impact on normal activities; severe = symptom prevents conduct of normal activities. Percentage of participants with at least one CNS toxicity of Grade 2 or higher were recorded, based on the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach.</description>

Mild = symptom is noticeable but does not interfere with normal activities; moderate = symptom has some impact on normal activities; severe = symptom prevents conduct of normal activities. The CNS toxicity score was calculated by summing across all 10 CNS toxicities and converting the sum to a percentage of the maximum possible sum of intensities (10 x 3 = 30). A positive change from baseline score indicates worsening symptoms. A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement in symptoms.</description>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol - specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol - specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE.</description>

          <title>CNS Toxicity Percentage Of Maximum Score</title>
          <description>Participants were asked to rate the intensity for each of the 10 events as none (Grade 0), mild (Grade 1), moderate (Grade 2), or severe (Grade 3). Mild = symptom is noticeable but does not interfere with normal activities; moderate = symptom has some impact on normal activities; severe = symptom prevents conduct of normal activities. The CNS toxicity score was calculated by summing across all 10 CNS toxicities and converting the sum to a percentage of the maximum possible sum of intensities (10 x 3 = 30). A higher CNS score indicates worsening symptoms.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With at Least One Central Nervous System (CNS) Toxicity of at Least Grade 2 Intensity at Week 12</title>
        <description>A questionnaire was used to solicit for CNS toxicity based on the following 10 events: dizziness; depression/low mood; insomnia/sleeplessness; anxiety/nervousness; confusion; impaired concentration/attention; headache; somnolence/daytime sleepiness; aggressive mood/behavior; and abnormal dreams. Participants were asked to rate the intensity for each of the 10 events as none (Grade 0), mild (Grade 1), moderate (Grade 2), or severe (Grade 3). Mild = symptom is noticeable but does not interfere with normal activities; moderate = symptom has some impact on normal activities; severe = symptom prevents conduct of normal activities. Percentage of participants with at least one CNS toxicity of Grade 2 or higher were recorded, based on the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in CNS Toxicity Score at Week 4</title>
        <description>A questionnaire was used to solicit for CNS toxicity based on the following 10 events: dizziness; depression/low mood; insomnia/sleeplessness; anxiety/nervousness; confusion; impaired concentration/attention; headache; somnolence/daytime sleepiness; aggressive mood/behavior; and abnormal dreams. Participants were asked to rate the intensity for each of the 10 events as none (Grade 0), mild (Grade 1), moderate (Grade 2), or severe (Grade 3). Mild = symptom is noticeable but does not interfere with normal activities; moderate = symptom has some impact on normal activities; severe = symptom prevents conduct of normal activities. The CNS toxicity score was calculated by summing across all 10 CNS toxicities and converting the sum to a percentage of the maximum possible sum of intensities (10 x 3 = 30). A positive change from baseline score indicates worsening symptoms. A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement in symptoms.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in CNS Toxicity Score at Week 4</title>
          <description>A questionnaire was used to solicit for CNS toxicity based on the following 10 events: dizziness; depression/low mood; insomnia/sleeplessness; anxiety/nervousness; confusion; impaired concentration/attention; headache; somnolence/daytime sleepiness; aggressive mood/behavior; and abnormal dreams. Participants were asked to rate the intensity for each of the 10 events as none (Grade 0), mild (Grade 1), moderate (Grade 2), or severe (Grade 3). Mild = symptom is noticeable but does not interfere with normal activities; moderate = symptom has some impact on normal activities; severe = symptom prevents conduct of normal activities. The CNS toxicity score was calculated by summing across all 10 CNS toxicities and converting the sum to a percentage of the maximum possible sum of intensities (10 x 3 = 30). A positive change from baseline score indicates worsening symptoms. A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement in symptoms.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With One or More Adverse Events (AEs) Through Study Week 12</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol - specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol - specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Discontinued Treatment Due to an AE Through Study Week 12</title>
        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol - specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol - specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE.</description>
